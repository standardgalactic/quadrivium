About the Authors
David Kay is a writer, an engineer, an artist, and a naturalist who combines
professions with the same effectiveness as his favorite business establish-
ment, Acton Muffler, Brake, and Ice Cream (now defunct). Dave has written
more than a dozen computer books, by himself or with friends. His other
titles include various editions of Microsoft Works For Windows For Dummies,
WordPerfect For Windows For Dummies, Graphics File Formats, and The
Internet: Complete Reference.
In his other life, as the Poo-bah of Brightleaf, Dave is a conservation biologist.
He and his wife, Katy, and golden retriever, Alex, live in the wilds of
Massachusetts. In his spare time, Dave studies animal and human tracking
and munches edible wild plants. He also has been known to make strange
blobs from molten glass, sing Gilbert and Sullivan choruses in public, and
hike in whatever mountains he can get to. He longs to return to New Zealand
and track kiwis and hedgehogs in Wanaka. He finds writing about himself in
the third person like this quite peculiar and will stop now.
William “The Ferrett” Steinmetz is a freelance Webmaster and editor who
helms StarCityGames.com, one of the premier strategy sites for the col-
lectible card game Magic: The Gathering. He wrote most of Internet: 
The Complete Reference and has written computer book reviews for
Amazon.com and TechSoc.com. The Ferrett lives in Cleveland and is geeky.

Introduction
C
ongratulations! Brilliant person that you are, you use Paint Shop Pro!
Thousands of other brilliant people also use Paint Shop Pro, and for one
intelligent reason: It does darned near anything you could want it to do, from
fixing photographs to animating Web graphics, and — unlike certain more
famous programs — it doesn’t set you back a week’s salary.
Guided by that same intelligence, you’re probably asking yourself “Is a book
available that gives me what I want, quickly, without dragging me through a
tutorial? One with an attractive yellow-and-black cover so that it doesn’t get
lost in the clutter on my desk? Preferably cheap?”
Welcome to Paint Shop Pro 9 For Dummies, the attractive, inexpensive,
yellow-and-black book that lets you get great graphics out of Paint Shop Pro
without making you feel like you’re going back to school in an attractive,
yellow-and-black school bus.
What Can You Do with This Book?
Books are useful, elevating things. Many people use them to elevate their PC
monitors, for example. With that fate in mind, this book has been created to
serve an even higher purpose: to enable you to do the kind of graphics stuff
you really want to do. Here’s a smattering of what you can do with the help of
this book:
 Download photos from a digital camera.
 Fix up fuzzy, poorly exposed, or icky-colored photos.
 Print album pages or other collections of photos.
 Paint, draw, or letter-in all kinds of colors, patterns, and textures.
 Paint like you’re using oil paints and canvas.
 Draw using lines and shapes that you can go back and change later.
 Apply cool special effects to photos and drawings.
 Change colors of objects.
 Combine photos with other images.
 Alter the content of photos and other images.
 Remove unwanted relatives from family photos.

 Add wanted relatives to Wanted posters.
 Retouch unsightly relatives on Wanted posters.
 Create transparent and other Web page graphics.
Is This the Book for You?
Is this the Paint Shop Pro book for you? It depends. If, like us, you tend to

In addition, this book is for you if
 You find most computer books boring or useless
 You need solutions rather than lessons
 You find parts of Paint Shop Pro 9 confusing
 You haven’t ever done much with graphics programs
 You have used other Windows programs
 You need Paint Shop Pro for business or home use

How Is This Book Organized?
Computer software manuals document features because that’s the easiest
way to write one: “The File menu presents the following choices. . . .” If fea-
tures on the File menu exactly matched what you had in mind, that would be
great — but how are you to know to use the Clone Brush tool when what
you’re really looking for is the “Fix Uncle Dave’s hair transplant scars” tool?
Some computer books are organized into lessons and teach you how features
work. They give you examples of basic tasks and then more complicated
ones. Along the way — hopefully, before too long — you find an example that
resembles what you had in mind.
This book is organized by different kinds of tasks, like working with photos 
or painting pictures or adding text. Wherever possible, this book tells you
exactly what to do in numbered steps. Wherever that’s not possible, it gives
you explanations of how things work in nontechnical language.
You don’t have to read the book in any order. Just skip to the section or chap-
ter you need. Go right to the index, if you like — or the Rich Tennant cartoons!
In detail, this book is organized as described in this section.

Paint Shop Pro 9 For Dummies 

Part I: The Basics
This part puts you in the picture and puts your picture in Paint Shop Pro.
Chapter 1 puts you in the picture, by explaining how to efficiently find, open,
and manage all your graphics files, deal with the peculiarities of different
graphics file types, and even convert file types en masse. Chapter 2 shows you
how to get things oriented and sized they way you want. Chapter 3 shows 
you all the Paint Shop Pro tricks for selecting exactly the area of interest you
want to work on, copy, move, or otherwise enhance. Chapter 4 gives you basic
editing tricks: how to copy, move, bend, and resize portions of your image.
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs
When you have an image that needs some sprucing up, Part II is the place to
turn. Chapter 5 shows you how to get the image you want into Paint Shop Pro
in the first place, whether it’s a photograph, a print, or on your PC screen.
Chapter 6 shows you how to use the Paint Shop Pro hand tools to brush away
wrinkles from portraits, fix scratches, and remove red-eye. Chapter 7 gives
you nearly instant ways to correct overall photo-exposure problems, such as
bad exposure, poor color, or dim grayish images. Chapter 8 gets into serious
adjustment of image quality and content. This part is your Extreme Makeover
part (not to be confused with the part Dave uses for his comb-over).
Part III: Painting Pictures
Part III is for anyone who plans to paint, draw, or otherwise doodle in Paint
Shop Pro. Chapter 9 gets you painting, spraying, erasing, and otherwise doing
all those basic things that everyday folks have been trying to do with graph-
ics software for years. Chapter 10 is for those who long for some serious 
support for the digital artist, by giving you ways to get precisely the color,
texture, or pattern you need. Chapter 10 also introduces the new Paint Shop
Pro Art Media tools, the closest thing to paint and canvas this side of the digi-
tal divide. Chapter 11 shows you how to divide images into layers or use
layers to combine images. Layers are a powerful tool that make later editing
much easier and produce stunning image overlays. Chapter 12 lets you add
layers of easily edited text and shapes to your image, by using the Paint Shop
Pro vector graphics tools. Chapter 13 shows you how to add artsy effects to
your work.
Part IV: Taking It to the Street
All this fooling around in Paint Shop Pro is great, but in the end you probably
want your image to appear somewhere else: on a piece of paper, on the Web,
3
Introduction

or as part of an animation. Chapter 14 shows you how to best fit your image
on paper. It also tells you how to print multi-image pages for photo albums,
collages, or portfolios. Chapter 15 tells you how to get exactly the image file
you want for the Web and gives you tips for getting the fastest-downloading
images with the least sacrifice in quality.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Problems often come in threes, so this book tackles them by the tens, just 
to be sure. Part V has fixes for the ten most-wanted issues that people run
into when they try to use Paint Shop Pro. Chapter 16 untangles the ten most
common confusions and perplexing problems of Paint Shop Pro, Chapter 17
gives you ten quick fixes for photography problems, and Chapter 18 is an
existential conundrum. It tells you about ten topics too advanced to be in
this book.

Part I
The Basics

In this part . . .
W
hen it comes to computer software, nothing is
basic. So, it is with some trepidation that we call
Part I “The Basics,” but, heck — we had to call it some-
thing. Here’s where to turn when you need more efficient
ways (or, for that matter, any way) of finding, opening, and
managing image files, viewing images, and making them
bigger, smaller, or just plain right side up.
Also fundamental to making any changes to your image is
the ability to select certain parts of an image, move it,
copy it, and resize or reshape it.

and Saving Image Files
In This Chapter
 Opening and browsing image files
 Zooming in and out
 Reading image information
 Saving image files
 Saving your workspace
 Working with different image types
 Using vector file types
 Converting or renaming batches of files
 Responding to file type messages and Auto Actions
 Getting image files from the Web
M
ost of the time, images exist as files. Those files may be on a disk, on 
a digital camera connected to your computer, or on a storage device
that looks and acts just like a disk in Windows. This chapter makes you Lord
of the Files. It tells you how to open image files, organize those files, and save
images as various kinds of files. It also helps you view them in whatever size
is convenient for you.
(If you want to open an image that does not appear to be stored as a file, see
Chapter 5. For example, you may want a picture that appears on your com-
puter screen in a document or a snapshot that needs to be downloaded from
your digital camera.)
Images are easy to deal with in small quantities. In large quantities, however,
they’re challenging to manage. (They’re sort of like kids, in that regard.) This
chapter tells you about the clever Paint Shop Pro features for keeping an eye
on all your graphical progeny, including browsing, previewing, and organizing
files in different orders and in different folders.

Image files come in an amazing variety of file types because many software
geeks over the years have each decided that they know a much better way of
storing an image as a file (a file type). Image files of different types have dif-
ferent multiletter extensions at the end, like .jpg, .png, or .tif. People refer to
them by those extensions, saying “jay-peg” or “jay pee gee” for .jpg or “ping
file” for .png. These file types sometimes behave differently in Paint Shop Pro,
so see the section “Using native and foreign file types,” later in this chapter, if
someone gives you a file that behaves oddly. Fortunately, although you need
to be aware that images come in a variety of file types, most of the time you
don’t have to give a hoot. Paint Shop Pro can crack open most popular types
of image file.
Three Ways to Open Image Files
Paint Shop Pro gives you three ways to open a file:
 Browsing (“I’ll know it when I see it”): Choose File➪Browse or press
Ctrl+B. The browser window opens, as shown in the following section, 
in Figure 1-1. You open folders in the left panel and double-click tiny pic-
tures in the right panel to open them.
 Opening (“I know its name and where it lives”): Choose File➪Open; or,
click the Open button on the toolbar or press Ctrl+O. The Open dialog
box appears, as shown a couple of sections from here, in Figure 1-2.
 Double-clicking (“There it is — open it”): If you see a file listed and it
displays a Paint Shop Pro icon (a tiny artist’s palette), double-click that
puppy and Paint Shop Pro should start up and display the image.
That’s all you need to know — well, at least most of the time, that’s all. The
following sections give you some additional tricks and tips for opening files in
those three ways.
If you can see the image on your screen, but aren’t sure where the image file
is, see the section in Chapter 5 about capturing images from your PC screen.
Images that appear in a document (a Web page, a Microsoft Word document,
or an Adobe Acrobat document, for example) may not be stored as files on
your computer. (Or, if they are, they may be very hard to find.) You may need
to capture the image off your screen.
For some files, Paint Shop Pro has to translate the image file into a form it can
use. Translation may especially be necessary for vector image files, such as
DXF and WPG. To translate, Paint Shop Pro needs additional information from
you: specifically, how many pixels wide and high you want the image to be.
See the section “Using Vector File Types (Drawing Files),” later in this chap-
ter, for more information.

Part I: The Basics 

Opening, Managing, and Sorting 
Files with the Browser
We like the Paint Shop Pro browser best for opening files because it also lets
you manage them visually. Do one of the following to open the browser:
 Press Ctrl+B.
 Click the Browse icon, as shown in the margin. (It’s on the Standard tool-
bar, which runs along the top of the Paint Shop Pro window.)
 Choose File➪Browse.
 If the Open dialog box is open already, click the Browse button.
Figure 1-1 shows you the Browse window. To close the window when you’re
done, choose File➪Close or press Ctrl+F4.
The left side of the Browse window looks and works like Windows Explorer.
The right side displays, and helps you manage, image files.
Figure 1-1:

visually.
9
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

The following list shows you the details for using the folders on the left side
(if the Find tab shown in Figure 1-1 isn’t displayed, click that tab):
 To see what images a folder holds, click the folder. Thumbnail (small)
images appear on the right.
 If the folder contains more folders (or subfolders), a + sign appears to its
left. To see those subfolders, click the + sign.
 To hide those subfolders again, click the – sign that now appears where
the + sign did.
Here’s how to open and manage files by using the thumbnails on the right
side:
 Open: Double-click the image.
 Get image information: Pause your cursor over any thumbnail, as we
did in Figure 1-1. Paint Shop Pro displays basic information near your
cursor. For more detail, click the Info tab in the browser’s left pane.
 Rearrange the order that’s displayed: Drag thumbnails where you want
them. You can also sort files by name, date, or other criteria. Follow the
numbered steps that appear after this list.
 Move to a different folder: Drag the thumbnail from the right pane to
your destination folder in the left pane.
 Copy to a different folder: Drag the thumbnail to another folder while
holding the Ctrl key down.
 Create a new folder: In the left panel, click the folder in which you want
to create a new folder. Choose File➪Create New Folder, and in the Create
New Folder dialog box that appears, type your new folder’s name.
 Delete: Right-click the file’s thumbnail and choose Delete from the menu
that appears.
 Rename: Right-click the file’s thumbnail, choose Rename from the drop-
down menu, and enter a new name in the Rename File dialog box that
appears.
 Select several files for opening, moving, copying, or deleting: Hold
down the Ctrl key and click their thumbnail images. To select a series,
left-click the first (or last) image; then hold down the Shift key and click
the last (or first) image. Follow the instructions in the preceding bullets
for opening, moving, copying, or deleting files.
To sort your thumbnails in different ways, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the blank area to the right of the pictures and choose Sort
from the context menu that appears.
The Sorting dialog box appears.
10
Part I: The Basics 

2. Choose Ascending or Descending sort order in the Primary sort order
area of the dialog box.
3. Choose what to sort by in the Sort Condition selection box: file attrib-
utes, such as date, or image attributes, such as dimensions (size).
4. To sort within a sort (such as sorting filenames alphabetically within
each file date), choose your secondary sort criterion by using the
Secondary sort order area of the dialog box. (It works just like the
Primary sort order area.)
5. Click OK to sort.
Files from some cameras now contain EXIF data: detailed and technical infor-
mation for professional photographers about how and when that photograph
was taken. The Paint Shop Pro 9 browser now lets you choose to sort on that
information in the Sort Conditions selection boxes.
Opening the right file with File➪Open
If you know the folder where your file lives, the fastest route to opening the
file is to use the familiar old File➪Open command. (Every program has one.)
As with most programs, you can alternatively press Ctrl+O or click the File
Open button on the toolbar (as shown in the margin of this paragraph).
Figure 1-2 shows you the Open dialog box that appears. As in any program,
you click a filename listed in the Open dialog box and then click Open to
open a file. Paint Shop Pro, however, adds a few special features for working
with images.
Figure 1-2:
The Open
dialog box.
11
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

 To open more than one file at a time: Hold down the Ctrl button while
clicking filenames, and then click the Open button. Or, to open a bunch
of image files listed sequentially in the Open dialog box, click the first
file, hold down the Shift button, click the last file, and then click the
Open button.
 To trim down the list of files to show just one type (if you’re looking
for a GIF file, for example): Click the Files of Type selection box and
choose that type from the many file types Paint Shop Pro can read.
 To see information on the image width, height, and color depth: 
Click your file and then read the Image Information area of the Open
dialog box.
 To see more information about an image you have clicked, such as
date or file size: Click the Details button.
Secrets of opening a file 
by double-clicking
If you see an image file listed on your computer — in a My Computer or
Windows Explorer window, for example — and it displays the Paint Shop Pro
palette icon, you can open it in Paint Shop Pro by double-clicking that icon. 
If you have several images you want to open, double-click each of them sepa-
rately, and they all get a separate window in Paint Shop Pro. You don’t end 
up with multiple copies of Paint Shop Pro running.
If you have an image file that Paint Shop Pro doesn’t open when you double-
click it, three things could be responsible:
 The file doesn’t have an extension, like .jpg or .gif. This problem often
happens when someone sends you a file from a Macintosh computer.
Use the browsing or File➪Open technique described in the preceding
12
Part I: The Basics 
If your file isn’t listed
If the file you want isn’t listed in the File Open
dialog box, make sure that the wrong file type
isn’t chosen in the Files of Type selection box.
File type choices are “sticky.” That is, if you
chose last time to display only GIF files, this time
the Open dialog box still displays only GIF files.
If you’re looking for a JPG file now, you don’t
see it! Choose All Files in the Files of Type selec-
tion box to see all files again.

sections. Or, if you know what kind of file it is (JPEG, for example), right-
click the file and choose Rename from the context menu that appears.
Then type the correct file extension (.jpg for JPEG, for example).
 Paint Shop Pro can’t open the file. Paint Shop Pro can open many dif-
ferent types of file, but not all of them.
 Paint Shop Pro may not be configured to open that file type. See the
nearby sidebar, “Making Paint Shop Pro open the right file types when
you double-click.”
13
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files
Making Paint Shop Pro open the right 
file types when you double-click
Two problems can occur with double-clicking
as a way of opening image files:
 Paint Shop Pro may open files that you would
prefer to be opened by some other program.
For example, if you’re running AutoCAD or
another AutoDesk program, you may prefer
that the AutoDesk program open DXF files
because they’re one of AutoDesk’s own file
types.
 Paint Shop Pro may fail to open image files
that you want it to open. For example, you
may install new software for a new digital
camera, and, suddenly, when you double-
click JPG files, some program other than
Paint Shop Pro opens the file.
These problems usually occur when you have
more than one graphics program. The latest one
installed may grab all the file types for itself.
Both problems can be solved the same way.
Follow these steps to specify which files are to
be opened (or not) by Paint Shop Pro:
1. Choose File➪Preferences➪File Format
Associations.
The File Format Associations dialog box
appears. This box directs Windows to open
certain file types by using Paint Shop Pro.
2. Click the check boxes to enable or disable
the file types you want opened by Paint
Shop Pro.
To disable all check boxes, click Remove
All. To enable all check boxes, click Select
All. (After that, you can enable or disable
check boxes manually, if you like.) To have
Paint Shop Pro open only the file types that
aren’t opened by any other program, click
Select Unused.
3. Click OK.
At this point, Paint Shop Pro is properly set up
to open just the file types you want it to and
leave the others alone. The other program you
use, however, may still not be properly set up to
open the files you want it to open. We can’t give
you much help with that, but we can tell you one
place to get help: Choose Start➪Help from the
Windows taskbar. In the Help window that
appears, click the Index tab at the top of the
Help window and then, in the text box in the
upper-left corner of the window, type associat-
ing file. Below that text box, a line appears that
reads Associating file extensions
(or types) with programs. Double-click
that line to get help with associating file exten-
sions with your other program.

Viewing and Zooming an Image
Working with images involves a great deal of zooming, or changing the magnifi-
cation of your view. Sometimes you need to work close up, to take that nasty
gleam out of Uncle Charley’s eye, for example (something Aunt Mabel has been
trying to do for years). At other times, you really need to see the whole picture,
but Uncle Charley’s gleaming eye rather scarily fills the whole window.
Zooming doesn’t change the size of an image (in pixels or in inches). It only
changes how big Paint Shop Pro displays the image onscreen.
Zooming and moving an 
image in the window
The basic way to zoom in (enlarge the view) or zoom out (see more of the pic-
ture) is to use the Zoom tool. The Zoom tool and its sidekick, the Pan tool, live
in the same position (which we call a tool group) at the top of the Tools toolbar.
Follow these steps to zoom:
1. Click the tiny down-arrow on the top tool group on the Tools toolbar.
Two tools spring out to the right of this button: the Pan tool (the hand)
and the Zoom tool (the magnifying glass).
2. Click the Zoom tool, as shown in the margin.
Your cursor changes to a magnifying glass icon.
3. Click with the zoom tool on the image in this way:
• Click (left-click) to zoom in.
• Right-click to zoom out.
You can choose the Zoom or Pan tool quickly by pressing a single key. Press
the Z key for Zoom. Press the A key for Pan.
If the image gets bigger than the window, use the Pan tool to move the image
around (pan it) in the window. Click the top button on the Tools toolbar, as
you did in Step 1, but this time choose the Pan tool (the hand icon) — or just
press the A key. Drag the cursor (it’s now displaying a hand icon) on the
image to move the image.
To see the image at its actual size (100 percent), choose View➪Zoom➪
Zoom to 100% or click the button labeled Actual Size on the Tool Options
palette. (The Tool Options palette runs horizontally near the top of the Paint
Shop Pro window and changes depending on the tool you choose. See the 
following sidebar about the Tool Options palette.)
14
Part I: The Basics 

Paint Shop Pro also lets you magnify a portion of the image rather than have
to enlarge the whole thing to see a detail. With either the Pan or Zoom tool
selected, choose View➪Magnifier or press Ctrl+Alt+M. Move your cursor over
an area of the image, and a special 5x Zoom window shows you a close-up
view of that area. Repeat the command to remove the magnifier.
Working on several images at a time
You can open several images at a time in Paint Shop Pro. Each one gets its
own window. Having several images open is useful for tasks such as cutting
and pasting between images. To help manage those windows, use the com-
mands on the Paint Shop Pro Window menu. That menu contains the usual
suspects of nearly all Windows programs: Cascade, Tile (Horizontally or
Vertically), or Close All to close all image files.
Remember that Paint Shop Pro tools and commands apply to only the 
image window that’s active (the one with the colored title bar). Click an 
image window’s title bar to make that window active and bring it to the front.
Alternatively, you can choose a window by the name of the file it’s displaying,
as listed on the Window menu.
Getting Information about an Image
Simply looking at an image doesn’t tell you the whole story. You may be
asking yourself, “What exactly am I looking at, here? I mean, how big is this
image, really? How many colors? What folder is it from? Is this really Uncle
Fred in Cancun?”
15
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files
The Tool Options palette — the toolbar-ish 
thing that changes a lot
Every time you choose a new tool (from the tool
buttons that run down the left side of the Paint
Shop Pro window), a toolbar changes just
above the image window. (If you’re not sure
which toolbar it is, press the F4 key repeatedly
to flash the toolbar on or off.) This toolbar, the
Tool Options palette, contains all the various
fiddly bits you may want to change on a tool. For
example, with a paintbrush, you set the brush
width here. With the Zoom or Pan tool, you can
choose shortcuts named Zoom more rather
than click repeatedly to zoom a lot. Each tool
has too many fiddly bits to cover in detail, so we
alert you to any important ones and let you, well,
fiddle with the rest.

To get information, choose Image➪Image Information from the menu bar or
press Shift+I. The Current Image Information dialog box appears and displays
all available information about this image file.
Saving an Image File
After you’re done working on an image in Paint Shop Pro, you need to save it.
Saving an image in Paint Shop Pro is just as easy as saving a Microsoft Word
document, for example. Choose File➪Save or click the Save button on the
standard toolbar (the floppy disk icon) or press Ctrl+S.
Paint Shop Pro saves (without complaint, in most instances) an image as the
same type (format) of file (JPG, for example) that it was when you opened it. It
may, however, raise a warning, depending on what changes you have made —
see the nearby sidebar, “When Paint Shop Pro notes your limitations.”
If you have added text or shapes or overlaid images on your original image,
saving the modified image as a Paint Shop Pro file is a good idea; see the fol-
lowing section.
16
Part I: The Basics 
When Paint Shop Pro notes your limitations
Paint Shop Pro images are sophisticated! They
can have layers, selections, and as many as 16
million colors. Many common image types (like
JPEG or GIF) cannot handle layers, selections,
or that many colors. If you try to save such a
sophisticated image as one of these more lim-
ited file types, Paint Shop Pro displays the fol-
lowing query box:
For example, if you start with a JPEG image and
put text on it, Paint Shop Pro normally puts that
text on a separate layer. If you save the image
as a JPEG file, Paint Shop Pro has to combine
all layers into one single layer.
Go ahead and click OK on the query box. The file
you create is limited, but the image you have
open in Paint Shop Pro is unaffected. It still has
its advanced features until you close it. We rec-
ommend that you take this opportunity to also
save the image as a Paint Shop Pro file so that
you can access those layers.

Saving an Image As a 
Paint Shop Pro File
Saving your image as a Paint Shop Pro (pspimage) type of file is a good idea,
even if the image started life as a different type or even if you ultimately want
to save the image as a different type.
Paint Shop Pro files are a good choice because, among other things, they
save layers and any current selection you may have made during the editing
process. Most common file types (except the common Photoshop type) don’t
save that stuff. Some file types are lossy (like most JPG varieties), which
means that they may even lose quality.
After you have taken the precaution of making a Paint Shop Pro file, if you
also need a different type of file, save a copy of the image as that other type of
file. If you make subsequent changes to the image, always make the changes
to the Paint Shop Pro file and then make copies of that file in the various file
types you may need.
Follow these steps to save your image as a Paint Shop Pro file:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
2. Click the Save as Type box and select the Paint Shop Pro Image option.
3. Select a folder and type a name for the file.
Do this exactly as you would to save a file in any other Windows program.
4. Click the Save button.
The image is now safely stored as the best file type possible for a Paint Shop
Pro user, with nothing lost.
Saving a Copy of Your File 
As Another File Type
After saving an image as a Paint Shop Pro file (refer to the preceding section),
if you also need the image in a different file type, save a copy in that different
file type. Follow these steps to save a copy as another file type:
1. Choose File➪Save Copy As.
The Save Copy As dialog box appears.
17
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

2. Select the file type you want from the Save as Type box.
If an Option button appears and isn’t grayed out, it provides access to
variations on your chosen format that can sometimes be useful, like
reducing the file size (compression) or putting the file in a particular
form that somebody needs. This section provides a few examples of
options.
3. Click the Save button.
Keep the following pointers in mind to avoid confusion, disappointment, and
bad hair days:
 We recommend that you keep your ongoing work in Paint Shop Pro files
(.pspimage) to avoid losing features like layers. If you need the image as
another file type, use the File➪Save Copy As command and avoid using
File➪Save As.
 When you save a copy in a different file type, the open file isn’t affected. It
remains whatever file type it was. For example, if the open file is a Paint
Shop Pro file type and you save a copy as JPEG, the open file remains a
Paint Shop Pro file type. (You can tell by the pspimage extension on the
filename, on the title bar in the image window.)
 If you have used layers (or floating selections) and save a copy as some-
thing other than a Paint Shop Pro file, Paint Shop Pro may have to merge
(combine) those layers into a single image. The program displays a
dialog box to warn you if it needs to merge layers into a single image.
(See the nearby sidebar, “When Paint Shop Pro notes your limitations.”)
That merge doesn’t happen to the Paint Shop Pro image you’re working
on — only to the file copy you’re creating. Don’t worry about the mes-
sage — just click Yes to proceed.
Saving the Whole Enchilada, 
Your Workspace
Got a hot and spicy date? Need to wrap up one Paint Shop Pro project and
start chewing on another?
You can close Paint Shop Pro at any time and go back later to exactly the way
things were: what file you had open, what palettes and tool options you had
chosen — the whole enchilada. This process is called saving the workspace.
It’s also a good feature if you’re finicky about exactly how the various Paint
18
Part I: The Basics 

Shop Pro controls (palettes and toolbars, for example) are arranged. It’s a
nice way to save different image projects by name.
Follow these steps to save a workspace:
1. Choose File➪Workspace➪Save.
The Save Workspace dialog box makes the scene and lists any work-
spaces you have previously created.
2. Type a name for this workspace in the New Workspace Name text box.
If you want your workspace to include any images you have open, click
to enable the Include Open Images check box.
3. Click the Save button.
If any images are open, Paint Shop Pro prompts you to save them now. If
you’re going out and your PC may crash or your cat may dance on the key-
board, consider clicking Yes.
To restore a previously saved workspace, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Workspace➪Load.
A Load Workspace query box may appear and warn you that loading a
workspace replaces your existing workspace settings. It asks whether
you want to save the existing workspace. Click Yes to open the Save
Workspace dialog box we just described. Click No if you don’t care to
save the current workspace.
The Load Workspace dialog box appears and lists workspaces by name.
2. Click the named workspace you want.
3. Click Load.
Paint Shop Pro loads any images that are part of that workspace and restores
all settings.
Using Native and Foreign File Types
Most graphics files are “not from around here”; that is, they’re not Paint Shop
Pro files. Because you may have to open or create these types of files, know-
ing something about file types can be helpful. This section describes a few 
of the most popular file types. Each file type is identified by the extension
(ending) it uses. For example, Paint Shop Pro files end with the extension
.pspimage or .psp.
19
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

Most of the time, you don’t have to do anything special to open a particular
file type or to save your work as that type of file — and then again, some-
times you do. Paint Shop Pro, in most cases, simply asks you a few questions
to resolve any problems when you’re opening or saving a foreign file type.
Paint Shop Pro files (pspimage or PSP)
The native Paint Shop Pro 9 file type, pspimage, is probably the best choice
for storing your own images. When you save your work as a Paint Shop Pro
file, you can save everything just as it is, including any areas you have
selected with the Paint Shop Pro selection tools, plus your various kinds of
layers, palettes, tool settings (like current brush width), transparency, and
other advanced features. You can pick up almost exactly where you left off.
Paint Shop Pro files can have any color depth (maximum number of colors)
you choose. Pspimage is the latest and greatest of the Paint Shop Pro native
formats; earlier versions used the PSP extension.
Programs other than Paint Shop Pro and Animation Shop don’t often read
Paint Shop Pro files, however. You may need to save a copy of your image in a
different file type for someone who uses other software, like Photoshop. Also,
earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro can’t read later Paint Shop Pro files (Paint
Shop Pro 7 can’t read Paint Shop Pro 9 files, for example.) To create files for
earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro, see the instructions for saving a copy of
your image in the section “Saving a Copy of Your File As Another File Type,”
earlier in this chapter.
20
Part I: The Basics 
“How the FPX can I see the TIF, JPG, 
DXF, and other extensions?!”
An image file is often referred to by the 3-or-more
letter ending (extension) at the end of its file-
name. The file polecat.tif, for example, is a TIF (or
TIFF) file. On many computers, Windows is set up
to hide these extensions, which makes your life
harder when you’re using Paint Shop Pro. If,
when you go to open a file in Paint Shop Pro, the
files don’t appear to end with a period and exten-
sion (such as .psp, .bmp, or .pcx), Windows is
hiding valuable information from you.To reveal
the extensions, do this: On the Windows desktop,
double-click the My Computer icon. In the
window that appears in Windows XP, choose
Tools➪Folder Options (or in Windows 98, choose
View➪Folder Options). This command displays
the Folder Options dialog box. Click the View tab
there, and under Files and Folders, Hidden Files,
deselect the check box labeled Hide File
Extensions for Known File Types.

BMP
BMP files are Windows bitmap files; that is, they were designed by Microsoft for
storing images, and many programs under Windows can read and write them.
BMP files can have color depths of 1, 4, 8, or 24 bits. (Set your color depth by
choosing Colors➪Decrease Color Depth or Colors➪Increase Color Depth.)
BMP files that are 24-bit can be quite large. When you save a file as BMP, 
you can click the Options button in the Save As (or Save Copy As) dialog 
box to choose higher compression (make smaller files). Under Encoding in 
the Options dialog box that appears, select RLE and then click OK. (RLE
stands for Run-Length Encoding, a way of making image files smaller.) Now,
when you save the file, Paint Shop Pro asks your permission to switch to a
256-color (8-bit) version of the BMP file. The resulting file is much trimmer
than the original, although the color quality may diminish slightly.
TIFF
TIFF (or TIF) stands for Tag Image File Format (which, of course, tells you
nothing useful). Many graphics programs on the PC and Macintosh can read
and write TIFF files, so it’s a good choice of file type when you don’t know
what kinds of files the other person can read.
TIFF files can be quite large unless you compress them. To compress a TIFF
file, click the Options button when you’re using the Save As or Save Copy 
As dialog box. Then choose the LZW Compression option in the Compression
area of the Options dialog box that appears. LZW gives you the best compres-
sion and compatibility with most other programs. (No image quality is lost by
using LZW compression in TIFF files.)
21
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files
Color depth
Color depth refers to the capacity of a given file
type (like GIF) to store a variety of colors. Color
depth is described as either the maximum
number of colors an image can contain (like 256
colors) or a number of bits. The term 1 bit means
that the image contains only black and white; 4
bits means that the image can contain 16 colors;
8 bits corresponds to 256 colors, and 24 bits
means as many as 16 million colors.

For advanced users, TIFF is a good choice because it can store information in
not only RGB (red, green, blue) primary colors, but also in CMYK (cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black), which is used for some high-quality printed
images. It can also store advanced data for color accuracy, such as gamma.
GIF
The Web uses CompuServe GIF images all over the place. GIF is the most pop-
ular of three common file types used on the Internet. (JPG and PNG are the
other two.)
Many programs read GIF files. (Older programs may read only the older 
GIF standard, GIF87, rather than the newer GIF89a. Paint Shop Pro lets you
choose which standard to use when you’re saving a GIF file — just click the
Options button in the Save As or Save Copy As dialog box.)
Saving your Paint Shop Pro work as GIF usually means that it loses some-
thing, but perhaps not enough to matter. GIF images have a maximum color
depth of 256 colors, which allows fairly realistic images. That number of
colors, however, isn’t enough to enable Paint Shop Pro to do all operations,
so it may at some point suggest that you let it increase the number of colors.
(See the section “File Types and Auto-Action Messages about Colors,” later in
this chapter.)
GIF enables you to use some special features, such as a transparent color
(which lets the backgrounds of Web pages show through), and interlaced dis-
play (in which the entire image gradually forms as it’s downloaded from the
Web).
A special Paint Shop Pro tool called the GIF Optimizer can help you set trans-
parency and otherwise optimize the image for Web use. See Chapter 15 for
the details of creating GIF files for the Web using this tool.
Some GIF files contain a whole series of images to be displayed as an anima-
tion. You can view these images by using Animation Shop; Paint Shop Pro
shows you only the first image of the series.
JPEG
JPEG (or JPG) stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which sounds
impressive. JPEG images are common on the Web for color photographs and
other realistic color images because their files are small (relative to other file
types) and download quickly.
22
Part I: The Basics 

The disadvantage of JPEG is that it uses a kind of compression, called lossy
compression, to make its files small. Lossy compression means that the image
quality is reduced a bit, especially around sharp edges, like text. Storing an
image as a JPEG is kind of like stuffing a pie into a little plastic bag in your
backpack for a hike. If it gets squeezed, the basic taste and nutrition are still
there, and it doesn’t take up lots of space, but you may not like the result.
You can choose just how much squeezing you want in the JPEG format, but
first storing your work in some other format (preferably, PSP) is a good idea.
1. Choose File➪Save Copy As.
The Save Copy As dialog box appears.
2. Select JPEG in the Save As Type box.
3. Click the Options button.
In the Save Options dialog box that appears, drag the Compression
Factor slider to the left for higher quality and larger files, or to the right
for lower-quality and smaller files.
4. Click the Save button.
The geeks at the Joint Photographics Experts Group have also come up with
a lossless (unsqueezed) variety of JPEG. To save your files in this maximum-
quality-but-largest-file-size format, first select JPEG 2000 in the Save As Type
selection box. Then click the Options button, and in the Save Options dialog
box that appears, choose Lossless. Be aware that not all software can read or
display JPEG 2000 files, though.
If you’re reading JPEG files, Paint Shop Pro offers an effect that removes some
image distortions, called artifacts, that result from compression. (See Chapter
6 for instructions for removing JPEG artifacts.)
As with GIF, Paint Shop Pro offers a special tool, the JPEG Optimizer, for
adjusting JPEG images for the Web. See the section in Chapter 15 about 
creating JPEG files for the details of fine-tuning JPEG images with this tool.
PNG
PNG (Progressive Network Graphics) was designed to take over for GIF on the
Web, although it’s catching on slowly. It does have some advantages over GIF
and accomplishes the same functions as GIF, so it may yet take over. Because
its main use is Web graphics, we discuss it a bit more in Chapter 15.
23
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

Using Vector File Types (Drawing Files)
Graphics images come in two main flavors: raster (also called bitmap) and
vector. Here are the differences between them:
 Raster (bitmap) images are made up of dots (pixels). Most computer
images are of this kind, and Paint Shop Pro is principally designed for
this kind of image. It both reads and writes a wide variety of raster
images.
 Vector images are made up of lines, shapes, filled areas, and text. You
can change text, lines, and shapes more easily if they’re stored as vec-
tors than if they’re stored as bitmaps. Although Paint Shop Pro is princi-
pally designed for raster images, it allows you to create vector layers
that contain lines, text, and preset shapes. If you use these layers, store
your image as a Paint Shop Pro file to retain any vector graphics you
create. If you store your images as other file types, PSP may convert
your vector graphics to bitmap form, which may make editing more 
difficult.
Vector files are typically created by popular drawing software (as opposed 
to painting software). AutoCAD, for example, a popular drafting application,
writes DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) files. Corel Draw writes CDR files, and
Corel WordPerfect uses WPG files. Many other vector file types are in use too.
Like Paint Shop Pro files, some other file types can also contain a mix of
vector and bitmap graphics. These include Windows Enhanced Metafiles
(EMF, a Microsoft Windows standard), Computer Graphics Metafiles (CGM, 
a standard by the American National Standards Institute), PICT (a Macintosh
standard), and embedded PostScript (EPS, by Adobe). Some files (like embed-
ded PostScript) may contain in some cases both a bitmap and a vector ver-
sion of the same image.
Opening vector files
Paint Shop Pro can open many kinds of vector (or mixed vector and bitmap)
files. You can also copy drawings, using the Windows Clipboard, from most
vector programs that run under Windows and paste the images into Paint
Shop Pro.
Paint Shop Pro 9 opens many types of vector files and keeps them as vector
files. If you open an AutoCAD DXF file, for example, the lines and other
objects are translated into Paint Shop Pro vector objects.
Because Paint Shop Pro also lets you work with bitmap graphics, however,
whenever you open a vector file, you have to add information about what
size, in pixels, you want the image to be. Paint Shop Pro pops up a dialog box
24
Part I: The Basics 

that requires you to enter dimensions in pixels (or dimensions in inches and
pixels per inch) for the resulting bitmap image. If a Maintain Original Aspect
Ratio check box appears, select it if you want to keep the same proportions
as the original image.
For a PostScript file, for example, Paint Shop Pro displays the PostScript
Renderer dialog box. To enter the page size, we generally find the Bounding
Box option (which refers to the outside of the drawing area) to be the best
solution; for resolution, the 72 dpi that is already entered in the Resolution
box usually does well. The image size you get (in pixels) is the image dimen-
sion (say, 8.5 x 11 inches) times the Resolution (say, 72 dpi, gives you an
image that is 8.5 x 72 pixels wide and 11 x 72 pixels high). For more detail or a
bigger picture, choose a higher resolution.
Because Paint Shop Pro is translating between two different kinds of image
data, it may make a few mistakes that you have to clean up afterward.
Saving vector files — not
You can’t save pure vector-type image files, such as DXF, in Paint Shop Pro.
You can, however, save your work as one of the file types that is allowed to
contain a mix of vectors and bitmaps, such as EPS or CGM.
In those instances, however, Paint Shop Pro simply stores all your edits as a
bitmap image and stores nothing in the vector part of the EPS, CGM, or other
combined bitmap or vector file. Your vector objects become part of a single
bitmap image. Because no vector objects are stored, a program that handles
only vector graphics may not be able to read the file.
Converting or Renaming Batches of Files
If you have lots of image files and need copies of them in a different file type,
try the Paint Shop Pro batch processing feature. Batch processing also lets
you create an ordered series of related names, like hawaii0001 through
hawaii9579, for your 9,579 vacation photos.
To copy a bunch of files to a new file format, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Batch➪Process.
The Batch Process dialog box appears.
2. Click the Browse button at the top of the Batch Process dialog box.
A Select Files dialog box appears.
3. In the Select Files dialog box, open the folder containing your files,
hold down the Ctrl key, and click all the files you want to convert.
25
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

4. Click Select to close the Select Files dialog box.
Your selected files are now listed in the Files to Process box of the Batch
Process dialog box. To add files from another folder, repeat Steps 2 
and 3.
5. In the Save Options area at the bottom of the Batch Process dialog
box, in the Type selection box, choose the file type you want as the
result of your conversion.
6. To put the newly generated files in a different folder, click the Browse
button at the bottom of the dialog box and choose a new folder.
7. Click the Start button.
In a few seconds or minutes, you have copies in the new file type you need.
To give a bunch of files similar names, differing by only a number (as in
hawaii01, hawaii02, and so on), take these steps:
1. Choose File➪Batch➪Rename.
2. In the Batch Rename dialog box that appears, click the Browse button.
3. In the Select Files dialog box, open the folder containing your files,
hold down the Ctrl key, and click all the files you want to convert.
4. Click Select to close the Select Files dialog box.
Your selected files are now listed in the Files to Process box of the Batch
Rename dialog box. To add files from another folder, repeat Steps 2 
and 3.
5. Click the Modify button.
The Modify Filename Format dialog box appears. The idea is to combine
various naming and numbering elements into a sort of formula for Paint
Shop Pro to follow. For example, hawaii50 is a custom text element of
our choosing, followed by a 2-digit sequence.
6. Click an element in the Rename Options panel to choose the first part
of the new name, such as Custom Text.
7. Click the Add button to add that element to your formula, which gets
assembled in the right panel.
Depending on what kind of element you choose, a 1-line text box
appears on the right for you to make a choice or enter some text. We
stick with our simple example. If you have chosen Custom Text, type
your text (hawaii, for example) in the Custom Text box that appears. If
you have chosen Sequence, type a starting number in the Starting
Sequence box that appears; use as many digits as you need for the batch
(type 1 for as many as 9 images and 01 for as many as 99 images). For
today’s date, choose a date format.
26
Part I: The Basics 

8. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more elements. Make sure that one of
your elements is Sequence, or else you’re asking the impossible: for
each file to have the same name.
The order in which you add elements on the right is the order in which
they appear in the filenames.
9. Click OK. When the Batch Rename dialog box returns, select the files
to be converted.
The files are all renamed, and each name includes a different number.
File Types and Auto-Action 
Messages about Colors
When you try to use certain Paint Shop Pro features or save your work in a
non–PSP format, you may see an Auto Actions message box from Paint Shop
Pro. For example, you may open a GIF file and want to use one of the Paint
Shop Pro commands on the Adjust or Effects menu. Or, perhaps you want to
add a raster layer to that GIF file. Paint Shop Pro displays an error message
like the one shown in Figure 1-3.
Don’t worry — be happy; just click OK. The issue is that certain file types,
like GIF, can handle only a limited number of colors (they have limited color
depth) and many Paint Shop Pro features work only on images able to handle
as many as 16 million colors. Paint Shop Pro is offering to create a 16-million-
color image for you so that it can apply the tool you want to use.
If you get one of these messages, and if you later save your work in the origi-
nal, color-limited file type (GIF, for example), you also get a message request-
ing permission to reduce the number of colors back to whatever that type of
file can handle. Simply click OK in whatever dialog box or boxes result, and
you’re likely to be happy with the result.
If you’re a professional and are picky, you understand what’s going on and
can take the necessary steps to control the result. You can always change the
Figure 1-3:

quality.
27
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, Managing, and Saving Image Files

number of colors manually by choosing Image➪Increase Color Depth or
Image➪Decrease Color Depth.
To turn off these messages and always have Paint Shop Pro proceed (or not
proceed), choose File➪Preferences➪General Program Preferences. Click the
Auto Actions tab in the dialog box that appears. For each type of conversion,
you can choose to never do it or to always do it or to have the program
prompt you. Or, click Never All or Always All to never or always do any of the
conversions.
Obtaining Image Files from the Web
The Web is a grab bag of goodies for graphics gurus. Here’s how to get your
hands on these fabulous fruits.
One of the best ways to get graphics is to find a Web site offering them free
and clear. Most of these sites provide instructions for downloading those
image files. Other Web pages may copy-protect their images so that you can’t
use the procedures we list in this section.
To save an image that you’re viewing in your Web browser, use either of these
methods:
 Right-click the image and, on the pop-up menu that appears, look for
Save Picture As or a similar choice. You’re prompted for the location on
your hard drive where you want the image saved.
 Right-click the image and, on the pop-up menu that appears, choose
Copy. This choice copies the image to the Windows Clipboard; open
Paint Shop Pro and press Ctrl+V to paste the image as a new image.
(Choose the Edit➪Paste command to see ways to paste the image into
another open image.) Save the image by choosing File➪Save.
A fair number of graphics images on the Web have transparent portions,
especially their backgrounds. The transparent parts of these types of image
have a hidden color (typically white), and that color may become visible in
Paint Shop Pro. See Chapter 15 for more information about transparency in
Web images.
Most Web images are one of only a few different file types: GIF, JPEG, or PNG.
GIF and some PNG images are palette images, with a limited number of colors
(typically, 256 colors).
Many animations on the Web are GIF files. You should open animated GIF files
in Animation Shop, not in Paint Shop Pro (which displays only the first frame
of the animation). Some animations are, however, in a private vector format
(Flash) that neither Animation Shop nor Paint Shop Pro can read.

I
t happened several times to Alice, of Wonderland fame: She needed to be
bigger or smaller or to change her orientation. Fortunately, you don’t have
to adopt her dubious pharmacological methods — eating and drinking myste-
riously labeled substances — to change the size or orientation of your
images.
No, to make your pictures bigger, smaller, rotated, or otherwise reoriented,
you need to indulge in only a few clicks on well-labeled commands or icons.
In this chapter, we illuminate your choices as you navigate the Paint Shop Pro
rabbit hole.
If your image appears smaller than you think it should be when you first open
it, Paint Shop Pro has probably zoomed the image out to fit your window. To
zoom in, click the Zoom (magnifier) tool from the pan and zoom tool group
and then left-click the image.
Getting Sized
Size may not be everything, but it’s important. You don’t need a 1024-x-768-
pixel image, for example (full-screen size on many PCs), for a snapshot of

your new company CEO on your Web site. If you didn’t get an appropriately
sized CEO (okay, an image of a CEO) in the first place, you can trim that
person in Paint Shop Pro. Likewise, if you’re rushing to prepare the opening
screen for a company presentation and the only way you can get a logo is to
scan in the tiny one on your letterhead, Paint Shop Pro can help you size it up
to a more presentable image.
If you’re preparing an image that someone else plans to place in a profession-
ally prepared and printed document, don’t scale it down yourself. Let your
graphics designer or printer do the scaling to suit the printing process.
Start resizing by choosing Image➪Resize or press Shift+S. The Resize dialog
box appears in order to help you size the situation up — or down (see 
Figure 2-1).
Proportioning
The Resize dialog box normally keeps an image’s proportions (relationship of
width to height) constant while you resize. If you set the width, therefore,
Paint Shop Pro sets the height for you (and vice versa). Keeping image pro-
portions constant avoids distortion.
Figure 2-1:
Sizing your
image up —
or down.
30
Part I: The Basics 

If you prefer to change the proportions (which distorts your image), you can
click to clear (deselect) the check box labeled Lock Aspect Ratio to 1. (The
box appears checked in Figure 2-1) Paint Shop Pro then lets you set the width
and height independently.
Dimensioning
Using the Resize dialog box (refer to Figure 2-1), you can adjust the size in
one of three ways, all of which do the same thing: change the image’s size in
pixels. Use whichever way suits your mindset:
 Specify size in pixels: If you’re using the image on the Web or in e-mail,
you most likely have a pixel size (probably a desired width) in mind.
Select Pixels from the drop-down menu next to the Width and Height
controls and then enter a value for Width (or Height).
 Make it X% of its current size: Select Percent from the drop-down menu
next to the Width and Height controls and then enter a Width (or Height)
value. In Figure 2-1, for example, the 66 setting makes the image 2⁄3 (66
percent) of its current size. To double the image size, use 200.
 Make it print bigger or smaller: Select which measurement you want 
to use (inches or centimeters) from the menu on the right side and then
use the Width or Height controls in the Print Size section to make the
image print as large as you want. Paint Shop Pro multiplies this physical
size (in inches, for example) by the resolution setting (pixels per inch) 
in this dialog box and calculates a new image size in pixels. You can also
change the value in the Resolution text box to adjust the image resolu-
tion (pixels per inch or centimeter). Don’t confuse this setting with the
printer’s resolution (typically, 300 to 600 dpi); see Chapter 14 if you are
confused about printing and resolution!
If your image has several layers and you want them all resized the same,
make sure to check the Resize All Layers check box. If you clear that check
mark, you resize only the active layer. Click OK to make the resizing happen.
Avoiding degradation
Resizing sounds easy: Just make the image bigger or smaller. What’s to think
about? Well, usually, you don’t have to think about anything. Occasionally,
however, your image’s appearance degrades after resizing. It has jagged or
fuzzy edges. These situations call for a little thought.
Behind the resizing issue is another difference between how computers and
humans think. If you want your image to be 25 percent bigger, Paint Shop Pro
has to figure out how to spread 100 pixels over 125 pixels. To get an idea of
31
Chapter 2: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

the scope of the problem, imagine dividing 100 cookies among 125 kids who
don’t accept broken cookies. Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro is pretty smart, so
you don’t have to smoosh up and bake these cookies again yourself. Unless
you instruct Paint Shop Pro otherwise, it uses the Smart Size feature to make
these decisions — it chooses the right way to do it based on what your image
looks like.
If your image doesn’t look so hot after resizing, try second-guessing the smart
resizing that Paint Shop Pro uses by default. Press Ctrl+Z to undo the ugly
resizing you just did. Then choose Image➪Resize again. In the Image Resize
dialog box that appears, click the Resize Type selection box to see the spe-
cific choices of ways to resize. Here’s what to do with those choices:
 Bicubic Resample: Choose to enlarge a realistic-looking or complex
image (like a photo) or to avoid jagged edges.
 Bilinear Resample: Choose to reduce a drawn image, one with well-
defined edges, or one with text.
 Pixel Resize: Choose to enlarge a drawn image or one with well-defined
edges. (Paint Shop Pro then simply removes or duplicates pixels in order
to resize.)
 Weighted Average: Choose to reduce a drawn image, one with well-
defined edges, or one with text if the Bilinear Resample option doesn’t
work out.
Click OK to proceed with the resizing. If your image doesn’t look better, press
Ctrl+Z to undo the last resize. Choose a different resizing method and try
resizing again.
Bilinear and bicubic resampling work for only 24-bit color images (or
grayscale images). You can use them on fewer-color images by first increas-
ing the color depth to 24-bit: Press Ctrl+Shift+0.
Cropping (Trimming) Your Edges
Is your image a bit shabby around the edges and in need of a trim? You can
improve the composition of many pictures by cropping (trimming) a bit off
the top, bottom, or sides. Often, for example, snapshots are taken from too
far away, so the subject is too small. You can enlarge the image in Paint Shop
Pro, but you also need to trim it so that the overall picture isn’t yards wide.
In a layered image, cropping affects all layers.
32
Part I: The Basics 

Paint Shop Pro provides a special tool for your crops. Take these steps to
trim your image:
1. Click the Crop tool (shown in the margin) on the Tools toolbar.
The cursor icon displays a set of crosshairs.
2. Visualize a rectangular area that defines the new boundaries of your
image.
For example, if you’re cropping a family photo taken in the backyard,
next to the trash barrels, visualize a rectangle around the family, exclud-
ing the barrels.
3. Move the crosshairs of your cursor to one corner of that visualized
rectangle and then drag diagonally toward the opposite corner.
As you drag, a real rectangle forms and items outside the rectangle are
dimmed. The status bar at the bottom of the Paint Shop Pro window
gives you the exact pixel column and row where the cursor is posi-
tioned, in case you need that information. As you drag, the status bar
also gives you the cursor position and the crop’s size, as shown in
Figure 2-2.
If the cropping rectangle isn’t quite right, you can modify it in one of
these three ways:
• To remove the rectangle and try again, right-click anywhere on the
image. The rectangle disappears.
• To change any side or corner of the rectangle, drag that side or
corner or adjust the edge values on the Tool Options palette, as
indicated in Figure 2-2.
• To position the rectangle, move your cursor within that rectangle;
the cursor becomes a four-headed arrow and you can drag the rec-
tangle to any new location.
4. When the rectangle is correct, double-click anywhere on the image.
Paint Shop Pro crops the image. If you don’t like the result, press Ctrl+Z
to undo the crop and then try these steps again.
To adjust, drag sides by handles.
Fine-tune edges.

Getting Turned Around, 
Mirrored, or Flipped
We can’t tell you how many people we have seen bending their necks to view
a sideways image! Apart from providing work for chiropractors, this habit
does nobody any good.
Paint Shop Pro makes rotating, mirroring, or flipping an image simple.
Mirrored or flipped images are particularly useful for imaginative work, such
as creating a reflection that isn’t present in the original or making a symmetri-
cal design, such as a floral border. Mirroring can also correct a transparency
that was scanned wrong side up.
Does your image have layers, or have you selected an area? As with many
Paint Shop Pro functions, the mirroring, flipping, and rotating commands
apply to only the active layer. If you have a selected area, mirroring and flip-
ping also restrict themselves to that area.
Rotating
To rotate an image, choose Image➪Rotate➪Free Rotate or press Ctrl+R. The
Rotate dialog box appears, with a variety of option buttons:
 To rotate the image clockwise, click Right.
 To rotate counterclockwise, click Left.
 Choose 90 degrees (a quarter-turn, good for righting sideways images),
180 degrees (a half-turn), or 270 degrees (a three-quarter turn) of rota-
tion, or choose Free (see the next bullet).
 To rotate any desired amount, choose Free and enter any rotation (in
degrees) in the highlighted text box.
If you’re rotating an image taken with the camera turned sidewise, just
choose Image➪Rotate➪Rotate Clockwise 90 or Rotate Counterclockwise 90.
Although you can use the Rotate dialog box to straighten an off-kilter photo,
you have a better way: the Straighten tool, which we cover in Chapter 5.
If your image has multiple layers (or if you aren’t sure whether it does) and
you want to rotate the entire image, click to place a check mark in the All
Layers check box in the Rotate dialog box. Otherwise, Paint Shop Pro rotates
only the active layer. Click OK to perform the rotation.
34
Part I: The Basics 

To rotate a portion of an image, select that portion with a selection tool and
then use the Deform tool. See Chapter 3 for help with selection and Chapter 4
to rotate a selection with the Deform tool.
Mirroring and flipping
To mirror an image is to change it as though it were reflected in a mirror held
alongside the image. To flip an image is to exchange top for bottom as though
the mirror were held underneath the image. Note that both transformations
are unique: You can’t achieve the same result by rotating the image!
If your image has layers, the mirroring and flipping commands apply to only
the active layer. If your image has an area selected, these commands float
that selection and then work on only that floating selection. See Chapter 4 
for more information about floating selections.
To mirror an image in Paint Shop Pro, choose Image➪Mirror. Your image is
transformed into its mirror image.
To flip an image, choose Image➪Flip. Your image is turned head over heels.
Taking on Borders
Paint Shop Pro can add a border of any color and width to any image. (If your
image uses layers, however, Paint Shop Pro has to merge them. For that
reason, borders are often best left as the last thing you do to your image.) To
create a border around an image, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Add Borders.
The Add Borders dialog box appears. (If Paint Shop Pro first displays a
dialog box warning you that the layers must be merged to proceed, click
OK to proceed.)
2. Choose your color.
Click the color box to bring up the Material Properties dialog box and
then click the shade you want to see surrounding your picture. Click OK.
If this strange array of circles and boxes proves too daunting for you,
check out the section in Chapter 10 about choosing a color for the very
picky, where we explain the Material Properties dialog box.
3. Set your border widths.
For a border that is the same width on all sides, leave the check mark in
the Symmetric check box and enter your border width in the Top, Bottom,
Left, or Right box. (It doesn’t matter which one you use; they all change
35
Chapter 2: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

together.) For different border widths on all sides, clear the Symmetric
check mark and enter the border widths in all the boxes individually. To
set a border in inches or units other than pixels, choose your preferred
unit from the selection box in the Original Dimensions area.
Click OK. Your image is now larger by the borders you have set.
Borders are no different from any other area of your image; they’re just new
and in all one color.
Achieving a Particular Canvas Size
Paint Shop Pro enables you to expand the canvas size of any image: that is, to
add a border area around the image to achieve a particular image width and
height. The Canvas Size command has the same effect as Add Borders.
“But,” you say, wisely, “if Add Borders does the same thing, why would I
bother with Canvas Size?” You would bother if you were looking to have an
image of a particular size — and didn’t want to do the arithmetic to calculate
how much border to add to the existing dimensions.
You may use the Canvas Size command, for example, if you’re making a cata-
log using images of various heights and widths and want all the images to be
of uniform height and width. You can’t resize the images because that would
distort them. If you use the Add Borders command, you have to calculate
border widths to fill out each image to the right dimensions. With canvas
sizing, however, you can simply place each image on a uniformly sized 
background.
Here’s how:
1. Choose Image➪Canvas Size.
The Canvas Size dialog box makes the scene.
2. Choose your color.
Click the Background swatch in this dialog box to display the Material
Properties dialog box. Choose the shade you want to see surrounding
your picture, and then click OK. (We explain the Material Properties
dialog box in Chapter 10). Alternatively, click with your cursor, which is
now an eyedropper, on any color in your image.
3. Enter in the Width and Height boxes a new width and new height for
your canvas.
These numbers define how big your overall image will be, including its
expanded canvas (borders). A selection box in this area lets you use
units of pixels, inches, centimeters, or millimeters.
36
Part I: The Basics 

To keep the canvas proportions the same as your original image, check
the Lock Aspect Ratio check box.
4. Choose where you want your image positioned on the canvas.
As you can see in Figure 2-3, you can press one of nine placement but-
tons to select which corner your image will be flush with on the canvas.
(The button in the center centers your image.)
If these ten positions aren’t good enough for you, you can place your
image on the canvas with exacting precision by using the Placement set-
tings. The values in these boxes tell Paint Shop Pro how far away the
image should be from each of the four borders, in whatever units you
chose in Step 3. For example, if you want to set your image so that it’s 
20 pixels away from the left side of the new canvas, enter a value of 20
in the Left Placement box.
For artistic purposes, you may want to crop the image at the canvas
edge (an effect called a full bleed). Using negative numbers in any of the
placement boxes places at least part of the image outside the canvas
border and effectively crops it. For example, a value of –20 pixels in the
Left placement box sets your image 20 pixels outside the left border of
the canvas. This action effectively trims 20 pixels off your image’s left
side.

37
Chapter 2: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

Click OK and your image is mounted on a fresh canvas of your chosen size
and background color. If you’re trying to put lots of variously sized images on
same-size canvases (as in a catalog), you may find it convenient that your
preceding canvas size settings remain as you open each image. Just choose
Image➪Canvas Size for each subsequent image and click OK.

f Uncle Dave is the only one looking a bit dark and gloomy in your wedding
picture, how can you lighten him — and only him — up? If the model in
your catalog is wearing last spring’s Irish Spring Green sweater, how can you
make it Summer Sunset Magenta without making your model magenta too?
Sometimes, you want Paint Shop Pro to do something to just one portion of
an image, like lighten Uncle Dave or color the model’s sweater, and leave the
rest of the image alone.
The solution is to select an area of the image. Just as you can select some text
that you want to modify in a word processor, you can select an image area to
modify in Paint Shop Pro. With that area selected, you can do, well, nearly
anything Paint Shop Pro can do, such as paint the area, change its color,
improve its contrast, erase it, copy it, or paste it.
You can hand-select an area by outlining it or automatically select an area by
its color. You can even get Paint Shop Pro to help you outline by finding edges.
Paint Shop Pro offers lots of features for getting a selection just right.
Paint Shop Pro has two other features that let you focus your actions on cer-
tain parts: the Background Eraser and layers. If you want to erase around
Uncle Dave, try the Background Eraser (see Chapter 9). Another feature, the
Paint Shop Pro layers, lets you transfer selections to independent layers so
that they can stay independent of the rest of the image (see Chapter 11).

40
Part I: The Basics 
In this chapter, we deal with selecting parts of your image that are raster
(bitmap) images. We don’t, however, deal with the special case of selecting
vector objects. The text and shapes that the Text, Draw, and Preset Shapes
tools make are almost always vector objects. To read about selecting vector
objects, see the section in Chapter 12 about controlling your objects.
Selecting an Area
Selecting is creating a restricted area in which you want Paint Shop Pro to do
its thing — a sort of construction zone. Paint Shop Pro’s “thing” is whatever
operation you choose, whether it’s moving, changing color, painting, filling,
smudging, filtering, erasing, copying, pasting, or mirroring — essentially, any
image change Paint Shop Pro can perform. For example, you can select an
elliptical area around Aunt Elizabeth in a group photo, copy that area to the
Windows Clipboard, and then paste it as a new image to create a classical
cameo-style oval image.
If you have layers in your image, selection can be slightly more complicated.
See the section “Avoiding Selection Problems in Layered Images,” later in this
chapter.
The selected area has a moving dashed line, or marquee, around it. Figure 3-1
shows you Alex the Wonder Dog in his very own marquee.

Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
The keys to selecting an area lie in two places in Paint Shop Pro:
 Selection tools on the Tools toolbar (along the left edge of the Paint
Shop Pro window)
 Commands on the Selection menu (on the Paint Shop Pro menu bar)
The three Paint Shop Pro selection tools are in the fifth tool group from the
top of the Tools toolbar, as shown in Figure 3-1. They give you three different
ways to select an area:
 Selection: Use the Selection tool to drag a rectangular, circular, or other
regular shape.
 Freehand: Use the Freehand tool, as we did in Figure 3-1, to draw an 
outline.
 Magic Wand: Use the Magic Wand tool to click an area that has a more-
or-less uniform color or brightness.
To make these tools work exactly the way you want, you need to use the Tool
Options palette (press F4 if you don’t see it). The Tool Options palette is
where, in Figure 3-1, you see Smart Edge chosen as the selection type.
You can add to or subtract from a selection with any selection tool, so you
may also find yourself switching between tools to build or carve out a selec-
tion of a particularly tricky shape.
The Selection menu on the menu bar also holds various commands for refin-
ing your selection and coping with technicalities. See the section “Modifying
Your Selection,” later in this chapter.
You may wonder why selecting gets all the attention it does in Paint Shop Pro.
The reason is that making a precise selection is the key to editing a bitmap
image cleanly. Check out Figure 3-2, which shows William’s daughter’s snow
creation, the Snowduck. (What, you didn’t recognize it? See the beak, the
eyes?) It has been selected from a photograph and then copied and pasted 
on a white background.
Figure 3-2:

42
Part I: The Basics 
The selection pasted on the right had all the black removed from it, although
a dark gray fringe remains. The figure on the left had the black color range
subtracted from it, and looks much cleaner.
Selecting by outlining: The Freehand tool
We find the Freehand tool to be one of the most useful of the selection tools,
especially in Smart Edge mode. It lets you define the area you want by outlin-
ing. It even helps you with that outlining so that you don’t have to scrutinize
every pixel you include or exclude.
On the Tools toolbar, click the lasso icon (the Freehand tool), as shown in
Figure 3-1. The Tool Options palette then looks something like the one shown
in Figure 3-3. (Press the F4 key to flash the Tool Options palette on or off if
you have misplaced it.)
The Freehand tool gives you four ways to snare a selection. From the Selection
type drop-down list, choose whichever of these methods best suits the area
you’re trying to select:
 Freehand: Drag an outline around the area you want to select. At what-
ever point you release the mouse button, Paint Shop Pro finishes the
outline with a straight line to your starting point. This method is best for
an area with a complex shape, especially if it doesn’t have a clear edge.
(If it does have a clear edge, try the Smart Edge method instead.)
 Point to Point: Click at points around the area you want to select. As you
click, the outline appears as straight line segments connecting those
points. To close the loop, double-click or right-click, and Paint Shop Pro
draws the final line segment from that point back to the starting point.
This method works well for areas with straight edges.
 Smart Edge: If the area you want to select has a noticeable edge — a
transition between light and dark, such as the edge of someone’s head
against a contrasting background — choose this type of selection. To
Figure 3-3:
Four ways
to outline
your selec-
tion with 
the lasso 
(the Free-
hand tool).

43
Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
begin, click at any point along the edge. A skinny rectangle appears, with
one end attached to the cursor. Move the cursor to another point along
the edge so that a portion of the edge is contained entirely within the
rectangle and then click. Paint Shop Pro selects along the edge. Continue
clicking along the edge in this way; Figure 3-4 shows you the result.
Double-click or right-click, and Paint Shop Pro finishes the outline with 
a straight line back to your starting point.
 Edge Seeker: This option works much like Smart Edge, except that you
can set how wide an area it searches to find an edge (called the Range,
it’s measured in pixels). As with most Paint Shop Pro elements, you can
change the Range on the Tool Options palette.
Here are a few tips for selecting with the Freehand tool:
 Aborting: You can’t abort the selection process after you begin. Instead,
right-click (or release the mouse button if you’re dragging) to finish the
loop, and then press Ctrl+D or right-click again to remove the selection.
 Undoing segments: If you’re in the middle of using Point to Point or
Smart Edge and make a mistake, you can undo segments by pressing the
Delete key on your keyboard.
 Being precise: When you’re using Smart Edge, click directly on or near
the edge as you go around the shape. (Put another way, don’t overshoot
any bends in the edge or let the edge exit the rectangle from the side of
the rectangle.)
 Smoothing edges: The Freehand tool provides anti-aliasing and feather-
ing, which, if you’re going to use them, you should set up before making
the selection. See the later sections “Feathering for More Gradual Edges”
and “Anti-Aliasing for Smoother Edges.”
 Using layers: If your image uses layers, Smart Edge normally looks for
the edge within only the active layer. If you want Smart Edge to look at
all layers combined, click to enable the Sample Merged check box.
Figure 3-4:
Alex’s coat
forms an
edge that

can detect.

Selecting a rectangle or other 
regular shape
Selecting a rectangular area is particularly useful for copying portions of an
image to paste elsewhere as a separate image. This technique is also useful
for working on portions of your image that happen to be rectangular. The
Selection tool lets you select rectangles, circles, and other predetermined
shapes.
To create a selection area, click the Selection tool (see Figure 3-5) or press
the S key, and then drag diagonally on your image. You determine the shape
you drag on the Tool Options palette, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Choose one of the many shape selections from the drop-down list. Drag diag-
onally to give your area both width and height. Here are a few tips for making
and changing your selection:
 Try again: After you define a selection, you can’t resize it by dragging
sides or corners, as you may expect. (Try it, and you drag the entire
selection instead.) Right-click anywhere to clear the shape to try again.
Or, you can simply drag a fresh shape if you begin your new drag opera-
tion anywhere outside the existing selection.

Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
 Drag: After you have selected an area, you can drag to move that por-
tion of the image and expose whatever background color or underlying
layer lies beneath your picture. Accidental dragging is very easy, but, as
with any accident, just press Ctrl+Z to undo an accidental drag.
 Modify: To move, add to, or subtract from the selection, see the section
“Modifying Your Selection,” later in this chapter.
Selecting by color or brightness: 
The Magic Wand tool
Sometimes, you want to select an area so uniform in appearance that you want
to simply tell Paint Shop Pro, “Go select that red balloon” or whatever it is.
To you, with your human perception, the area is an obvious thing of some
sort. In software, anything that even slightly mimics human perception is
often called magic. The Magic Wand selection tool is no exception. It can
identify and select areas of uniform color or brightness, somewhat as your
eye does.
One benefit of this tool is that you can select areas with complex edges that
would be a pain in the wrist to trace with the Freehand tool. For example, a
selection of blue sky that includes a complex skyline of buildings and trees
would be relatively easy to make with the Magic Wand tool.
The Magic Wand tool doesn’t, however, work as well as your eye. In particu-
lar, if the color or brightness of the area you’re trying to select isn’t uniform
or doesn’t contrast strongly with the surroundings, the selection is likely to
be spotty or incomplete or have rough edges.
Paint Shop Pro gives you lots of ways to improve an imperfect selection. See
the section “Modifying Your Selection,” later in this chapter, and particularly
the subsection “Removing specks and holes in your selection.”
Making the selection
To make a selection, select the Magic Wand from the selection tool group, 
as shown in Figure 3-6. Your cursor takes on the Magic Wand icon. Click 
the Magic Wand cursor on your image and it selects all pixels that match 
(or nearly match) the pixel you clicked.
To get the selection you want when you use the Magic Wand tool, consult the
Tool Options palette. The Tool Options palette for the Magic Wand tool looks
like the one shown in Figure 3-6. The palette lets you define (by using the

Match Mode list box) exactly what you mean by match and lets you adjust
(by adjusting the Tolerance setting) how closely the selected pixels should
match the one you clicked.
To select a contiguous area of similar pixels around the point where you click
(all of Alex, for example), make sure that Contiguous is selected on the Tool
Options palette. To select all similar pixels regardless of where they are in the
image — any Alex-colored pixel anywhere, for example — deselect the
Contiguous check box.
If your image uses layers, be sure that the active layer is the one containing
the pixels you’re trying to click with the Magic Wand. If you want the Magic
Wand tool to examine all layers combined, enable the Sample Merged check
box on the Tool Options palette. Otherwise, the Magic Wand tool selects a
totally wrong area and you wonder what’s happening!
Choosing Match mode for better results
Click the Match Mode list box and you can choose exactly how you want
Paint Shop Pro to select the pixels around the place you clicked. Some of the
choices are shown in this list:

Part I: The Basics 

 RGB Value: When you choose this option, you tell Paint Shop Pro to
“select pixels that match in both color and brightness.” Clicking a red
apple by using this choice may select only the highlighted side where
you clicked, for example. Technically, it selects all adjacent pixels with
red (R), green (G), and blue (B) primary color values that match the one
you clicked.
 Hue: You’re telling Paint Shop Pro to “select pixels that match in color”
when you choose Hue. Hue, however, is somewhat more independent of
brightness than the RGB value. Clicking a red apple with this choice is
more likely to select the entire apple than if you choose RGB Value.
Technically, this option selects all adjacent pixels with hues (in the
Hue/Saturation/Lightness color system, or color wheel) that match 
the hue of the pixel you clicked.
 Brightness: Brightness disregards color and selects all adjacent pixels
whose brightness matches the one you clicked. This choice is useful for
selecting things that are similarly illuminated, like shadows and high-
lights, or that are in a notably light or dark color compared with the
background.
 Opacity: Opacity is a measure of how transparent your image is. Opacity
mode selects anything that’s suitably close to the transparency of the
selected pixel. For example, if a layer contains brush strokes at various
opacities, Opacity lets you select strokes of a specific range of opacity.
 All Opaque: This option is a special choice for when you’re working on
an image or a layer that has transparent areas — areas of no content
whatever — usually displayed with a checkered background. All Opaque
tells Paint Shop Pro to select the area that has content around the pixel
where you clicked. For example, you may have photos of various air
freshener products on an otherwise transparent layer, artistically float-
ing over a cow pasture on the background layer. With this choice, you
can just click one of the products to select it in its entirety.
Experiment to get the mode that works best for you! Press Ctrl+D to deselect
each failed experiment, change match modes, and click again with the Magic
Wand tool.
Setting tolerance to include more or fewer pixels
The Tolerance setting on the Tool Options palette helps you determine how
much of an area is selected by the Magic Wand tool. You may have to undo
your selection by right-clicking, adjust the tolerance, and click again with 
the Magic Wand tool several times to get the best selection possible. For an
easier solution, see the discussion of expanding and filling in selections in the
following section.
47
Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image

48
Part I: The Basics 
Tolerance tells Paint Shop Pro how closely the pixels it selects should match
the pixel you clicked — in RGB value, hue, or brightness, depending on which
match mode you chose. (Tolerance doesn’t matter for All Opaque match mode.
A pixel either has content or it doesn’t.) Here’s how it works:
 Lower the tolerance value to select fewer pixels the next time you click.
 Raise the tolerance value to select more pixels the next time you click.
In Paint Shop Pro, low tolerance means that the Magic Wand tool tolerates
little variation in color or brightness from the pixel you clicked. The toler-
ance value itself has no particular meaning; it’s just a number.
The Tolerance value box on the Magic Wand tool’s Tool Options palette has 
a clever adjustment feature you find in similar boxes throughout Paint Shop
Pro. As with these types of boxes in any Windows program, you can type a
value (from 0 to 200) in its text box or click its up or down arrow to adjust 
the value. We find that the best way is to click the down arrow, or clever
adjustment feature, and hold the mouse button down. A tiny slider appears,
which you can drag left or right to set the tolerance value lower or higher.
Tolerance can be a sensitive and picky adjustment. A small change can some-
times make a big difference in what gets selected. Unless you’re trying to select
an area well differentiated by color, brightness, or content, you probably have
to adjust your selected area afterward. We tell you how to do that in the next
section.
Modifying Your Selection
If you didn’t select exactly the area you want with one of the Paint Shop 
Pro selection tools, don’t despair. You can fine-tune or completely rework
your selection in any of these ways:
 Drag the selection outline to another area of your image.
 Add to or subtract from your selection by using the selection tools.
 Expand or contract the selection’s boundary by a given number of pixels.
 Remove holes or specks in your selection.
 Edit the selection with the Paint Brush or Eraser tool.
 Grow the selection to include adjacent pixels of similar color or 
brightness.
 Select pixels of similar color or brightness anywhere in the image.
The following sections tell you how to make each one of those modifications.
Read on!

49
Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
Moving the selection outline
To move the selection outline (marquee) to another area of your image, first
click the Move tool, as shown in the margin (or press the M key). Then hold
down the right mouse button anywhere in the selection area and drag to
move the outline elsewhere.
Adding to or subtracting 
from your selection
You can use the selection tools to add to or remove from your selection. You
can add any area at all, and using any selection tool — not just the one you
used to create the selection.
Performing the addition or subtraction is as simple as, well, arithmetic —
simpler, even. Do either of the following:
 To add areas to an existing selection: Hold down the Shift key (or choose
Add [Shift] as your mode on the Tool Options palette). Then, as with any
selection tool, make a new selection outside (or overlapping) the origi-
nal selection. A + sign appears next to the tool’s cursor to remind you
that you’re adding.
 To subtract areas from an existing selection: Hold down the Ctrl key (or
choose Subtract [Ctrl] as your mode on the Tool Options palette). Then,
make a selection within (or overlapping) the original selection. A – sign
attaches itself to the selection tool’s cursor.
Here’s an example. In Figure 3-7, we originally clicked with the Magic Wand
tool on the blue clothing worn by Dave’s wife, Katy, and used Brightness for
the match mode. (We chose Brightness over Hue because the contrast in
brightness between dark blue clothing and white snow was stronger than the
uniformity of the blue.) The selection extended over to sled dog Starr’s
darker markings, however, which we didn’t want.
To remove Starr from this selection, we held down the Ctrl key and used the
Freehand tool (set to the Freehand selection type) to draw a loop around
Starr. Figure 3-7 shows you this loop nearing completion. Note the – sign near
the lasso cursor, indicating subtraction. When we released the mouse button,
Paint Shop Pro completed the loop and subtracted Starr from the selection.
We could just as easily have used the Selection tool and (with the Ctrl key
pressed) dragged an elliptical selection around Starr. In real life, Starr was
never this easy to lasso.

50
Part I: The Basics 
Expanding and contracting by pixels
Expanding or contracting a selection in Paint Shop Pro simply means adding
or removing a set of pixels around the edge of the selection area. It’s like pack-
ing snow onto a snowman or melting it away. You can expand or contract a
selection by as many snowflakes, er, pixels as you like. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Selections➪Modify➪Expand, or Selections➪Modify➪Contract.
The Expand Selection, or Contract Selection, dialog box appears.
2. Set the Number of Pixels control to however many pixels you want to
add or remove.
To examine the effect closely, zoom in by clicking the magnifying glass
icon marked with a + in the dialog box. Drag the image in the right panel
to move it around. To see the effect in your actual image, click the Proof
button (with the eye icon).
3. Click OK when you’re done.
Removing specks and holes 
in your selection
If the current selection has holes in it that you want selected or has specks of
selected areas you don’t want, you can fix it. This feature is especially useful
for selections made with the Magic Wand.

Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
This feature works in a more understandable fashion if your selection has no
feathering (see the following section).
After you have an area selected, follow these steps:
1. Choose Selections➪Modify➪Remove Specks and Holes.
You’re presented with a Remove Specks and Holes dialog box, as shown
in Figure 3-8, which shows you the selected area on the left and the
despecked or deholed area on the right. This box needs to know the
maximum size of the speck or hole to be filled in (as measured in pixels,
the smallest element of the picture that can be measured).
2. To select the Remove Specks, Remove Holes, or Remove Specks and
Holes option, click the appropriate option box.
3. In the two boxes labeled Square Area Smaller Than, enter the size
(the area in total pixels) of the largest holes or specks to be removed.
The numbers in the boxes are a bit confusing, so think of it as a multipli-
cation project: In Figure 3-8, the left number is set to 70 and the right
number is chosen to be 100. (The number on the right goes up in multi-
ples of 10.) Any speck of selection in Figure 3-8 that is smaller than 7,000
pixels is removed; any hole smaller than that is filled.
Figure 3-8:

Part I: The Basics 
4. When the picture on the right looks correct, click OK.
If you’re not sure whether all the holes and specks are fixed, zoom in by
clicking the magnifying glass icon marked with a + and move your view
by dragging on the image in the right panel. To see the selection in your
actual image, click the button with the eye icon. Change the left number
in Step 3 to fine-tune the result.
As you can see, the holes in Alex’s interior get filled in, but they’re not
expanded out along the border. The danger is that if you select too wide an
area, Paint Shop Pro may well decide that your entire selection is one huge
gap and erase it.
Editing the selection
Tired of all that adding and subtracting to get exactly the selection you want?
Wish that you could just paint the selection area? Well, here’s how:
1. Choose Selections➪Edit Selections.
The selected area turns a stimulating reddish orange. (This color, and in
fact the procedure, should be familiar if you have used “masks” in image
editing.)
2. In the Materials palette, choose white as your foreground/stroke color
and black as your background/fill color.
In the Foreground/Stroke Properties box or Background/Fill Properties
box, you can right-click to quickly choose black or white. Choosing gray
gives an intermediate degree of selection (a sort of transparency), which
may confuse the heck out of you.
3. Use the Paint Brush tool to paint the new selected area, or the Eraser
tool to remove the selected area.
4. Choose Selections➪Edit Selections to exit the editing process.
Feathering for More Gradual Edges
When you copy or modify selected areas, you may notice that the edge
between the selection and the background becomes artificially obvious. To
keep a natural-looking edge on these types of objects, use feathering in your
selection.
Feathering creates a blending zone of several pixels (however many you
choose) extending both into and out of your selection. Whatever change you
make to the selected area fades gradually within that zone, from 100 percent
at the inner edge to 0 percent at the outer edge of the zone. For example, if

53
Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
you were to increase the brightness of the selected area, that increase fades
gradually to 0 at the outer edge of the feathered zone. If you delete, copy, cut,
or move a feathered selection, you also leave a feathered edge behind.
You can apply feathering in either of two ways:
 Before making the selection: On the Tool Options palette for whatever
selection tool you’re using, set the Feather value to something greater
than zero. When you next make a selection, the feathering is applied and
the marquee’s enclosed area expands to include the outer feathered
pixels.
 After making the selection: Choose Selections➪Modify➪Feather and
the Feather Selection dialog box appears. Set the Number of Pixels value
in that dialog box to the number of pixels you want the selection feath-
ered, and then click OK. The area within the selection marquee expands.
The value you set in the Feather control tells Paint Shop Pro how wide to
make the feather zone — how many pixels to extend it into, and out of, the
selection. (A setting of 4, for example, creates a feathered zone 4 pixels into
and 4 pixels out from the edge of the selection, for a total of 8 pixels wide.) A
larger value makes a wider, more gradually feathered edge. When you feather,
the marquee expands to include the pixels that are in the feathering zone.
If feathering in all directions is too clumsy for you, you can choose to feather
the edge in one direction only, either into the interior of the selection or
feathering out beyond its borders. Choose Selections ➪Modify➪ Inside/Outside
Feather to display a dialog box that offers exactly the same pixel control of
the regular Feather control, except that you get to choose which way you
feather.
Figure 3-9 shows you the difference that feathering makes. Normally, Alex is
fairly fuzzy around the edges anyway. Feathering makes his edges even fuzzier.
From left to right, this is the same image copied without feathering, with feath-
ering in all directions, with inside-only feathering, and with outside-only
feathering.

Part I: The Basics 
When you copy or move a feathered selection, you bring along a faint 
border — feathered copies of the original background pixels surrounding 
the selection.
You can defeather your image by choosing Selections➪Modify➪Unfeather;
unfortunately, this command isn’t like the friendly Undo button, where it
magically undoes any feathering you have added. Instead, this command dis-
plays a dialog box in which you can set the threshold of how harshly you want
to strip any fuzziness from the edges of your selection; a low threshold gives
your selection a light shave, whereas a high threshold reduces your selection
to a sticklike skeleton of itself.
Because feathering a selection expands the marquee, it gives the appearance
of filling in holes in a selection (adding them entirely to the selection). It
doesn’t really add those holes entirely to the selection, however; the pixels 
in them are simply feathered. As a result, if you feather a selection that has
holes in it and then cut, delete, or move it, you leave behind faint images of
those holes. If your selection has holes, try removing specks and holes or
smoothing the selection before you feather it.
Anti-Aliasing for Smoother Edges
Because computer images are made up of tiny squares (the pixels), when a
straight edge of a selection is anything other than perfectly horizontal or ver-
tical, those squares give the edge a microscopic staircase, or sawtooth, shape
known as aliasing. Any changes you make to the selected area, or any cutting
or pasting of the selection, may make that aliasing objectionably obvious.
To avoid aliasing when you next make a selection, click to enable the Anti-alias
check box on the Tool Options palette for your selection tool. Anti-aliasing is
available for only the Freehand tools, not the Magic Wand or the Selection
tool. (You can use feathering to reduce most aliasing problems.)
The anti-aliasing option, like other settings on the Tool Options palette, applies
to only selections you make after choosing that option, not to a current selec-
tion. You can’t fix an existing aliased selection by clicking that option.
Selecting All, None, or Everything But
Sometimes, you want a selection to be an all-or-nothing proposition! To select
the entire image, press Ctrl+A or choose Selections➪Select All.

55
Chapter 3: Selecting Parts of an Image
To select none (also known as clearing the selection or deselecting), press
Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪Select None. You can also clear selections (except
when the entire image is selected) by right-clicking anywhere on the image.
Sometimes, you may want to select everything but the part of the image that
is not selected. This process is known as inverting the selection. To perform
it, choose Selections➪Invert or press Ctrl+Shift+I.
An Example: Selecting Alex, 
and Only Alex
So, you have a problem: Your dog (the one in our example is named Alex) is
sick of the snow. Sure, you could send him to a tropical paradise, but you
have decided that it’s much simpler to select him so that you can cut and
paste him into a picture of the Caribbean. Then you show him the picture 
and tell him that he was in the tropics just last week.
The genius of dogs is that they require surprisingly little evidence to believe
anything you tell them. So, how do you complete the transfer?
1. Select the Magic Wand tool from the selection tool group.
Because you’re trying to select Alex and he’s the only really brown thing
in the picture, set the Magic Wand tool options to a match mode of Color.
The easiest way to select complex shapes
Selecting everything but and then inverting is a
useful trick when you may have a complex
object on a comparatively uniform background.
Rather than spend lots of effort selecting the
object, you can more easily select the uniform
background with the Magic Wand tool and then,
by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I, invert the selection
(which selects the complex object). It doesn’t
work if the background is complex, but you
would be surprised at how much time you can
save.
However, if you do have a complex background,
you can use the Background Eraser to clear a
“moat” of transparent space around the shape
you want selected and then switch to the regu-
lar Eraser tool to remove everything outside that
moat. Then use the Magic Wand to select the
transparent space around your image and
invert it.

56
Part I: The Basics 
2. Set the tolerance of the Magic Wand.
Here’s the trick: Even we hardened professional Paint Shop Pro experts
(we’re writing a book on it, aren’t we?) are never sure what number to use
for tolerance — like everyone else, we guess.
We guess 100, which, as you can see in Figure 3-10, turns out to be way
too much. Right-click to clear the selection and try again. A little experi-
menting with the tolerance shows you that a tolerance of 25 is a solid
starting point.
3. Shift-click a few stray selections to clean up the edges.
The Magic Wand selected most of this cuddly retriever, but Alex’s ear,
the underside of his left foot, and his right rear foot are still not selected.
Those are also the areas where the color tends to vary a little more wildly,
by shifting from almost black to light green, so set the tolerance a little
higher, to 50, for example — and then Shift+click in these areas to add
those places to your selection. As you can see in Figure 3-11, that action
adds the ears and feet, and also adds unwanted portions of the door to
your selection.

4. Fill in the small gaps.
Choose Selections➪Modify➪Remove Specks and Holes and set it to 70 x
100 pixels, which automatically chooses any gap smaller than 700 pixels.
Look back at Figure 3-8 to see the clear difference; click OK.
5. Ctrl+click the door away.
Although you can create some fancy shenanigans with the Select Color
Range option to remove that pesky door, you have a simpler solution:
Because it’s all in one place, you can just Ctrl+select it away. Remember
that Shift+select adds to your existing selection, whereas Ctrl+select
subtracts it. In this case, you switch to the Freehand tool, hold down
Ctrl, and draw a ring around the door to remove it.
6. Feather the edges.
Now, the edges are crisp — too crisp, as you can see in Figure 3-12. A little
feathering makes the selection edge softer and blends it with any back-
ground in which you paste it. Choose Selections➪Modify➪ Inside/Outside
Feather and opt to feather the inside of the selection by two pixels.
Avoiding Selection Problems 
in Layered Images
Layered images can cause both the selection and the editing of those selec-
tions to go apparently screwy. The Magic Wand tool and Smart Edge features
may appear neither magic nor smart, by selecting areas not at all like what
you had in mind. Also, whatever changes you try to perform to the selected
area (such as cutting, copying, or changing color) may apparently not take
place. (If you’re not sure whether your image has layers, see Chapter 11.)
Alex before feathering:
Notice the jagged, blocky edge?

with his edges muted
Figure 3-12:
The two
sides of
Alex: pre-
and post-
feathering.

The basic trick is to work on the right layer. Here are some more detailed
rules you can follow to keep the selection and editing process relatively sane:
 Activate the right layer: Before you make any changes to a selected
area (such as fill-painting it), be sure to activate the layer you want to
change. Otherwise, you paint (or otherwise modify) whatever layer 
happens to be active at the time.
 Use Sample Merged for combined layers: Before you make a selection
with the Magic Wand tool or Smart Edge feature, if the object you’re
trying to select is the result of various layers combined, enable the
Sample Merged check box on the Tool Options palette. That way, the
Magic Wand tool or Smart Edge feature examines the combined effect,
not just the active layer. For example, if you added a party hat to Uncle
Charley’s head on a separate layer and now you want to select Charley-
with-hat by using the Smart Edge feature, you use Sample Merged.
 Consider the effect of higher layers: If the changes you try to make to a
selected area aren’t visible or seem only partially effective, a higher
opaque or transparent layer may contain pixels that are obscuring your
work. You may have to merge layers, make your changes to the higher,
obscuring layer, or rethink your use of layers altogether.
Paint Shop Pro helps keep you sane. The preview window that certain adjust-
ments provide (such as Brightness/Contrast) shows you only the area you’re
affecting: the selected part of the active layer. If the wrong layer is active, you
don’t see the area you’re expecting!
When you make a selection, it extends to all layers — no matter which one is
active at the time. Changes to selected image areas, however (like painting),
affect only the active layer. So, you can activate one layer, for example, to
make a selection with the Magic Wand tool and then switch to another layer
to make changes within that selected area.

Moving, Copying, and Reshaping
Parts of Your Image
In This Chapter
 Moving, floating, copying, or deleting a selection
 Using the Windows Clipboard
 Reshaping selections
I
n Chapter 3, we tell you how to select a chunk of your image in Paint Shop
Pro. In this chapter, you see how to move, copy, twist, and deform a selec-
tion — in short, how to do almost anything that changes the physical loca-
tion or outline of a selection. (Paint Shop Pro also lets you rotate, flip, or
mirror a selection. Just select something and follow the same directions
Chapter 2 gives for rotating, flipping, or mirroring an entire image.)
 If your image has multiple layers, make sure that you’re working on the
right layer. See Chapter 12 for help with layers.
 You can press Ctrl+Z to undo any changes you make. The changes you
can undo include selecting, floating, moving, copying, pasting, or
defloating.
 The instructions in this chapter deal only with selections to bitmap or
raster images (images made from dots, not objects like rectangles or
text). To deal with vector selections (typically, text, lines, and geometric
shapes), see Chapter 12.
Floating, Moving, and 
Deleting Selections
After you have made a selection, you can easily move it anywhere within
your image, move a copy of it, or delete it altogether. Here’s how to do it:

 To move a selection: Choose any selection tool (Selection, Freehand, 
or Magic Wand) and then drag the selection. Selection tool cursors
become 4-headed move arrows when you position them over a selec-
tion, as shown in Figure 4-1. On the Background (main) image layer,
dragging a selection in this way leaves behind background color. The
image on the left in Figure 4-1 shows you the effect.
 To float a selection (make it moveable): A floating selection simply means
a moveable one. You can float a selection in one of two ways. When you
click an existing selection with a selection tool (as the preceding bullet
describes), that selection is floated automatically. Alternatively, you can
choose Selections➪Float or press Ctrl+F. Floating a selection in that way
(manually) leaves a copy of it behind. (Note that any floating selection
also appears on the Layer palette.)
 To move a selection and leave a copy behind (as the right side of
Figure 4-1 shows you): Float the selection manually first (choose
Selections➪Float or press Ctrl+F) and then move it with the Mover tool
(the 4-headed arrow) or any selection tool.
 To defloat the floating selection (or glue it back down): To defloat a
selection, press Ctrl+Shift+F or choose Selections➪Defloat. You can also
deselect (press Ctrl+D) to defloat. The defloating command leaves the
area selected in case you want to do additional work on it. Whichever
way you defloat the image, defloating glues the image down. It’s now
part of the underlying image (or image layer), and its pixels replace
whatever was there. If you move the selection again, you find that the
original underlying pixels are no longer there.

Part I: The Basics 

 To delete the selection: Press the Delete key on your keyboard. If the
selection is on the background layer, the Paint Shop Pro background
color appears in the deleted area. If the selection is on a layer, the pixels
within the selection simply go away. (Okay, technically, they’re made
transparent — same thing.)
 To move a floating selection to another layer: Drag the Floating
Selection layer up or down on the Layer palette. (Press F8 to display the
Layer palette if it’s not showing.) Leave the selection immediately above
the layer you ultimately want the selection to join. When you defloat the
selection, it joins the closest underlying (raster) layer.
You can also flip or mirror a selection. See the section in Chapter 2 about get-
ting turned around, mirrored, or flipped for information about using the Flip
and Mirror commands. Both commands leave a copy of the original image
underlying the selection.
Cutting, Copying, and Pasting 
from the Windows Clipboard
To make lots of copies of a selection, use the conventional cut, copy, and
paste features that employ the Windows Clipboard. You can use these fea-
tures for copying selections to or from other Windows applications too
because nearly all Windows applications make use of the Clipboard.
If your image has multiple layers, first make sure that you have selected the
right layer to cut, copy, or paste the image you want. Click the layer’s name
on the Layer palette. (Press F8 if the palette isn’t visible). See Chapter 12 for
more help with layers.
Cutting and copying
In Paint Shop Pro, cut and copy work much the same as they do in any Windows
program. First, select an area in your image. Then, do any of these tasks:
 Cut a selection: Press Ctrl+X, choose Edit➪Cut, or click the familiar
Windows Cut button (scissors icon) on the Paint Shop Pro toolbar. Paint
Shop Pro places a copy of the selected area on the Windows Clipboard.
If you’re cutting on the main (Background) layer of the image, Paint Shop
Pro fills the cut area with the current background color on the color
palette. On other layers, it leaves behind transparency.
61
Chapter 4: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

 Copy a selection: Press Ctrl+C, choose Edit➪Copy, or click the Copy
button (2-documents icon) on the Paint Shop Pro toolbar. Paint Shop Pro
puts a copy of the selected area (of the active layer) on the Windows
Clipboard. Nothing happens to your image.
 Copy a merged selection from a multilayer image: The normal Edit➪
Copy command copies only from the active layer. If your image is made
up of multiple layers, you may want to copy the combined effect of all
layers. If so, choose Edit➪Copy Merged (or press Ctrl+Shift+C).
 Cut or copy from other applications: Most Windows applications offer
the same Edit➪Copy and Edit➪Cut commands, so you can place text 
or graphics on the Windows Clipboard. Paint Shop Pro enables you to
paste a wide variety of Clipboard content from other programs, such 
as text, vector graphics, or raster graphics.
Pasting
After your selection is on the Windows Clipboard, choose Edit➪Paste to
paste it into Paint Shop Pro (or nearly any other application). When you
choose Edit➪Paste in Paint Shop Pro, however, you get several different
paste options.
If you’re in the habit of using Ctrl+V for pasting in other programs, you need
to retrain yourself. In Paint Shop Pro, Ctrl+V creates a new image rather than
pastes your selection to the existing image, which is what you probably
expect to happen.
One pasting option we cover elsewhere in this book is Paste As New Vector
Selection. This command is used only for pasting text and shapes you create
by using the Paint Shop Pro Text tool and various shape tools. For more
about vectors, see Chapter 12.
For better paste jobs, see the section in Chapter 8 that gives you tips for 
natural-looking pastes.
Pasting to create a new 
picture: As New Image
The Paste As New Image option creates a new image containing the Clip-
board contents. The image is just big enough to contain whatever is on the
Clipboard. The background of the image is transparent, which means that if
your copied selection isn’t rectangular, you see transparent areas; erasing
also leaves transparency behind.
62
Part I: The Basics 

Choose Edit➪Paste➪Paste As New Image or press Ctrl+V (the nearly univer-
sal keyboard command for Paste). Your new image appears in a new window.
If you prefer your new image to have a background color or to be slightly
larger than the contents of the Clipboard, create the new image first, sepa-
rately (refer to Chapter 1). Then paste a selection or new layer rather than
use the Paste As New Image command.
Pasting on an existing image: 
As New Selection
The Paste As New Selection option pastes the Clipboard contents as a float-
ing selection on your image. This pasting option is the one most people want
for editing an image because it is the simplest and most intuitive.
If your image uses multiple layers, make sure to first activate the layer where
you want to paste (refer to Chapter 12).
Because the selection is floating, you drag the selection to move it anywhere
in the image. To defloat the selection (paste it down on the underlying layer),
press Ctrl+Shift+F or choose Selection➪Defloat. See the earlier section
“Floating, Moving, and Deleting Selections,” for details about moving and
defloating a floating selection.
Pasting for maximum flexibility: 
As New Layer
Pasting directly on another image is fine, as far as it goes. For maximum flexi-
bility in making future changes, however, paste on a new layer instead. When
an image is on a layer, you can modify it to your heart’s content without wor-
rying about surrounding or underlying image areas. (In Chapter 12, we dis-
cuss the whys and hows of layers in detail.) Here’s how:
1. If your image already has more than one layer, activate (choose) the
layer above which you want the new layer to appear.
For example, click the layer on the Layer palette to activate it. See
Chapter 12 for more details on activating layers.
2. Choose Edit➪Paste➪Paste As New Layer (or press Ctrl+L).
Your pasted image appears on a layer of its own.
63
Chapter 4: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

If the background of the image you pasted was transparent, the underlying
image layer shows through those background areas. Otherwise, the pasted
image and its background color fill an opaque rectangle. If you want to delete
the background (make it transparent), use the Magic Wand tool, or another
selection tool, to select it (refer to Chapter 12) and press the Delete key on
your keyboard. Alternatively, see the following section.
Moving or pasting without the background
color: As Transparent Selection
The most straightforward way to move or paste something (a picture of your
kid, for example) without the background is to make sure that you don’t
select the background in the first place! Refer to Chapter 3 for instructions on
making precise selections.
If, however, the background color is uniform (and this is almost never true of
a photograph — only a painting or drawing), Paste As Transparent Selection
may be faster.
This approach is the same as pasting a new selection, but any color in your
selection that matches the current background color is made transparent.
Suppose that you have painted a black dot on a white canvas. You can select
the dot with a simple rectangular selection, copy and paste it, and not worry
about pasting the surrounding white too. Follow these steps:
1. Make the background color in the Materials dialog box match the
image’s background by right-clicking the background with the drop-
per tool.
2. Select around the thing you want to copy and don’t fret about includ-
ing the background. Use a rectangular selection, if you like.
3. Choose Paste As Transparent Selection (or press Ctrl+Shift+E).
For most work, where the background is somewhat, but not entirely, uniform,
we prefer to remove the background from the selection with the Magic Wand
tool. Refer to Chapter 3 for instructions on using the Magic Wand. Select a
rough area, as described in Step 2. Then, while holding down the Ctrl key,
click the background within that rough area with the Magic Wand. Holding
down the Ctrl key removes whatever you click from the selection. Then, copy
and paste (or move), background-free, to your heart’s content.
Pasting while scaling to fit: Into Selection
If you select an area in your image, you can fit the Clipboard contents exactly
into the height and width of the selection and scale the contents up or down
64
Part I: The Basics 

as needed. This process is useful for copying the head of Person A onto the
body of Person B because rarely are their heads the same size!
Copy the image you want to paste (for example, the head of Person A from
Photo A) to the Clipboard by choosing Edit➪Copy. Then, select the area 
you want to paste into (the head of Person B in Photo B) and choose Edit➪
Paste➪Paste Into Selection. The image doesn’t fit exactly because of irregular
shapes, but you can finesse the edges with other Paint Shop Pro tools.
Resizing, Rotating, Deforming, 
and Perspective-izing
Okay, so perspective-izing isn’t a real word. Perspecting? In any event, you
can resize, rotate, deform, or move your selection by using the deformation
tool group, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Making a shape look as though it’s seen in perspective is one of the cool
kinds of deformation you can do. You can make a rectangular area, for exam-
ple, look like a wall or road receding into the distance. You can paint a rail-
road track running vertically, flat, as though it’s on a map, and then make it
lie down realistically by applying perspective.
Preparing for deformation
The deformation tools are picky: They need a separate layer (other than the
background layer) to work with. If you’re trying to deform a selection, Paint
Shop Pro asks you whether it’s okay to promote that selection to a layer.
Are you using layers? These tools work on the active layer and encompass all
nontransparent areas in that layer. In other words, if you have a blob of pixels
Figure 4-2:
The
deformation
tool group,
where
everyone
has a
skewed
perspective.
65
Chapter 4: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

on a layer, the tool encompasses (rather neatly, in our opinion) just that blob.
If you have multiple blobs separated by transparency, it encompasses all
blobs. If you want to deform just one blob, select it.
Doing the deformation
The easy and fairly intuitive way to make a deformation is by dragging vari-
ous parts of the deformation grid with the Deform tool. See “Deforming by
dragging,” coming up next.
The geeky, but precise, way to do the deformation is in the Deformation
Settings dialog box. See “Deforming by dialog box,” a bit later in this chapter.
Deforming by dragging
Select the Deform tool from the deformation tool group(if it’s grayed out, refer
to the earlier section “Preparing for deformation” for instructions), and your
cursor turns into that icon. Click your selection to get this cool-looking defor-
mation grid with tiny squares (called handles) on it, as shown in Figure 4-3.
This figure shows you what to drag for resizing, rotating, or moving the
image. Note that you can move the selection with this tool by dragging any-
where except on one of the handles. (In areas where dragging is possible, the
cursor changes to a 4-way arrow.) Here’s how to do various operations, by
using the handles of the deformation grid:
 Resizing or repositioning sides: Adjust the width and height by drag-
ging the handle in the center of any side. Drag corner handles to change
both the height and width at the same time. (The Deform tool provides
no way to automatically keep the proportions constant while you drag,
so see the following section for help.)

66
Part I: The Basics 

 Rotating: Drag the handle, marked Rotation handle in Figure 4-4, in a cir-
cular motion around the center of the grid. (When your cursor is over
the rotation handle, the cursor depicts the pair of curved arrows shown
in the figure. The center of rotation is marked by a square that is at the
face’s nose.) Only the grid rotates until you release the mouse button;
then, the selection rotates.
 Adding perspective: In the real world, the farther away an object is, the
smaller it appears to your eye. Here’s how to create that illusion with
your selection so that one end looks farther away:
• To shrink any side of the selection as though it were farther away,
first hold down the Ctrl key. With that key down, drag one of the
two corner handles that terminate the side; drag toward the center
of that side. To expand the side, drag away from the center. The
side shrinks or expands symmetrically about the center (both cor-
ners move). The perspective this distortion creates is symmetrical,
as though your eyes were level with the middle of the selection, as
the left side of Figure 4-5 shows you.
• To shrink or expand any side asymmetrically (move one corner
only), first hold down the Shift key. With that key down, drag a
corner handle toward or away from the center handle of that side.
When you apply this effect to the left or right side, as shown on the
right in Figure 4-5, the result is as though your eyes were at a level
above or below center. For example, to get the illusion of a tall
wall, drag the upper corner down.

Chapter 4: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

 Shear (or skew) distortion: We created the shear effect shown in Fig-
ure 4-6 by dragging the right side of the selection down. To drag a side of
your selection, hold down either the Ctrl or Shift key and drag the center
handle on the side you want to move.
Shear is useful for perspective when you want the virtual horizon (the vanish-
ing point, in drafting terms) to be higher or lower than dead center. Apply
perspective distortion to shrink a left or right side first, and then use the
shear effect to drag one of those sides up or down. Dragging down, for exam-
ple, makes the image appear as it would if a viewer were looking up slightly
(it lowers the horizon).

Deforming by dialog box
Dragging handles is convenient and intuitive, but not particularly precise.
What if you know that you need to rotate something 31.5 degrees, for exam-
ple? Or scale it down to 85 percent of its original dimensions?
Press F4 to bring up the Tool Options palette, and you can type the settings
you want. It provides a column for X, or horizontal values, and Y, or vertical
values, and rows for each of the various changes that the Deform tool can
make. Here’s how to choose the values you need:
 Position: To move the selection, enter the X and Y coordinates where
you want the upper-left corner of the deformation grid to go. (Remember
that X and Y both equal 0 in the upper-left corner of the image.)
 Scale: Enter X and Y scale factors. Enter 80 in the X% scale box, for
example, to reduce the horizontal size of the selection to 80 percent of
the original. To keep the original proportions, put the same value in both
the X and Y columns.
 Shear: To slide the top edge to the right, enter a positive value; enter a
negative value to move the edge the other way.
 Perspective: To make the right edge appear to recede into the distance
by pulling the upper-right corner down and inward, enter a positive
number in the Perspective X box. To make the top edge appear to
recede, do likewise in the Y box. Use negative values to make those
same edges appear to approach the viewer instead.

Deformation consternations
The Deform tool can occasionally wrinkle your
brow with certain weirdnesses. Here are a few
typical problems and their solutions:
The tool encompasses the wrong area:You prob-
ably have the wrong layer active. Here’s what
happens: If you’re on a layer that’s transparent in
the selected area, the Deform tool chooses the
nontransparent area instead. Press the F8 key to
open the Layer palette and click the layer that
contains the image you want.
You can’t find the deformation grid; you see only
two squares and a connecting line: The grid is
there, all right, but you have applied the Deform
tool to a layer or selection that covers the entire
image. Change layers or make a new selection.
An annoying background appears in the area
the selection outline has vacated: Well, Paint
Shop Pro has to put something there, and it can’t
invent a background image. (Refer to “Preparing
for deformation,” earlier in this chapter, for more
information about backgrounds.) If Paint Shop
Pro could stretch the surrounding area to stay
continuous with your newly deformed selection,
that would be nice, but it isn’t so.

 Pivot: Normally, when you rotate a selection or layer, it rotates around 
the center. If you want your image to revolve around a different point —
around the upper-left corner of the selection, for example, or even around
a point that’s outside the selection entirely — adjust the pivot values. The
numbers in the X and Y boxes vary, but unless you have changed the
pivot in the past, those numbers are the exact center of the image. Lower
X numbers move the pivot to the left, whereas higher Xs shift it right;
lower Y numbers move the pivot up, and higher numbers drop it down.
 Angle: To rotate the selection clockwise, enter a positive number of
degrees (45, for example) into the text box. Use a negative value to
rotate the selection counterclockwise.
Other handy deformities
You should know about three other tools in the deformation tool group:
 Mesh Warp: Using this tool covers your image with a grid of warp
points; you can click and drag each of these points to deform your image
in specific ways, as you can see in Figure 4-7.
In the left picture, the grid is untouched; in the right, however, we have
moved the warp points around and the image has stretched itself to fit
the new warp points. (You can control the number of warp points by
changing the Mesh Horizontal and Mesh Vertical controls on the Tool
Options palette; larger values mean more points. As usual, press F4 if
you don’t see the Tool Options palette.)

Part I: The Basics 

You can accomplish some mighty strange effects with this feature, given
time and lots of patience; the most common use is to warp an existing
image to fit on another image’s contour.
 Straighten: Did you ever spend an afternoon hanging paintings and
taking painstaking care to ensure that the bottom edges of the frames
were all perfectly parallel with the floor? This tool is an automatic 
picture adjuster. Most images are at least a little tilted when they’re
scanned, so we discuss this tool in Chapter 5, in the section about 
scanning into Paint Shop Pro.
 Perspective Correction: This tool does the reverse of the Deform tool: If
you have an image that’s already a little skewed or sheared, you can use
this tool to attempt to remove the skew or shear. Dragging the Perspective
tool around an image creates a box; you can then drag the points on the
edge of the box, just as you would with the Deform tool — but in this
case you’re trying to re-create the shear or skew that’s already present.
Align the box sides with vertical and horizontal edges in your image.
When you’re done, double-click the image and Paint Shop Pro attempts
to remove the shear. See color plate C-8 in the center of this book for an
illustration.

In this part . . .
E
ver since Kodak sold its first Brownie camera, folks
have been snapping pictures like mad — and often,
not liking them much. They’re too dim, too bright,
scratchy, speckly, or simply contain far too much Aunt
Martha. But, even Aunt Martha can get an extreme
makeover in Paint Shop Pro, even without (much to the
disappointment of certain relatives) ever going under the
knife. And, if the makeover doesn’t work, this section tells
you how to remove her altogether and get rid of that terri-
ble wallpaper behind her, too.
The problem goes beyond family snapshots. There’s noth-
ing uglier than a bad screen capture of some image or an
amateurish scan of a printed image (except perhaps for
Uncle Dave). And, of course, you need to be able to get
your digital picture into Paint Shop Pro in order to use it.
No matter if your problem is unsightly blemishes or look-
ing a bit green, you can hack your way to beauty in Part II.

here do your pictures come from? From your new digital camera?
From a piece of paper? Or, from your PC screen?
Ironically, most people don’t paint pictures in Paint Shop Pro. They get an
image from somewhere and then mess around with it. This chapter tells you
how to use Paint Shop Pro to get that image onto your hard drive. After the
image is on your computer, then you can start making your pictures prettier.
Connecting to Your Scanner or Camera
Paint Shop Pro has lots of built-in ways to transfer images from a scanner or
camera to your hard drive — but the most common methods involve a soft-
ware program called TWAIN. Much like a career bureaucrat, TWAIN doesn’t
do anything by itself; instead, it acts as an interpreter, translating your scan-
ner or camera’s language into native Windows-speak. If your camera or scan-
ner came with an installation disc, chances are good that the software it

installed is TWAIN-compliant, which means that Paint Shop Pro (a Windows
program) can use TWAIN to get images from your scanner or camera.
Another method of getting computers and cameras to talk to each other is
the Microsoft Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) method, which serves the
same function as TWAIN but isn’t quite as popular. If your scanner or camera
supports WIA, follow the instructions that came with the device for installing
and using WIA.
In this chapter, our instructions usually assume that you’re using the long-
time standard, the TWAIN software interface. However, the instructions also
give general scanning tips for everyone, regardless of what form of connec-
tion you use.
Getting Images from a Digital Camera
Digital cameras were made for family get-togethers. You can preview your
photo seconds after you have taken it and share the fun with your friends.
You can take 200 snapshots over the course of an afternoon without changing
film. And, if an unflattering photo highlights your bald spot, you can quietly
delete the evidence before anyone else sees!
The good news is that Paint Shop Pro can be a great tool for enhancing your
digital photos. First, however, you have to get the pictures off the camera and
onto your PC, which means that you need to get your PC and camera talking
to each other. They have to connect (or interface, in geekspeak) both physi-
cally and with their software.
76
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 
Getting RAW power from your camera
On certain high-end cameras, you can elect to
save your pictures in RAW format, which is a spe-
cial file type that sidesteps the automatic correc-
tions that most digital cameras make to fix photos
taken by everyday doofuses like you and us. Most
digital cameras automatically perform rudimen-
tary sharpening and color correction before
saving a file. When a camera saves an image in
RAW format, however, it does no processing to
the image. What you saw is what you get.
Professional photographers refer to RAW files as
“true digital negatives” and prefer them because
they feel that the autocorrected images are too
synthetic and artificial. If you too rage against the
machine, rejoice! Paint Shop Pro 9 can now read
RAW files. (You have to read your camera’s
manual to find out how to get your digicam to
produce them, however.)
For most people, however, regular ol’ JPEGs or
TIF files — the two formats that cameras usually
save in — are just fine. If all you want is photos of
your latest cookout, RAW is probably irrelevant.

Connecting hardware-wise
We wish that we could give you exact instructions on how to hook your
camera into your PC, but digital cameras — particularly, older ones — con-
nect in all sorts of mysterious ways. Your physical connection may be a serial
port (a connector on the back of most PCs, if a modem or something else
isn’t already using it), a parallel (printer) port, a USB port, a FireWire port, a
memory card that plugs into your computer, a floppy disk, an infrared beam,
X-rays, semaphore flags, or magical auras — who knows what the camera
people will come up with next? You have to consult your camera manual for
precise details.
However, the way most cameras connect to your computer these days is via 
a USB port — a small, rectangular socket about the size of a Chiclet held side-
ways. You simply plug one end of a USB cable into your camera’s input port
and plug the other end into the USB port, and you’re ready to go.
Some cameras save their pictures on a small chip called a flash card (or, some-
times, memory stick). If that’s the case, you need to remove the stick from your
camera and insert it into a small device called a flash card reader. You then plug
the reader into your computer.
Many cameras also require you to flip a switch or open the camera lens to
put the camera in “upload pictures” mode. Again, check your friendly manual
if simply plugging it in isn’t enough.
Connecting software-wise
You can use one of four methods to move pictures from your camera to your
PC. All but one of them (the easiest way) involves installing the camera’s inter-
face software, which comes on a disc with the camera. Most cameras use
either a TWAIN-compliant interface or a Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)
interface; Paint Shop Pro knows how to use both to transfer your pretty
images from your camera’s memory to your hard drive.
If the installation program lets you, avoid installing any freebie image soft-
ware (basically, a cheaper Paint Shop Pro) that comes with the camera. If 
you do, the installation process may assign certain image file types to that
program rather than to Paint Shop Pro. If that happens, refer to the Chapter 1
sidebar that talks about the secrets of opening a file by double-clicking, for
making Paint Shop Pro open the right file types when you double-click.
Copying pictures from mounted drives
If your camera is plug-and-play enabled (a fancy way of saying that it’s smart
enough to work with Windows automatically), Windows thinks of your camera
as nothing more than a separate hard drive. When you plug in your camera
77
Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

and turn it on, a new drive — helpfully named something like E: or F: —
appears in My Computer, as shown in Figure 5-1.
You can copy, delete, or move files on and off your digital camera just like it
were any other drive. Simply copy the files to a folder on your computer and
open them in Paint Shop Pro — or, if you like, you can even open and edit
files while they’re still on your camera!
It’s not a good idea to edit files while they’re still on your camera — not that
it does any harm. But, if you’re anything like us, you may forget that the
image you’re altering is still on your camera, and you won’t save a copy of
your carefully tweaked photograph to your hard drive. Later, when you
absent-mindedly clear your camera’s memory in order to take more pictures,
you lose everything.
Using TWAIN to transfer photos
TWAIN, which is the industry standard software that acts as a go-between to
Windows and your digicam, is used widely to translate native camera dialects
into fluent Windows-speak. If your camera isn’t plug-and-play, chances are
excellent that TWAIN can get the photos off your memory stick and onto your
hard drive.
If you want to import photos directly from Paint Shop Pro, you can some-
times use TWAIN even if your camera supports plug-and-play.

Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

If you have on your computer more than one TWAIN device (a scanner and
your camera, for example), first choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Select Source.
In the Select Source dialog box that appears, click the camera and then click
Select.
To begin the downloading process, choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Acquire.
Some form of dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 5-2, arrives on
the scene.
If you have more than one TWAIN source set up (like a scanner and a camera
on the same computer), choosing From Camera or Scanner starts up the
scanner rather than the camera. Yes, that is irritating if you use your camera
more than your scanner.
If that’s the case, choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Select Source to access your
camera; a small dialog box appears that shows you all your TWAIN-compliant
devices. Click the one that has a name something like your camera model
(ours was Olympus Digital Vision 3.0 33-32) and click OK. Then, choose File➪
Import➪TWAIN➪Acquire to start your camera’s download.
Alas, we can’t tell you exactly how this happens because the interface that
downloads the pictures is unique to each camera. Fortunately, most of them
are similar; they present a selection of thumbnails or preview images that
you can flip through in some manner.
If you don’t see a set of thumbnail images, you may need to hunt for a Get
Previews button or menu option.

Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

You see buttons or menu options that allow you to accomplish these
common camera tasks:
 Download photos — the whole enchilada: Look for a Download All,
Save All, or perhaps (as in our Olympus example) Select All command
before you can click the Download button. Downloading means that your
photos go directly to your PC’s disk drive, as files. You don’t see them in
Paint Shop Pro. You then can open them in Paint Shop Pro by choosing
File➪Open, as you can any other image file (refer to Chapter 1).
 Download selected images — the ones where your child isn’t sticking
out his tongue: Browse through the thumbnails (which are sometimes also
called previews), which you can generally do by clicking the left and right
arrows under the thumbnail image or scrolling up and down. The expo-
sure number, date, and time appear next to the image in some cameras,
and others may have an Information or Details button to display details.
When you come to a desirable photo that you want to download to your
PC, click the image you like and then look for a Save to Disk or Download
button or something similar. (You can select multiple images by holding
down Ctrl while you click.) You then can open them in Paint Shop Pro by
choosing File➪Open.
 Erase the images where your child is sticking out his tongue: Browse
through the thumbnails and find the offending images. Click that image
and first try pressing Delete, and then look for a Delete, Erase, or Trash
button. Clicking this button removes the image from your camera.
 Open a particular image in Paint Shop Pro: Browse through the thumb-
nails (as the preceding bullets describe) to that image. Click the image
and then look for an Open button. You can also open all images in Paint
Shop Pro if you select them all and then press Open. That choice may
use so much memory, however, that Paint Shop Pro becomes sluggish.
To save an open image to disk, refer to the instructions for saving a file
in Chapter 1.
For most makes of digital cameras, downloading images doesn’t delete them
from the camera. Erasing images, however, generally does wipe them from
the camera, which you want to do to clear out space for future photos.
Retrieving pictures with WIA
WIA serves the same function as TWAIN, but was never as popular. However,
some digital cameras only use WIA, so Paint Shop Pro supports it.
In Paint Shop Pro, choose File➪Import➪From Scanner or Camera to open
camera files by using the WIA method. Depending on your camera’s make,
the program either shows you the photos as though they resided on a hard
drive (in which case you would follow the instructions in the earlier section
“Copying pictures from mounted drives”) or presents you with some sort of
preview interface (in which case events are similar to what happens in the
earlier section “Using TWAIN to transfer photos”).
80
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Your last resort: The camera’s native software
If all else fails, it may be that your camera is either very old or very cranky,
and it allows you to snarf photos off it only via its custom-written interface
software. In that case, Paint Shop Pro can’t get the images for you; read your
camera’s manual’s for the directions. Sorry ’bout that. You can still save the
image from that software to your hard drive by using its File➪Save command;
then open the file in Paint Shop Pro.
Making E-Mail-Ready Photos
William’s family means well. About twice a month, they send him pictures of
his niece, Amanda. Unfortunately, the pictures are the size of billboards and
take about an hour-and-a-half to download, which prevents him from doing
anything else while he waits for the new picture to arrive.
He loves Amanda, but it’s not worth waiting 90 minutes just to see a picture
of her.
81
Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen
EXIF, stage left
Once upon a time, taking a photo was an
intensely complicated process: You had to be
able to set a camera’s F-stops, whatever those
were, read lighting exposures, and, um, snorkel
the defibrillating valve. If any of those cryptic
settings was set wrong, your pictures of Aunt
Flo may have developed as blurry brown
smears.
Fortunately, today’s digital cameras handle those
fine details automatically. Normally, this is a good
thing — but sometimes you want to know why
one picture looks fantastic and another photo,
taken seconds later, looks as though it were
taken from behind the glass of an uncleaned
aquarium tank. The difference is usually because,
for some reason, the camera quietly changed one
of its many settings.
If you want to study differences in camera set-
tings to find out what sorts of F-stops and focal
lengths create the clearest pictures, you can find
out by examining the image’s EXIF (Exchangeable
Image File) data. EXIF data is saved as part of a
JPEG file on most cameras, and it contains all the
camera’s settings at the time the photo was
taken.
One other part of EXIF files is handy, even if you
don’t give a darn about metering patterns: It
stores the date and time the photo was taken
and can contain optional extras, such as the
artist’s name, the artist’s comments, and the
make of the camera that took it. Some photo
albums use EXIF data to help sort through thou-
sands of stored pictures; for example, you can
search through keywords stored in the EXIF
comments to find a specific photo, even if you
don’t know the name of the file.
You can edit some parts of a JPEG’s EXIF infor-
mation by choosing Image➪Image Information
and selecting the EXIF Information tab. The
editable bits are marked with asterisks.

Chances are, your friends feel the same about your pictures: They want to
see your little bubbeleh, but they want to see her quickly. Unfortunately,
scanners and digital photos, left to their own devices, give you the biggest,
the most detailed, and, above all the largest files they can possibly produce.
On the Internet, large files mean large download times — and long waits.
Shrinking Photo Download Times
Your friends never tell you that they hate waiting four hours for a picture of
your newborn; they just force a smile and say “Those humongous photos
were lovely.” Be proactive and take these steps to condense your photos —
and save your friendship!
1. Crop the photo so that it shows you only the important parts.
If Amanda is on the right side of the picture, there’s no sense in showing
everyone the wallpaper in the left half of the room. Cropping is ridicu-
lously easy, and we show you how to do it in Chapter 2.
2. Reduce the physical size of the photo.
Most digital cameras produce photos roughly the size of this page; the
smaller the photo, the quicker it downloads. Again, this information is in
Chapter 2.
3. Reduce the quality of the image.
It sounds horrible: Our darling Amanda, in a low-grade image? — but the
fact is that most images can have their quality reduced by 10 or 20 per-
cent without anyone noticing a thing — and it saves lots of download
time. We show you how to compress photos in Chapter 15.
Scanning into Paint Shop Pro
With digital cameras so cheap these days, you may wonder why anyone
would use a scanner. After all, putting a photo on a flatbed and going through
the hassle of aligning it properly is much more trouble than simply clicking
Download in your camera’s software program. Why would you bother?
For one thing, digital cameras are still a recent development. Chances are
good that you have a drawer full of old, paper photos that you want to send
to your friends. Or, maybe you have a magazine cover that you want to share
with the world. Other scanning candidates are line drawings, original art-
work, and documents that you have only in paper form. If that’s the case,
your only option is a scanner.
82
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Many people are surprised to discover that scanning is a fairly involved
process. Getting an image from paper isn’t quite as simple as putting an
image on paper — unless quality isn’t all that important.
If your PC is equipped with more than one TWAIN-based image-acquiring
device (scanners or cameras, for example), you need to tell Paint Shop Pro
which one you’re using before going through the following steps. Choose
File➪Import➪Twain➪Select Source. The Select Source dialog box appears.
Select your scanner (source) and then click Select.
In most instances, these steps scan an image from a properly installed scan-
ner that has a TWAIN interface (although your scanning software may differ):
1. Launch the scanning software that came with your scanner.
To do that, choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Acquire. (If your scanner uses
WIA, choose File➪Import➪Scanner or Camera.)
Or, press the Scan button on your scanner, if it has one.
Some special software designed to run your scanner should appear, and
Paint Shop Pro enters into a special TWAIN mode. (If the software doesn’t
appear, read the literature that came with your scanner and check to
make sure that your scanner is properly installed.) Because that software
depends on the scanner manufacturer, we can’t tell you many details
about it. We give you some tips, however, in the following section.
Figure 5-3 shows you the software that appears if, for example, you’re
using a Canon Multipass.
Figure 5-3:

Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

2. Find and click the Preview button.
In Figure 5-3, for example, the Preview button is in the Preview window.
If you don’t find a button labeled Preview, look for a similar word. The
scanner starts to scan and then shows you a small preview image, as
shown in the Preview window in the figure. This preview image shows
you the entire scanning area of the scanner (the glass area in a flatbed
scanner).
3. Define the area you want to scan.
In most scanner software, you create a rectangle in the Preview area to
define the area you want to scan. (Drag from one corner of the part you
want to the opposite corner.) Usually, you can then drag this rectangle
to adjust its position or drag its sides or corners to adjust its size. If you
don’t define the scan area in this way, you may end up with an enormous
image (your scanner’s entire field of view) that you have to crop (trim)
to the area you want. (Chapter 2 shows you how to crop a photo after
it’s in Paint Shop Pro — a vital skill that everyone should know.)
Most scanner software allows you to enlarge (zoom in on) the preview
image. Look for a magnifying glass icon, click it, and then click the
image.
4. Adjust settings that control the resolution or number of colors or that
improve the appearance of the preview picture.
Scanner software often offers important features and controls, including
whether you want color or black-and-white scanning. In the ScanWizard
software shown in Figure 5-3, the controls are in the right window. We
describe these and other useful controls in the following section.
5. Find and click the Scan button.
If you can’t find a Scan button, look for a Start or Begin button. Figure 5-3
shows you a Scan button under the Preview button. The scanner begins
to scan again. (It may take longer or shorter than it did in Step 2.)
After the scanner is done, an image appears in Paint Shop Pro. You can
now close the scanner software window or continue to scan more
images (starting with Step 2). Each image gets its own window in Paint
Shop Pro.
6. When you’re done scanning, close the TWAIN session.
If you’re using TWAIN software to run your scanner, as we suspect, Paint
Shop Pro will have put you into a special TWAIN-handling session where
you can save files but not edit them. To return to “normal” mode, choose
File➪End TWAIN Session. You return to Paint Shop Pro, where your
scanned images are waiting for you.
84
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Getting the most from your 
scanning software
Whatever software your PC uses to control your scanner, it undoubtedly
offers certain settings to play with. For casual scanning of images that don’t
have problems (such as underexposure), you can often ignore lots of those
settings and do all your fiddling in Paint Shop Pro. Sometimes, however, the
controls in your scanner software can improve your image in ways that Paint
Shop Pro alone can’t — especially with moiré problems that occur when you
scan newspaper photos. (Although Paint Shop Pro has an adjustment that
removes moiré patterns, it’s not nearly as effective as fixing it at the source.
See “Forever plaid: Scanning printed images,” later in this chapter, for more
about moiré.)
You can usually adjust these settings after you do the preview. Except for res-
olution and color settings, the preview image reflects the changes without
running your scanner again.
Choosing the number of colors
To achieve the best quality possible with color photographs (and other
images that have either many colors or gradual, subtle shadings), you want
the maximum number of colors the scanner can produce. Usually, this maxi-
mum is expressed as 24-bit or 32-bit color. If your PC has disk space for the
large files this produces, scanning at this number of colors is best even if
your final application requires fewer colors.
Here are some scanner settings you may find, labeled Type or Color Depth in
the scanner software, that usually work well for the following uses:
 Business or highest-quality personal use: Choose 16 million colors (24-
or 32-bit). (You can then color-reduce these images in Paint Shop Pro for
faster downloading in Web or e-mail applications; see Chapter 15.)
 Casual family or business Web page illustrations or snapshots to be
sent by e-mail: Choose 256-color if it’s available, although it’s not always
offered as a scanner option. Use 16 million colors if the 256-color option
isn’t available.
 Black-and-white photos, pencil drawings and sketches, or line draw-
ings with lines of varying weight: Choose 256 shades of gray, or some-
times Newsprint. Scanners typically scan these types of image by
looking for one particular color. If your drawing is all in one color of
pencil, such as green, it may not appear! Check your scanner manual for
notes on scanning grayscale (black-and-white) images or line drawings,
or avoid red, blue, or green pencils.
85
Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

 Clear, original printed text with good contrast or line drawings in
dark ink or with thick lines: Choose two colors (1-bit), or line art, if it’s
available; otherwise, choose 256 shades of gray. If you have a line draw-
ing with uneven line darkness, you can sometimes turn it into good line
art by adjusting either the Line Art Threshold or Highlight/Midtone/
Shadow settings. See the section “Setting contrast and other adjust-
ments,” later in this chapter, for more information about the latter setting.
Choosing resolution
Resolution is the number of dots (or samples) per inch that your scanner
reads from the paper image. Your scanning software has a control for 
resolution.
Higher resolution means that you get more detail — more pixels — which is
generally A Good Thing. For example, if you scan a 4-inch x 6-inch snapshot
at 300 dots per inch (dpi), you get an image of 4 × 300 (1200) pixels high and
6 × 300 pixels (1800) wide. (That’s even more pixels than most PC screens can
show at the same time.) You can always make a picture lower in resolution
(reduce its size in pixels) in Paint Shop Pro, if necessary, but you can’t add
detail that isn’t there in the first place.
Higher resolution also poses some problems. First, high resolution means
bigger files! If you’re just scanning a photo to e-mail to someone or to put on
the Web, the people viewing your photo won’t appreciate the long wait for a
large photo to download — especially if it’s bigger than their screen! You can
reduce a photo in Paint Shop Pro, of course, but why bother if you don’t need
to? Besides, sometimes the shrinking process (also called resampling) doesn’t
give quite as good a result as if you had chosen the lower resolution in the
first place.
To judge which resolution to use, answer these questions:
 “How big an image do I need?” For most Web and e-mail work, an
image 300 to 400 pixels on a side is plenty. Multiply the width or height
of the region you’re scanning (6 inches wide, for example) by the scan-
ner resolution you’re thinking of using (300 dpi, for example) to figure
out the resulting width or height in pixels (1800 pixels wide, in this
example). Select a lower resolution to get a smaller image in pixels.
 “How big a file do I want?” Scanning a 4-inch x 6-inch color snapshot at
300 dpi (and 24-bit color) can give you a file as large as 6 megabytes.
Cutting the resolution in half can reduce the file size by as much as a
factor of four.
 “How finely detailed does the image need to be?” With the setting at
300 dpi, you can begin to see an individual human hair placed in your
scanner.

Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

You probably won’t see any changes you make to the resolution in your pre-
view image . To see the effect of resolution settings, you have to scan an
image into Paint Shop Pro (click the Scan button in your scanner software).
Setting contrast and other adjustments
Some other adjustments that are available in your scanner software can make
an enormous difference in the quality of your image. Fiddle with these after
you have clicked the Preview button in your scanner software so that you
have a preview image to look at as you make your adjustments. You may 
have to poke around to find a button or command (usually Advanced or More
Options) that reveals these adjustments, or even discover that your software
doesn’t offer them.
Many adjustments that scanning software offers are technical. We don’t have
room to fully do them justice here, but you probably don’t need them
anyway. We describe here a few of the important ones you may find:
 Brightness: Brightness makes all areas darker or lighter to the same
degree.
 Contrast: The Contrast adjustment makes dark areas darker and light
areas lighter.
 Exposure: Increasing the Exposure setting makes dark pixels dispropor-
tionately darker and brings out detail in the light areas.
 Shadow/Midtone/Highlight: The Shadow and Highlight values are also
called the black and white points, respectively. Sometimes they’re
unnamed and appear as sliding arrows under a histogram chart. These
three settings are something like Contrast and Exposure, but more pre-
cise, which make an image’s dark areas darker and its light areas lighter.
The settings also bring out detail in the middle ranges of darkness and
adjust a too-dark or too-light image to a more pleasing appearance. Each
setting ranges from 0 to 255 (the numeric values correspond to bright-
ness: 0 is black and 255 is white). The choices are shown in this list:
• Shadow: To make the darker areas as dark as possible, adjust the
Shadow value upward. All pixels below that value become as dark
as you can make them without radically changing any colors.
• Highlight: To make light areas as light as possible, adjust the
Highlight value downward. All pixels above that value become as
light as possible without radically changing their colors.
• Midtone: If the rest of the image is, overall, kind of dark, adjust the
Midtone value downward; if the image is light, set the value higher.
87
Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

 Descreen: Some software has special descreen capabilities, which 
means that they can minimize the moiré patterns that arise when you
scan printed images. Generally, the software offers several settings that
depend on whether you’re scanning from a newspaper, magazine, or
higher-quality printed source, like a book. (You probably have to scan 
to see the result of descreening — it’s unlikely that you can see it in the
preview.)
 Unsharp Mask: Try this feature (it often lurks in an area named Filter or
something similar) if your photo doesn’t look quite as sharp as it should.
Without making the image sharper, this feature gives the illusion of sharp-
ness. It raises the contrast around edges (where the pixel values change).
Unsharp masking usually has four settings:
• Strength: Adjusts the degree of contrast enhancement (sharpness).
• Radius: Determines how far from an edge the effect extends.
• Clipping: Sets a limit, below which an edge isn’t enhanced. A set-
ting that’s too low may make the image speckly.
• Luminance Only: Sometimes, unsharp masking may mix up the
colors and produce strange new hues that have no place in your
image. If that’s the case, set the Unsharp Mask to Luminance Only,
which means that it changes only the black-and-white bits and
leaves the colors alone. Although this option sounds horrible,
often it produces a much clearer picture.
(The numbers used in these settings have no intuitive meaning, so don’t
look for one. Just adjust them up or down.)
If you forget to use Unsharp Mask while scanning, you can use the Paint Shop
Pro Unsharp Mask effect after scanning. Choose Adjust➪Sharpness➪Unsharp
Mask and the Unsharp Mask dialog box appears. Make the same adjustments
listed in the last bullet in the preceding list. Figure 5-4 shows you the Unsharp
Mask effect, as shown on a picture of one of the authors as a young Gene
Simmons.
Many scanner programs offer check boxes to turn on automatic features 
(typically auto contrast and auto color correction). These features attempt 
to adjust various settings for you, based on the preview scan. Sometimes
they work well and sometimes they don’t. Try enabling and disabling their
check boxes to see the result in the Preview area.
You can find an excellent, detailed guide to using the features of scanning
software — in fact, to using your scanner in general — on the Web at www.
scantips.com.

Forever plaid: Scanning printed images
When you scan a printed image from a newspaper, magazine, or book, your
image often acquires a blurry checkered plaid or barred pattern. This pat-
tern, called a moiré (“mwah-RAY”) pattern, is caused by conflict between the
dots used to print your image and the dots that happen during scanning.
The next time you put your window screens up or down, you can see this
same effect if you look through two screens at the same time. Or, if you have
a screen porch, stand outside and look through the two screens where they
meet at a corner.

Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen
Dots not nice!
Why do scans of printed images get moiré pat-
terns? Unlike photographic prints and painted
or drawn artwork, printed images are made up
of ink dots of varying sizes at a certain spacing.
This effect wouldn’t be a problem, except that
your scanner also uses dots — and they’re of a
different size and spacing.
Your scanner reads the image by sampling it
(looking at tiny spots on the image) at some
spacing (your chosen resolution in dots per
inch). The samples don’t align exactly on the
printed dots, except every 10 or 20 pixels, for
example; the rest of the time, they align partly
on the dots and partly on the white background.
The usual result is a checkered or barred pat-
terning on the image. Something similar can
happen when Paint Shop Pro displays the
image on your PC screen, which also uses dots.

The moiré pattern may exist only on your PC screen in Paint Shop Pro and
not in your image file, as Figure 5-5 illustrates. In this figure, the zoom of 1:3
(noted on the title bar) is responsible. Try viewing the image at full scale
(press Ctrl+Alt+N) or larger. If the pattern disappears, the pattern is just the
effect of using a zoom of less than 1:1. Don’t worry about it. When the image
is printed at a high printer resolution or used on the Web at full size, that pat-
tern probably doesn’t appear. If the pattern is still visible at a 1:1 zoom, it’s
permanent and you need to do something about it.
Permanent moiré pattern problems? Try these solutions:
 Higher resolution: The pattern may fade if you set the resolution of
your scanner’s software (the dots-per-inch value) higher.
 Descreening: If your scanner software provides descreening, use this
option. See the section “Setting contrast and other adjustments,” earlier
in this chapter, for more information.
 Special filter: Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪Moiré Pattern
Removal (see Chapter 6).
Printed images pose more problems than just moiré patterns. Although the
images appear to have a wide variety of tones, printed images are composed
of alternating dots of primary colors (black-and-white photos have only two
colors, for example). When these images are scanned (particularly at high
resolution), they retain that spotty, dotty character. Zoom in to see them.
As a result, Paint Shop Pro features that use color selection and replacement
don’t work as your eye would lead you to expect. An area that looks uni-
formly green, for example, may be made up of blue and yellow dots. You can’t
select that green area of your scanned-in logo, for example, because it’s not
really green! This problem gets worse at higher resolutions.
Figure 5-5:

Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

To partially solve this problem, you can apply the Paint Shop Pro blur adjust-
ment (see Chapter 8) to make the dots blur together. If you have problems
selecting a colored area with the Magic Wand tool (refer to Chapter 3), try
increasing the Tolerance setting in the Tool Options dialog box.
Straightening crooked scans
Lining up your photos neatly across the bottom of most scanners is a pain —
and even then you normally don’t get it quite right, which leads to a tilted pic-
ture of your sweet snookielumps. Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro has a useful
tool that straightens your pictures for you.
Here’s how to get your pictures to straighten up and fly right:
1. Select the Straighten tool from the deformation tool group, as shown
in Figure 5-6.
2. Find a horizontal line in your crooked picture that should be level,
but isn’t.
In Figure 5-7, which we show you momentarily, that line is the top edge
of the photo. In other images that don’t have easily accessible photo
edges to work with, try looking for flat horizons (oceans disappearing
against the sky are usually a good bet), pictures, benches, kitchen coun-
ters, or windows.
Figure 5-6:
The
Straighten
tool, hidden
among the

tool group.
91
Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

This tilted straight line is your way of telling the Straighten tool, “If you
rotate the image until this line is perfectly level, the image will be fixed.”
So choose it carefully!
If your image has no horizontal lines that you can use but it does have
vertical ones, you can use the Straighten tool on a vertical line as well.
Paint Shop Pro notices that your baseline is vertical, not horizontal, and
instead rotates your image so that the baseline is perfectly north-to-
south.
3. Position the Straighten line so that it’s next to your baseline.
A straightening line, complete with a handle on each end, appears 
in your picture. Move your mouse over it until the cursor becomes 
a four-headed arrow with a line over it, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Click and drag the Straighten line to the tilted line you have chosen to
use as a baseline.
4. Click and drag the handles on each end of the Straighten Line until
both of them are on the tilted line you have chosen.
When you’re finished, the Straighten tool should be lying along the edge
of your baseline.
If you want to have your image automatically cropped to snip out the
blank spaces around the edge of the picture after it has been straight-
ened, check the Crop Image box on the Tool Options palette (press F4 if
you don’t see the palette).

Straighten
line, and a

92
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Double-click your image to straighten it (and crop it, if you have 
chosen to).
5. Make sure that it’s straight!
For the picture shown in Figure 5-7, we chose to use the top edge of the
photo as a baseline for straightening . . . and we were wrong. As you can
see in Figure 5-8, we have adjusted the image so that the photo is level,
but the photo itself was taken at an angle (as though it weren’t embar-
rassing enough)! On the right side of the figure, William is on the level —
a feat he would not manage to duplicate until years later.
Press Ctrl+Z to undo any changes. Note that when we went back and
straightened the image again using the top line of the television set as 
a baseline, it came out much better.
Capturing Images from Your PC Screen
There it is, onscreen: the exact image you need. But it’s in some other pro-
gram, not Paint Shop Pro. You figure that there must be some way to get it
into Paint Shop Pro — after all, it’s already in your computer.
You’re right. Paint Shop Pro has several different ways to capture that image.
When an image appears in a window on your PC, it comes with all kinds of
other stuff that is part of the program displaying the image: toolbars, status
bars, a title bar, and a sushi bar, for example. Maybe you want that stuff, and
maybe you don’t. Paint Shop Pro helps you capture only the part of the

window you really want: It’s most likely an image, but if (like us) you’re illus-
trating software, you may want to see just a toolbar from the program
window or where a mouse cursor is pointing. For all these captures, use the
Paint Shop Pro capture features, on the Capture menu.
Preparing to capture
To set your snare, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Screen Capture➪Setup from the menu bar.
The Capture Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-9, comes to your aid.
From left to right in the figure, you can see that you have three kinds of
choices: what you want to capture, how you want to trigger (activate)
the snare, and a couple of options (Include Cursor or Multiple Captures).
2. Choose what to capture.
Paint Shop Pro can capture five different species of Windows wildebeest.
In the Capture Setup dialog box, choose one of the possibilities listed in
Column 1 of Table 5-1.

Type of Capture
What It Does
Client area
Captures everything in a window except the title bar.
Window
Captures the application window you specify (don’t use

Object
Captures an application window, a document window, or
any individual feature in a window, like a toolbar — a
useful catchall category that works for toolbars, menu
bars, scroll bars, palettes, and sometimes portions of
those objects.
3. Choose your trigger.
You must choose a trigger, which is an action (such as pressing a particu-
lar key) that you take, after setup finishes, to tell Paint Shop Pro to start
capturing images. Without a trigger, the capture would start immedi-
ately. All you would ever capture is Paint Shop Pro itself! In the Capture
Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 5-9), you can see that you have three
choices for triggering the capture. Select one of these options:
• Right mouse click: A right mouse click begins the capture.
• Hot key: From the Hot Key selection box, choose a key to serve as
a trigger. You can choose any of the function keys, F1 through F12,
alone or in combination with Shift, Alt, or Ctrl. F10 is initially
chosen for you.
• Delay timer: Select this option and then enter a delay time (in sec-
onds) in the Delay Timer box.
4. Choose options.
Paint Shop Pro gives you two options:
• Capture multiple images: If you plan to capture a series of
onscreen images, select the Multiple Captures check box in the
Capture Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 5-9). You then can simply
snap a series of images without returning to Paint Shop Pro each
time. If you’re creating a tutorial for using some software, for exam-
ple, you can set up Paint Shop Pro and then easily capture a screen
for each step.
• Include mouse cursor in capture: You may want to show the
mouse cursor in your screen captures to point out some feature. If
so, select the Include Cursor check box in the Capture Setup dialog
box (refer to Figure 5-9).
95
Chapter 5: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

Using the Include Cursor option may not work if you’re only capturing an
object. You need to use your cursor to select the object and place the cursor
somewhere other than where you want it in the picture. If you’re capturing a
client area or window, you have to be sure that your cursor is within the cap-
tured area.
Making the capture
After you’re set up to capture from the PC screen in Paint Shop Pro, you’re
ready to make the capture. To capture an image, follow these steps:
1. Click the Capture Now button in the Capture Setup dialog box.
The Capture Now command starts the capture process. (Or, you can
press Shift+C.) Paint Shop Pro discreetly shrinks to a button on the
taskbar to get out of your way.
2. Make any last-minute changes to the thing you want to capture.
You have a final opportunity to adjust the appearance of the screen area
that contains the image — before you trigger the capture. If you have
chosen the option of capturing the mouse cursor, position the cursor now.
3. Trigger the capture (or wait for the timer to trigger it).
Depending on the kind of trigger you chose (refer to Step 3 in the pre-
ceding section), either right-click with your mouse, press the hot key
(F10, for example), or wait for the time interval to elapse.
If you’re capturing a full screen, Paint Shop Pro restores itself to full
window size now. You’re done and can skip the following steps.
Otherwise, Paint Shop Pro waits for you to choose your capture area.
4. Choose the capture area (unless you’re capturing the full screen).
How you choose the capture area depends on what kind of capture you
have chosen, as shown in Table 5-2.
After you choose the capture area, the capture occurs instantly. Paint
Shop Pro immediately restores itself to its original window size (unless
you have chosen the multiple capture option) and displays the capture
as a new image.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 if you have chosen the multiple capture option.
Paint Shop Pro acquires each capture as a separate image. You don’t see
them because Paint Shop Pro remains minimized as a button on the
taskbar. To restore Paint Shop Pro, click its button on the Windows
taskbar.

For better and easier captures, read and heed these tips:
 Set up your screen the way you want it to look before you enable the
trigger (before you press the Capture Now button or press Shift+P). If
you try to make adjustments after you set the trigger, you may acciden-
tally trigger the capture.
 To enhance colors — for those captured colors that come out fairly
accurate, but faded, murky, or otherwise less than satisfactory — see
Chapter 7.
 If you’re capturing an image from your Web browser, use the browser’s
Save As or Copy command rather than the Paint Shop Pro screen cap-
ture. To save an image as a file in Internet Explorer, for example, right-
click the image and choose Save Picture As.

C
ommon wisdom states that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but
common wisdom is wrong. Beauty is in the lens of your camera —
because when you have broken photos, nobody looks good. Your cousin
Freddy may be a heartthrob, but if your photos of him are scratched and his
eyes are glowing a dim red, who can tell the difference between Freddy-your-
cousin and Freddy-the-stalker from Nightmare on Elm Street?
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro has many tools to fix common photo mistakes.
The problems that Paint Shop Pro is good at fixing are shown in this list:
 Scratch removal
 Red-eye removal
 Tinted photos
 Blurry areas
 Grainy photos
 Moiré patterns
 JPEG artifacts

Note that this chapter is dedicated to fixing broken photographs — pictures
where something is obviously very wrong. If you have an otherwise-
unremarkable image and you want to make it look better, that’s easily done.
But, you have to find out how in Chapters 7 and 8.
If your image has a color depth of fewer than 16.7 million colors, Paint Shop
Pro needs to increase the number of colors in your image before you can use
any of these tools and adjustments; if you’re tired of it always asking you
whether it’s okay to increase the colors, see Chapter 16.
Removing Scratches
Photographic scratches usually fall into one of two categories:
 Individual scratches that arise from creased photos or scratches on the
negative
 Masses of tiny scratches that arise from a photo being stored in a drawer
for a long time, where it has been rattling around with dusty pencil shav-
ings and spare screws.
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro is adept at handling either type of scratch. (Then
again, if it weren’t, we probably wouldn’t be writing this section.)
Patching up single scratches
Having photos come back from the developer with a scratch is heartbreaking.
Usually, it means that a scratch is on the negative, so making a new print can’t
help. Equally traumatic is having a valued print creased, torn, or scratched
when you don’t have a negative and can’t replace the print. Thankfully, Paint
Shop Pro has an answer for all your folds, creases, and scratches. After you
scan the picture into Paint Shop Pro (refer to Chapter 5), here’s what to do:
1. Zoom in on your scratched area so that it fills the screen.
Select the magnifying-glass icon from the pan and zoom tool group and
zoom in; refer to Chapter 1 for details.
2. Click the Scratch Remover tool from the clone tool group, as shown in
Figure 6-1.
This tool is the trowel-looking icon shown in the margin.
100
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

3. Position your mouse cursor at one end of the scratch and drag along
the scratch.
As you drag, a frame area stretches to follow your mouse cursor and
extends across the width of the scratch, as shown in Figure 6-2.
4. Release your mouse button at the end of the scratch.
If you’re following a curved or irregular scratch, release your mouse
button at the point where the curve can no longer fit within the frame.
(Later, you can go back and remove remaining segments of the scratch.)
When you release the mouse button, the Scratch Remover tool picks up
paint from either side of the scratch and pushes it into the scratch. If
you had to stop short of the end of the scratch, drag a second time to
cover the remaining portion.

Chapter 6: Fixing Broken Pictures

That’s it! You now have a slightly fuzzy band where the scratch was, but it’s
probably much better than a scratch.
If the scratch wasn’t completely filled in, you may need to repeat your action
for another segment of scratch or adjust some tool options and try again. For
irregular scratches, remove the scratch in sections. To adjust options, first
undo any failed attempt (press Ctrl+Z). Next, open the Tool Options palette
(press F4 to toggle the window on or off). Follow one of these methods:
 If the scratch didn’t fill in because the scratch was wider than the tool’s
frame: A value box on the Tool Options palette allows you to adjust the
Scratch Remover’s width in pixels. Increase the value in that box and
again try to remove the scratch. With tool settings larger than 20, the
frame exhibits an inner and outer zone as you drag. As you drag, make
sure that the scratch fits in the inner zone and that the outer zone is com-
pletely filled with the bordering colors you want to use for filling in.
 If you end up with an unacceptably wide, fuzzy band where the scratch
was: The tool’s width was set too high. Lower the width value on the Tool
Options palette.
 If the end points of the scratch didn’t properly fill in: An outline option
gives you an alternative shape to drag; one that has pointed ends rather
than square ones. That shape is good for clicking in tight spaces or cor-
ners. Click that alternative shape button and then try scratch removal
again.
If the scratch runs along an edge in the image, use the smallest width possible
to avoid blurring that edge. For example, in Figure 6-2, the scratch grazes
Dave’s shoulder, where his shirt ends and the trees begin. The scratch remover
blurs that edge. Rather than remove the entire irregular scratch in one broad
attempt, he may do better to remove that shoulder-grazing portion of the
scratch separately, with the width value set very low. If all else fails, use the
Clone Brush tool, as shown in Chapter 8.
Smoothing masses of scratches
Some photos or their negatives can get pretty seriously abused, picking up
tiny scratches, pits, or other imperfections while being handled, while living
in suitcases or sandy beach bags, or while being badly processed. Hey, who
wouldn’t get a little abraded under those circumstances?
Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪Automatic Small Scratch Removal to
display the Automatic Small Scratch Removal dialog box. You can see its
effects on your screen, as shown in Figure 6-3.
102
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

If only a part of your picture is scratched, you can use the selection tool
group to restrict the Scratch Removal tool to a limited area. For further selec-
tion details, see Chapter 3.
First, determine whether your scratches are light or dark or both. Next,
select Remove Light Scratches, Remove Dark Scratches, or both. If the pre-
view image on the right side isn’t already adequately cleaned up, change the
Strength setting from Normal to Aggressive. If the effect is removing things
that aren’t scratches or making your photo too fuzzy, try changing Strength
to Mild. (A necessary side effect of cleaning up scratches with this effect is a
bit of added fuzziness, so you can’t be too picky.) If the effect is removing too
many tiny features, try adjusting the Local Contrast Limits option. To restore
low-contrast features, drag the pointer at the left end of the line to the right.
To restore high-contrast features, drag the pointer at the right end of the line
to the left.
If the result is still too fuzzy, check out the section “Removing Noise from
Grainy Shots,” later in this chapter, for alternative methods, like the Salt-and-
Pepper filter.
The Red-Eye Remover
In our youth, we longed for something to remove the telltale morning red eye
that bespoke a long, hard night out. Regrettably, Paint Shop Pro doesn’t
remove that kind of red eye, where the blood vessels in the whites of your
eyes throb reproachingly.

Chapter 6: Fixing Broken Pictures

The Paint Shop Pro red-eye remover does, however, fix the evil red glow that
sometimes appears in photographs and emanates from the pupils of the eye
as the result of a camera’s flash. In animals, that glow may not be red, but,
rather, yellow or other colors.
The red-eye remover in Paint Shop Pro is a red-eye replacer. Rather than
attempt to restore the original pupil of the eye, Paint Shop Pro says “The
heck with it!” and paints a whole new pupil, complete with the glint of the
flash bulb. In fact, the red eye remover can even construct a new iris (the 
colored portion of your eye) if the camera’s flash has obliterated it!
Reconstructing the pupil
Usually, red eye affects only the pupil. If it has affected the iris in your photo,
see the section “Replacing pupil and iris,” later in this chapter. Here’s how to
get rid of red eye if the flash hasn’t affected the iris area:
1. Choose Adjust➪Photo Fix➪Red Eye Removal.
The amazingly complex-looking Red Eye Removal dialog box appears.
Figure 6-4 gives you the picture.
2. Zoom in close on one of the red eyes, in the preview windows.
To zoom in, click the button displaying a magnifying glass with a + sign,
underneath the left window. Repeat until the eye practically fills the 
windows.
To move the photo around behind the window, drag in the right (not left)
window. Your cursor displays a hand icon when it’s over the right window.

If you’re working on an animal, choose Auto Animal Eye.

Or, if you have changed your mind and decided that the red really does
afflict the iris, see the section “Replacing pupil and iris,” later in this
chapter.
5. Click once on the dead center of the (red) pupil of the eye in the left
window.
A circle appears, with a dot in the center and a square frame surround-
ing the circle. The circle has handles on it (tiny squares you can drag).
Figure 6-4 shows this tool.
You want the circle to just cover the red pupil and be centered over it.
6. Adjust the circle’s position or size if the circle doesn’t cover the red
pupil.
You can drag the circle by the dot in its center. To resize the circle, drag
one of the handles on the box surrounding the circle.
7. Looking at the right window, adjust the Refine control left and right
until the red is just covered by a dark spot (the new pupil).
The Refine control determines to what extent the new pupil covers the
red. When you’re done, little or no red should be showing. For precise
control of Refine, click the slider and press the left- and right-arrow keys
on your keyboard to decrement or increment the slider. The new pupil
should be no larger than the original and shouldn’t cover the eyelid. If
you can’t achieve a result you like, return to Step 5 and resize the circle.
8. Adjust the Pupil Lightness value box to set the lightness of your new
pupil to your liking.
Decrease the value for a darker pupil. For a normal appearance, the
pupil should be darker than the iris.
9. Check the new, white glint in the right window against the original in
the left window.
If the new glint isn’t roughly the same size as the original, adjust the
Glint Size control up or down until they match. Feel free, however, to
make the new glint any size you like, including removing it altogether 
by setting the glint size to zero. If you prefer the glint in the center of 
the eye, click to enable the Center Glint check box. Otherwise, the glint
tracks the original one. Adjust the Glint Lightness control up or down 
to match the brightness of the original glint. If the new glint has a notice-
ably sharper edge than the old, adjust the Blur control upward.
105
Chapter 6: Fixing Broken Pictures

10. Increase the Feather control to get a softer edge or to mute any
remaining red spots around the edge.
Alternatively, if the original photo is a bit blurry, try adjusting the Blur
control upward instead. Fool around with these two controls until the
edges look properly blended into the rest of the eye.
11. Click the Proof button (with the unlocked eye icon) to check your
results in the main image window.
(Drag the Red Eye Removal dialog box out of the way, if necessary; don’t
close it yet.)
Return to any earlier steps that seem necessary to adjust size, darkness,
coverage, glint, and so on.
If you decide that you need to give up and start again, click the Delete
Eye button. If you want to return all the settings to their original posi-
tions, click the Reset button in the upper-right corner.
If you can’t get acceptable coverage of the pupil, click the Cancel button
and see the following section.
12. Click OK.
When you’re done with one eye, repeat those steps for the other eye. When
you proof your work in Step 10, make sure that the eyes match!
Outlining problem pupils
As you undoubtedly remember from school, some pupils are troublemakers.
They don’t cooperate if you try to doctor their red eye. In that case, change
from using automatic red-eye removal to manual outlining.
Open the Red Eye Removal dialog box and zoom in as directed in Steps 1 and
2 in the preceding section. Rather than choose Auto Human (or Auto Animal)
Eye in Step 3, which tells Paint Shop Pro to automatically outline the red area,
choose one of these two manual outlining options:
 Freehand Pupil Outline: Choose this option if you prefer to drag a con-
tinuous line around the red area to outline it. (This technique requires 
a steady hand, but can give a more rounded outline.) When you release
the mouse button, Paint Shop Pro connects the line’s end with its 
beginning.
 Point-to-Point Pupil Outline: Choose this option if you prefer to click a
series of points around the red area. Paint Shop Pro draws a straight line
between the points. When you’re ready to complete the circle, don’t
click the starting point again. Instead, double-click somewhere short 
of that point. Paint Shop Pro completes the circle for you.
106
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Drag or click an outline, according to your choice of options. After you out-
line the pupil, resume with Step 7 in the steps in the preceding section to
refine the red-eye correction.
Replacing pupil and iris
If the flash has affected the colored iris of the eye, first follow Steps 1 through
4 in the steps in the section “Reconstructing the pupil,” earlier in this chap-
ter. (In those steps, you open the Red Eye Removal dialog box, zoom in on an
eye, and click in its center.)
Then, after Step 3, follow these steps:
1. Enlarge the circle in the left window to cover an area equal to the iris
(not just the pupil) you need.
Drag any corner handle of the square frame surrounding the circle to
enlarge the circle. Often, the circle needs to overlap the top eyelid and
possibly a bit of the bottom.
2. Adjust the value in the Iris Size value box up or down, a little at a
time, until the iris and pupil size either matches the other eye or
simply looks correct.
Click the tiny up arrow or down arrow adjoining the Iris Size value box
to change the value by one.
3. Click the Hue selection box and choose an iris color from the list.
Choose from Aqua, Blue, Brown, Grey, Green, or Violet.
4. Click the down arrow to the right of the Color sample box and choose
a precise shade of color from the gallery that appears.
5. Adjust the Refine control left or right to set the shape and extent of
the iris.
The optimal setting of the Refine control occurs when the iris doesn’t
significantly overlap an eyelid and is reasonably round elsewhere. A
black spot with a white glint should cover the pupil of the eye.
Resume with Step 8 in the earlier section “Reconstructing the pupil.” From
here, you adjust the darkness of the pupil, set any feathering or blurring you
need, and adjust the glint size, if necessary.
Color-Correcting Photos
Sometimes, you take a photo and the entire thing is tinted with a color that
wasn’t there when you took the picture. The white drapes look a milky green,
107
Chapter 6: Fixing Broken Pictures

the yellow sunflowers are a bright emerald, and your family now possesses
an alien skin tone that makes them look like they’re auditioning for The 
X-Files.
Would you recognize the correct color of that skin if you saw it? If so, you
have an easy way to correct the color of your photo: the Paint Shop Pro
Manual Color Correction effect.
Note that the Manual Color Correction effect adjusts the color of the entire
image so that your selected object (skin or fur, for example) is then the cor-
rect color. It presumes that every object in your photograph was shot in the
same terrible light. If it gets your selected portion of the image correct, the
entire image is then correct.
As with any other Adjustment tool, you can select a part of the image and
then color-correct only that area. So, if you want to keep your family a sickly
green while making the sunflowers yellow again, you can. Refer to Chapter 3
for details.
Ready? Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Manual Color Correction to give this
targeted tool its instructions. The Manual Color Correction dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 6-5. (Refer to the color section of this book to see
the difference in colors.)
1. Click the Preset Colors radio button and choose a likely-sounding cat-
egory from the menu that matches some portion of your object, like
Skintones or Hair.
Figure 6-5:
Correcting

108
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

2. Click and drag in the left preview window to select a small swatch in
your image that matches the menu selection.
In this case, we have selected Skintones and have selected a tiny box of
skin on Katy’s cheek. We could also have selected Hair and selected her
bangs, if we had wanted.
Drag diagonally to define a rectangular area. For example, drag across
the forehead of your subject, to create a rectangle that surrounds a fairly
uniform skin color, if you intend to match the person’s skin tone to a
color. Choose an area that isn’t strongly affected by highlights or shad-
ows. Drag again if you want to change your selection.
If the area you want to define is irregular in shape, enable the Freehand
Selection check box. Then, drag (draw) the irregular shape you want to
use on the left window.
Use the zoom, drag, and locating features in the dialog box (see the sec-
tion in Chapter 7 about understanding the Paint Shop Pro dialog boxes)
to get to the right place in the left preview window, if necessary.
3. Click the down arrow to the right of the colored box next to the
Preset Target Color radio button.
A gallery of color appears.
4. Choose a color from the gallery that is what that swatch should look
like.
If you can’t find the color you want, click the Manual Target Color button
and then click in the Target box to choose a color from the Paint Shop
Pro Color dialog box. See Chapter 9 for the details of using this dialog
box.
Paint Shop Pro then alters the image in the right preview window, to match
the hue of your selected area to the hue of the color you chose in Step 4.
“But,” you may say, “the color doesn’t match exactly.” Don’t panic. Unless
you have previously fiddled with the check boxes in the Options section of
the Manual Color Correction dialog box, the color shouldn’t match exactly —
yet. The Preserve Lightness and Preserve Saturation check boxes, which are
initially selected, cause your photo’s color to be corrected only to the hue (a
kind of fundamental color) of the color you have selected, and not to its satu-
ration or lightness. If you want to make the color match your chosen sample
exactly, you must clear both check boxes. However, you may find that you get
good results more easily by leaving both check boxes selected and choosing
different colors.
Bringing Your Photo into Focus
Paint Shop Pro offers three ways to clarify a blurry photo — though none of
them is a complete fix for a bad shot. Remember that Paint Shop Pro can
109
Chapter 6: Fixing Broken Pictures

work with only the information you have given it, and although it can make
some educated guesses about what a picture should look like, there are limits
to its power. If your picture looks like a patch of white fog, all the sharpening
in the world won’t turn it back into the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
That said, Paint Shop Pro does a bang-up job of fixing photos that are slightly
out of focus. You can deblurrify a picture with two methods: sharpening and
edge enhancing.
How do sharpening and edge enhancing compare? The Enhance effect is
more dramatic, by focusing directly on even the tiniest edge, as shown in
Figure 6-6. The Sharpen adjustment makes a subtler (and usually more effec-
tive) change that influences a range of pixels around the edges of items in
your photo.
Sharpening your snapshots
Sharpening is the first method you should try for fixing blurry photos, mainly
because it’s the most effective. To give it the old college try, choose Adjust➪
Sharpness and then choose one of these options from the menu that appears:
 Sharpen: Does a little bit of metaphorical grinding and filing on the vari-
ous edges of your photo, by boosting the contrast at those edges. No
dialog box appears — your image simply gets sharper.
 Sharpen More: The same as Sharpen, but more so.
Figure 6-6:

right is
sharpened;

enhanced.

is William’s
godchild
Andy, and

110
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

 Unsharp Mask: Sharpens like its two siblings (Sharpen and Sharpen
More), but operates incognito, like the Lone Ranger. No, just kidding. It
wears not a mask, but rather an adjustment dialog box. To use this box’s
controls, refer to Chapter 5, where we discuss unsharp masking for set-
ting contrast and other adjustments in scanning software.
As with all these other photo fixers, you can apply them to a selected area.
Refer to Chapter 3 for details.
Edge enhancing
The Paint Shop Pro Enhance Edge effect is a close cousin to its sharpening
effect. Both find adjoining pixels that contrast in lightness (an edge) and then
make the contrast stronger by darkening or lightening those pixels. The pixels
gradually move toward fully saturated primary colors, plus white and black.
Choose Effects➪Edge Effects➪Enhance or its more powerful sibling, Enhance
More. Neither uses an adjustment box, but just immediately does its thing.
Removing Noise from Grainy Shots
Removing noise from an image sounds a bit illogical, like subtracting apples
from oranges or removing odor from a TV program. Okay, you can perhaps
imagine ways to do the latter, but apply that same imagination to how your
TV looks when you run a vacuum cleaner: The screen is covered with speck-
les. That’s graphical noise: pixels altered at random locations and in random
colors.
The trick with removing speckles is to avoid removing freckles or other
speckly stuff that’s supposed to be in the picture. (Unless, of course, you
want to get rid of the freckles!) For that reason, Paint Shop Pro offers several
choices, depending on what you need. Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise
and then one of these menu selections:
 Despeckle: Removes smaller, isolated speckles altogether and is good
for removing a light coating of dust. Speckles that are closer to each
other tend to form clumps, however.
 Edge-Preserving Smooth: Gives an effect like rubbing carefully within
the shaded areas of a pastel drawing, using your finger. Speckles disap-
pear into a uniform shade, and you keep the sharp edges of those larger
areas. This effect is also good for removing the random discoloration of
pixels that often results from shooting digital photos in low light. In the
adjustment dialog box that appears, drag the Number of Steps slider to
the right to make a smoother image.
111
Chapter 6: Fixing Broken Pictures

The Edge-Preserving Smooth effect, turned up high, creates a nice oil-
painting-like effect on photos! See Color Plate C-11 in the color insert in
this book.
 Median Filter: Removes speckles by removing fine detail, a kind of blur-
ring process in which each pixel is recalculated to be the average of its
neighbors. Contrast is lost at the detail level. An adjustment dialog box
appears in which you drag the Filter Aperture slider to the right to
remove increasingly large details.
 Salt-and-Pepper Filter: Removes speckles of a particular size (or up to a
particular size) you choose. A Salt-and-Pepper Filter adjustment dialog
box appears, with these adjustments:
Speck Size: Adjust this value to match or slightly exceed the size
of the speckles you’re trying to get rid of. (You may have to zoom
in close to figure out how big your speckles are.)
Sensitivity to Specks: If the right preview window shows clusters
of specks remaining, increase this value. Too high a value blurs
your photo.
Include All Lower Speck Sizes: Enable this check box to remove
specks of Speck Size and smaller. Otherwise, you just remove
specks close to Speck Size.
Aggressive Action: Enable this check box to remove specks 
more completely. Otherwise, you may simply reduce the specks’
intensity.
 Texture-Preserving Smooth: Sounds like a sophisticated grade of
peanut butter, but in reality blurs and reduces the contrast of tiny
specks while preserving the larger variations that give texture to grass,
wood, water, and the like. The result is sort of like a crunchy peanut
butter without small, gritty chunks. An adjustment dialog box appears in
which you adjust the Amount of Correction value upward to minimize
specks.
You can always select an area by using the Paint Shop Pro selection tools, to
add or remove noise from only that specific area (refer to Chapter 3).
Don’t Want No Moiré
Scanned-in photos from print media (books, magazines, newsletters, and PC-
printed images, for example) often have moiré patterns. (Refer to Chapter 5
for more information about moiré and ways to avoid it in the first place.)
You can fix moiré patterns by choosing Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪Moiré
Pattern Removal. The rather simple Moire Pattern Removal dialog box
arrives, to do your bidding.
112
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

The Moire Pattern Removal dialog box offers two controls: Fine Details and
Remove Bands. Adjusting Fine Details upward (sliding it to the right) blurs
your image and removes fine, grainy moiré patterning. Adjusting Remove
Bands upward counters the distracting bands that often are part of moiré
patterning.
Unearthing JPEG Artifacts
When photos are stored in JPEG format, as they often are, the result is nice,
small files. But JPEGs that have been heavily compressed to save space often
exhibit strange patterns and checkerboard patterns around text and other
objects with sharp edges. Figure 6-7 shows those patterns, also called artifacts.
Compressing JPEG files is normally something you should do — done cor-
rectly, it squeezes the file size down to as much as 10 percent of its original
size without noticeable image degradation. To find out how to compress a
JPEG file effectively, see Chapter 15.
To clean up JPEG images, choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪JPEG Artifact
Removal. The JPEG Artifact Removal expert appears on your doorstep, in the
form of the dialog box shown in the figure.
After checking your image by either looking in the right preview window or
proofing your choice, choose the strength (Low, Normal, High, or Maximum)
needed to clean up your artifacts. Another casualty in JPEG files is a certain
amount of detail, which you can restore by increasing the value in the
Crispness value box.

W
hen William does his own laundry — which, thankfully, isn’t often —
the colors in his clothing all run together. Pure white socks become a
dull gray, bright red shirts lighten to a washed-out pink, and we don’t discuss
what happens to his underwear.
But, if you hadn’t seen the way William’s shirts looked originally, you may 
not realize that anything was wrong. You may think that his shirt was supposed
to be an ugly pink and that he had chosen to wear gray socks. Eventually,
William’s wife, Gini, would sigh and do his laundry for him, at which point you
would be amazed at how much better William looks when someone compe-
tent cleans him up.
Photos are much like William in that their colors are usually a little off by
default. Although some photos are obviously miscolored, like being too
bright or too murky, almost all pictures benefit visibly from a good color
adjustment. With very little effort, you can make the colors in your picture
“pop” and turn an ordinary photo into a portrait-quality image.
The secrets to brightening your family’s dirty laundry lie within Paint Shop
Pro. Be warned that not all remedies are intuitive. The remedy for what you
may call a brightness problem, for example, may turn out to be something
called lightness, or both lightness and contrast.

116
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 
Some photographs are tinted a specific hue, where everything is a shade of
sea blue. If that’s the case, we consider the photo to be almost unusable,
which is why we show you how to fix that image in Chapter 6, in the section
about color-correcting photos, which deals with fixing broken photos. After
you have chased the blues away, come on back to see how to improve it even
further.
The One Step Photo Fix
If you’re in a hurry and don’t want to read the rest of this chapter, here’s some
good news: You don’t have to! Paint Shop Pro has a one-click solution that
solves many common color problems, and it’s called the One Step Photo Fix.
On the Photo toolbar, at the top, you should see a drop-down menu that says
Enhance Photo; select it and choose One Step Photo Fix. (If for some reason
you don’t see it, choose View➪Toolbars➪Photo.) Paint Shop Pro then adjusts
your picture’s color, sharpens the image, fixes the contrast and clarifies it,
does an Edge-Preserving Smooth for good measure, and then tops off your
gas tank. (Okay, we’re just kidding about that last one.)
Be warned, however, that the One Step Photo Fix isn’t a universal solution.
For one thing, it doesn’t fix photographs that have obvious flaws, like red eye
and scratches. (To fix those problems, refer to Chapter 6.) Also, sometimes
pictures have specific problem areas, like underexposed shadowy places
underneath a tree or a single wall that’s too bright. To spot-fix problems like
that, you need to use the Backlighting and Fill Flash tools, as shown later in
this chapter.
Lastly, much like baking store-bought chocolate chip cookie dough, the One
Step Photo Fix isn’t quite as good as doing it by hand — it tends to err on the
light side, which creates slightly washed-out photos. But, if you’re pressed for
time, it can be a lifesaver.
If you don’t like the results of the Photo Fix, read on! Sometimes, you just
have to roll up your sleeves and get a little dirty to create the vibrant picture
that your friends deserve to see.
Understanding the Paint 
Shop Pro Dialog Boxes
All the dialog boxes for color adjustments have similar controls, and some-
times they can be confusing. So, it can’t hurt to walk you through it first. The

Brightness/Contrast dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-1, provides an example.
Note that the slider shown in the figure appears only when you click and hold
down the mouse button on the larger down arrow at the far right end of a
value box.
Making color adjustments
You have several ways to adjust settings in the dialog boxes:
 In adjusting value boxes, you may type a value, click the associated up
and down arrows, click in the value box, and press the up- and down-
arrow keys on the keyboard or click and hold the larger down arrow to
the right of the box and drag the slider that appears.
 Some adjustments appear as sliders: Drag sliders to the left or right or
up or down. Dragging varies an associated value (number) that appears
in a text box to the right of each slider. Dragging left or down reduces
that value, and dragging right or up increases it. Alternatively, click a
slider and then press the up- and down-arrow keys on the keyboard to
increase or decrease its value by one.
 To give precise values, double-click in the box where the value appears
and type a new value.

Chapter 7: Adjusting Your Picture’s Brightness, Contrast, and Color

 To take a chance and see what happens, click the Randomize Parameters
button. Your new settings are chosen at random.
 To reset adjustments to their original (default) levels, click the Reset to
Default button (refer to Figure 7-1).
After you make an adjustment, click OK to apply it to your image. Before you
apply it, however, use the proofing or previewing tools that we describe in
the following section.
Changes are rarely final in Paint Shop Pro because you can undo them by
pressing Ctrl+Z or clicking the History palette (see Chapter 18).
Proofing or previewing your adjustments
All the color adjustment dialog boxes let you see the effect of your adjust-
ments in the main image window, a feature called proofing. The change isn’t
permanent until you click the OK button. If you cancel out of the dialog box,
the change doesn’t occur. You have two ways to proof:
 Click the Proof button, the one with the eye icon, after every adjustment.
 If you find yourself clicking the Proof button too often, try using Auto
Proof. Click the Auto Proof button, the creepy eyeball with a padlock, 
as shown in Figure 7-1. Paint Shop Pro now shows the effect of your
changes in the main image window every time you make a change. 
For large images, however, you may find this proofing method slow.
The dialog boxes for commands on the Adjust menu also have preview win-
dows that let you see the effect of your adjustments without the long wait
that proofing sometimes entails. Here’s how to preview your changes:
 To zoom in or out within the preview windows, click the Zoom In button
(marked with a +) or Zoom Out button (with a –), as shown in Figure 7-1.
 To move the image in the preview window so that you can see a new
area, drag the image in either window.
 To quickly move to a new area of the image, click the Navigate button, as
shown in Figure 7-1, and keep the mouse button depressed. A small ver-
sion of the entire image is displayed, with a rectangle representing the
preview area. Drag the rectangle to the area you want to preview and
then release the mouse button.
Like most Paint Shop Pro effects, every color adjustment we cover in this
chapter can be applied to a specific area within an image, which allows you 
118
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

to lighten a darkened entryway or make Uncle Vania’s shirt color more vibrant.
Here are a few points to keep in mind about that phenomenon:
 If you have made a selection, only the selected area is affected by your
adjustments. For a complete rundown on the selection process, check
out Chapter 3.
 If you’re using multiple layers in your image, commands on the Adjust
menu affect only the selected layer.
 If you’re using multiple layers in your image, consider using an adjust-
ment layer so that you can affect color across multiple layers.
 If a feature doesn’t appear to be working, check to see whether you have
selected an area or have made a particular layer active. If you have, the
tool is working only within that selection, or layer, and not necessarily in
the area you’re trying to change. Read all about selections and layers in
Part III.
Correcting Trouble Spots
Quite often, the problem with a picture is that only part of it is wrong, particu-
larly in outside snapshots, when bright sunlight comes into play. A picture
taken entirely in sunshine isn’t a problem — although when you have some
people sitting in the shade and others standing in the sunshine, digital cam-
eras have to choose between one of the two lighting styles.
Your camera may decide to optimize for the people standing in the sun — in
which case the sun people look normal and the folks in the shade are lost in
shadow. Or, your camera may highlight the people in the shade, in which
case the folks standing in the sun look overly white and washed out.
If this happens, Paint Shop Pro has two tools to correct these common
errors: the Backlighting Filter and the Fill Flash Filter.
Despite the fact that the Fill Flash Filter and the Backlighting Filter do largely
opposite things, nothing is stopping you from using both of them on the same
image. That trick works better than you may think.
Shedding light on shadows
Technically speaking, when a picture has an area that’s too murky to see
because it didn’t get enough light, that phenomenon is called underexposure.
To correct the underexposed segments of your photo, choose Adjust➪Photo
Fix➪Fill Flash. The Fill Flash Filter dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
119
Chapter 7: Adjusting Your Picture’s Brightness, Contrast, and Color

The Fill Flash filter attempts to re-create your image as though it had been
taken with a stronger flash bulb. Appropriately, it has one setting: Strength. 
A larger strength setting means that the shadowy portions of your picture are
more visible, although it has a hidden cost: The rest of your image is bright-
ened, sometimes resulting in artificially bright colors outside the underex-
posed area.
You can select a specific area of your image — in Figure 7-2, the garage inte-
rior would be a good bet — and have the Fill Flash filter apply its artificial
flashbulb to only that portion of your picture. For details on how to select the
right parts, refer to Chapter 3.
Preview your image with the Proof button. If everything looks all right, 
click OK.
Reducing glare and overexposure
Sometimes, a flash reflects off a white wall and pours too much light into 
the room. When that happens, not only is everyone way paler than they need
to be, but you also have pools of glare (also known as ugly white smears)
everywhere.
To help you compensate for this lighting overload, Paint Shop Pro offers the
Backlighting Filter, as shown in Figure 7-3. The Backlighting Filter attempts to
even out the amount of light in the photo and usually darkens it.
Like the Fill Flash Filter, the Backlighting Filter has one setting: Strength. Higher
strength values reduce the glare and also make your image darker and more
shadowed. Experiment to find the value that works for you, and then click OK.
Figure 7-2:

120
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

If someone’s skin has glare spots so white that they don’t even show up as
skin colored, the best the Backlighting Filter can do is make that skin an
unhealthy charcoal gray. In that case, you may want to use the Smudge Tool
or the Clone Brush to copy a healthy skin color into the glare spot. Chapter 8
shows you how.
Correcting Lighting Color
Despite automatic flashes, lighting is still one of the prime photographic prob-
lems. Your flash fails to go off, the room is lit by incandescent or fluorescent
light, the sunset casts an orange light, the forest reflects green, or the swim-
ming pool reflects blue. Many of these problems go away almost magically
with the Paint Shop Pro Automatic Color Balance effect.
Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Automatic Color Balance. The Automatic
Color Balance dialog box makes the scene (refer to Figure 7-1).
Adjust the slider left or right in the grandiosely named Illuminant Temperature
area, or edit the value in the Temperature text box. Dragging the slider left (to
a lower Temperature value) makes the color of your photo visually warmer,
or more orange. (Yes, lower temperature makes color warmer.) Dragging right
makes the color visually cooler, or bluer. Notice that the Temperature scale is
labeled with various light sources, such as Sunlight; position the slider at a
given label to simulate that light source.
Adjust the Strength value higher for greater effect — generally, a brighter pic-
ture. Adjust it down for the opposite effect.

Chapter 7: Adjusting Your Picture’s Brightness, Contrast, and Color

You want to check the Remove Color Cast option whenever a picture is pre-
dominantly one color — for example, when both your wife and the back
porch are tinged ever-so-slightly with green. Paint Shop Pro then analyzes 
the image to try to find what the dominant color is and then attempts to 
mute that color to bring out the other hues.
This feature works well for subtle color changes — but, if your spouse is as
blue as a Smurf, you’re better off using the Manual Color Correction tool, as
described in Chapter 6, in the section about color-correcting photos.
The temperature thing is about the illumination term color temperature,
which refers to the temperature of an incandescent light source. A lower-
temperature light source generally gives a warmer (more orange) light. You
can see the effect in a fireplace or barbecue; as the fire dies down, it gives off
a more orange glow.
Bringing Your Picture’s Colors to Life
One problem in showing you how to improve your colors is that unless
you’re a professional photographer, most of the photos you enhance don’t
look that bad to start with. Most people don’t look at the images on their digi-
tal camera and mutter, “Wow, this picture could use more saturation and
increased coloration in the midtones.” But, after you have laundered your
image’s colors, you may be surprised at how much better your pictures look.
To help you understand the problem, the color section of this book has
before-and-after pictures taken of William’s wife, Gini. Go ahead and look.
Notice how the preenhanced picture of Gini isn’t notably awful — you would
probably just shrug if someone showed it to you — but the enhanced image
is much more vibrant and alive.
That’s how you want your photos to look.
Sadly, that’s not as simple as saying “Fix the colors.” Color is a catchall term
that describes the three elements of luminance and shade that combine to
create a color’s “look:”
 Hue: Hue is the base shade of color, the element that differentiates one
color from another. Hue is the core setting that makes something blue or
red or turquoise.
Paradoxically, hue isn’t that important in the scheme of things. Hue con-
trols only the base color of an object in your image; it doesn’t account for
the two other color-related elements that stack on top of it. Put another
122
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

way, although the essential hue can be “red,” adding more brightness can
turn that hue into light pink and subtracting saturation can turn it into a
murky red.
You almost never fiddle with hues because you usually don’t want to
change the core colors. You want to make your hues brighter or more
vivid or have them stand out more. Change the hue and you risk turning
your sister’s lovely brown skin into an ugly fuschia with the exact
shades and tones as the old color.
 Brightness: Brightness is a measure of how light your colors are,
independent of their actual hue. A basic blue hue with lots of brightness
may be a sky blue, whereas that same blue with low levels of brightness
may become a dark navy. Taken to its logical limits, a 100 percent bright
image is pure white, whereas an image with no light is jet black.
Adding more brightness makes a picture lighter; subtracting brightness
makes it darker. You want to change the brightness in your images a lot.
 Saturation: Technically, saturation measures the amount of gray in a
color. (Yes, most colors have some gray in them.) Realistically speaking,
saturation measures how pure a color is; high levels of saturation mean
that very little gray is mixed in. (An image with no saturation, inciden-
tally, is a black-and-white photo — all grays, no colors.)
Hues with too much saturation look artificial and garish, like an Andy
Warhol painting. On the other hand, hues with too little saturation are
muddied and indistinct.
Most digital photographs suffer from too little saturation, incidentally.
Reducing the saturation levels can make your image pop!
In addition, color has a secret fourth element. This element doesn’t define 
a specific color; instead, it looks at all the colors in your image as a whole.
Contrast measures the range of lights and darks that exist in the colors in your
photo. A high-contrast image has lots of high- and low-brightness colors, with
little in between, which makes it look kind of like the image shown in Figure 7-4.
A low-contrast image, on the other hand, has colors that are almost entirely
composed of the same brightness. This sounds good, but you need contrast
to be able to distinguish things — witness what happens in Figure 7-5.
Quite often, changing the contrast of your image makes things more visible
and sharper.
Where do you start? Well, here’s a guilty confession: Even though we’re big-
shot authors of Dummies books, quite often we can’t pinpoint the exact prob-
lem with our family snapshots. Usually, the problem gets solved via a quick
adjustment of contrast and saturation — but, sometimes we have to go delv-
ing through pretty much all the items listed in this chapter before our photos
are changed to our satisfaction. Don’t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and
muck around until everything’s picture perfect!

Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Tweaking contrast and brightness
We have been trying for years to be brighter, and now Paint Shop Pro has
shown us the light. Just what is brightness, though? If you increase the bright-
ness of an image, it looks whiter. This whitening affects all shades uniformly,
sort of like using bleach in mixed laundry: Lights get whiter, and so do darks.
Because brightness alone rarely does the job, Jasc puts the Paint Shop Pro
adjustments for brightness and contrast together. Contrast is a bit like a laun-
dry brightener that makes the lights lighter and the darks darker. (It isn’t too
picky about keeping your colors exactly right, though.)
Although Paint Shop Pro offers several ways to adjust contrast, for photos, the
Automatic Contrast Enhancement effect is a great place to start. It simultane-
ously fiddles with brightness and contrast — two interlinked attributes — to
optimize your photo’s appearance. Whether your photo has too little contrast
or too much, this tool can help.
Choose Adjust➪Automatic Contrast Enhancement and the Automatic Contrast
Enhancement control, as shown in Figure 7-6, rushes to your aid. This effect
has three control areas: Bias (or lightness), Strength (amount of effect), and
Appearance (amount of contrast).
In the figure, a photo we took of a cardinal (through a window) suffers from
poor contrast — a dark fate for such a bright bird. The Automatic Contrast
Enhancement effect restores his outstanding appearance. Use the controls of
this effect in the following ways:
 If your photo needs contrast adjustment, use the Appearance controls. If
your photo needs more contrast, click Bold; for less contrast, click Flat;
and, if it’s just right, click Natural.
Figure 7-6:

125
Chapter 7: Adjusting Your Picture’s Brightness, Contrast, and Color

 If your photo needs lightening or darkening, use the Bias controls. If it’s
overall too dark, click Lighter; if it’s too light, click Darker; if it’s just
right, click Neutral.
 For a greater effect on contrast and brightness, click Normal in the
Strength area. Otherwise, choose Mild.
Intensifying (or dulling) 
colors through saturation
The more common problem with photos is dull colors that need more inten-
sity. However, if you’re shooting Ronald McDonald, for example, at a sunny
tulip festival, we can imagine that you may need duller colors, too. Either
way, the Automatic Saturation Enhancement effect fills the bill.
Choose Adjust➪Automatic Saturation Enhancement to enter the land of more
intense (or dimmer) colors. The Automatic Saturation Enhancement dialog
box glimmers onto your screen.
Figure 7-7 shows the dialog box in action. Showing you intensified colors in 
a black-and-white illustration is a bit too much of a challenge, however, so
please turn to the color section of this book for some examples of the kinds
of results you can achieve.
Controls in the Bias area determine whether you intensify or dull your colors.
Choose Less Colorful to dull your colors or More Colorful to intensify colors.
Normal may intensify or dull your colors, depending on how intense they 
are now.
Figure 7-7:

ment.
126
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Controls in the Strength area determine to what degree you dull or intensify
colors (according to your choice in the Bias area). Choose Weak to barely
affect colors, Normal to moderately affect them, or Strong to have the most
effect.
If you have people in your image, the Automatic Saturation Enhancement may
brighten their faces by mistake, by amplifying a healthy pink into a drunkard’s
blush. Or, it may dampen a vibrant brown into a sallow gray. If you have people
in your picture, check the Skintones present check box to warn Paint Shop Pro
to leave those pinks and browns alone!
Altering an overall tint
Are your overalls the wrong tint? Paint Shop Pro can’t fix that laundry 
problem — unless, of course, you have a picture of your overalls.
Images, whether the subject is overalls or not, sometimes have — or need —
an overall tint. Portraits taken in a forest setting, for example, tend to make
people look a bit green because of the light reflected off the leaves. Or, you
may want to add a slight orange tint to a sunset picture.
Paint Shop Pro, as it does with most color controls, gives you several ways to
alter tint:
 Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Red/Green/Blue: The Red/Green/Blue
dialog box that appears is the simplest control for altering overall tint.
 Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Color Balance: Color Balance and
Curves tint shadows, midtones, and highlights separately.
Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Red/Green/Blue and the Red/Green/Blue
dialog box appears. Like all dialog boxes for commands on the Adjust menu,
it has preview windows and proofing controls, plus one sliding control for
each primary color: Red %, Green %, and Blue %.
To make your image more red, green, or blue, the solution is straightforward:
Increase the value for that color. (Decrease it for less of that color.) Values
range from –100 to +100.
Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Color Balance and the Color Balance dialog
box appears. It works much like the Red/Green/Blue dialog box, but you get
to choose whether the controls apply to shadows, midtones, or highlights.
Choose by first clicking the corresponding radio button (such as Shadows)
for the tonal range you want to change; then move the sliders toward what-
ever tone you want more of (Red, for example).
127
Chapter 7: Adjusting Your Picture’s Brightness, Contrast, and Color

Fun with Colors
Not all color adjustments have to improve your photos. You can also alter
photos by turning them black-and-white, tinting them with shades, or turning
them into silk-screen paintings!
Going gray with a tint: Colorizing
We all go gray. Some of us try to add an attractive tint when that happens.
The same scheme can be even more attractive when applied to images.
Paint Shop Pro calls this process colorizing. But, unlike the colorizing you
may have seen used to make old black-and-white movies look as though they
were shot in color, colorizing in Paint Shop Pro imparts only a single hue to
the image. In effect, the result is a grayscale (monochrome) image done in
your chosen hue rather than in gray — kind of like all of those Che Guevera
pictures, where he’s standing against a red background.
The best Paint Shop Pro tool for this process is the Colorize tool, and it works
like this: Choose Adjust➪Hue and Saturation➪Colorize to display the Colorize
dialog box. The Colorize dialog box grabs its crayons and reports for duty.
The Colorize dialog box sports two adjustments:
 Saturation: Increase this value to determine how much color is applied.
If you set it to 0, the image is strictly grayscale (black and white). At 255,
the image has no gray, but is purely the hue you choose by adjusting the
Hue control.
 Hue: Click and hold the tiny down arrow at the right end of the Hue
value box. A rainbow-colored slider appears. Drag to the hue you want
and then release the mouse button.
Going totally gray or negative in one step
You’re just one step away from going as gray as William’s grandfather or
becoming as negative as a political ad. The Paint Shop Pro commands for
Greyscale and Negative Image, on the Adjust menu, are simple enough to do
their work in a single step: You get no dialog box and have no adjustments 
to make.
128
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Negative Image and Paint Shop Pro gives you
the negative of your image. Lights become darks, darks become lights, and
colors switch to their opposing colors on the color wheel. Reds become cyans,
yellows become blues, and so on. Changing an image from positive (normal) to
negative isn’t often useful, but sometimes you need to go the other way. That
event occurs when you (or whoever is supplying your images) is using a film
scanner and scans a film negative. The Negative Image command gives you the
normal (positive) image you want.
To turn your color image into shades of gray (like a black-and-white photo),
choose Image➪Greyscale. Going grayscale affects the entire image, even if you
have selected an area. If you want to turn just a certain area grayscale, select
that area and use the Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog box, as described ear-
lier in this chapter, to set the Saturation control to the minimum.
Posterize
The Posterize control isn’t on the Adjust menu, like the other advanced con-
trols we discuss in this section, but it does interesting things with colors.
Choose Effects➪Artistic Effects➪Posterize to launch the Posterize dialog box.
In posterizing, an image takes on the appearance of a silk-screened poster,
made up of areas of a few uniform colors. Posterizing reduces the number 
of colors that appear and results in blocks of color, like a paint-by-numbers
painting.
The dialog box for posterizing has only one adjustment, named Levels. Reduce
the value to reduce the number of colors or increase it to increase colors. The
value in Levels determines the number of levels of brightness in the image.
Threshold
The threshold control (choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Threshold)
gives you images in pure black and pure white, as shown in Figure 7-8. With a
threshold control, you’re telling Paint Shop Pro, “Turn any pixel with a bright-
ness below a given threshold black, and turn any pixel above that threshold
white.”
The dialog box for this layer has a single adjustment. Reduce the Threshold
value for a lower threshold (more white) and increase it for a higher thresh-
old (more black). You can use a threshold value between 1 and 255.

T
he problem with photos is that they are, in the end, depressingly accu-
rate. In William’s mind, he is a slim 180 pounds, has a full head of hair,
and possesses white teeth bright enough to make the Osmond Brothers jeal-
ous. But when his photos show up on-screen, they always reveal William to
be a man with a generous pot belly, a growing bald spot, and yellowing teeth.
(This is, incidentally, why Wiley does not allow author signings for Paint Shop
Pro For Dummies.)
William can improve the quality of his pictures all he wants — but in the end,
that just makes his bald spot clearer and more vibrant. What William wants
to do is to change the nature of his photo.
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro is extremely good at altering details. With Paint
Shop Pro, you can remove zits, cover up ugly carpets, and even put people in
photos who weren’t there when you took the picture. Wouldn’t it be nice to
have a pimple-free photo of you standing next to Britney Spears?
If that sounds interesting, let’s rock on!

Retouching Skin Blemishes and
Other Small Ugly Spots
Making small changes to an image to improve it is called retouching. Not sur-
prisingly, if you want to spruce up your images, your best friend is the
friendly finger of the retouch tool group, as shown in Figure 8-1. The retouch
tool group, which lurks on the toolbar, is kind of a virtual fingertip with which
you can rub away many defects, like Mom rubbing a bit of soot off your nose.
The retouch tool group offers many tools to choose from. Some of them
require a fair amount of technical insight into computer graphics in order to
use them properly. In this chapter, we cover the effects you’re likely to use
most.
Removing wrinkles with the Soften tool
One of the most useful Paint Shop Pro effects is great for retouching por-
traits: the Soften tool. The Soften tool, well, softens sharp edges — wrinkles,
for example. Just brush the tool across those edges or click them.
Figure 8-2 shows a frighteningly close shot of the left eye of wrinkled, old
Uncle Dave, a friendly author. On the left is an unretouched copy; on the right
is the Soften tool softening his wrinkles.
Figure 8-1:
When I think
about you, I
retouch
myself: the
retouch tool
group.
132
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

You could get the same result by selecting the wrinkled area and applying the
Blur or Blur More effect, but that’s more work. (We give you details later in
this chapter, in the section “Adding Blurs and the Illusion of Motion.”) If you
want a nice, soft, angelic glow to your entire image, the Soft Focus Adjustment
(see the later section “Bringing Someone into Soft Focus”) makes everything
radiant.
To work more gradually and do less softening in each stroke, set the opacity
to a lower value on the Tool Options palette.
Zapping warts and pimples 
with the Smudge tool
The Smudge tool picks up paint from the place where you set it down and
smears that paint as you drag to other areas, to make it the closest thing Paint
Shop Pro has to finger painting. As the tool smears, it loses paint just as your
finger would. You can use smudging to soften edges, rub out pimples, cover
up glare spots, or even blend in a dot of rouge (in the form of low-opacity red
paint) that you have added to the cheek of your CEO’s portrait.
To minimize moles, pimples, and similar imperfections, start not on the dis-
colored area, but rather off to one side. Smudge across the discolored area
and release the mouse button after you’ve smeared skin tone through the
imperfection. Repeat in the opposite direction, again starting on clear skin.
Figure 8-3 shows the smudge effect as the Retouch tool is dragged from left 
to right, starting with white and passing through the center of three differ-
ently colored squares in a single stroke. Notice how the paint fades as the
tool moves from left to right. The tops of the three squares have also been
smudged, but with repeated, circular strokes.
Figure 8-2:
The Soften
tool

left eye.
133
Chapter 8: Heavy-Duty Photo Alterations: Adding People and Removing Zits

As shown in the center of Figure 8-3, a single stroke may reveal the inherent
dottiness of computer stroking, which you can minimize by reducing the Step
value on the Tool Options palette (press F4 if you don’t see it). Repeated
strokes, as indicated along the tops of the squares in Figure 8-3, tend to
smear out those dots.
If your wart, pimple, or mole is too big to smudge — and some are — con-
sider using the Clone Brush tool to cover up the offending blemish with pris-
tine skin taken from elsewhere in your image. See the section “Removing
People, Places, and Things from Your Image,” later in this chapter.
Miscellaneous retouch tools
Not all retouching tools are useful; some are obscure, and others are more
creative than restorative. Still, they may be worth a try. This list provides
brief synopses of what they do:
 Sharpen: Amplifies edges, wrinkles, and other sudden transitions (the
opposite of Soften).
 Emboss: Creates a grayscale image that appears to be embossed, like
George Washington’s face on a U.S. quarter.

Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

 Push: Picks up the image area where you begin dragging and pushes it
along, leaving a trail of finely overlapping copies of that area. (Overlap is
controlled by the Step value on the Tool Options palette.)
 Dodge: A term taken from photographic darkroom work that means to
lighten areas that are already somewhat light. It lightens the image and
enhances contrast at the same time.
 Burn: The opposite of Dodge; darkens pixels that are already somewhat
dark. It darkens the image while enhancing contrast.
Burning and dodging are frequently used by professional photographers to
draw attention to parts of an image. For example, if you want your cousin to
stand out in her graduation picture, you might burn the people surrounding
her (as horrid as that sounds) and darken the rest of the assembly. The
viewer’s eye is then drawn to the light spot (namely, your cousin) in the
middle of a dark crowd.
Adding People, Places, and 
Things to Your Image
Using the Paint Shop Pro selection commands makes it very easy to cut people
out of one image and paste them into another. For example, in Figure 8-4, we
have cut the faithful Alex from Dave’s snow-covered doorstep in Maine and
placed him next to Amy, William’s daughter, as she kneels next to her fantastic
creation: the Cleveland Snowduck.

Chapter 8: Heavy-Duty Photo Alterations: Adding People and Removing Zits

This part of the program is a great deal of fun, and Paint Shop Pro aficionados
frequently get hours of enjoyment by inserting themselves into movie posters
so that they’re costarring with Salma Hayek. In fact, an entire underground
Internet movement is devoted to taking pictures from the news and doing 
as many strange and bizarre things with them as possible. The Web site
www.fark.com, for example, holds PG-13–rated contests to see who can
“Photoshop” pictures of Alan Greenspan and Ludacris into the funniest 
places. Some results are quite impressive.
We cover the mechanics of selecting a portion of an image in Chapter 3, and
we tell you in Chapter 4 how to cut and paste those portions into other
photos. That’s a good place to start — but a simple cut-and-paste doesn’t
create realistic fakes. Not that you need your photos to hold up to the eye of
conspiracy theorists — but plopping a picture of you, jaggies and edge halos
and all, into some random image just looks amateurish. Your completed pas-
tiche should look plausible at first glance, if not the second or third.
With that in mind, we here on the Paint Shop Pro 9 For Dummies staff offer the
following advice to make your images blend seamlessly:
1. Use the Magic Wand to select.
Yes, it’s easier to just draw a line around your target — but unless you
have a steady hand and a ridiculously exacting eye, the Magic Wand does
it better after some fine-tuning. Get used to it.
2. Get rid of the holes and specks in your selection.
This task used to be difficult, but Paint Shop Pro makes it so easy now
with its Remove Specks and Holes command that it’s a crime not to 
do it.
136
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 
Layers: Really, incredibly useful
If you’re going to be adding new people, places,
or things to your image, you probably want to
add them as new layers. When something is on
a layer, you can edit it separately from the rest
of the image.
For example, when we created the Alex-and-
Amy fake in Figure 8-4, we put the picture of Amy
and her Cleveland Snowduck on one layer and
then pasted Alex the dog into another layer. That
allowed us to resize Alex, making him smaller,
without changing Amy’s size. We also erased a
little around Alex’s edges without erasing any of
the snow on Amy’s layer. Whatever we did to
Alex’s picture didn’t affect Amy’s image, and
whatever we did to Amy didn’t affect Alex.
Layering is so amazingly powerful that we have
an entire chapter devoted to it; Chapter 11
opens up a whole new world to you.

3. Feather a little.
Usually, you want to leave off those crisp edges. Feather one or two
pixels on the inside to help the selection blend into the background.
4. Eliminate the background color entirely.
We show you how to remove a color from a selection in Chapter 3, in the
section about removing the background or other colors from your selec-
tion — and we show you an ugly image that shows what happens if you
don’t. Learn the lesson!
5. Resize appropriately.
When we first put Alex in the picture in Figure 8-4, he only came up to
Amy’s shoulder, making Amy look freakishly huge. A little downsizing
made a large difference.
6. Match the blur.
Most photos aren’t perfectly clear, and dropping a crisply focused image
into the middle of a slightly blurry pic looks wrong in a way that most
people can’t quite put a name to. Sharpening or Gaussian-blurring your
selection just a tad helps it to blend in.
7. Adjust the color.
Having a sunlit image brought into a fluorescent background makes the
image stick out like a throbbing thumb. Adjust the contrast, hue, and
brightness to match it as closely as you can. To find out how to adjust
contrast, hue, and brightness, look no further than Chapter 7.
8. Don’t forget the shadows!
A touch of low-opacity black paint can serve as a quick-and-dirty fake
shadow — as we did in the example shown in Figure 8-4. If you want to
go all out, you can even paste in another identical selection as a layer,
deform it so that it’s twisted sideways and elongated like a real shadow,
position it so that it’s spreading out from the bottom of the image, erase
the layer so that it’s transparent — and then fill it in with low-opacity
paint. But that’s a great deal of work for a quick fake!
Removing People, Places, and Things
from Your Image
The Clone Brush tool is a wonderful thing that allows you to erase someone
from an image without leaving a blank hole the way the Eraser tool does. The
Clone Brush requires you to select an area of your image — also known as
“the source” — before you start painting. When you paint with the Clone
Brush, you paste copies of the pixels from the source area into the area
you’re painting.
137
Chapter 8: Heavy-Duty Photo Alterations: Adding People and Removing Zits

This tool is frequently used in photograph retouching to “erase” areas in a
picture. If you don’t like your Uncle Fred, paint over him with a section of the
wall that’s off to his left.
This process is easier shown than described — so suppose that you have
decided that the green blanket that Alex is sitting on in Figure 8-5 just has to
go. You had better cover it up with some snow!
1. Click the Clone Brush tool (shown in Figure 8-6) on the Tools toolbar.
If you don’t see the Clone Brush tool, you may have selected the Scratch
Remover tool earlier. If that’s the case, click the arrow next to the
Scratch Remover tool and select the Clone Brush tool from the drop-
down list.

2. If necessary, adjust the size and hardness of the Clone Brush tool on
the Tool Options palette (see Figure 8-7).
Sometimes, you want to have a very large clone selection to replace
huge areas of a picture — or, you want a small selection to make sure
that you can get right in between Alex’s paws. You can adjust the size on
the Size control on the Tool Options palette; large numbers mean that
you copy a large sample of the picture, and smaller numbers mean tiny
samples. You want a teeny selection, so choose 20.
The hardness is a percentage that determines how crisp the edge of a
cloned copy is; 100 percent is a razor-sharp edge, whereas 0 percent is a
fuzzy selection that looks almost blurred and blends easily into the
background (see Figure 8-8). We keep ours at 50 percent.
If you don’t see the Tool Options palette, press F4 on the keyboard.
3. Right-click the source area (the area you want to copy).
Clicking an edge or corner of the object you want helps you with the
next step. In this case, because you want to cover up the green blanket
with a fluffy coating of snow, right-click the snow in the lower-right
corner, as shown in Figure 8-9.

4. Brush (left-click or drag) on the destination area (the area you want to
paint).
As you brush, keep an eye on the source area too. An X marks the spot
on the source image where the Clone Brush tool is picking up (copying)
pixels. As you move your brush, the X on the source image tracks your
movement. Move so that the X sweeps across the object you want to
copy, as shown in Figure 8-10.
If you ever want to choose another area to clone, all you have to do is
right-click a new section.
If, in Step 3, you right-clicked the upper-left corner of the area you’re copying,
begin painting where you want the upper-left corner of the clone to appear
in Step 4. Stroke down and to the right so that the X traverses the original
object.

Cloning between images or layers
The Clone Brush tool copies just as well from one
image window to another window as it does
within one image. It also copies between layers,
if you want. (If you don’t know what layers are —
and you should — flip to Chapter 11.)
To clone between images, open both images.
They appear in separate windows in Paint Shop
Pro. Just right-click the source image where
you want to copy, and then left-click or drag
where you want to paint on the destination
image.
To clone between layers, select your source
layer on the Layer palette. Then, right-click the
image you want copied. Select the destination
layer on the Layer palette, and then left-click or
drag on the image.

Other Clone Brush options
As you have already seen, the size of the area and the hardness can be set on
the Tool Options palette. In fact, by using the Tool Options palette, you can
set all the usual variations available to Paint Shop Pro brushes: shape, opac-
ity (transparency), step, and density (speckliness). You can find more infor-
mation on these settings in Chapter 9.
Cloning versus selection
When you copy individual people or objects, you can either use the Clone
Brush tool or copy and paste. Which to choose? The Clone Brush tool isn’t
really the best tool for copying objects because constraining the tool to just
the object you’re copying is difficult — although sometimes it’s the fastest
tool to use.

Chapter 8: Heavy-Duty Photo Alterations: Adding People and Removing Zits
Cloning neatly within the lines
You can paint neatly within a precisely defined
area by selecting that area in the destination
image. (We describe selection in Chapter 3.)
Paint Shop Pro paints only within the selection
marquee.
To paint Alex behind a palm tree, for example,
you can select the palm tree’s trunk and then
invert the selection to select everything except
the palm tree. Then, your brush stroke can slop
right over the tree without leaving paint on it.
Creating a selection around the source area
doesn’t help you copy from a precise area, how-
ever. A selection works on only the destination
area.

Here are three tips to tell you when the Clone Brush is the way to go:
 When you have a large enough background to clone: If you left-click
very near where you originally right-clicked, you may soon start cloning
your clones. (Your X may traverse areas you just painted.) You don’t
lose quality, but a pattern becomes apparent more quickly. If you look
carefully at Figure 8-11, where we have begun to clone over Alex, you
can discern a pattern in the slats we have cloned.
 When you want to put an object behind something: For example, you
may want Alex to appear behind a palm tree at Club Med. With the Clone
Brush tool, you can paint his image on either side of the palm tree. Paint
Shop Pro has ways of doing this job that give cleaner results, but the
Clone Brush tool is often simpler.
 Only when backgrounds are similar: Copying an object without picking
up a few border pixels is difficult using the Clone Brush tool, so it works
best when the backgrounds match.
Bringing Someone into Soft Focus
Directors learned long ago that smearing the lens with Vaseline produces a
soft, gentle look that gives everything a faint glow and makes the leading lady
look angelic. (Not coincidentally, it also hides wrinkles on aging marquee
stars, like Doris Day.) If you want to put the romance back in your photos,
you too can simulate this effect!
Choose Adjust➪Softness➪Soft Focus to bring up the Soft Focus controls, as
shown in Figure 8-12, which allow you to smear all the virtual Vaseline you
want.
This list describes the controls shown in the figure:
 Softness: This option controls how blurry you want your image, much
like defocusing a camera. Slide the control to the right to give the image
that total I-forgot-my-glasses look.
 Edge Importance: Blurring the image may cause faces to turn into
peachlike, fuzzy mushes; sliding this control to the right attempts to
Figure 8-11:
Bad
patterning,
Indy.
142
Part II: Prettying Up Photographs 

keep the edges (and eyes) distinct. It also helps to produce halos that
surround objects, as opposed to a more general haze.
 Halo Amount: You can produce halos that lend an angelic look to the
items in your image. Slide this control to the right for halo effects that
surround just about everything, or yank it all the way to the left to turn
off halo-ing altogether.
 Halo Size: Sliding this control to the right creates large, wide bands of
halos, and moving it to the left produces tighter, “borderlike” halos.
 Halo Visibility: To create halos of pure white light, move this control to
100 percent; for softer, more background-colored halos, pull it leftward.
Adding Blurs and the Illusion of Motion
“Why would I want to add blurs to an image?” you may ask. “Didn’t I spend
the big bucks to buy a digital camera that takes nonblurry photos?”
We have to admit that you have a point. But, sometimes, you’re trying to
paste an image into a slightly blurry photo and you need to match the larger
picture’s fuzzy background. At other times, you need to add a motion blur to
something to make it look like it’s moving very fast.
Blurring effects, although many and varied, are simple to use. Choose
Adjust➪Blur to access these menu items:
 Average: Pops up an adjustment dialog box with a single control,
Amount of Correction. Drag right for more blur.
 Blur: Applies a moderate amount of blurring. No adjustment dialog box
appears.
Figure 8-12:

wife Gini,

143
Chapter 8: Heavy-Duty Photo Alterations: Adding People and Removing Zits

 Blur More: Like Blur, only more so.
 Gaussian Blur: Pops up a single-control adjustment dialog box. Drag the
Radius control to the right for more blurring, or left for less. To the
trained eye of the blur aficionado, this blur is a bit more refined than
Average blur. To the rest of us, it’s just a blur.
 Motion Blur: Produces an artistic effect that most people can under-
stand if they have tried to take a photo of a fast-moving child, a car, or
an animal and ended up with a motion blur. This effect, using an adjust-
ment dialog box, produces a motion blur! Drag the clock-hand-like
Direction control in that box to point in the direction you want motion.
Then set the Strength slider and move it to the right if you need more
blur (see the following Tip paragraph).
Blur is often most effective when applied selectively to a particular area 
of your image. Select an area with any of the selection tools we discuss in
Chapter 3 and then apply the Blur effect. Applied selectively, Blur can help
focus attention on the subject of your photo and away from a confusing 
background.
The Motion Blur effect is sometimes best applied to the background area
around the object you want to appear speedy, so the object of interest isn’t
blurred. It’s a great way, for example, to make Speedy, your lethargic retriever,
appear to live up to his name. Take a photo of Speedy in his fastest pose —
moseying toward his dinner bowl, for example. In Paint Shop Pro, select the
area around Speedy before choosing the Motion Blur effect. Apply the motion
blur in the head-to-tail direction. Your photo looks like your camera tracked
Speedy as he sped heroically to save his Gravy Train from a watery demise.
Figure 8-13 shows this effect applied to Alex, with a slight feathering to make
him blend better into the blurred background.

Spot-Changing Colors within an Image
Although Paint Shop Pro offers a dizzying variety of ways to change colors
and intensities, the hue tool group, as shown in Figure 8-14, is the easiest. You
can lighten or darken areas of your image, swap colors in a target area, inten-
sify the colors, or leach them to a dull gray.
The hue tool group doesn’t do anything you can’t do by selecting an area and
then applying any one of the color adjustments we describe in Chapter 7.
However, it’s often much quicker to swipe a couple of strokes with a paint-
brush-like object across your area than it is to carefully . . . select . . . the 
right . . . part and then adjust it.
Removing unsightly gleams and glares
You can lighten or darken in lots of different ways in Paint Shop Pro — but
the most basic is the Lighten/Darken tool in the hue tool group. You’re given
two options here: RGB and Lightness. In most cases, RGB works just fine.
Hold down the left mouse button and drag to lighten an image; hold the right
button and drag to sink it into the shadows.
Lightness adjusts the lightness portion — the L in HSL — and RGB adjusts the
red, green, and blue portions. If you really want to know what the difference
is, check out Chapter 7.

Chapter 8: Heavy-Duty Photo Alterations: Adding People and Removing Zits

Figure 8-15 shows an image of Dave’s trusty golden retriever, Alex, that was
taken a bit too close to the camera’s flash. On the copy on the right side, we
have right-clicked with the Lighten/Darken tool in RGB mode to tone down
the gleam on his nose and reduce the flash’s reflection in his eyes.
To darken more gradually and gain more control over the results, set the
opacity to a lower value on the Tool Options palette.
The rest of the hue tool group
Other tools are in the hue tool group, but they’re not used much:
 Saturation Up/Down: Holding down the left mouse button and dragging
while you have the Saturation tool selected amplifies the inherent colors
in your image; holding down the right button leaches the colors out and
renders the image a lifeless gray. (For more information on what satura-
tion is, see the section in Chapter 7 about bringing your picture’s colors
to life.)
 Change to Target: You can use the Change to Target tool to transform all
the colors under your brush into shades of the color in the Foreground
Materials box. If you’re really feeling comfortable with the whole HSL
thing (as shown in Chapter 7), you can replace the hue, saturation, or
lightness instead.
 Hue Up/Down: This option pushes colors counterclockwise (red, yellow,
green, cyan, blue, violet, and magenta) or clockwise on the Paint Shop
Pro color wheel. We don’t know when you would use it, but, hey — it
came with the program, right?

O
f course, Paint Shop Pro does all the basics you have seen in garden
variety “paint” programs (like the Paint program that comes with
Windows). For example, it lets you brush or spray lines, blobs, and colors
and fill in areas.
This is Paint Shop Pro, however, and pro means that you get a heck of a lot
more control than those simple programs offer. It also means more sophisti-
cated editing abilities, like replacing one color with another or erasing back-
ground areas. This tool is the one that Dave’s house painter, Phil, would use if
Dave’s house were digital — and Phil’s a pro.
As with most jobs you do in Paint Shop Pro, painting affects only the active
layer and only the selected area. If it appears that a painting or retouching
tool isn’t working, make sure that you’re on the right layer and working
within a selected area (or clear the selection by pressing Ctrl+D). If you don’t
use more than one layer or don’t have any current selection, don’t worry
about those restrictions. Also, remember that by pressing Ctrl+Z, you can
undo any painting or erasing.

Starting a Fresh Canvas
You can paint on an existing image in Paint Shop Pro, but if you’re starting a
work of art from scratch, you need a fresh canvas, or background layer. Here’s
how to start a fresh canvas:
1. Choose File➪New or press Ctrl+N.
The New Image dialog box appears.
2. Specify the size of your image by using the Width and Height value
boxes, and choose inches, centimeters, or pixels in the adjacent Units
selection box.
If you use inches or centimeters for your units, specify in the Resolution
box how many pixels you want per one inch or centimeter. Set the adja-
cent Units selection box to Pixels/cm or Pixels/inch.
3. Under Image Characteristics, choose Raster, Vector, or Art Media.
For purposes of this chapter, choose Raster. Vector is for text or shape
objects, and Art Media is for special artsy stuff, which we talk about in
Chapter 10.
4. For color depth, choose 16 million colors unless you know that you
have a special need for fewer colors.
5. For a solid background, deselect the check box marked Transparent.
If the color sample box displayed above the check box isn’t the back-
ground you want, click that sample box. In the Color dialog box that
appears, click a hue in the circle; adjust its lightness or darkness by
clicking in the rectangle in the center of the circle. Or, click any standard
color in the colored grid. When the Current box is the color you want,
click OK.
Finding Your Tool
Before you can do much of anything, you need to be able to find your tools!
Figure 9-1 shows the Paint Shop Pro Tools toolbar, where painterly tools, like
brushes, live. This toolbar has a slightly confusing design. It doesn’t give
every tool its own spot on the bar. The bar would be way too long.
Instead, the toolbar groups similar tools into what we call tool groups. A tool
group (or toolset) exists wherever you see a tiny downward-pointing triangle
(or down arrow) to the right of an icon.
150
Part III: Painting Pictures 

The Tools toolbar is normally sort of magnetized (docked) to the left side of
your Paint Shop Pro window, although you can drag it elsewhere — to the
top, the right side, or the bottom or even floating free in the middle of the
screen! Drag the toolbar by the faint dotted line at its top to place it to wher-
ever you want. To place it back along the left side, drag first to the center of
the side until it grabs, and then slide it up into its original position.
Click the small down arrow next to the tool group and then select its icon
from the tool group menu that flies out. Your cursor then becomes that tool
(it displays that tool’s icon) whenever the cursor is over your image.

Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling
Disappearing toolbars and palettes
The Tools toolbar and other toolbars and
palettes in Paint Shop Pro have the ability to get
out of your way automatically. They can shrink
to nothing more than a title bar when you’re not
using them. We find that this behavior drives us
nuts, but you may like it.
Click the tiny pushpin icon at the top or left end,
which turns the icon sideways. (For the Tools
toolbar, first drag the toolbar to a floating posi-
tion.) Now, whenever your cursor leaves the
toolbar, the toolbar shrinks to a title bar (labeled,
for example, Tools for the Tools toolbar). To
restore the toolbar, position your cursor over the
title bar. To restore normal behavior, restore the
toolbar by positioning the cursor over the title
bar, and then sneak up along the toolbar to the
pushpin and click it.
A completely different way that a toolbar or
palette may disappear is if you close it by click-
ing the X next to the pushpin or by pressing a
function key. You can restore (or turn off) any
toolbar by choosing View➪Toolbars, and then
your desired toolbar from the menu that appears.
For palettes, choose View➪Palettes. Each line
on the palette menus also lists the function key
that turns the palette on or off.

Brushing, Airbrushing (Spraying), 
and Erasing
Using the Paint Brush, Airbrush, and Eraser tools is much like using real
paint, paper, and erasers. Okay — you would never use an eraser on paint in
real life, but you get the idea.
Like most Paint Shop Pro tools and commands, the Paint Brush, Airbrush,
and Eraser tools do their things on the active layer of your image. If they
don’t seem to be working correctly or are grayed out, you may be on the
wrong layer. See Chapter 11 for more information about layers.
Brushing or spraying
The Paint Brush tool, like a real paint brush, paints a spot of paint when you
click it on your image or a line when you drag it. The Airbrush works simi-
larly, but like a can of spray paint, it puts down a speckly spot or line that
gets denser as you hold the button down.
The Airbrush tool paints speckly and the Paint Brush tool paints solid for a
reason: Jasc initially gives the two tools different density settings on the Tool
Options palette. You could easily change their density settings and make the
Paint Brush tool paint speckly or the Airbrush tool paint solid. The real differ-
ence between the tools is that if you pause the Airbrush tool or move it
slowly while keeping the mouse button pressed, paint continues to fill in the
speckles. As a result, you increase the paint density just as you can with real
spray paint. Not so with the Paint Brush tool: You would have to click repeat-
edly to get that effect.
The two tools work similarly. Here’s how to paint with the Paint Brush or
Airbrush (spray) tools:
1. Click a color from the Materials palette, as shown in Figure 9-2.
Press F6 to turn on the Materials palette if you don’t see it. Click the
middle tab of the three tabs that appear there to see the easy-to-
understand “rainbow” display of colors, and then click your color. To
use more complex paint materials, see Chapter 10.
Your chosen color appears in the foreground color box.
2. Select the Paint Brush or Airbrush tool from the brush tool group.
Refer to the first section in this chapter and Figure 9-1 for help in locat-
ing your tool.
152
Part III: Painting Pictures 

3. Set the brush size and other options on the Tool Options palette.
Press F4 to turn on Tool Options if it’s not visible, and adjust the Size
value box. If the industry standard Paint Shop Pro brush doesn’t tickle
your fancy, here’s where you get to change the kind of brush you paint
with; you can make it a tiny, crisp square or a ghostly, rocket ship-
shaped brush or a watercolorish schmearer. We go over this technique
in the next section, but feel free to experiment. It’s fun!
4. Drag on your image (or click to make just a single spot).
As you drag or click with the left mouse button, you apply whatever
color (material) you have selected as the foreground in the Materials
palette.
If you’re using the Airbrush tool, you can keep the cursor in one place
and hold down the mouse button. The paint density gradually builds up.
Make sure that texture button
is out (off) to apply solid color.
Your color appears here,
in the Foreground color box.

Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling
Painting or erasing a straight line
Can’t draw a straight line? Paint Shop Pro
comes to your rescue. The starting point of the
line is the last place you clicked, or wherever
your last brush stroke ended.
To create a straight line from that point, hold
down the Shift key and click where you want the
line to end. This trick works with all the tools from
the brush tool group (Paint Brush, Airbrush, Warp
Brush) and with the Eraser tool.

If the spot or stroke doesn’t look right, press Ctrl+Z (or click the Undo button
on the toolbar) to undo it; you may need to use the Tool Options palette to
change the brush features. See the later section “Controlling Strokes, Sizes,
Shapes, and Spatters: Tool Options,” for details on changing appearances.
Picking up colors from an image
You can pick a color to paint with from the Materials palette, as shown in
Figure 9-2, but picking color from the image is sometimes much more conve-
nient. Cohabiting with the Color Replacer in the color selection tool group is
an eyedropper icon. Shown in the margin here, it’s called the Dropper tool,
and is the sixth button from the top of the Tools toolbar.
Click the Dropper, and then click any color in the image to make that your
current working (that is, foreground) color. To pick up a background color
(used by some tools and paint brushes), right-click. Here are a few tips for
picking up color:
 If you’re using any brush, painting, or eraser tool, you don’t need the
Dropper to pick up paint. Just Ctrl+click with your current tool to pick
up color.
 The Dropper initially is set to pick up color from only a single pixel.
Sometimes, however, apparently continuous color is mottled, and no
single pixel is the right color. In that case, average the color of an area
by choosing a larger sample size on the Tool Options palette. (Press F4 if
it’s not visible.)
 The Dropper normally gets its color from all layers combined. To pick up
color from just the current layer, enable the Active Layer Only check box
on the Tool Options palette.
Erasing with the Eraser tool
The eraser tool requires a little caution to get the results you want. Here’s
how to erase:
1. Click the Eraser tool, as shown in the margin.
Alternatively, press the X key rather than click the Eraser. Make sure
that you have chosen the Eraser shown at the left, not the Background
Eraser.
2. Set the Size of the eraser on the Tool Options palette.
Press F4 to turn the Tool Options palette on if it’s not visible. Then,
adjust the Size value box. A higher number is bigger.
154
Part III: Painting Pictures 

3. Hold down the Ctrl button and right-click your image somewhere that
the background color (typically, white) appears.
You can skip this step if you’re erasing on a layer that is transparent. This
little precautionary trick ensures that when you erase on a background
layer (which is typically nontransparent), the Eraser leaves the correct
color behind. It sets the official background color on the Materials palette,
which is what the Eraser leaves behind on nontransparent layers.
4. Drag on your image to erase, or click to erase a single spot.
The Eraser leaves behind background color on an opaque background.
On transparent backgrounds or other layers, it leaves transparency.
If the size, shape, and density (speckliness) of your eraser aren’t what you
want, press Ctrl+Z (or click the Undo button on the toolbar) to undo. Then,
see the section “Controlling Strokes, Sizes, Shapes, and Spatters: Tool
Options,” a little later in this chapter.
Erasing backdrops with the 
Background Eraser tool
A common problem in any Paint Shop Pro project is erasing specific areas;
for example, you want to erase an ugly wallpaper print — but not Cousin
Charlie, who’s standing in front of it. You could carefully erase that ghastly
wallpaper, pixel by pixel. Not only is that method incredibly time-consuming,
though, but also one slip of the wrist and you accidentally remove his left
elbow.
The incredibly handy Paint Shop Pro Background Eraser tool makes this
process easy by doing some complex calculations to determine what is Charlie
and what is the background behind Charlie and then automatically erasing that
background. (You can also select around Charlie to make normal erasing easier;
refer to Chapter 3 to read about selection.)
For example, as you can see in Figure 9-3, erasing the background behind
both Dave and Alex is a snap. The Background Eraser recognizes the differ-
ence between Dave and a coniferous tree — not always an easy task.
Just to confuse you, Paint Shop Pro calls this tool the Background Eraser, even
though it has nothing to do with the Background Material box, discussed in
Chapter 10. Whereas background in every other aspect of Paint Shop Pro means
“the secondary color that’s used to fill the middle of a shape,” here it means
what most people think it does: the stuff behind the interesting things in a pic-
ture. Why they didn’t call it something like the Erase to Edge tool in order to
keep the terminology consistent is beyond us.
155
Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

Here’s how to erase the background behind Uncle Charlie:
1. Click the Background Eraser tool, as shown in the margin.
2. Set the size of your eraser by adjusting the Size value on the Tool
Options palette. (Press F4 if you don’t see the palette.)
To control other brush-like aspects of the Background Eraser, see the fol-
lowing section.
If the background is the result of multiple layers, enable the Sample
Merged check box. To improve the Background Eraser’s behavior, see
the nearby sidebar “Tweaking the Background Eraser.”
3. Click a section of the area you want erased and hold the mouse button
down briefly before dragging.
In our example, you would want to click that ugly wallpaper. Holding the
button down briefly gives Paint Shop Pro time to do the calculations to
figure out what wallpaper looks like so that it can erase it.
If you’re erasing on a background layer, Paint Shop Pro may pop up an
Auto Actions dialog box which suggests that you let it promote the back-
ground to a full layer. Click OK. Your image background layer is now
transparent, and the former background layer is now a layer.
4. Drag the point of the tool across the background, to allow the outer
radius of the tool to overlap the edge of the area you want isolated
(Charlie).
Figure 9-3:
Man, dog,
and tree.

ground

appreci-
ates the
distinction.
156
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Don’t drag the point of the tool across Charlie, or else he is taken as
background. Dragging quickly may go too fast for Paint Shop Pro to keep
up, and as a result it may start erasing bits you want to keep. Drag at a
slow, sure pace along the edge.
Using the Background Eraser is great for removing the bits around edges, 
but it’s very slow (and not efficient) at removing large areas. If you’re trying
to erase everything except Cousin Charlie, we suggest that you use the
Background Eraser to clear a “moat” of transparent space around Charlie 
and then switch to the regular Eraser tool to mop up the rest of the image.
157
Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling
Tweaking the Background Eraser
Mostly, the settings that Paint Shop Pro picks
for special options (like Sampling) work pretty
darned well. (You may have to click the tiny right
arrow at the right end of the Tool Options palette
to see all options. ) If they don’t work well for
you, you may need to tweak them. Here’s what
you need to know to tweak:
Sampling: The Background Eraser works by
looking at (sampling) the pixels directly under its
black tip and calling that the background. It then
erases matching pixels that it finds under the
full radius of the tool.
Continuous: As you drag, the Background
Eraser continually checks the image to dis-
cern a difference between the foreground
and the background. This setting generally
provides the best results.
Once: The eraser looks only at the place
where you first clicked to determine back-
ground. Generally, this setting does very
little erasing.
Foreswatch and Backswatch: The Back-
ground Eraser attempts to erase colors that
are similar to what is in the Foreground or
Background boxes, respectively, of the
Materials palette. Use this setting if what
you want to erase is one color and the
Continuous setting isn’t getting it right.
Limits:
Contiguous: Paint Shop Pro erases only
background pixels that are contiguous. This
option is often good for removing up to the
edge of Cousin Charlie.
Discontiguous: The tool erases pixels that
match the background even if they’re iso-
lated from each other. If a little bit of the
wallpaper’s color is on Charlie’s shirt, it may
well erase that too when the eraser over-
laps the shirt.
Find Edge: The tool erases pixels starting at
the tool tip outward until the tool finds an
edge within its radius. This setting is also
good for isolating Charlie.
Sharpness:
Low values produce a fuzzy line between
the background and Cousin Charlie; high
values create a crisp, sharp line. (Low
values in the 40s look more natural.)
Auto Tolerance:
You can clear this check box to set your tol-
erance manually in the Tolerance setting.
Lower tolerance values mean that a pixel
must be a pretty close match to the sampled
pixels to be erased.

Controlling Strokes, Sizes, Shapes, 
and Spatters: Tool Options
The Painting and Eraser tools can do much more than just create a plain,
boring spot or line. The Tool Options palette, as shown in Figure 9-4, is your
key to variety, artistic success, fame and fortune, and probably good dental
health. It’s the key to making your paint tool work the way you want. The
palette works the same — or nearly the same — for all painting and erasing
tools, except for the Warp Brush.
One key role of the Tool Options palette is to show you what your brush
looks like. As Figure 9-4 indicates, a preview area in the upper-left corner
shows you the size, fuzziness (hardness), and speckliness (density) of the
spot you make if you clicked your image. The Tool Options palette is so
incredibly useful that it should almost always be open so that you can check
your brush before you paint.
The Tool Options palette (or its title bar, labeled Tool Options) is probably
already floating around somewhere on your PC screen. If you can’t find the
Tool Options palette, follow these steps:
1. Press the F4 key on your keyboard a few times.
The palette appears and disappears. Leave it visible.
2. If Tool Options appears as a floating window and you don’t want it
hovering over your painting, double-click its title bar to dock it.
3. If the Tool Options palette isn’t where you want it (we prefer along the
top), click the dark shaded bar at the far left and drag the palette to
wherever you want.
4. If you don’t see all the options on the Tool Options palette, you may
need to slide the palette open to see everything.

up and down) until you can see all options clearly. Alternatively, you can
drag the bottom edge of the palette down, as Figure 9-4 suggests, to
widen the palette to display all sections.
(Of course, if you can see everything you intend to change, you don’t
have to open everything. Think of the three sections of the Tool Options
palette as a chest of drawers: You can open them all at one time or close
the ones you’re not working on and keep open the ones you need.)
You don’t need to put away the Tool Options palette before working on your
image. Leave it up so that you can make adjustments as you go. Drag it out of
the way, if necessary, like we just showed you.
Not all tools offer all the adjustments we discuss in the next few subsections.
Using convenient controls on 
the Tool Options palette
You can make adjustments on the Tool Options palette by using the dialog
box gadgets you’re familiar with from other programs. You can click the Size
and other boxes and edit or type a new value or click either of the spin dial
buttons (the pair of up and down arrows) to increase or decrease a value.
In addition to the usual ways of adjusting values, Paint Shop Pro has a nifty
adjustment feature, as shown in Figure 9-5. Click the tiny down arrow at the
far right edge of the box for any numerical value, such as the Size box. Hold
the mouse button down, and a tiny ruler-like bar appears, with a pointer.
Keep the mouse button down and drag the pointer left or right to adjust the
value down or up, respectively.
Figure 9-5 shows a slider for the Paint Brush tool, although all or most of
these same controls exist for the other painting tools. Clicking the far right
down arrow for a given widget opens the adjustment slider, which gives 
you a rough preview of what your tool will look like.

Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

If you repeatedly use the same tool with the same tool options, you can save
that tool’s settings as a preset. Presets allow you to load a bunch of tool
options in one click as opposed to entering them over and over again. Click
the Presets icon, and in the Presets fly-out box that appears, click the disk
(Save) icon. Type a memorable name for your settings in the Save Preset
dialog box that appears and press Enter. Click the Presets icon to put away
the fly-out. Thereafter, to choose your preset, click the Preset icon and
choose your preset by clicking its name in the fly-out box.
Making lines wider or narrower: Size
You most frequently adjust size. One size of tool definitely does not fit all.
Even Phil, Dave’s house painter, uses different sizes of brushes. (What an
artiste!) On the Tool Options palette, adjust the Size value to any value from 
1 through 500 (from 1 to 500 pixels).
You can see just how big your tool is at any time by moving the cursor over
the image. Big brushes may need smaller step values (the number in the box
labeled Step) to avoid painting dotted lines.
Shaping clicks, lines, and line ends: Shape
Shape changes the way the painted (or erased) line looks when it ends or
bends. Shape also lets you stamp a shape by clicking the image, as though
you had a rubber stamp or were spraying paint through a template.
On the Tool Options palette, you have two options: You can go with a generic
round or square brush or with brushes that simulate chalk or watercolor, or
you can even select a variety of strange and unearthly brushes (like cherries,
comets, or fuzzy circles) to paint with, as shown in Figure 9-6.
Selecting a round or square brush couldn’t be simpler: Click the round or
square box on the Tool Options palette. If you want something a little more
esoteric, however, you can select a brush tip from the brush tip drop-down
menu, next to the Presets menu. As shown in Figure 9-6, you’re presented
with a gallery of brushes, called the Resource Manager, that you can scroll
through; double-click a brush tip to load it.
Using the various brush tips, you can make your lines look as though you
have drawn them with a calligraphic pen. Figure 9-7 shows you, from top to
bottom, the square, round, hard rake, and twirly spike brush shapes. The
twirly spike uses the background color as well as the foreground color from
the Materials palette. See Chapter 10 for more about the background color.
160
Part III: Painting Pictures 

As you make strokes, you see repeated stampings of this shape. The Step con-
trol (which we discuss in the section “Making lines more or less dotty: Step,”
later in this chapter) helps you change the separation between stampings.
Painting with a softer or 
harder edge: Hardness
Hardness determines how sharp the edges of your tool are. Maximum hard-
ness (100) gives your tool a sharp edge; lower hardness applies a gradual
fade to the edge. Zero hardness gradually fades the edge all the way to the
center of the brush shape. At low hardness, you may need to decrease the
step to avoid creating a dotted line. Figure 9-8 shows you a single spot that
shows a hardness of 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20 (from left to right).
Reduce hardness to minimize jaggies (a staircase effect also called aliasing)
where your line bends.

Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

Making paint thinner or thicker: Opacity
Opacity is how thick (opaque or solid) your paint is. A value of 100 means
that your paint is completely opaque. Reduce opacity to make a more trans-
parent paint. A value of 50, for example, means that an individual spot of
paint (caused by clicking once with your mouse) is 50 percent transparent.
Overlapping spots cause each stroke, or click of the mouse, to add paint and
make the area more opaque. Figure 9-9 shows spots with an opacity of 100,
80, 60, 40, and 20 (from left to right).
A brush stroke (dragging with your mouse) is more opaque than a single spot
(clicking with your mouse) because strokes are simply repeated, overlapping
spots. If you increase the values of the step variable (which controls the
spacing of those spots), you make the stroke more transparent.
For the Eraser tool, opacity refers to how completely you erase. If you use
maximum opacity (100), you erase the line entirely. Use repeated strokes 
or clicks with values less than 100 to shave the paint thickness and reduce
opacity.
Getting speckles of spray: Density
The word density doesn’t accurately describe this adjustment. The words
speckly-ness or speckle-osity are more accurate, but still confusing. Density
works like this: When density is at its maximum (100), you get nice, solid
Figure 9-9:

spot! Single
spots with
decreasing
opacity.
Figure 9-8:

162
Part III: Painting Pictures 

paint coverage (or eraserage, if you’re using the eraser). At lower settings of
density, you get random speckles, as though you were spattering or spraying.
Figure 9-10 shows you a single spot, at densities of 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20
(from left to right).
For the Airbrush tool to do its job (which is spraying paint), you must set the
density to less than 100. Yet, you can set density less than 100 for the Paint
Brush or Eraser tools too, and they also give a speckly result, similar to the
results you would get with the Airbrush tool.
Making lines more or less dotty: Step
It’s time you knew the truth: The Paint Shop Pro paint tools don’t apply paint
continuously as you drag. (Gasp!) No, they apply repeated stampings of the
brush’s shape. (Imagine a jackhammer tipped with a rubber stamp.) The Step
control determines the distance between those stampings.
If you set the step value at its maximum (100, or 100 percent), the shapes
don’t overlap; the step is 100 percent of the tool size, so you get a dotted line.
At 50, the shapes overlap halfway, and at 25 they overlap three-quarters (25
is often a good choice). Figure 9-11 shows you step values of 20, 40, 60, and
100 (from top to bottom). The larger the step values, the more dotted the
line.
Figure 9-11:

163
Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

Very low step values use up lots of processor power because the computer
has to draw a new stamp every time the mouse moves. If you’re drawing and
the computer hesitates a moment before it renders the line on the screen,
you may consider raising the step value 10 or 20 percent.
Coloring within the Lines 
By Using Selection
When you’re using painting tools in Paint Shop Pro and have selected an
area, those painting tools work only within that selection. This feature is
great for keeping you “within the lines” as you paint.
First, select the area you want to paint. (Refer to Chapter 3 to find out how 
to make selections.) If you have chosen to use multiple layers in your image,
make sure that you’re on the layer that contains the object you want to paint.
(See Chapter 11 or the Cheat Sheet for help with layers.) Then, choose a
painting tool and paint! Feel free to scribble or spray paint over the edges;
the paint falls only within the selection.
Feathered selections work too, for blending the edges of your painting efforts
into the rest of the image. Paint Shop Pro applies less paint in the feathered
zone. Feathering expands the marquee to include feathered pixels outside the
selection, however. If the selection has Swiss-cheese-like holes in it (as the
Magic Wand tool selections often do), you may not notice the holes because
the feathered expansion covers them. As you paint, because the holes are
feathered areas, they reappear as fuzzy spots that resist being painted. If you
don’t want that effect, eliminate the holes in your selection before you apply
feathering. Refer to Chapter 3 for help.
Replacing Colors
Here’s your chance to fix that purple cow — the one that people always
prefer to see, rather than be. The Color Replacer tool is your companion in
reconstructive cow coloring.
The Color Replacer isn’t a great tool for photographs. It tends to skip pixels,
and it also replaces, with a single color, the natural range of color values that
result from sun and shadow. Use this tool for cartoon cows with blocks of
color or the text COWs and you will be fine. For photographic cows, you’re
better off selecting a colored area and using the Colorize tool, as described in
Chapter 7. You’ll get a far more realistic result.
164
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Color replacement, like most Paint Shop Pro actions, works on only the active
layer and within any selection you may have made. If you have chosen to use
layers in your image, make sure that you’re working on the correct layer
during the following steps, or else replacement may not work.
Don’t be cowed. Here’s how to put new hue in your purple moo:
1. Click the Color Replacer from the color selection tool group, six but-
tons from the top of the Tools toolbar, as shown in Figure 9-12.
The cursor takes on a brush shape. As with the Paint Brush and other
painting tools, the brush size, shape, and other properties are controlled
by the Tool Options palette. Refer to “Controlling Strokes, Sizes, Shapes,
and Spatters: Tool Options,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Hold down the Ctrl key and right-click in your image the color you
want to replace.
The Background Material box takes on this color.
3. Again, hold down the Ctrl key and left-click your new, replacement
color, either in the image or in the Available Colors area of the Color
palette.
The Foreground Material box takes on this color. Alternatively, you can
use any technique we describe in Chapter 10 to set a new foreground
material, complete with textures and gradients and whatnot.
4. To replace the color in specific areas, drag across those areas. Double-
click anywhere to replace the color everywhere.
Like most tools, the Color Replacer tool’s action is constrained by layers
and selections. If you have used layers in your image, color is replaced
only throughout the active layer. If you have a current selection, replace-
ment happens only within that selection.
The Color Replacer tool replaces a range of colors that are close to the one
you picked to be replaced. Adjust the Tolerance setting on the Tool Options
palette to control closeness. (Press F4 if you don’t see the Tool Options
Figure 9-12:
The Color
Replacer
hides in the
color
selection
tool group.
165
Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

palette.) The larger the Tolerance setting, the broader the range of colors the
Color Replacer tool replaces. If you’re replacing a single, uniform color, set
the tolerance to zero. If you’re purpling a cow in a photograph, you need to
replace a range of browns (or blacks or whites, depending on the cow). Set
the tolerance higher in that event; try 25 or so, to start. In short, select one of
these methods:
 If the Color Replacer tool replaces more than you want, decrease the tol-
erance. Press Ctrl+Z to undo the overenthusiastic replacement, and then
drag or double-click again.
 If the Color Replacer tool doesn’t replace enough, increase tolerance
and then drag or double-click again.
Filling Areas
For flooding an area with nice, even color, nothing beats the Flood Fill tool,
except possibly spilling a glass of red wine on a white sweater. (Fortunately,
unlike with the wine spill, you can undo the Flood Fill tool’s actions by press-
ing Ctrl+Z.)
Using the Flood Fill tool, shown in the margin, you can fill an area with solid
color. You can not only fill with a simple color, but also fill areas with complex
gradients, patterns, or textures. You only have to choose a foreground mater-
ial in the Material Properties dialog box, as Chapter 10 relates.
Filling a selected area with solid color
The most basic kind of fill you can perform is filling a selected area with a
uniform color (the sort of work that Phil, Dave’s house painter, does). For
example, the sky in your photograph may be gray — perhaps with clouds and
power lines running through it — and you want to make it solid, cloudless
blue with no power lines. Here’s how to fill like Phil:
1. Use any of the selection tools to select the area you want to fill.
For example, click the sky in your picture with the Magic Wand tool.
Refer to Chapter 3 for help with getting exactly the selection you want.
The selection marquee indicates your selected area.
If you have chosen to use layers in your image, you must also select the
layer that contains the portion of the image you want to fill. See Chapter
11 for more help with layers. If you don’t use layers in your image, just
make your selection and move on to Step 2.
166
Part III: Painting Pictures 

2. Click the Flood Fill tool on the Tools toolbar.
Your cursor icon changes to the paint can, the Flood Fill tool icon.
3. Choose a foreground material to fill with.
For simple unpatterned, untextured fills, make sure that the Foreground
and Stroke Properties box is set to a solid color. Refer to Figure 9-2, near
the beginning of this chapter, to see how to choose just a plain color.
4. Open the Tool Options palette.
If the Tool Options palette isn’t visible on your screen, press the F4 key
on your keyboard to display the palette.
5. Make the following choices from the drop-down lists there:
• Blend mode: Normal
• Match mode: None
• Opacity: 100 percent for a fill that nothing shows through, or lower
for a more transparent fill
6. Click your selection in the image.
The color completely fills the selected area (in your chosen layer, if you
use layers). If you choose an opacity lower than 100, the color just tints
the selected area and increases in thickness if you click again.
Figure 9-13 shows the effect of a solid fill in a selection of the sky, using deep
blue to fill the sky uniformly. (The edge of the selection is feathered a bit,
causing the white band to appear along the skyline.)
Figure 9-13:

this image, a

167
Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

If you’re modifying a drawing, a solid color may be exactly what you want. In
our photo, however, a solid color doesn’t look natural as sky. Sky is never a
uniform color in real life; it changes in color gradually as it approaches the
horizon. For a more natural look, you need a gradient, or shaded, fill.
Filling with a gradient, pattern, or texture
In real life, you rarely see a uniform color (even if you think you do). Changes in
lighting or the angles at which light strikes an object cause a gradual change
across the object from one color to another, lighter color. The surface of your
desk, for example, is probably a lighter color nearer your source of light.
If you need a realistic shading like that, or if for any other reason you want
colors in an area to make a smooth transition from one color to another, try 
a shaded, or gradient, fill. Figure 9-14 shows the effect of a gradient fill on the
sky area of the photograph.
For some fills, like filling a rectangle to look like a brick wall or a tree trunk,
use a pattern rather than a solid color. To use gradients or patterns, you must
first set your foreground material to be a gradient or pattern; see Chapter 10
for instructions on choosing the gradient or pattern you need.
Or, you may want to apply color with a textured appearance. Just like the
other painting tools, if the Material box has a texture, such as canvas or
asphalt, the Flood Fill tool applies it. Again, see Chapter 10 for more details
Figure 9-14:

168
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Blend modes
Sometimes, you don’t want to overpaint the underlying image; you want to
just tint or infuse the image with a color or increase or decrease color satura-
tion or apply some other quality. The Flood Fill tool has some fancy features,
called blend modes, that combine attributes of your chosen fill, such as hue
and saturation, with the underlying image in complex and subtle ways. In
general, these blend modes are too obscure to be useful for any except the
most dedicated graphics professional. For the rest of us, two of the modes,
Color and Hue, can be occasionally useful because they can infuse an area
with color, although the Colorize command, which we describe in Chapter 7,
does that job quite nicely.
To experiment with blend modes, click the Blend Mode drop-down list on the
Flood Fill tool’s Tool Options palette and choose a mode. Then try filling a
selected area of your image.
Painting an Example: A Halo for Alex
As an example of all this brushing and filling hoo-hah, we have decided that
Dave’s dog Alex is the best-behaved dog in the world. We’re attempting to
convince the Weekly World News tabloid that Alex is such a good dog that he
has a halo. (The Weekly World News may be naïve, but it pays well.)
169
Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling
What about tolerance?
Technical types may be wondering what the
Tolerance control, on the Flood Fill tool’s Tool
Options palette, is good for. In this chapter, we
bypass the need to use that control by instruct-
ing you to select the area you want to fill and
then use a Match mode of None. We think that
that’s the easiest way to fill a specific area.
An alternative to selecting an area beforehand
with a selection tool is to use the Flood Fill tool
itself to determine which pixels are to be filled,
according to their color or other qualities.
Choose a Match mode other than None, and
then set tolerance. The Flood Fill tool deter-
mines what pixels to fill based on those settings,
exactly as the Magic Wand tool does to deter-
mine what pixels to select.

Two problems show up in the current picture of Alex, though, as shown in
Figure 9-15:
 One, he has no halo — but we draw that.
 Two, the Weekly World News uses only black-and-white photos, and that
light slatted background behind Alex isn’t dark enough to make the halo
stand out. We rectify that in eight easy steps!
If you’re reading ahead in this chapter, you may notice that the doorbell
directly above Alex’s head, as shown in all the other pictures of Alex in this
book, isn’t present here. We got rid of that using the Clone Brush; refer to
Chapter 8 to find out how to remove unsightly doorbells from your pictures.
1. Select the slatted background behind Alex.
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, in “Coloring within the Lines By
Using Selection,” you want to select the background to make sure that
you don’t accidentally draw over Alex’s head while you’re changing the
slats. Refer to Chapter 3 for help with getting exactly the selection you
want.
(For the record, we used the Magic Wand Tool set to a Match mode of
Color, a tolerance of 17, a feather of 1, and a large amount of judicious
Shift+clicking to clean up the small patches of unselected areas.)
2. Select the Paint Brush tool from the brush tool group.
3. Change the material (as we discuss in Chapter 3), and then do a test
paint along the edges to make sure that the edges look good.
We selected a dark red material for our paint, but we set the opacity for
our Paint Brush to 50 (half-transparent) so that the slatting still appears
through the paint. As you can see in Figure 9-16, our brush strokes have
stopped at the marquee edge of the selection, right above Alex’s
Buddha-like gaze.
If you don’t see the Tool Options palette, press F4.
Figure 9-15:

170
Part III: Painting Pictures 

4. Paint the entire selected area.
You could also use the Flood Fill tool with a Match set to none. The
Flood Fill tool is at its best, though, on fairly even areas that are mostly
the same color, like the sky in the Fill example earlier in this chapter —
not areas with dark vertical streaks through it, like this one. Besides,
you’re already using the Paint Brush tool, so why switch? The final
results are just as good, as shown in Figure 9-17.
5. Deselect the area.
Alex’s halo needs to be big and impressive. So big and impressive, in
fact, that it sticks out of the current selection — and as long as we have
the background selected, we can’t paint outside the lines. If you don’t
feel like skipping to Chapter 12, where we tell you how to deselect, you
can either press Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪Select None.
6. Select the Airbrush tool from the brush tool group.
A halo is supposed to be fuzzy, so we airbrushed it in. The airbrush also
makes it easy to build up the halo from repeated loops so that we don’t
have to be so careful about shape.

Chapter 9: Basic Painting, Spraying, and Filling

7. Set the Airbrush options on the Tool Options palette and choose your
color (texture, pattern) from the Materials palette.
A halo is supposed to be fuzzy and bright white, so we picked a pure
white color from the Materials palette. We wanted a reasonably small
line for our halo, so a size of 11 seemed about right — and a halo is sup-
posed to be bright, so we cranked up the Opacity to 100 so that the
background doesn’t bleed through.
This process still doesn’t address the “fuzziness” issue — but the
Hardness and Step settings do. We reduced the Hardness to 0 to provide
maximum fuzziness, and we set the Step to 35 to produce a slightly spot-
tier line.
8. Draw a halo.
Keep a steady hand, here! Alex’s reputation is at stake! (see Figure 9-18).
What’s that, you say? It looks fake? Have you ever seen the Weekly World
News?
You may be asking “Isn’t Alex’s halo a little shaky there? Doesn’t Paint Shop
Pro have a tool for drawing perfect shapes, like circles, squares, and elliptic
halos?” Of course, it does — and we show you how to draw better halos in
Chapter 12.

f you do lots of painting, this chapter is the one to check out before you go
flinging your paint brush around with wild abandon. Among other things,
an artiste like you needs the fastest and best ways to choose a color.
Moreover, because you’re so talented, you don’t just paint with color. How
boring and pedestrian! No, you paint with materials in Paint Shop Pro!
Material, in this case, is the Paint Shop Pro term for anything from plain old
solid colors to textured colors, gradients (shaded areas with transitions from
one color to another), or even multihued geometric patterns. You can even
save your carefully designed materials as swatches for future use.
All this excitement springs from the Materials palette, which in Paint Shop
Pro 9 hides more secrets than a black dog hides ticks. Figure 10-1 shows the
palette and some of its more important features.
If the Materials palette isn’t on your screen, press F6 or choose View➪
Palettes➪Materials. Palettes are lumps of useful tools and settings in Paint
Shop Pro; the Materials palette is one of them. You can drag the palettes
around to different places in your Paint Shop Pro window; they stick (dock)
to various edges.
Here’s a quick review of picking color: As we note in Chapter 9, the simplest
way to choose a color is with the Rainbow tab in the Materials dialog box.
(Press F6 to display the Materials palette if it’s not showing already.) Click 

the center, or Rainbow, tab on that palette to display that tab, as shown in
Figure 10-1. On the multihued Rainbow tab, just click the color you want.
(Right-click for background color — we tell you more about background 
color later in this chapter.)
The cursor is a Dropper icon while it’s over the color selection area, to indi-
cate that you pick up a color if you click. As you move the cursor, you see an
enlarged sample of the color your cursor is over. (The numbers are primary
color values that give you the exact numerical color you’re using. We tell you
more about this subject later in this chapter.)

Part III: Painting Pictures 
Choosing paint for each tool separately 
or all tools together
In real life, if you paint with your brush dipped in
red paint and then switch to spray-painting with
a can of green paint, your brush remains red. It
doesn’t switch to green. Of course, in real life
you can’t insert your dog into a picture of Elvis
and then spray-paint him purple, so you have to
assume that Paint Shop Pro is a little stranger
than the world outside your door.
Unless you tell Paint Shop Pro otherwise, it
applies the same style and texture to all the
tools you’re using; if you use the Spray Paint tool
with red paint and a rough texture and then
switch to the Paint Brush tool, the paint brush is
red with a rough texture. You can, however,
choose to change this rather odd behavior by
unchecking the All Tools box on the Materials
palette. Checking All Tools applies your current
paint choice to all tools; deselecting All Tools
means that you choose paint individually for
each tool.

Choosing a Background Color
Paint Shop Pro has two painting colors, called foreground and background.
Foreground just means the color you normally paint with. Background is a sec-
ondary color used for certain operations, or just for convenience when you
switch often between two colors.
To choose a foreground color, you left-click a color on the Materials palette;
to choose background, you right-click. How do you know whether you need
or want a secondary color? It depends on the tool you’re using and how you
intend to use it:
 If you want to be able to switch quickly between painting with one color
and another, you can paint the foreground color by pressing the left
mouse button and the background color by pressing the right mouse
button.
 The Shapes tools require a background color if you want solid shapes. 
If you plan to draw filled-in squares (as opposed to just the outline of a
square), you need to choose a background color to fill the shape in with.
 If you’re using the Eraser tool, you can choose what the eraser leaves
behind: a transparent streak (useful if you’re using layers) or the back-
ground color.
 If you’re using a tool that involves two colors — for example, the Color
Replacer tool to replace one color with another, you need a second 
color — and the background color is that second color. Background
color also provides the fill of filled shapes and text.
To swap the background and foreground materials, click the Material
Switcher (the larger, double-headed arrow), as shown in Figure 10-1. The
background material becomes the foreground, and vice versa. If you want to
swap colors and keep textures or gradients the same, click the smaller arrow.
Choosing Color More Conveniently
Paint Shop Pro offers conveniences for the artist on the go who is in a rush to
choose the correct color. You can choose a recently used material or pick up
a color from the image.
Choosing a basic color or 
a recently used material
You may want to use your everyday, smiley-face yellow — but locating

impossible: Your eyes and fingers can’t be that precise. Likewise, you may
have developed a cool gradient that slid from cool blue to a sea green, but do
you think that you can do that again?
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro gives you another way to choose a recently used
material: the Recent Materials dialog box. The Recent Materials dialog box
also gives you basic black, totally white, and a variety of other basic colors
you can return to again and again.
Here’s how to see this helpful box of recently used materials and basic colors:
1. Right-click the Foreground (or Background) Material Properties box,
whichever one you want to set.
The Recent Materials dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-2. The
ten most recent materials you have used appear along the top two rows;
ten standard colors appear along the bottom rows (including black,
white, and two shades of gray). If the colors have circles with slashes,
you’re using an image that has its own palette of colors, and those
colors aren’t part of its palette.
Colors in the bottom two basic-color rows are pure colors — except for
the grays — that is, they’re the reddest red, bluest blue, magenta-est
magenta, and so on.
Technically speaking, the top row contains the pure red, green, and blue
primary colors of radiant light. The second row contains the pure cyan,
magenta, and yellow primary colors of printed ink.
2. Click any color or material to choose it (or press the Esc key if you see
nothing you like).
The Recent Materials dialog box disappears immediately. The color you
clicked is now chosen and appears in the color sample on the Materials
palette.
You may think that right-clicking in the Recent Materials dialog box
would choose the background color, as it does on the Materials palette.
You would be wrong. Right-clicking does nothing here.

To get shades of color other than the ones you see in the Recent Materials
dialog box, click the Other button. This button takes you to the Material
Properties dialog box. See the upcoming section “Choosing a Color for the
Very Picky,” for details.
Choosing a recently used color
If it’s simply color you’re interested in, not material with all its textures and
gradients and stuff, follow this approach — it remembers more colors than
the Recent Materials dialog box does:
1. Right-click the small Foreground or Background Color box —
whichever one you want to set.
The Recent Colors dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-3. The ten
most recent colors you have used are in the top two rows of the dialog
box, and the ten pure colors — exactly the same colors from the Recent
Materials box — are in the bottom two rows. If the colors have circles
with slashes, you’re using a palette image, and those colors aren’t 
available.
2. Click any color to choose it (or press the Esc key if you see nothing
you like).
The Recent Colors dialog box disappears immediately. The color you
clicked is now chosen and appears in the color sample in both the Color
and Materials boxes.
Choosing a color from your picture
Sometimes, the easiest way to choose a color is to pick up that color from
your picture. You have two ways to pick up color. Choose the one that makes
your life easier:
 When using any tool that applies paint (for example, the Paint Brush tool),
hold down the Ctrl button and the cursor turns into a Dropper icon. Left-
click to pick up foreground color, and right-click for background color.

Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

 On the Tools toolbar, click the Dropper tool icon, as shown in the margin.
(If you see no Dropper icon, you may have been using the Color Replacer
tool — click the Color Replacer tool and select the Dropper icon from the
drop-down menu.) The cursor turns into a Dropper icon. Left-click to pick
up foreground color, and right-click for background color.
If you have deselected the All Tools check box, colors you select for one tool
don’t apply to other tools.
Choosing Color for the Slightly Picky
If you need a slightly more precise way to choose color, try the Frame tab in
the Material Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-4. The Frame tab
lets you choose the basic color (hue) by clicking a frame, and then lightness
by clicking in the center.
To choose a hue (yellow, for example), first click the hue in the frame. The
center of the frame becomes shades of that hue.
Then, click in the center of the frame to choose how light or dark you want
that hue to be. The foreground color box reflects your choice. To access a
bigger version of the same color-picking technique, see the next section.
Choosing a Color for the Very Picky
Choosing a color from one of the Materials palette’s tabs area is all well and
good, but the palette is so small that you can’t be precise. What if you’re very
picky?
Figure 10-4:

tab. Choose
the basic

ness or

178
Part III: Painting Pictures 

To choose a color more precisely, left-click the Foreground or Background
properties box (whichever color you want to set). Those are the big squares
on the Materials palette.
The amazingly colorful Material Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 10-5. (If the foreground or background material has a gradient or pat-
tern, their respective dialog boxes are displayed. Don’t worry: A row of tabs
is at the top. Click the Color tab.)
Precise color using the color wheel
The color wheel works just like the Frame tab, as described in the preceding
section — it’s just bigger, and round rather than rectangular. The callouts
shown in Figure 10-5 give the details. You need to follow only three steps:
1. Drag the little circle on the color wheel to the basic hue you want.
2. Drag the little circle on the square to the precise shade you want.

The Current swatch, in the lower-right corner of the dialog box, shows
exactly which color you’re choosing, overlaid with any textures you
have selected. (The Previous swatch shows the color you started with.)
3. Click OK.
Your color has been changed.
Additional shades of basic colors
The Color tab in the Material Properties dialog box (as shown in Figure 10-5)
is also home to 48 basic colors. These colors are shades of 6 primary colors
(red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta) plus 6 shades of gray (including
white and black).
Open the Color dialog box as usual by clicking either the Foreground or
Background Material Properties box and selecting the Color tab.
Choose a basic color by clicking it in the Basic Colors area, in the middle-left
corner of the dialog box. Click OK and your foreground or background color
is changed to your chosen color.
Precise color adjustments — 
by the numbers
Just as saying “1 foot, 3 inches” is much more precise than saying “a little
bigger than my shoe,” choosing a color by using numbers is much more pre-
cise than clicking it on a palette or color wheel. But, how can you do color by
the numbers?
180
Part III: Painting Pictures 
Creating shadows and highlights
For brushing highlights or shadows onto an
object, you often want a color that’s the same
hue as an existing one — just a little lighter or
darker. Pick up the existing color from your pic-
ture and make it the foreground color by click-
ing it with the Dropper tool.
Click the Foreground and Stroke Properties
square on the Materials palette to bring up the
Material Properties dialog box, and then click
the Color tab, if it isn’t already selected. In the
Saturation/Lightness box, drag the tiny circle up
to make a shadow color, or down to make a
highlight color.

As it turns out, you can specify any color by using just three values.
Adjusting these values independently gives you more control. For example,
you can change just the lightness of a color and be certain that you haven’t
changed the hue.
The situation is like measuring distance, where you can use either the English
(feet, inches) or metric (meters) systems. In Paint Shop Pro you can use one
of three alternative systems to specify colors: Hue/Saturation/Lightness (HSL,
to its friends) or Red/Green/Blue (known as RGB) or HTML.
The Color tab in the Material Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-5,
shows the three values that describe your chosen color in all three systems
(RGB, HSL, and HTML). The area displays values for Red, Green, and Blue (on
the left) and Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (on the right). When you choose
a new color using any control in this dialog box, those numbers change. In
value, the numbers range from 0 to 255. An optional visual control appears
when you click and hold the down arrow at the far right end of a value box
(see Figure 10-6). The easiest way to adjust this value is with the slider con-
trol at the bottom.
To adjust a color precisely, you can change the numbers in either the RGB or
HSL value boxes (your choice). For example, do you want more red? Use the
RGB controls and increase the value in the Red box. More yellow? To use 
the RGB controls, you would have to know that red and green make yellow 
in the RGB system and then increase the values in Red and Green (perhaps
decreasing the value in Blue).
The HTML value is a numerical representation of the three RGB values, ren-
dered into one hexadecimal code that Web browsers like Internet Explorer
can understand. You should never try to adjust a color by using the HTML
value. If you’re designing for the Web, though, the only way to tell a browser
that a sidebar should be precisely this shade of red is to use hexadecimals. If
you’re a Web designer, you know that you can use the HTML value within the
color attributes of HTML; if you’re not, you can safely ignore this section and
go in peace.
Figure 10-6:
Achieving a
numerically
precise
color.
181
Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

Using the HSL values is sometimes a more intuitive alternative to using the
RGB values. HSL values are connected to the controls on the color wheel and
the Saturation/Lightness box. Here’s how they work:
 Hue: The Hue value connects to your chosen position on the Color
wheel, beginning at zero at the top (red) and increasing as you go
around the circle counterclockwise. As you increase the number, the hue
passes through red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet, and magenta.
 Saturation: The Saturation value connects to horizontal motion in the
Saturation/Lightness box: left (for a lower value) or right (for a higher
value). Use a higher value for a more intense (saturated) color.
 Lightness: The Lightness value connects to vertical motion in the
Saturation/Lightness box: up (for a lower value) or down (for a higher
value). Use a higher value for a lighter color.
As with any value box in a Windows program, you can change the values by
either typing new numbers or clicking the tiny up and down arrows to gradu-
ally increase or decrease the value.
A more visual way to fiddle with the RGB or HSL values is to click the down
arrow at the far right end of any of the RGB or HSL value boxes. As Figure 10-6
demonstrates, a multicolored bar appears, showing the range of colors you
can achieve by dragging left or right. While holding the mouse button down,
drag left or right to choose a color. Release the button when you’re done.
Working with 256 Colors or Fewer
Images that have 256 colors or fewer are palette images: They use only a spe-
cific set of colors — the image’s palette of available colors. You can change
any of those colors individually, but you can’t have any more colors than the
palette size (color depth) allows.
You don’t have to continue to live with this limitation. Press Ctrl+Shift+0 to
increase the image to 16 million colors (full color) and then you can skip all
the following stuff.
To choose colors in a palette image, click one of the Material Property boxes
and select the Color tab from the Material Properties dialog box. You see a
somewhat larger view of the palette. To reorder the colors, click the Sort
Order drop-down list box and choose either Palette Order (an arbitrary, num-
bered order), By Luminance (ordered from light to dark), or By Hue (ordered
by color). To choose a color, click it; then click OK.
To change any color on the image’s palette (or change a black square to some
other color), choose Image➪Palette➪Edit Palette. The Edit Palette dialog box
that appears is identical to the Select Color from Palette dialog box, with one
182
Part III: Painting Pictures 

exception: If you double-click any color on the palette, the Color tab in the
Material Properties dialog box is displayed. See the section “Choosing a Color
for the Very Picky,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions on choosing a
color in this dialog box.
Going Beyond Plain Paint
Going beyond plain paint to something fancier means getting something
straight in your head, first. Here’s what to remember:
Paint Shop Pro can paint with any of three styles of paint:
 Color: Plain, solid color
 Gradient: Smooth transitions between two colors
 Pattern: Any pattern of multiple colors, or even an image
To any of these three types of paint, you can add texture. Texture is an effect
similar to what you would create by doing a “rubbing” over some textured
surface. (Place paper over a coin and then rub the paper with a pencil tip —
you’re doing a rubbing. Oh, come on — you must have done this.)
A quick way to choose style is with one tiny button, under the Foreground
Properties (and Background Properties) box. Click one to choose plain paint,
gradient paint, or pattern. Figure 10-7 shows you how the button works.
A tiny menu flies out and displays icons for the three styles (color, gradient,
and pattern, in order). Any icons that are grayed out aren’t available in your
chosen tool.
You don’t have to use these buttons. The alternative is just to click the
Foreground or Background Properties box and then click the tab for Color,
Gradient, or Pattern. Details follow!

Choosing gradients
Click the Foreground (or Background) Properties box on the Color palette.
The Material Properties dialog box appears. Click the Gradient (center) tab in
this dialog box and you see what’s shown in Figure 10-8.
Here’s what to do:
1. Choose a gradient style by clicking one of the buttons in the Style area
that appears on the right side of the Gradient dialog box (refer to
Figure 10-8).
Each button depicts a different kind of gradient: from side to side, from
center to edges in a rectangular or circular fashion, or proceeding radi-
ally around in a circle. The Preview box on the left then displays a gradi-
ent in your chosen style.
2. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the Preview box and
choose from the ultrafabulous gallery of gradients that appears.
The colors of all choices are prechosen, except for those that use the
terms foreground and background. Those choices make use of whatever
foreground or background colors are current at the time you paint with
this gradient. Click your choice.
3. Customize the angle or center of the gradient by dragging the control
in the Preview window.

184
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Gradients in the linear style (Linear is the leftmost button in the Style
column) have an angle setting. In the preview window, drag the gadget
that looks like the hand on a clock to set the angle.
Gradients in other styles have a center point. In the Preview window,
drag the crosshairs to set the center point.
4. Make the gradient pattern repeat several times, if you want.
Increase the number in the Repeats value box.
5. Click OK.
Your chosen gradient appears in the Properties box that you originally
clicked (Foreground or Background) on the Materials palette.
Creating gradients in your choice of colors is easy, although not many pat-
terns are available for that purpose. Choose a foreground or background
color or both as the one or two colors for your gradient. In the gradient
gallery, choose any gradient you like that uses the term foreground or 
background.
Creating your own gradient patterns is possible, as is altering the existing
ones, but — wow! It’s definitely not a Dummies kind of project. If you want to
fool around with the controls, click the Edit button on the Gradient tab in the
Material Properties dialog box to access the Gradient Editor dialog box.
Whoa! Have fun; try dragging the little pointers around, and good luck.
Painting with gradients
Gradients fill a painted area with a series of colors. When you paint with a
gradient by using the Text, Draw, or Preset Shapes tools, or fill with a selec-
tion by using the Flood Fill tool, Paint Shop Pro scales the gradient to fit
within the object you have created or area you have selected. For example, 
to apply to the sky in your photo a sunset-like gradient from blue to orange,
select the sky and use the Flood Fill tool. Paint Shop Pro ensures that the full
range of colors (blue to orange) fills the sky area. Or, if you create text and
use a gradient style, the text displays the full range of colors.
If you paint with the Paint Brush or Air Brush tool, however, the gradient is
scaled to the entire image. If you paint with a sunset-like blue-to-orange gradi-
ent, anything painted near the top of the image is blue and anything near the
bottom is orange.
Choosing patterns
Patterns are interesting surface images, like brick or wood, or other more
exotic or creative patterns not found in nature. Their colors are fixed, like
185
Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

those in a photograph, and are unaffected by your choice of foreground or
background color. The patterns that come with Paint Shop Pro are seamless,
which means that they can maintain an unbroken pattern and fill any area
without appearing like tiles (with distinct edges). The process of choosing a
pattern is much like choosing a gradient.
Click the Foreground (or Background) Properties box on the Color palette,
and in the Material Properties dialog box that appears, select the Pattern tab.
The Pattern tab slightly resembles the Gradient tab, as shown in Figure 10-8,
but it’s not as complicated. A box on the Gradient tab shows a preview of the
selected pattern.
With the pattern tab of the Material Properties dialog box displayed, follow
these steps:
1. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the preview box and
choose from the boffo gallery of patterns that appears.
The preview box now shows your choice.
2. Customize the angle of the pattern by dragging the clock-hand Angle
control to point in any direction.
3. Click OK.
Your chosen pattern appears in the Material box.
To apply a pattern to an existing image, try the Sculpture effect and set its
Depth control to 1. We describe artistic effects and how to use them in
Chapter 13.
Applying a Texture
Textures give a result like rubbing chalk on concrete, or like spraying ink on
your body and rolling on the floor. (Let us know if you try this latter activity —
and send us a copy.) Paint Shop Pro supplies a variety of textures, such as con-
crete, construction paper, and bricks. When you use one, anything you do with
the Paint Brush, Erase, Airbrush, Fill, Text, Draw, or Preset Shapes tools dis-
plays that texture. Textures don’t change your choice of color and they work
with any style: solid color, gradients, or patterns.
You can apply texture to either the foreground material, the background
material, or both; you can turn textures on or off by clicking the texture
button on the Materials palette (the middle of three tiny buttons under the
Foreground or Background Properties box.)
186
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Or, you can use the Material Properties dialog box that pops up whenever
you click the Foreground (or Background) Properties box. Texture is nor-
mally turned off (disabled). To use a texture, follow these steps:
1. On the Materials palette, click the Foreground (or Background)
Properties box.
Figure 10-9 shows the dialog box that appears. Regardless of whether
the Material Properties dialog box is asking for color, gradient, or pat-
tern, the texture information is always on the right side.
2. If the Texture check box isn’t checked, check it.
Or, alternatively, if you don’t want texture right now, uncheck it.
3. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the texture sample.
A gallery of textures appears, as shown in Figure 10-10. Scroll down the
gallery to find a texture you like.
4. Click the texture you want in the gallery.
The gallery disappears and the sample area of the Texture dialog box
shows your chosen texture.
5. Customize the angle or scale of the texture by dragging the controls in
the Preview window.
Textures have an angle setting that allows you to spin it around to point
in any direction you want them to face. In the Preview window, drag the
gadget that looks like the hand on a clock to set the angle.
You can also make the texture larger or smaller by typing different per-
centages in the Scale box; you can shrink the texture to a tiny 10 percent
of its normal size or swell it to a massive 250 percent.
Figure 10-9:

6. Click OK in the Material Properties dialog box.
The Foreground or Background Properties box you originally clicked dis-
plays your chosen texture, laid over the top of any colors, gradients, or
patterns you have selected.
Now, anything you create or erase appears textured.
Paint Shop Pro remembers the last texture you used — so even if you stop
using a texture, all you have to do click the appropriate Material box to bring
up this dialog box again and then click the check box to reenable it.

Part III: Painting Pictures 
Texture thins your paint
When you use texture, paint goes on thin (with
low opacity) with each click or stroke. Make
repeated strokes or scribble with your paint tool
to build up the thickness.
Do likewise for the eraser: Only a thin layer of
paint comes off with each pass. Disable the
Texture option and, on the Tool Options palette,
set the Opacity option to 100 to erase fully in a
single stroke.
When you use texture with the Fill tool, make
repeated clicks if you need to increase the
opacity.

Storing Swatches to Use Again
After you have done all your texturing and gradienting and coloring, some-
times you don’t want to have to re-create it all again the next day. The
Swatches tab in the Materials box also provides a place to store swatches of
material to save the colors and patterns you want to use repeatedly.
To see these swatches, click the Swatch tab on the Materials palette. It’s the
third tab, with the checkerboard icon, and looks like Figure 10-11.
A swatch is a combination of a color and any effects, like textures or patterns,
that you have applied to them. It’s still a material even if you haven’t applied
any textures or patterns to the color.
To save a swatch, follow these steps:
1. Click the Properties box of the material you want to save — fore-
ground or background.
The Material Properties dialog box appears.
2. Click the Add to Swatches button.
This step displays a dialog box in which you’re asked to name your col-
orful creation. Name it as you like, and then click OK.
Your material is now stored on the Swatches tab, ready to be accessed when-
ever you want. Click OK if you’re done using the Material Properties dialog box.
Alternatively, if you’re not as nearsighted as we are, you can click the tiny
Create New Swatch button instead. It’s the second button on the Swatches
tab of the Materials palette, just under all the swatches. We would reproduce
it here, but it would look just as blobby as it does in real life.

Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

Using a Stored Material
Using a stored material is so easy that you can do it in two clicks. Of course,
if you have a number of swatches, sorting through them all can be cumber-
some. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Swatches tab on the Materials palette, as shown in 
Figure 10-11, in the preceding section.
2. If you need to narrow the number of available swatches in order to
find one, left-click the View button of the Swatches tab and hold the
button down.
A drop-down menu appears, where you can choose one of four options:
all swatches, colors only, gradients only, or patterns only. Choosing one
hides all others until you change the view.
To find out more about each swatch, hover the cursor over the swatch; a
small, informational pop-up message appears, giving you the name of
the swatch in question, the RGB numbers, the types of textures in the
swatch, and the names of the gradients and patterns used.
3. Click the swatch you want to use.
Left-click it if you want it to be in the Foreground Properties; right-click if
you want it to be in the Background Material box. Whatever tool you use
next is now loaded up with that swatch’s material.
Deleting a Stored Material
Deleting a swatch is so easy that it’s scandalous we’re getting paid to tell you
how to do it (don’t worry — writing the rest of this chapter was darned hard
work):
1. Select the swatch you want to delete.
Remember that you can sort through the swatches if you need to hunt
one down, as discussed in the preceding section.
2. Click the Delete button on the Swatches tab.
Using Pastiches of Pictures
Imagine a paint tube that, rather than contain paint, is crammed with images
that pour out as you squeeze the tube. You now have a good mental image of
190
Part III: Painting Pictures 

the Paint Shop Pro Picture Tube tool. Paint Shop Pro comes with a gallery of
tubes to use.
Each tube contains a set of images on a particular theme. For example, you
can squeeze out a set of airplanes, butterflies, billiard balls, or coins. Each
individual image in a tube is different. Figure 10-12 shows an illustration that
uses two tubes: various blades of grass and many raindrops.
Picture tubes have several purposes. They can serve as
 A source of clip art on various themes
 Brushes for interesting textures and shapes, such as grass, fire, or 
3-dimensional tubes
 Creative painting tools that are sensitive to your brush strokes
Basic tubing
Picture tubing is fundamentally easy. You choose what kind of pictures you
want and click or drag the picture tube across the image. Here are the details:
1. Click the Picture Tube tool (as shown in the margin) on the toolbar.
You may have to wait when you first choose this tool because Paint
Shop Pro loads its cache with pictures. A Cache Status box may briefly
appear.

191
Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

2. Choose which picture set you want from the Tool Options palette.
A sample image from the selected picture tube appears next to the
Presets menu. Click the down arrow to the right of that sample to reveal
a gallery of picture tubes of different types. Some picture tube pictures
aren’t much to look at individually, like the 3-D items, but they create
cool effects when you drag your brush. Scroll through those images to
review them, and then click the one you want.
3. Click in the image window to deposit one picture at a time or drag to
paint a line of pictures.
As you click or drag, various pictures similar to the sample you chose
appear at intervals on the image. (If the image isn’t much bigger than an
individual picture, few pictures may appear. See the following section for
instructions on reducing the picture size.)
One common way to use picture tubes is as a sort of randomly chosen clip art
to ornament an illustration. Figure 10-12, for example, uses a single animal
from the Animals image set. Choose a tube and then click the illustration in
various places to drop in some art; press Ctrl+Z if you don’t like one and want
to try the next image. Other tubes are meant to be dragged to create a banner,
like Filmstrip, Rope, and Neon Pink. In Figure 10-12, we used the Lawn tube to
create the basic marsh and the Grass tube to create the tall vegetation.
Adjusting basic tube behavior
If the Picture Tube tool doesn’t deliver images in quite the way you want, you
can change its behavior. Behaviors you can modify include
 Picture size: Reduce the number in the Scale value box if the pictures
are too large. Scale is initially set to 100 (percent), the largest setting.
 Spacing between pictures: Pictures initially flow off the brush at a cer-
tain preset spacing. Increase the step value on the Tool Options palette
to separate pictures. To jam them together, decrease the value.
 Regular or random spacing: The Picture Tube tool is initially set to ran-
domly vary the spacing between pictures as you drag. To make it deliver
an evenly spaced stream of pictures, choose Continuous from the
Placement Mode drop-down menu, on the Tool Options palette.
 Picture sequence: The tool is initially set to choose pictures randomly
from its set of images. To have it select images in sequence, choose
Incremental from the Selection Mode drop-down menu, on the Tool
Options palette.
The artist who created the tube determined the sequence. For each
stroke you make, the sequence picks up where you last left off. The tube
doesn’t repeat the initial picture until it has delivered the last picture.
192
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Angling to follow your brush stroke: Some images, like butterflies, are
ordered so that they angle themselves to follow your brush stroke;
choose Angular under Selection Mode on the Tool Options palette.
Art Media: For Those 
Who Miss Real Paint
Those of us who were born while the earth was still cooling remember a
primitive art medium involving suspensions of minerals in oil called paint
and surfaces made of plant fiber called canvas. If you’re nostalgic for the
smell of turpentine, well, go sniff a cleaning rag because Art Media can’t 
help you there.
But, if you long to be able to create brush-like strokes, blend colors on a
palette or on your canvas, work with wet paint, brush over dried paint, and
still have all the digital whoop-te-doo of Paint Shop Pro’s digital features,
expose yourself to Art Media!
Art Media is really a separate world in Paint Shop Pro. Art Media uses a spe-
cial tool group on the Tools toolbar, as shown in Figure 10-13. You can use 
Art Media tools only on Art Media layers or backgrounds (canvases). This
restriction is consistent: You can use only vector tools (like Rectangle) on
vector layers and only bitmap tools (like the regular paint brush) on bitmap
layers. If you try to use regular tools on an Art Media layer, Paint Shop Pro
asks permission to convert the layer to raster. The good news is that you can
add Art Media layers to an image with regular bitmap layers or vector layers.
To use layers, see Chapter 11.
Art Media would be a great stage name for a TV art instructor. We ask only

Creating an Art Media canvas or layer
To paint with Art Media, you need an Art Media layer. You can start a new
image by using an Art Media background layer or add an Art Media layer to
an existing image.

Starting a fresh Art Media canvas
To start a new image where Art Media is the background layer (that is, a new
Art Media canvas), follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New or press Ctrl+N.
The New Image dialog box appears. Determine the settings for image
dimensions. For help, see the section “Starting a Fresh Canvas,” in
Chapter 9.
2. Choose Art Media Background in the Image Characteristics section of
the dialog box.
3. Click the sample square in the Select the Canvas Texture area.
A flyout panel displays different Art Media canvas textures.
4. Click whatever canvas you like.
If you want the canvas to have a color, click the Enable Fill Color check
box; then click the sample square under the check box to bring up the
Color dialog box. See the section “Precise color using the color wheel,”
earlier in this chapter, for help in using the color wheel in this dialog
box.
5. Click OK.
Your new canvas appears.

Creating an Art Media layer
Art media layers can add “hand-painted” elements to raster and vector
layers. See Color Plate C-10 in the color section of this book for an example.
1. Choose Layers➪New Art Media Layer.
2. In the Art Media layer dialog box that appears, enter a name for your
layer in the Name field.
If you don’t see the Name field, click the General tab in this dialog box.
3. Click the Canvas Texture tab.
4. Click the sample square in the Select the Canvas Texture area.
A flyout panel displays different Art Media canvas textures.
5. Click whatever canvas texture you like.
If you want the layer to have a color, click the Enable Fill Color check
box; then click the sample square under the check box to bring up the
Color dialog box. See the section “Precise color using the color wheel,”
earlier in this chapter, for help in using the color wheel in this dialog
box.
6. Click OK in the New Art Media Layer dialog box.
Your new layer appears.
Pretending that you have real media
Art Media tools, like computer book authors, live in their own, special world
that is as close to reality as technology can achieve. Figure 10-13 shows you
where Art Media hang out on the Tools toolbar. You get a nifty toolbox of oil-
paint brushes, chalk, crayons, pencils, markers, a palette knife, a smearing
tool to keep your fingers clean, and a special eraser that you cannot chew on.
What is it about real paint, chalk, crayon, canvas, and the like that make them
different from digital media? Here are a few characteristics:
 Surfaces have texture.
 Brushes run out of paint — how fast depends on how heavily you “load”
the brush. They also can be cleaned between colors — or not.
 Brushes mix paint as you drag them through it.
 Brushes have bristles of different firmness and bristle size.
 Some tools (like brushes and markers) have thin tips that can give an
effect like a calligraphy tool, depending on how much you rotate the
head as you make a stroke.
195
Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

 Some tools, like pencils, can mark more heavily on one side of the stroke
than the other if you tilt them. Others, like crayons, may mark more
heavily in the middle.
These are the effects that Art Media tools duplicate — and pretty well, too.
You set these effects on the Tool Options palette, as you discover in the fol-
lowing sections.
Figure 10-14 shows a little of what you can achieve with Art Media. On the left
is Oil Paint, which shows the natural blending that takes place on wet paint.
The other marks are dry media: chalk, pastel, crayon, colored pencil, and
marker (from left to right).
For the easiest adjustment of various controls on the Options palette and
elsewhere in Paint Shop Pro, use the slider control where it appears. To the
right of any numerical adjustment is a button with the downward-pointing V.
With your cursor on this V, hold down the left mouse button. A slider appears
with a visual representation of what you’re adjusting (brush size or color, for
example). Drag to the setting you want.
Setting up the basics of your Art Media tool
Before you make a stroke, you at least want to set the tool size on the Tool
Options palette. Press F4 to pop up the Tool Options palette, and adjust the
following settings to your liking:
 Size: Adjust the size as you would for any tool: Adjust the Size value up
or down.
Figure 10-14:
Some of the
Art Media
media.
196
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Shape: Shape is also pretty obvious; choose round or square. When you
make a stroke, you don’t see much difference unless, for a square shape,
you choose fixed head tracking (see the bullet in the following section).
 Trace: Enabling the Trace check box makes the tool pick up color from
the underlying layer.
If your Art Media tool seems to switch color as soon as you click the canvas,
you may have Trace accidentally selected. Click the check box to clear it and
deselect Trace.
Getting calligraphy-like strokes
If you want calligraphic strokes that get wider and narrower as you go verti-
cally or horizontally, set the following options on the Tool Options palette:
 Thickness: Some tools don’t appear to let you set thickness (the control
is grayed out), but, if you set a tool’s head tracking to Fixed Angle, it
allows a thickness adjustment.
 Rotation: This control sets the rotation of the tool’s head in degrees.
(Use the slider control to set rotation visually.)
 Head tracking: Computer book authors often lose their heads and wish
for head tracking, but, we digress. Head tracking has to do with whether
the tool rotates to give you a constant width as you make a curving
stroke — or not. For constant width, choose Track Path; for calligraphic-
style work, choose Fixed angle. If you choose Fixed Angle, set the angle
by using the Rotation control.
Controlling colored pencil strokes
Colored pencils make variable-weight strokes depending on how you hold
them. The Tool Options palette offers two styles to “hold” your brush:
 Style: Choose Point for a line that is heavier in the center. Choose Tilt for
a line weighted to one side, and Edge for a similar effect, but broader.
Control which side of the line is weighted by stroking up versus down on
a vertical line and left versus right on a horizontal line.
 Softness: A higher Softness value produces a line that is denser in the
center than a low Softness value does.
Controlling paint with the Oil Brush and Palette Knife
The Oil Brush (and, to some extent, the Palette Knife) have special controls
that you want to set up on the Tool Options palette:
 Paint Loading: A high value means lots of paint on the brush; a low
value means that the brush runs out more quickly.
 Viscosity: Viscosity measures how gooey the paint is (as opposed to
runny). High viscosity paint starts out dense but runs dry quickly. Low
197
Chapter 10: Advanced Painting for the Artiste

viscosity paint goes on thinner at first but lasts longer on the brush
stroke.
 Auto Clean: This option vacuums your automobile. No, sorry — if this
check box is enabled, it means that your brush is cleaned of color
between strokes and then dipped in pure foreground color. If you clear
this check box, your brush retains a certain amount of color from the
last stroke.
 Clean: Whenever you click Clean, Paint Shop Pro cleans existing color
from your brush and then dips the brush afresh into the foreground
color.
Brush firmness doesn’t make much difference if you’re using a mouse. A 
pressure-sensitive pad would allow it to make a difference. The bristle size is
also a bit too subtle for us to care about it. You may find a reason to care.
Erasing and smearing
To erase Art Media, use the Art Eraser. You need several strokes of the eraser
to totally erase Art Media.
The edge is somewhat indistinct. No controls exist to modify the sharpness
of the eraser’s edge or how fast it erases. But, if you click Presets on the Tool
Options palette, you can choose various shapes from the menu that appears.
Sometimes you just want to run your finger through the paint. Paint Shop Pro
gives you the digital finger you need, in the Smear tool. Unlike what you
could achieve with your fingertip, which is pretty round, you can do calli-
graphic smearing by choosing any of various tip shapes from the Presets
menu. See the section “Getting calligraphy-like strokes,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for other controls, like head tracking, that affect artistic use of the Art
Eraser or Smear tool.
Mixing colors on the mixer
Ha! Software vendors have been calling their color-selector thingies “palettes”
for so long that the folks at Jasc got stuck using the term mixer when technol-
ogy finally allowed them to provide a real palette. A real palette is a place
where you can mush colors together with a palette knife to get the color (or
band of colors) you want to use. The Paint Shop Pro version of this feature is
the Mixer.
You can use the mixer with any coloring tool in the art media tool group. To
use the mixer, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Palettes➪Mixer or press Shift+F6.
(F6 is the Materials palette, so Shift+F6 makes sense for the Mixer.) The
Mixer palette appears, as shown in Figure 10-15. Use the tube icon to
198
Part III: Painting Pictures 

pick up and place colors on the Mixer, use the Mixer Knife to mix colors,
and then click the Mixer Dropper on the color you want.
The Mixer palette is misshapen and ugly if it appears docked to the top
of the window. Drag it by its title bar at the left end until it floats.
2. Click the tube icon in the upper-left corner of the Mixer to pick up
some color.
3. To pick up color from the Materials palette (press F6 to see that
palette), click any of the colors displayed there.
If you’re in the middle of painting with an Art Media tool, you can pick
up color from the canvas by Ctrl+clicking that color.
4. Click the Mixer to place a spot of color there.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to place additional colors in the Mixer. You can
start smearing on the Mixer even while the tube tool is selected.
5. Click the Mixer Knife icon at the top of the Mixer.
6. Smear the paint samples together to create the blend you like.
If you want stripey paint, it’s okay not to thoroughly mix the colors. To
undo a mix, click the Unmix button, at the bottom of the Mixer. To start
with a clean Mixer page, click the New Page button, in the lower-left
corner.
7. Click the Mixer Dropper, at the top of the Mixer.
8. Click the Mixer where you like the paint blend.
Notice that the foreground material on the Materials palette reflects
whatever you click — including stripes! When you use dry media, like
chalk, you can set the pixel size.
Now, you’re ready to paint with your own unique blend of paint.

The Mixer is larger than you think. To get more room to work, drag the lower-
right corner of the Mixer palette to expand the palette. To see hidden areas of
the Mixer, click the cross-arrow Navigate icon, under the Mixer window and
on the large-scale view of the Mixer that pops up.
Drying and wetting paint
Paint that has been applied to a layer normally smears (very artistically)
when you drag your brush through it. If you don’t want that smearing, dry
the current layer:
Choose Layers➪Dry Art Media Layer. Now, your existing paint doesn’t smear.
New paint that you apply, however, is wet!
If you want to make old paint wet again, choose Layers➪Wet Art Media Layer.

T
he old masters of oil painting used layers of paint to give their paintings
great depth and radiance. Now, artistic masters (who all work in Paint
Shop Pro, of course) use layers for another reason: It makes changing stuff
lots easier. It also lets you combine images more easily.
Layers are like transparent sheets of plastic that are laid over an opaque
(nontransparent) background. You can put stuff on the background layer or
on the other, transparent layers.
As simple as this basic idea is, Paint Shop Pro uses it to give you lots of flexi-
bility and power in creating stunning images. To see what using layers can do
for you, read on!
Putting Layers to Work for You
With layers, you can paint, erase, or move things around without worrying
about ruining the underlying image. You can erase a line, for example, 

without erasing the background. You can move an entire object or see how
something looks without permanently committing yourself to it. You can also
combine images in various clever ways.
Because Paint Shop Pro layers are electronic, not physical, they can make
your life easier in other ways, too. Here are just a few special tricks you can
do, besides simply painting, moving, combining, or erasing images:
 Select an object painted on a layer without accidentally selecting other
areas of the same color or that underlie that object.
 Make an image partly transparent, a sort of ghost on the background.
 Switch image objects into or out of the picture, as needed, or quickly
change their stacking order.
 Combine layers into one layer, if you’re certain that no more changes are
needed, or lock several layers together temporarily to form a moveable
group of objects.
 Make vector layers, which enable you to create basic shapes, text, and
other objects in a special form that lets you easily change their shape.
 Make an adjustment layer (a brightening layer, for example) that affects
only the underlying layers and which effect you can vary.
 Create the frames of an animation by simply moving one or more layers.
 Make layers interact, for special effects. For example, you can subtract
one layer from another — a way to reveal changes between photographs.
Getting Layers
Your parents probably never explained where layers come from — unless, of
course, you grew up on an egg ranch. Here’s the real story.
You always have at least one layer: the background layer. That’s the layer
where nearly everything happens until you add more layers. If you down-
load a digital photo from your camera, for example, the image is on the back-
ground layer. If you happily paint away, ignorant of all knowledge of layers, 
all your painting is on the background layer.
You can get images with additional layers in a variety of ways:
 Make a new, blank layer by using the various New commands on the
Layers menu (on the menu bar) or by using the Layer palette.
 Turn a selection into a layer (promote it, in Paint Shop Pro terms).
 Incidentally, make a new vector layer by drawing lines or shapes or by
adding text.
202
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Make a new raster layer by using a tool, like the Deformation tool, that
requires a layer to work on, and Paint Shop Pro creates one automati-
cally for you.
 Paste an image from the Windows Clipboard by choosing Edit➪Paste➪
As New Layer.
 Open an image file that already has multiple layers, such as many Paint
Shop Pro or Photoshop files have.
 Add a picture frame with the Image➪Picture Frame command.
Calling a Pal for Help: The Layer Palette
The first thing you should do when you’re working with layers is to call a
friend for help. The Layer palette, as shown in Figure 11-1, is your best pal.
It’s a small pal; hence, the name palette. See how things make sense, after
they’re explained?
If your little pal isn’t on your screen already, call it by pressing F8 on the key-
board or click the Toggle Layers button on the toolbar. Do the same thing to
hide the palette again.
One of the not-so-adorable Paint Shop Pro quirks is that sometimes it opens
the Layer palette so that the names of the layers (and, hence, the only way to
select a layer) are hidden. Your Layer palette should look like ours, with at
least the Background layer visible on the far left side; if it doesn’t, right-click
and drag the vertical bar immediately to the left of the Visibility toggle (the
little eye) and drag it rightward to reveal all.
Here are a few basic factoids to help you get along with your new and complex-
looking pal:
 Each row of the palette represents a layer. Your view of the image 
in the image window is down through the layers, from top to bottom
Figure 11-1:
Your pal, 
the Layer
palette, is at
your side to
help you
with layer
stuff.
203
Chapter 11: Layering Images

(background). The layers’ names are on the left side of the palette. You
assign names when you create the layers, or else you allow Paint Shop
Pro to create a boring but adequate name, like Layer3. Paint Shop Pro
automatically calls the initial, background layer (the one that every
image starts with) Background.
 To work on a layer, click its name. Clicking its name makes that layer
the active one. Nearly everything you can do to an image in Paint Shop
Pro, such as paint, erase, or fiddle with the colors, affects only the active
layer. The palette helps you remember which one is active.
 The icon to the left of each row tells you what kind of layer that row
represents. Four kinds of layers exist: raster, vector, grouped, and
adjustment. You use raster layers most often. See the section after next,
“Choosing a Layer That’s Just Your Type,” for details. In Figure 11-1, the
row named Pasted Alex, Sky, and Snow show you a raster icon, the
Lettering and Pentagon layers show the vector icon, the
Brightness/Contrast layer displays an adjustment icon, and Alex’s
Background shows the group icon.
Don’t bother trying to understand the palette all at once. We tell you how to
use the rest of the palette’s features as we go along.
Creating a New, Blank Layer
To create a new, blank layer, follow these steps by using the Layer palette:
1. Choose where, in your stack of layers, you want the new layer to
appear.
(If this is the first layer you have added to an image, you can skip this
step. The new layer appears just above the background layer.)
Otherwise, on the Layer palette, click the layer that you want the new
layer to appear above. In Figure 11-1, for example, we have clicked the
layer labeled Sky, to make that layer the active one.
2. For a raster layer (the most commonly used type of layer), click the
New Raster Layer button or choose Layers➪New Raster Layer from
the menu bar.
The New Layer button is in the upper-left corner of the Layer palette, as
shown in Figure 11-1.
If you’re savvy about the various types of layer and know that you want
a specific type, you can choose other types of layers from the Layer
palette button bar or Paint Shop Pro menu bar. You can choose Raster,
Vector, Art Media, Mask, or Adjustment layer. For more information
about types of layer, see the next section.
204
Part III: Painting Pictures 

3. Type a name for the layer.
The Name field of the Layer Properties dialog box is already highlighted,
so you don’t have to click there before typing. Whatever you type
replaces the descriptive but rather boring name (like Raster1) that Paint
Shop Pro suggests. Enter a name in that field that describes what you
will put on this layer. If you’re not feeling creative, just skip this step and
Paint Shop Pro uses the boring name.
4. Click OK.
Get the heck out of this dialog box and get on with the fun!
Your image doesn’t look any different, so maybe you’re wondering “Just what
have I accomplished?” Fear not! You have indeed added a layer. The image
doesn’t look any different because your new layer is transparent and blank.
It’s just like a sheet of clear plastic placed over a painting.
Look at the Layer palette. You see your new layer, with the name you gave it,
highlighted. That means that it’s the active layer, and any painting, erasing,
selection, or color adjustment you perform now takes place on that layer.
When you float a selection, it appears on the Layer palette like a layer and is
named Floating Selection (in italics). It’s not really a full-fledged layer, but you
can use Layer menu commands on it, like moving it down in the stack. You
can turn a selection into its own layer, as we show you later in this chapter.
Choosing a Layer That’s Just Your Type
To make life a bit more complicated, Paint Shop Pro has four different types
of layers for different kinds of stuff. Four of those types of layers appear in
Figure 11-1, where you can see that they’re distinguished by special icons.
Here’s more about those layers:
Raster: You use this plain-vanilla type of layer most of the time. A raster layer
handles normal images — the kind made of dots, called raster, or bitmap,
images. Raster layers are marked with the icon shown here.
Vector: This special type of layer comes into play mostly when you use the
Paint Shop Pro text, preset shapes, or line-drawing tools. Vector images are
made up of lines or curves connected in a connect-the-dot fashion. Paint
Shop Pro normally creates text, preset shapes, and lines as vector images,
although you can alternatively create them as raster images. Vector images
can’t appear on a raster layer, and raster images can’t appear on a vector
layer. Vector images are marked with the icon that appears here.
205
Chapter 11: Layering Images

Art Media: Art Media layers are for artwork made using the special Art Media
tools described in Chapter 10. These are paintings or drawings with an
appearance of being done with real paint, chalk, crayon, and so on. Be sure 
to choose what type of texture you want when you create a new layer. Click
the Canvas Texture tab when the Layer Properties dialog box appears, and
then click the sample texture that’s shown to choose from a fly-out menu of
textures.
Adjustment: This special type of layer doesn’t contain any images! It’s like a
magical coating that imparts a particular image quality to the layers under it.
It works almost exactly like color adjustments. The advantage of adjustment
layers is that the enhancement is separated from the image, so changing your
mind is easier. Adjustment layers are named according to the kind of adjust-
ment they perform, and each of them has its own snazzy color icon; the one
shown next to this paragraph is Contrast.
Group: Many times, you want to apply an effect to the same two or three
layers while leaving the other layers untouched. You can group the layers so
that Paint Shop Pro treats them like a single layer, which is awfully handy; we
show you how to do this later in this chapter.
Mask: Masking is used to hide certain areas of an overlaying layer’s image
while letting other areas remain visible. It’s a little like masking tape except
that rather than cover parts of an image, like masking tape does, masking
makes areas transparent — just as erasing on a layer does in Paint Shop Pro.
That allows the underlying image to show through. This handy trick for
advanced Paint Shop Pro users allows you to cut shapes out with little effort
or create transparent areas on the background layer.
Working on Layers
To work on a layer, click its name on the Layer palette to select it (make it
active). You can now paint, erase, adjust color, cut, copy, paste, and make
image transformations, such as flipping, filtering, or deforming, and the
results appear on only your selected layer. How tidy and organized!
As an artist who is using multiple layers, you’re like a doctor who is seeing
multiple patients. To avoid mistakes, you must know which one you’re oper-
ating on. You can’t tell what image is on which layer by simply looking at the
image. The transparency of layers prevents you. So, instead, keep an eye on
the Layer palette to see which layer is active. The active layer is highlighted
there. Pause your cursor over a layer’s name to see a tiny thumbnail image 
of the layer’s contents. If a tool doesn’t seem to be working, you’re probably
trying to work on something that isn’t on the active layer. Try turning various
layers on and off to find the object you want.
206
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Here are a few peculiarities of working with layers:
 Moving: You can use the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) to slide an
entire layer around (but not the background layer). Click the Move tool on
the Tool palette. Then, in the image window, drag the entire layer by drag-
ging any object on that layer. To move an individual object independently
of the others on that layer, select the object before you use the Move tool.
(If the object still doesn’t move independently, make sure that the object’s
layer is the active one, reselect the object, and try again.)
 Selecting: When you make a selection on a layer, the selection marquee
penetrates to all layers. That means that you can select an object on one
layer, switch to another layer, and then, for example, fill that selected
area (within the selection marquee) with paint on that other layer.
 Copying: When you copy, you copy only from the active layer — unless
you choose Edit➪Copy Merged. A merged copy includes all the layers.
 Erasing: When you erase or delete on a (nonbackground) layer, you
restore the layer’s transparency. (On the background layer, you leave
behind background color when you erase, or transparency if the image
was originally created with transparent background — and for the
record, photos are not created with transparent backgrounds.)
 Using raster, Art Media, and vector tools: Paint Shop Pro uses the three
distinct image types raster, vector, and Art Media, and has three distinct
sets of tools for these image types. (Refer to the section in Chapter 10
about Art Media and those who miss real Paint, and Chapter 12 for infor-
mation about vector objects, like text and shapes.) These tools work
only on layers of the same type (except that raster tools are also used
on mask layers). As a result, if you’re working on a raster layer, for exam-
ple, and try to apply a vector or Art Media tool, Paint Shop Pro offers to
create a new layer of the appropriate type.
Managing Layers
When you view a multilayer image, you look down through all the layers just
as you would look down through a stack of plastic sheets with stuff painted
on them. To control which layers you see and also adjust the order in which
they’re stacked, use these techniques:
 To see just the active layer: Choose Layers➪View➪Current Only.
 To see all layers: Choose Layers➪View➪All.
 To see specific layers: On the Layer palette, click a layer’s Layer Visibility
toggle, known to its friends as the eyeglasses icon. Each layer has this
icon, to the right of the layer name. Click it once to turn the layer off
(make it invisible) and click again to turn it on. When a layer is off, an X
appears through the eyeglasses icon.
207
Chapter 11: Layering Images

 To move a layer up or down in the stack: Drag it up or down in the left
column of the Layer palette. While you’re dragging, the layer itself doesn’t
move; instead, a black line follows your cursor to tell you where the layer
will go when you release the mouse button. An alternative to dragging is
to click a layer and then choose Layers➪Arrange➪Bring to Top, Move Up,
Move Down, Send to Bottom, Move Into Group, and Move Out of Group.
 Renaming a layer: To change a layer’s name, double-click the layer’s
current name on the Layer palette. When the Layer Properties box
appears, type a new name in the Name field (already selected, for your
convenience) and click OK. Or, right-click the name once and choose
Rename from the context menu that appears, and you can edit the name
right on the Layer palette.
 Removing a layer: To delete a layer on the Layer palette, click that
layer’s name and then click the Delete Layer button. Everything on that
layer goes away with the layer.
Pinning Layers Together: Grouping
After you have carefully positioned objects on different layers, it’s nice to 
pin those layers together so they can’t reposition themselves. If you have
painstakingly put Uncle Tobias’s head on the neck of a giraffe, for example,
you want to keep them together while you get creative with other layers.
The first thing to do is to select the first layer you want to add to your group
and then click the New Layer Group button near the upper-right corner of 
the palette. This action brings you to the ever-so-titillating New Layer Group
dialog box, which looks almost exactly like the New Layer dialog box, and
you should do the same thing you did there: Ignore all those options and just
type a friendly name for your group. Then click OK. (As with the New Layer
dialog box, if you leave it to Paint Shop Pro, it chooses something delightfully
nondescriptive, like Group 1.)
As you can see in the Alex’s Background group, as shown in Figure 11-1, 
you now have a group on your Layers palette, complete with the layer you
selected neatly tucked under it. (You also should see a tiny box with a – next
to it; if you don’t want to see all the layers contained in this group, click the –
to hide them. Click the + sign next to the group to reveal them again.) To add
another layer to your group, click the name of the layer, drag it back up to
just underneath the name of the layer (it turns into a small black bar), and let
go. Your layer is now a part of the group! (If only high school had been this
easy.) To remove a layer from a group, simply drag it above the group name.
Layers with the same group name behave as though they were pinned
together: When you move one layer with the Move tool (the 4-headed arrow
thingy), you move the entire group. Members of a group keep their indepen-
dence in other ways, though. If you change the appearance of a layer (make it
brighter, for example), its fellow group members don’t change.
208
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Using Layers to Separate 
or Combine Images
The main reasons for using layers are either to break an image apart into sev-
eral layers for more flexible editing or to combine multiple images into one.
This section describes how to do both.
Combining entire images
Do you have two entire images to combine? To combine an entire image file
with the image you’re working on, follow these steps:
1. On the Layer palette of the image you’re working on, click the name
of the layer above which you want to insert your new image.
If the image doesn’t have multiple layers, skip to Step 2.
2. Choose File➪Browse and open the image browser to the folder con-
taining the image file.
209
Chapter 11: Layering Images
Gone but not forgotten: Layer links
In the old days of Paint Shop Pro, you didn’t
have the handy-dandy Layer Groups command;
instead, you used layer links, which were clum-
sier and harder to remember, and you could
have only 12 of them. In a nod to older Paint
Shop Pro .psp files that may not support layer
groups, Paint Shop Pro 9 allows you to use layer
links in addition to groups.
Click the layer link toggle to assign a layer link
number to your layer; layers that share the same
layer link number act exactly like groups. Click the
Layer Link toggle button to assign a given layer to
Layer Link 1, and click it again to raise the number
by one each time, all the way up to the number of
layers you have within your image — at which
point it goes back to having no layer link. You can
tell whether a layer is assigned to a layer link
because it has a small number next to the tiny
chain image.
Honestly, the new Group Layer feature is so
handy that we’re only letting you know about this
ratty ol’ layer link feature in case you open a Paint
Shop Pro 7 (or earlier) file that uses it. You don’t
want to know what happens if you start mixing
layer links and layer groups. (It’s much like mixing
tequila and rum.)
The upshot is that if you have a layer that you
could swear you have grouped properly but just
doesn’t seem to be affected by something that
changed the rest of the group, check to see that
it doesn’t have a layer link number. If it does, click
the toggle enough times to set the layer link to
None and then group those layers. You can thank
us in the morning.

Thumbnail pictures of the images in that folder appear. (For more infor-
mation about how to use the image browser, refer to the section in
Chapter 1 about opening, managing, and sorting files with the browser.)
3. Drag the thumbnail picture of the image file to the image you’re work-
ing on.
Paint Shop Pro inserts the new image as a layer, above the layer you
selected in Step 1. (If the image you’re dragging contains multiple layers,
all its layers are grouped together.) The cursor turns into a 4-headed
arrow to indicate that Paint Shop Pro has selected the Move tool for you.
4. Drag the new image to position it where you want it.
After dragging, we often click the Arrow tool (at the top of the Tool palette)
or some other tool to avoid accidentally dragging the selection when we
move the mouse again.
Separating image parts into layers
How do you get an object separated out and on its own layer? One answer is
that you can select the object and turn it into a new layer, called promoting a
selection. Take these steps:
1. Select the desired chunk of any existing layer (the background layer,
for example) by using any of the Paint Shop Pro selection tools.
We cover selection tools for normal (raster) images in Chapter 9. To
select an object on a vector layer, click the object with the Object
Selector tool (at the bottom of the Tools toolbar).
Is your selection tool not selecting on the object you want? Remember
that selection works within only one layer at a time. Your object may be
on a different layer than the active one. On the Layer palette, click the
layer where that object lives to make that layer active. Then try select-
ing again. If you’re not sure where that object lives, pause your cursor
over each layer’s name, one at a time, and look for your object in the
thumbnail image of the layer’s contents.
2. On the Layer palette, click the layer that you want the new layer to
appear above.
3. Choose Selections➪Promote to Layer from the Paint Shop Pro 
menu bar.
A new layer, cleverly named Promoted Selection, appears on the Layer
palette. Although nothing appears to change in your image, your selec-
tion is now on that Promoted Selection layer.
210
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Your object is now on its own layer. A copy of that object remains on the orig-
inal layer. You can now deselect the object; press Ctrl+D or choose
Selections➪Select None.
If you would prefer that no copy be left behind when you promote a selec-
tion, drag the selection slightly after Step 1. On the background layer, this
action leaves behind an area filled with the background color. On other
layers, the area becomes transparent.
Another way to separate image chunks into layers is to select the chunks and
then cut and paste the chunk as a new layer (see the following section).
Copying, cutting, and pasting with layers
A good way to get an image or chunk of an image onto a layer is to copy (or
cut) it and then paste it as a new layer. This approach uses the same, familiar
Windows Clipboard system that other applications use, which is a great way
to combine multiple images, even if the additional images come from a pro-
gram other than Paint Shop Pro. In the following sections, we tell you how to
copy, cut, and paste a selected image as a new layer.
Copying or cutting an image
You can copy or cut images from a variety of sources. Here’s how to do it:
 From a program other than Paint Shop Pro: First, open that program
and display the image you want. (You don’t need to close Paint Shop
Pro.) Exactly how to copy or cut an image from that program varies
somewhat from program to program. By copying from a Web page in
Internet Explorer, for example, you can right-click the image and then
choose Copy from the menu that appears. In many programs, click the
image to select it and choose Edit➪Copy to put a copy on the hidden
Windows Clipboard.
 From another layer within your Paint Shop Pro image: On the Layer
palette, click the layer containing the object you want. Select the image
chunk you want with any of the Paint Shop Pro selection tools. (Refer to
Chapter 3 for help with selection tools. If the layer is a vector layer, use
the Object Selector tool at the bottom of the Tools palette.) Then choose
Edit➪Copy (or Edit➪Cut, if you want to remove the chunk from its cur-
rent layer).
 From another image file: Open that file in Paint Shop Pro. A new
window appears and displays that image. Use any of the Paint Shop Pro
selection tools to select your chosen chunk. Choose Selections➪Select
All if you want to select the whole image. Choose Edit➪Copy to copy
from the active layer. To copy combined images from all layers, choose
Edit➪Copy Merged.
211
Chapter 11: Layering Images

Pasting the image as, or on, a new layer
After you have copied (or cut) an image to the Windows Clipboard, you can
paste it as a layer or on an existing layer. Here’s how to paste it as a layer:
1. Click the title bar of the window in Paint Shop Pro where you want to
paste.
This step makes sure that you paste it in the right place.
2. On the Layer palette, click the layer that you want the new layer to
appear above.
To put a layer above the background layer, for example, click
Background. If your image has only one layer, you can skip this step
because Background is already selected.
3. Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Layer or press Ctrl+L.
Your image appears as a new layer, and the Paint Shop Pro cursor
appears as a 4-headed arrow. That cursor tells you that Paint Shop Pro
has automatically selected the Move tool for you.
(If you copy a vector object from outside Paint Shop Pro, such as a
Microsoft Draw object from Microsoft Word, Paint Shop Pro converts it
to a raster layer when you paste it. First, however, Paint Shop Pro dis-
plays a dialog box labeled Meta Picture Import. In that dialog box, set
Width in Pixels and Height in Pixels to the sizes you want for the pasted
image and click OK.)
4. Drag your newly pasted image where you want it.
When you’re done dragging, consider clicking the arrow tool (at the top of
the tool palette) or some other tool to avoid accidentally dragging the selec-
tion with subsequent mouse motions.
You can also paste an image on an existing layer rather than paste it as its
own new layer. After you have copied or cut the image to the Windows
Clipboard, click the existing layer’s name on the Layer palette and choose
Edit➪Paste As New Selection or press Ctrl+E. The image appears; drag it
where you want it and then click to make it a floating selection. Press Ctrl+D
to deselect the image.
Copying entire layers from 
one image to another
When you start using layered images, you may find that a layer you created
in one image is useful in another image. To copy a layer (or layers) from one
212
Part III: Painting Pictures 

image to another, you drag the layer from the Layer palette of the source
image to the destination image. To do so, take these detailed steps:
1. Open both images in Paint Shop Pro.
Each image gets its own window. Arrange the windows so you can 
see at least part of both images. (For example, choose Window➪Tile
Vertically.)
2. Click the title bar of the destination image.
By destination image, we mean the one where you want the layer to go.
3. On the Layer palette, click the layer above which the new layer is 
to go.
Clicking makes that layer the active one.
4. Click the title bar of the image containing the layer you want to copy.
5. On the Layer palette, click the name of the layer you want to copy and
drag it to the destination image.
Drag the layer directly into the middle of the destination image, and not
onto the title bar of its window. When you release the mouse button, the
copied layer appears.
Blending images by making 
layers transparent
Double your pleasure, double your fun. One popular effect is a sort of double
exposure, which you do by making an overlaying layer on which the image is
partially transparent. For example, you may want to overlay a diagram on a
photograph or add a faint image of a logo to a picture.
Figure 11-2 shows a few tasty vegetables overlaid with the word Veggies, per-
haps to be used as a sign for a vegetarian buffet. (It looks much more appeal-
ing in color — see color plate C-4 in the color section of this book.)
To make a layer transparent, you merely adjust one little setting, Layer
Opacity. Each layer has a Layer Opacity setting on the Layer palette (the
shaded bar shown in Figure 11-2). Until you change it, the setting for every
layer is 100 to indicate that the layer is 100 percent opaque (you can’t see
through the image on the layer).
At the far right end of each bar is a pair of pointers (triangles). Drag that pair
to the left to make the layer more transparent. Drag the pair to the right to
make the layer more opaque. The number on the bar changes as you drag,
between 100 and 0. In Figure 11-2, the layer containing the text Veggies! is set
to 52 percent (roughly half-transparent).
213
Chapter 11: Layering Images

Blending images in creative ways
Sometimes, simply overlaying one image on the other doesn’t give quite the
effect you want. For example, if you overlay colored text on an image that has
like-colored areas, you can’t read the text in those areas.
In that case, the result may be better if the layer could, for example, lighten
or darken the underlying image — or perhaps change the underlying color,
no matter what color it is. With Paint Shop Pro, you can create those effects,
and more, using layer blending. Layer blending is determined by two settings:
layer blend mode and the layer blend levels.
To use blend modes with forethought and skill requires pondering all kinds 
of technical stuff about computer graphics. Do like we do: Use blend modes
with reckless abandon rather than forethought and skill. Try one mode, and 
if you don’t like the result, try another!
The right side of the Layer palette contains layer blend mode settings you
can change for each layer. Until you change a layer’s blend mode, it’s normal,
which means that the paint on that layer simply overlays the paint on lower
layers, like paint on transparent plastic (see Figure 11-3).
Click the Blend Mode control for your chosen layer and choose a blend mode
from the menu that appears. To restore the original appearance, choose
Normal from the list of modes.
Note that Layer2, which contains the
text Veggies!, is at 52 percent opacity.
Figure 11-2:

214
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Here are a few tips:
 For maximum contrast between underlying and overlying images, try
Difference mode.
 Try making the color of the overlying layer lighter or darker, if you can’t
get the results you want otherwise.
 Make a layer more transparent if you want to reduce the effect of any
blend mode, producing a more subtle result.
 For a speckly, spray-painted look, try Dissolve mode and also make the
layer partly transparent.
Using a blend mode on a group may or may not work, depending on what
layers are in it; having a group with mixed raster and vector layers will
almost certainly reject the attempt. If you’re trying to blend a group and it’s
not “taking,” try removing layers one by one from the group until it works.
Creating and Using Adjustment Layers
An adjustment layer is sort of like a perfect facial makeup. It doesn’t cover
anything up; rather, it magically changes the appearance of underlying layers.
Changes include brightness or contrast, color, and other effects.
Many of these effects you can create in other ways — with commands on the
Colors menu, for example. In fact, the dialog boxes for adjustment layers are
very much like those for commands on the Colors menu, both of which we
cover with one set of instructions in Chapter 7.

215
Chapter 11: Layering Images

So, why use an adjustment layer rather than a command on the Colors menu?
Here are a few good reasons:
 Adjustment layers can affect the entire, combined, multilayer image (if
it’s placed on top of all other layers). Most commands on the Colors
menu, on the other hand, affect only the active layer.
 Adjustment layers are useful when you’re using different layers to com-
bine two images. One image may have lower contrast than the other, for
example. You can put a contrast-adjustment layer above one image and
put the second image above that adjustment layer so that it remains
unaffected.
 An adjustment layer lets you make changes that are later easily
reversible. You can simply delete the layer or change its settings if you
later find that the adjustment is wrong. Otherwise, you need to counter
your earlier adjustment — a trickier job than undoing or changing it.
 You can paint the layer to apply the effect in different strengths in differ-
ent places! This process is admittedly a bit mind-boggling, but if you can
imagine being able to paint brightness (rather than a color), for exam-
ple, you have the idea. Rather than paint, you can copy an image to the
layer, and the brightness of each pixel of the image determines the
strength of the effect.
Adjustment layers change only the appearance of the underlying colors, not
the colors of the layers. For example, when you use an adjustment layer, the
colors that the Dropper tool picks up and displays on the Materials palette
are the real colors — the color of the paint in the layer, not the apparent
color caused by the adjustment layer.
Creating an adjustment layer
To create an adjustment layer, follow these steps:
1. Open the Layer palette (press the F8 key) if it isn’t already onscreen.
2. On the Layer palette, right-click the name of the layer above which
you want to add the adjustment layer.
3. Choose Layers➪New Adjustment Layers.
4. Choose the type of adjustment layer you want from the menu that
appears.
(See the following section for information about choosing adjustment
types.) The Layer Properties dialog box appears.
216
Part III: Painting Pictures 

5. Click the Adjustment tab, near the top of that dialog box.
The tab shows various sliders, and other adjustments appear, depending
on your choice of layer type.
6. Make your adjustments and click OK.
We describe how these adjustments work in Chapter 10.
You can delete or move adjustment layers just as you do other layers. See the
section “Working on Layers,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions. To
rename an adjustment layer, double-click its name on the Layer palette; when
the Layer Properties dialog box appears, click the General tab, enter a new
name in the Name field there, and click OK.
To change these adjustments after you create a layer, double-click the layer’s
name on the Layer palette. You find these adjustments on the Adjustments
tab of the Layer Properties dialog box that appears. It’s the same dialog box
that appears when you create a new adjustment layer (refer to Step 5 in the
preceding list).
Choosing the type of adjustment 
layer you need
The Paint Shop Pro adjustment layers give you lots of different ways to fiddle
with the color, contrast, and brightness of the underlying layers of your
image. Here are some suggestions for what to use to achieve various results:
 To adjust brightness or contrast, use the Brightness/Contrast layer.
 The Brightness/Contrast layer affects all three major tonal ranges —
shadows, highlights, and midtones — at one time. To independently
adjust any of these three ranges — to just get darker shadows, for 
example — try a Levels layer.
 If shadows, highlights, and midtones aren’t precise enough for your
brightness and contrast adjustment — you need better contrast only
within specific shadows, for example — you can adjust brightness or
contrast within any range of tone by using a Curves layer.
 For richer/grayer or lighter/darker colors, try a Hue/Saturation layer.
The Hue/Saturation layer also lets you colorize underlying layers (give
them a monochrome tint).
 To make a negative image, choose an Invert layer, set the blend mode to
Normal (if it isn’t already), and set the opacity to 100.
 To reduce the number of colors, which results in a kind of paint-by-
numbers effect, try a Posterize layer.
 To get a truly black-and-white (two colors, no shades of gray) effect,
choose a Levels layer.
217
Chapter 11: Layering Images

Applying adjustments 
to only certain areas
One cool feature of adjustment layers is that you can apply their effects selec-
tively, to certain areas of your image. Paint Shop Pro uses paint on the adjust-
ment layer to accomplish that result.
After you create the adjustment layer, you can, by using black paint, paint out
the areas on that adjustment layer where you don’t want the effect. Apply the
paint to the adjustment layer with any painting tool, such as the Paint Brush
tool. The paint doesn’t show up as black — only as a masking-out of the
effect. Use gray paint to screen out the effect. (You can also use a texture
while you do this, to create some neat-looking effects.)
You can also paint in an area with white or gray, if that area is painted out.
Notice that black, white, and shades of gray are the only colors the Materials
palette gives you to paint with when you’re working on an adjustment layer.
Using Vector Layers
Most people discover vector layers accidentally. They use the Text, Draw, or
Preset Shapes tools to create vector objects, and Paint Shop Pro automati-
cally (and without telling them) creates a vector layer to contain the vector
objects these tools produce. (We explain the difference between vector and
raster images and layers in the section “Choosing a Layer That’s Just Your
Type,” earlier in this chapter.) See Chapter 12 for more information about
using these tools.
You can also create vector layers intentionally, as we describe in the section
“Creating a New, Blank Layer,” earlier in this chapter. After you create a
vector layer, you can use the Text, Draw, or Preset Shapes tool to add objects
to that layer. You can also copy and paste to move these objects from one
Paint Shop Pro vector layer or image to another.
You can convert a vector layer to a raster layer. The command to choose is
Layers➪Convert to Raster Layer. Converting an image to raster form allows
you to apply any of the raster paint tools to your vector shape to get cool
effects, such as graduated fills or airbrush spraying. The drawback is that
you can then no longer edit the shape by adjusting the lines and points that
make up a vector object. You can’t convert a raster layer to a vector layer.
If you copy the vector layer before converting it, however, you have a backup
copy of it. Simply hide it when it’s not needed.
218
Part III: Painting Pictures 

As you add vector objects to a vector layer, each object gets its own entry on
the Layer palette. The left side of Figure 11-4 shows the Layer palette with
two layers: the background layer and a vector layer, Vector1. To see each
individual object in the vector layer, click the white box with the + sign to the
left of the vector layer’s icon. That action reveals the individual vector
objects, indented under the layer. (To hide the objects, click that same white
box again, which now holds a – symbol.)
Paint Shop Pro has three kinds of vector objects: line objects, text objects,
and groups of objects. Each kind of object has its own icon, as Figure 11-4
demonstrates. Vector1 contains a line object named Rectangle, a line object
named Star 2, and a text object named It’s Some Text. Star 2 is a single, multi-
segment line that is part of the Preset Shapes object library (see Chapter 12).
Having objects listed on the Layer palette lets you select, delete, hide, or
reposition them in the stack, just as you would a layer — the main difference
is that each object is grouped within a vector layer, just like regular layers are
grouped in layer groups.
Clicking an object on the palette selects it and displays its name in bold type.
(Hold down the Shift key as you click to select multiple objects.) Pressing the
Delete key deletes the selected object. Dragging it moves it up or down in the
stack and enables you to place it over or under other objects. Double-clicking
it reveals one of two things: If it’s a text object, it displays the Text Entry
dialog box; if it’s a shape, it displays the Vector Property dialog box. See
Chapter 12 for more information about managing vector objects.
Merging Layers
Using multiple layers usually makes working with images easier. Sometimes,
however, you would rather have (or need to have) everything on one layer.
For example, you may want to use one of the commands on the Colors menu
on the entire image, but the command works on only a single layer. Or, if you

Clicking the
+ symbol

Vector1 has

objects on

219
Chapter 11: Layering Images

try to save your image as something other than a Paint Shop Pro file, Paint
Shop Pro may offer to merge all the layers for you. (Merging can sometimes
be necessary because not many file types support multiple layers. Adobe
Photoshop is the most popular format that supports layers.)
If Paint Shop Pro merges layers when you’re saving a file, it merges layers
only in the file you’re creating on your disk drive. It doesn’t merge the layers
in the image you’re working on in Paint Shop Pro.
Paint Shop Pro gives you two ways to merge layers into one layer. To merge all
the layers (including those whose visibility is switched off), choose Layers➪
Merge➪Merge All. To merge only the visible layers (leaving the hidden ones
as layers), choose Layers➪Merge➪Merge Visible. To merge a group into one
handy layer, choose Layers➪Merge➪Merge Group. Choosing Layers➪Merge➪
Merge Down merges the selected layer with the one underneath it.
What happens when you merge? Nothing visible happens to your image when
you merge. The merged layers, however, become one normal (raster) layer,
named Merged, that you see listed on the Layer palette. Any vector layers
(typically text, lines, or preset shapes) are converted into raster images, so
you can’t edit them any more with the text, drawing, or shape tools. When
adjustment layers are merged, they no longer simply affect the image appear-
ance; rather, they modify the underlying colors.

G
iven a paintbrush, most of us would have trouble making nice, neat
text, regular shapes like circles, or even straight lines. We would clamor
for a typewriter, template, ruler, or some other special tool that gives nice
straight edges and shapes.
Clamor not. Paint Shop Pro offers multiple tools for creating such stuff and
one to help you manage the stuff you create. Figure 12-1 shows those tools 
as they appear at the bottom of the Tools toolbar.
Figure 12-1:
Six tools to
create text
and shapes,
and one to
move them.

Unless you tell Paint Shop Pro otherwise, these tools create text, lines, and
shapes in a special vector form that makes them easier to change. Images in
this form are known as vector objects. Unlike the other things you can paint or
otherwise create in Paint Shop Pro, vector objects aren’t a collection of pixels
(colored dots). Instead, they’re shapes that have color, line width, and other
properties. These easily modified shapes can exist only on special vector
layers.
So, you ask in businesslike, Donald Trump fashion, “What’s the upshot?”
Here’s the bottom line:
 Creating stuff as vector objects: If you use the Paint Shop Pro text, line,
or shape tools in the normal, vector way, your creations are easier to
modify — but you have to know how to deal with layers and the special
features of vector objects. Refer to Chapter 11 for help with layers, and
we explain vector features in this chapter.
 Not creating stuff as vector objects: If you don’t want to bother with
vector layers and special vector object features, you can create text, lines,
and shapes as though they were painted with a brush. This form is called
raster form. If you’re such a dedicated, um, rasterfarian, you must do this:
After you select your tool but before you create the object, go to the Tool
Options palette (press F4 if it’s not visible). For any object other than text
(shapes or lines), click to clear the check mark in the Create As Vector
check box. For text as a raster selection, choose Selection or Floating from
the drop-down Create As menu on the Tool Options palette. Eh, but we
talk about it in the next section. Your choice of raster remains unless you
change it. No problem, mon.
If you need to work on vector objects with raster tools (like the Paint Brush
or Eraser tools), you can convert a vector layer to a raster layer. Choose
Layers➪Convert To Raster Layer. You can’t convert back, however (though
you can use the Undo function if you have done the conversion recently).
Keeping Track of Objects and Layers
Here’s the most important thing to remember about adding text, lines, or
shapes: If you try to add these types of vector objects to a normal, raster
image (such as a digital photograph), Paint Shop Pro automatically, and 
quietly, creates a vector layer to hold the new object.
If you want to return to the rest of the image, you have to switch to the 
layer on which the image lives. For example, if you add text to a photograph
(which usually appears on the background layer), in order to work on the
image, you need to press F8 to see the Layer palette (if it’s not visible
already) and then select the background layer.
222
Part III: Painting Pictures 

To add text, lines, or shapes in a nice, controlled fashion, where you know
exactly what layer every object is on, create or select a vector layer before
you create or paste a vector object. Refer to Chapter 11 for help with creating
and choosing layers. As you put vector objects on a vector layer, each object
is listed separately, indented under the vector layer’s name on the Layer
palette. Click the + sign to the left of the layer’s name to display these objects
individually. From within the Layer palette, you can select, reorder, rename,
or delete objects; refer to the discussion of using vector layers in Chapter 11.
Adding and Editing Text
Text in Paint Shop Pro isn’t just your grandfather’s plain old letters and num-
bers. Oh, my gracious, no. Although you can certainly have plain text in a
straight line, you can also have it filled or outlined with colors and patterns,
bend it around curves, or rotate it into a jaunty angle. It’s truly the cat’s 
pajamas!
Creating, placing, and editing text
Text has two parts: an outline, set by the Materials palette’s foreground con-
trols, and a fill, set by the background controls. You can have both or either.
If you already have a vector layer (one that has text, lines, or shapes on it),
you can put your text on that same layer; just choose the layer now on the
Layer palette. Or, you can create a new vector layer on which to put your
text. If your active layer is a raster layer (background, for example), Paint
Shop Pro creates a new vector layer for you in the following steps. If you’re
not familiar with layers, don’t worry about all this layer stuff for now.
Begin with the Materials palette open. Press F6 if you don’t see it, and refer to
Chapter 10 for details about what’s what on that palette.
223
Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes
Antialiasing for smoother edges
Shapes with nice, sharp edges tend to look a bit
ragged when those edges run in any direction
other than perfectly horizontal or vertical. They
develop an objectionable staircase look called
aliasing. Antialiasing is a process of filling in
those steps with a little bit of color, which gives
the illusion of a straighter, if slightly fuzzier,
edge. To antialias objects, place a check mark in
the Antialias check box on the Tool Options
palette.

Here’s how to create basic text:
1. Click the Text tool (as shown in the margin) on the toolbar.
2. If you want outlined text, do the following:
a. Choose the inside color by right-clicking any color on the Materials
palette. This action sets the background color. (For a more sophisticated
fill material, left-click the Background and Fill Properties box to open a
Material Properties dialog box. For guidance, refer to the section in
Chapter 10 about choosing a color for the very picky.
If you want to have just an outline, leaving the middle of the letters com-
pletely see-through, click the Transparency button under the Background
and Fill Properties box. (It’s the rightmost button, and should have the
international circle-with-a-slash No sign in it.) The box turns gray and con-
tains an international No sign of its own, indicating that the background
color is now set to no color. (If this confuses you, refer to Chapter 10 to
understand these kooky Material boxes.)
b. Choose a foreground color (the outline) by left-clicking the Foreground
and Stroke Properties box. On the Tool Options palette, set the value in
the Stroke Width dialog box to the width of the outline you want, in
pixels. For example, for an outline 4 pixels wide, set it to 4.
3. If you want solid (filled) text (no outline):
a. On the Materials palette, click the transparency button under the
Foreground and Stroke Properties box. (It’s the rightmost of the three
tiny buttons there.) The box turns gray and contains an international No
sign of its own.
b. Choose a background color by left-clicking the Background and Fill
Material box and selecting one from the Materials palette.
In Paint Shop Pro, a material is a combination of a color, pattern, and tex-
ture. It’s just as easy to use gradients and patterns as the foregrounds and
backgrounds of text as it is to use colors, as we show you in Figure 12-2 —
and it makes things look so much snazzier! Again, refer to Chapter 10 to
unveil mysteries of the Material boxes.
4. Click your image where you want the center of your text.
The text entry dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-2. Note that a
preview of your text, as it appears when you click OK, appears on your
image. You can change your choices here by changing what’s in the
Foreground and Background Property boxes.
Figure 12-2 shows how the Tool Options palette controls the width 
(and style) of the text outline. If you don’t see the Tool Options palette,
press F4.
5. Choose a font from the Font drop-down menu on the Tool Options
palette.
224
Part III: Painting Pictures 

6. Choose a font size from the Size selection box or manually enter any
other size you want, in points, on the Tool Options palette.
7. Enter your text in the big box labeled Enter Text Here.
The text appears in your chosen font and size. For long, multiline text,
you can press the Enter key to start a new line. If you have multiple lines
of text, decide how you want them aligned (left-justified, centered, or
right-justified) by clicking the appropriate button in the upper-right
corner of the Tool Options palette.
If you know that you will use the same text the next time you use the
Text tool, you can check the Remember Text check box, next to the OK
button.
8. To selectively apply any font style (bold, italic, underlined, or
strikethrough), drag across the text you want styled to highlight it.
Then click the B, I, U, or A (strikethrough) buttons on the Tool Options
palette, just as you would in most word processors.
You can also selectively change the font or size of any text by highlight-
ing the text and then choosing a new font or size.
9. For vector text, remember to choose Vector from the Create As menu
on the Tool Options palette.
If you prefer raster text, choose Selection to create a nonfloating selec-
tion (or Floating to create a floating selection). If you don’t care, use
Vector.

Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

10. Click the OK button when you’re done.
While you’re using the text entry dialog box, it displays a continuously
updated preview of your work in the image window.
Your text appears attractively displayed in a rectangular frame that has
squares (handles) around it. This selection frame means that your text object
is selected. You can do several things to the text object now, including move,
resize, rotate, or delete it. See the section “Controlling Your Objects,” later in
this chapter.
You can also edit your text. With the Text tool chosen, double-click directly
on the body (outline or fill) of the text. The cursor turns into a 4-headed
arrow when your cursor is properly positioned; clicking and dragging allows
you to reposition it, whereas double-clicking brings up that darned text entry
dialog box all over again, where you can change the text or its appearance.
You can turn text into shapes, if you like. For example, you may want to alter
the shape, rotation, or other attributes of a text character in a creative way.
Select the text you want to convert and then choose Objects➪Convert Text
to Curves. Then, to make each character an individually selectable, movable,
rotatable object, choose As Character Shapes. If you want the characters to
remain part of a single object, choose As Single Shape.
Bending text to follow a line or shape
Is your theatre company performing The Wizard of Oz? Before you can click
your heels together three times and say “There’s no place like home,” you
can make the text on your advertising posters follow the yellow brick road —
or any other (vector) shape or line in Paint Shop Pro. Figure 12-3 shows a
before (top) and after (bottom) picture of fitting text to a line.
Here’s how to do your own:
1. Create your (vector) text.
See the preceding two sections for help with text.
2. Create your shape or line.
See the rest of this chapter for help with lines or shapes. Bear in mind
that if a line is created from left to right, text ends up on top of that line.
If a closed shape is created clockwise, text ends up on the inside. In both
instances, the opposite direction gives opposite results.
3. Click the Object Selection tool.
226
Part III: Painting Pictures 

If you just want to shape the text — you don’t really want the line (or
shape) itself to appear — take one additional step before proceeding 
to Step 4. The selection frame is still around your shape or line from its
creation, and you have chosen the Object Selection tool. Now, click the
Properties button on the Tool Options palette. In the Properties dialog
box that now appears, click to clear the Visible check box and click OK.
Your chosen shape becomes invisible, and the selection frame remains.
4. Hold down the Shift key and click the text, which places both the line
and text within the selection frame.
The top illustration in Figure 12-3 shows this stage of the game.
5. Choose Objects➪Fit Text to Path.
Zap! Wanda the Good Witch puts your text safely on the yellow brick
road to Oz. The bottom part of Figure 12-3 shows the result of fitting text
to the path.
Don’t use solid-color-filled shapes if you intend for your text to be on the
inside of the shape — the fill hides your text! A gradient, textured, or pat-
terned fill, however, usually allows your text to be seen.

Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Drawing Lines and Shapes
Paint Shop Pro is a quirky little devil. It makes drawing lines and shapes so
darned easy that it’s not even funny, which allows you to draw point-to-point,
like connect-the-dots, to draw freehand like a crayon, or even a combination
of the two. And, if you want shapes, hoo-boy! You can select stars, diamonds,
and lucky clovers (not really) from a drop-down menu. Simple!
What about adjusting those lines and shapes when you have drawn them?
That’s a bit trickier and involves adjusting things called nodes — but we walk
you through that process in the next section — never fear. After all, we’re
professionals: professional dummies.
Setting line and fill color 
for lines and shapes
To determine how lines and outlines look, choose a foreground color, style,
or texture (or all of them) on the Color palette before creating the line or
shape. To determine how fills look (unless you’re making a single straight-line
segment, where fill doesn’t apply), choose a background material from the
Background Material box before creating the line or shape. (Remember that a
material is a combination of a color, pattern, or gradient and any textures you
choose to add to it.)
Note that for open shapes (a curvy line, for example), if you use fill, it fills the
area between the starting and ending points of the shape. In many such
cases, you may want to turn off background (fill) material altogether: Click
the Transparent button on the right side, just underneath the Background
Material box.
If you have already created a line or shape and want to change its appearance,
see the section “Changing Colors and Other Properties,” later in this chapter.
Drawing single lines and 
connected line segments
To draw a straight (vector) line or a series of connected straight lines, click
the Pen tool on the Tools toolbar and then follow these steps:
1. Choose a foreground color, style, or texture (or all three).
Left-click the Foreground Material box on the Color palette. Refer to
Chapter 3 for more help.
228
Part III: Painting Pictures 

2. Set the mode to Drawing, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Press F4 to bring up the Tool Options palette if you don’t see it.
3. Click the Draw Lines button from the Tool Options palette, as shown
in Figure 12-4.
4. Also on the Tool Options palette, set the Width value to the width (in
pixels) of the line you want.
All the Paint Shop Pro value boxes offer a nifty way to adjust them: Click
and hold the big down arrow on the right side of the value box and drag
left or right in the slider that appears.
You can also choose a line style (like dashes or barbed wire) for your
line at this time by choosing a style from the Line Style drop-down menu,
also on the Tool Options palette.
5. Enable the Connect Segments check box if you want to play connect-
the-dots: make multiple, connected straight lines.
Clear that check box to make separate lines.
6. Drag or click line end points.
If you want lines drawn at perfect 90-degree or 45-degree angles (perfect
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines), hold down the Shift key before
you drag or click, and Paint Shop Pro snaps your lines to the nine com-
pass points.
To move individual line segments, or move the points where line segments
connect, enable the Show Modes check box. Your line appears with square
dots (handles) around the perimeter. Drag the dots to move them. For more
flexibility in changing lines, see “Picking at Your Nodes,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

With all vector shapes, click the Apply button on the Tools toolbar after each
shape if you want that shape to be an independent object. Otherwise, objects
are all linked together even if they appear separate.
Drawing freehand lines or shapes
Freehand lines are basically any old scribble you want to make (or almost
so). Here’s how to scribble in high-technology land. Click the Pen tool on 
the Tool toolbar, choose your color (together with any textures, patterns, 
or gradients) from the material boxes, and then follow these steps:
1. On the Materials palette (press F6 if it’s not already visible), click the
Transparent button in the Background and Fill Properties box.
This step ensures that whatever shape you draw doesn’t get filled in like
a closed blob. If you want a filled shape, choose a material instead.
2. On the Tool Options palette (if the palette isn’t onscreen, press F4),
click the Draw Freehand button.
3. Also on the Tool Options palette, set the Width value to the width (in
pixels) of the line you want; also, set the line style and other options.
4. Drag any old way on your image.
5. If you want to turn your line into a shape (with a closed line), click the
Close Selected Open Contours button on the Tool Options palette
when you’re done.
6. If you want to start a new, unrelated line elsewhere on the canvas,
click Apply on the Tool Options palette. Otherwise, your lines are
visually separate but linked together.
Paint Shop Pro has this adorable habit of keeping everything you draw with
the Pen tool joined. Even if you draw a squiggle in one corner, start a new
contour, and then draw a loop on the other side of the screen, Paint Shop Pro
thinks of them as one big shape — even if they’re not connected. If you want
to draw two entirely separate shapes so that you can apply separate fills and
strokes to them, make sure that you click the Apply button between shapes.
If you enable the Show Modes check box,, your line appears with square dots
(handles) around the perimeter. Drag any handle around the outside of the
rectangle to resize or reorient your line.
The line is a clever, automatically constructed, connect-the-dots line. If you
want to drag a line that follows your tight turns more smoothly, you need
dots that are closer together. For a line more obviously made up of line 
230
Part III: Painting Pictures 

segments that connect dots, the dots need to be farther apart. On the Tool
Options palette, you can set that closeness by adjusting the Curve Tracking
value: smaller for closer dots and larger for more widely spaced dots.
Making curved lines
To make curved lines, you lay down a series of points where Paint Shop Pro
makes the line bend. Click the Pen tool on the Tools toolbar and ensure that
the Tool Options palette is visible (if it’s not, press F4).
On the Tool Options palette, click the Draw Point-to-Point Bezier Curve
button (which looks like a lumpy S on its side). To make just a single curve,
make sure that the Connect Segments check box is clear; to make curve after
curve, enable that check box.
You click to lay down the points, but don’t just click when you place your
dots — click where you want the dot, and then keep your mouse button
down and drag a little. As you drag, you pull out an arrow by its tip. Your line
no longer bends sharply at the dot. Here’s how that arrow works for you:
 As you drag the arrow longer, the curve gets broader at the dot. If you
make the arrow shorter again, the curve gets sharper at the dot.
 When the arrow appears, you can release the mouse button and make
your adjustments by dragging either end of the arrow.
 If you drag either end of the arrow around the dot, your line rotates to
stay parallel to the arrow where the line and arrow pass through the dot.
Figure 12-5 shows the effect of dragging the tip of the arrow. On the left, a
curved line is created and the arrow appears for the latest dot. On the right,
the arrow’s tip is being extended and dragged upward a bit. You can see how
the curve broadens and changes angle to follow the arrow’s direction.

Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Adding shapes
Need a square? Need a star? The Paint Shop Pro shapes tool group lets you
choose from a wide range of predetermined shapes, including circles, rectan-
gles, stars, triangles, and cool icons.
In the margin appears the one tool, Preset Shapes, that can deliver any shape
known to Paint Shop Pro. The Preset Shapes tool lives with three of its more
specialized cousins in the tool group that is third from the bottom on the
Tools toolbar (refer to Figure 12-1). These other cousins (Rectangle, Ellipse,
and Symmetrical Shape) are really just convenient shortcuts to access com-
monly used shapes. Use them if you like — they work similarly. We discuss
only Preset Shapes here.
Preset shapes are normally vector objects (as are text, lines, and arbitrary
shapes). If you prefer them as raster (normal, bitmap) objects, make sure
that the Vector option box is cleared on the Tool Options palette. If you
create any vector object, it must be on a vector layer. If your active layer isn’t
a vector layer, Paint Shop Pro adds a vector layer for you and places the
shape there.
If you like, you can edit the shapes of preset shapes after you have placed
them in your image. Follow the instructions in the section “Picking at Your
Nodes,” later in this chapter.
When you’re done adding preset shapes and you want to work on other parts
of the image, you may need to change to another layer — probably the back-
ground layer. Otherwise, refer to Chapter 11 for the skinny.
Dragging a shape
The Preset Shapes tool can deliver a shape from its library of shapes in any
size, proportion, color, gradient, pattern, or texture you like! Like text and
drawn shapes in Paint Shop Pro, preset shapes have two parts: the outline
and the fill. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Preset Shapes tool on the Tools toolbar.
2. If you want your shape to have an outline, do the following:
On the Materials palette (press F6), click the Foreground and Stroke
Properties box and choose a color from the dialog box that pops up. For
a gradient or patterned outline, switch to the appropriate tab; refer to
Chapter 10 for help on how to set gradients, patterns, or textures.
232
Part III: Painting Pictures 

On the Tool Options palette, set the value in the Width dialog box to the
width of the outline you want, in pixels. For example, for an outline 4
pixels wide, set it to 4.
If you want to use a styled outline (like arrows or dashes) to surround
your shape rather than a solid line, choose a custom line from the drop-
down Line Style menu, also on the Tool Options palette.
If you want no outline, click the Transparent button on the right side
underneath the Background Material box.
3. Select a fill for your shape.
Click the Background and Fill Properties box and choose a color from
the dialog box that pops up. For a gradient or patterned outline, switch
to the appropriate tab; refer to Chapter 3 for help on how to set gradi-
ents, patterns, or textures.
If you don’t want your shape filled (that is, you want just the outline of a
shape), click the Transparent button on the right side underneath the
Foreground and Stroke Properties box.
4. On the Tool Options palette, click the down arrow next to the Shapes
preview box and choose a shape in the gallery of preset shapes that
appears.
The Tool Options palette and its gallery of shapes appear.
5. If you want to use the colors, styles, and textures you chose in Steps 1
and 2, make sure that the Retain Style check box is unchecked on the
Tool Options palette.
Otherwise, if that box is checked, Paint Shop Pro uses the colors, line
width, and other properties of the original shape that is stored in the
shape library.
6. Drag diagonally on your image.
As you drag, your chosen shape appears and expands. (The colors and
other style attributes don’t appear until you release the mouse button.)
If you drag more horizontally than vertically, the shape is flattened.
Likewise, dragging more vertically gives you a skinny shape. Hold down
the Shift key as you click and drag to create a shape with the original
proportions that’s not skinny or fat.
When you release the mouse button, your shape appears fully colored and
filled according to your choices. The shape appears within the usual Paint
Shop Pro object selection frame, which means that you can redimension
the shape by dragging any of the handles (squares) around the edge of
that frame. To rotate your shape, drag the handle at the end of the arm
that sticks out from the center of the frame. A star is born: Figure 12-6
shows the various elements we have discussed in the preceding steps.
233
Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Picking at Your Nodes
Paint Shop Pro users have an old saying: “You can pick your friends and you
can pick your nodes, but you can’t pick your friend’s nodes.” It’s not true, of
course, but that doesn’t keep users from saying it. You can freely pick, or pick
at, all your nodes — including your friend’s nodes, if that person gives you a
Paint Shop Pro file with vector lines or shapes in it.
If you want to alter a shape or a line after you have drawn it, you need to get
down and dirty and start changing the nodes. Nodes are the dots that Paint
Shop Pro plays connect-the-dots with to create lines and shapes; you can
move nodes, remove them, or change how the line passes through them.
To start fiddling with nodes, you need to select the Pen tool and click the Edit
Mode button on the Tool Options palette (right under the word Mode).
When you have the Pen tool selected, even if you’re not in Node Edit mode,
enable the Show Nodes check box and you still have node-editing options
available. This redundancy is nice, but makes a fine distinction between Edit
mode and Draw mode generally a little fuzzy to the casual user — or even to
the writers of Dummies books, for that matter. You can tell that you can edit
nodes if you can see the nodes (tiny squares) along the line. Also, your
cursor turns solid black, and the nodes turn black when you click them.
Click here to rotate.

To enter Node Edit mode, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. On the Tool Options palette, click the Edit mode button.
After you’re in Edit mode, you can manipulate your nodes all you want. Here
are some changes you can make:
 To select a node for any action (like deleting, dragging, or changing its
type), click it. You know that you can select it when a 4-headed arrow
appears under the cursor; you know that a node is selected when it’s
solid black.
 To move a node, drag it. You can move multiple nodes at one time as
long as they’re all selected.
 To delete a node, press Delete.
 To select several nodes, hold down the Shift key while clicking them.
 To select several nodes at one time, make sure that you’re in Node Edit
mode (this action doesn’t work if you’re in Drawing or Knife mode) and
draw a square around the nodes you want to select.
 To select all nodes, right-click a node and choose Edit➪Select All from
the context menu that pops up.
 To join two line segments that are part of the same object (for example,
if they were created by cutting a line in half with the Pen tool in Knife
mode), select the two ends you want to join by Shift+clicking both of
them and then right-click your image and choose Edit➪Join.
If your vector shape is the only vector layer in your image, you may be able
to select nodes in it, regardless of which layer you’re in — which is a direct
reversal of everything we have told you in all the other layer sections. (Paint
Shop Pro loves to make us look foolish.) However, if you have more than one
vector layer in an image, you can select nodes from only the vector object
you have selected. For more information on what these layers are, look to
Chapter 11.
Note that a line has direction, based on the order in which you create the 
line. The control arrow that appears on a node in Node Edit mode points 
in the line’s direction. The word Start or End that appears when you pause
your mouse cursor over end nodes of a line also tells you the direction. A 
few things you do may be dependent on direction, such as aligning text to 
the line or shape.
235
Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Slicing Alongside Your Nodes
The Pen tool is mightier than the Sword tool — or would be, if a Sword tool
existed. Ironically, though, Knife mode is a part of the Pen tool, and it’s might-
ier than the rest of the Pen tool, by slicing in half the lines and shapes you
have drawn.
Select Knife mode from the Tool Options palette and drag a line through your
vector object. This action separates your object into two separate sets of
nodes, cut cleanly where you drew through them with the knife. Be warned
that even if you separate an image in two with the knife, both still count as
one vector object.
Changing Colors and Other Properties
Don’t like the color or some other look of your vector text, shape, or line? No
problem. Put on colored glasses — or use the Vector Properties dialog box.
Sound like fun? No? Well, it is fun. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Object Selection tool at the bottom of the Tools toolbar.
2. Select the object or objects you want to modify.
The selection frame appears around your chosen object or group of
objects. See the following section for different ways to select objects.
3. Right-click the object and then choose Properties from the context
menu that drops down.
The Vector Property dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-7, makes the scene.
With this puppy onscreen, you can change all kinds of features.
Figure 12-7:

236
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Here’s a list of what you can change:
 Object name: If you have lots of different objects in your image, you may
find naming them useful. Enter a name in the Name text box, if you like.
 (In)visibility: Clear the Visible check box to make your object invisible.
What good is an invisible object? It’s useful mainly as a hidden curve 
for text to follow. Refer to the section “Bending text to follow a line or
shape,” earlier in this chapter, to find out how to make text follow a
curve.
 Aliasing (staircasing): Place a check mark in the Anti-alias check box 
to avoid the jaggies (jagged edges) that afflict the edges of computer-
generated shapes.
 Color/gradient/pattern/texture: The Styles and Textures swatches work
just like the ones on the Material palette, except that you can’t make
them transparent from here.
 Thickness of line or outline: For a thicker line, adjust the Stroke Width
value upward.
 Dashed line or outline: Click the Line Style drop-down list and choose
something appropriately cool.
The rest of the controls have to do with joins. The term join refers to the
point that forms where line segments meet. Paint Shop Pro offers three basic
types of join, which you select by clicking the arrow next to the Join drop-
down list box and then choosing one of these options:
 Miter: A miter join (what Paint Shop Pro normally creates) is one that
ends in a point. It tries to end in a point, anyway. If the lines meet at 
an acute angle, Paint Shop Pro gives up in disgust and creates a flat
(beveled) end. The point at which it gives up is controlled by the value
in the Miter Limit value box. Fiddle with it this way:
• If you want a point, increase the Miter Limit value.
• If you want a flat end, decrease the Miter Limit value.
 Round: A round join is one that is, well, round at the point. Enough said.
 Bevel: A bevel join is one that is flat at the point, like a miter join that
has reached its miter limit (or a computer user who has reached her
limit and has been banging her head against the wall).
These join settings are available when you first create a line or shape, on the
Tool Options palette.
237
Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Controlling Your Objects
Creating objects is one thing; getting them to do what you want is another —
sort of like having kids. If the time has come to discipline your vector objects,
Paint Shop Pro can make them straighten up and fly right.
Lots of illustrations need objects that are precisely centered, balanced, or
distributed evenly. You can certainly arrange objects by dragging them and
rotating them. For drill-team precision, however, you should also check out
the Paint Shop Pro vector object positioning talents.
Selecting and grouping vector objects
To do anything to an existing object, you need to select it first. Vector objects
(the usual Paint Shop Pro form of text, lines, and shapes) have their own
selection tool — the Object Selection tool. The Other Paint Shop Pro selec-
tion tools (the Magic Wand, Freehand, and Selection tools) don’t work on
vector objects.
Click the Object Selection tool that appears on the Tools toolbar and then do
one of the following:
 Click your vector object to select it. If the object has gaps in it (spaces
between letters, for example), don’t click the gaps. Even if the object
isn’t on your active layer, the tool selects the object. Your layer selection
doesn’t change.
 Drag around one or more objects. Whatever vector objects you drag
around become selected. Selecting multiple objects lets you treat them
as a group for many purposes: You can change their color, change other
properties, or use the Paint Shop Pro automatic arrangement features.
 Hold down the Shift key and click multiple objects to select a group.
To remove objects from that selection, hold down the Ctrl key and click
them.
You don’t need to use the Object Selection tool. With the Layer palette open,
you can click the object’s name on the list of layers.
A selection frame appears around your object or group of objects, with
squares (handles) you can drag to move, resize, or rotate the object or group.
To create a single object out of multiple objects, select them all and choose
Objects➪Group. To ungroup them again, select the group and choose Objects➪
UnGroup.
To deselect, press Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪Select None from the menu
bar. To select all objects, press Ctrl+A or choose Selections➪Select All.
238
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Paint Shop Pro selects an object automatically after you create it so that you
can move, resize, or rotate the object. You can tell that the object is selected
by the rectangular frame that appears around it. Even though the object is
selected, however, you can’t access the same context menu (the thing that
pops up when you right-click) that you could access if you had selected 
the object with the Object Selection tool! For example, you can’t change the
object’s color unless you first select the object with the Object Selection tool.
Deleting, copying, pasting, and editing
As with nearly any Windows program, you can delete, cut, copy, or paste
selected objects in Paint Shop Pro by using the Windows Clipboard. First,
select the object with the Object Selection tool. Next, do any of the following:
 Copy, cut, or delete: Use the conventional Windows keystrokes (Ctrl+X
to cut, Ctrl+C to copy, and the Delete key to delete) or the familiar tool-
bar buttons Cut (scissors icon) or Copy (2-documents icon).
 Paste: You can use the conventional Paste command (Ctrl+V) and Paste
button (Clipboard-with-document icon). These conventional methods,
however, create an entire, new image from the Clipboard contents. More
likely, you want to paste the object as a new object on the current layer.
For that, choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Vector Selection or press Ctrl+G
on your keyboard. Your copied object appears and is selected so that
you can position it; click to anchor it. Another alternative is to paste
your object as a new layer: Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Layer or press
Ctrl+L.
Positioning, arranging, and sizing by hand
To move an object (or group of objects), select it with the Object Selection
tool. You can then position it in the following ways:
 Move it: Click anywhere on an object (on the outline or fill, but not in
gaps like the spaces between letters), and then you can drag it any-
where. Or, you can drag the object by the square handle in the center 
of the selection frame. You can tell when your cursor is properly posi-
tioned over the square handle because the cursor displays a 4-headed
arrow.
 Resize or reproportion it: Drag any corner of the frame, or any side of
the frame, by one of the square handles to resize the object or group. By
default, Paint Shop Pro keeps the proportions constant; if you want to
drag one corner away to skew your shape, hold down the Shift key as you
drag, and if you want to change the perspective, hold down Ctrl. These
work pretty much like the Deformation tool, described in Chapter 4.
239
Chapter 12: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

 Place it on top of or underneath another object: Vector objects can
overlay one another, so sometimes you need to control which object is
on top of which. Envision them in a stack and the following menu
choices on the Objects➪Arrange menu make sense:
• Bring to Top (puts your selected object on top of all)
• Move Up (raises your object in the stack)
• Move Down (lowers your object in the stack)
• Send to Bottom (puts your object on the bottom of the stack)
Alternatively, you can see the stack of objects on the Layer palette and
adjust an object’s positioning by dragging it up or down. Refer to
Chapter 11, where we discuss managing vector and other layers.
 Rotate it: Sticking out from the center square is an arm that ends in a
square handle. Pause your mouse cursor over that handle so that the
mouse cursor displays a pair of circling arrows. Drag the handle around
the center square to rotate your object.

T
his chapter is, without a doubt, the most entertaining one in this book.
Oh, we’re not saying that the other chapters aren’t useful — you need to
know how to do the everyday tasks, like scanning photos, and we can make
it painless. But we can’t do much to make those everyday tasks riveting.
Nobody’s reading through Chapter 5 and giggling as they scan photo after
photo and titter, “Look! The light on the platen is moving! How cool is that?”
Rest assured, you will giggle at some of the stuff you can do in this chapter. With
a few mouse clicks, you can turn a photo of your back yard into a watercolor
painting! You can make your image all wavy, like a Scooby Doo flashback! You
can even twist your photo into a compact, reflective sphere! Now, that’s cool.
Paint Shop Pro has enough wild and crazy effects to satisfy the most avant
garde artistes (also known as psycho art geeks). The Effects menu in Paint
Shop Pro 9 hides more than 70 different effects that you can apply to your
images — and they can make some dramatic differences, by surrounding
your image with a wooden picture frame, showering your picture with col-
ored lights, or adding leather and fur textures. These gadgets are great fun,
and incredible timesavers when you need a striking effect in a hurry.
Many of these effects use adjustment dialog boxes, which all have a set of
common controls for zooming, previewing, proofing, and other functions.
Refer to Chapter 7 for help in using these controls — specifically, the section
about understanding the Paint Shop Pro dialog boxes. We don’t repeat those
instructions here.

Paint Shop Pro categorizes its creative effects into these ten major 
categories:
 3D effects: For turning selected areas into raised buttons or cutouts,
dropping shadows, or doing anything else that looks like it’s raised
above or dropped below the page.
 Art Media effects: For simulating physical art media, like pencil, colored
chalk, and paint brushing.
 Artistic effects: For changing your picture into another media entirely,
like a big neon glow, a topographical map, or a tinfoil stamp.
 Distortion effects: For warping the surface of your image, by sending
gentle ripples across the top of it, making it look like you’re looking at it
through a big lens, or pixelating parts of it just like they do whenever
someone is exposing too much flesh on Cops.
 Edge effects: For finding the edges within a picture and bringing them
into focus or softening those edges into a fine Silly Putty-ish blur.
 Geometric effects: For wrapping or distorting the image as a whole. In
Distortion Effects, you change the surface, but the picture still stays the
same size and shape; in Geometric Effects, you can wrap your picture
around a can, or stre-e-e-e-tch it like it was a big rubber band.
 Illumination effects: For introducing a sunburst or placing one or more
spotlights on parts of the image.
 Image effects: A catchall category for creating tiles, moving images
slightly, or creating a page-curl effect.
 Reflection effects: For holding a mirror — or several mirrors — up to
your fabulous image, creating a simple reverse image or a funhouse
array of reflections.
 Texture effects: For giving your image the effect of being laid on different
surfaces, like crinkled paper or leather, or seen through mosaic glass.
Effects, like most other features of Paint Shop Pro, are applied only to the
active layer you’re working on — and, if you have an area selected, only
within that selection. This restriction is designed to let you modify just the
portion of the image you want, but it can also be confusing if you forget that
you have a selection or have changed layers: Your effect may not appear to
work. If your image has multiple layers, make sure that you’re on the layer
you want the effect applied to.
If you’re working with a photograph or scanned picture, your image probably
has just a single layer. (Every image contains at least one layer, known as the
background layer.) For more information on layers — which are fantastically
handy things to know about — check out Chapter 11.
242
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Also, effects don’t work on Vector or Adjustment layers. If you use an Adjust-
ment layer, you must merge it with your image if you want your effect to act
on that adjustment.
Effects don’t work on 256-color images. If your image has 256 or fewer colors,
Paint Shop Pro asks whether it’s okay to automatically increase the color depth
to 16.7 million. Click OK, and then see Chapter 16 if you want it to stop asking
these silly questions.
If you use a certain adjustment often, you can save its settings as presets; see
Chapter 18 for more details on this timesaver.
Try ’Em On: Browsing the Effects
An easy way to try an effect on your image is to use the Effect Browser. Choose
Effects➪Effect Browser. The Effect Browser dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 13-1.
Choose an effect on the left side; as you can see in Figure 13-1, each of
the effects is grouped into ten subfolders stored in the Effects folder — 
conveniently enough, there’s one subfolder for each of the ten categories
we list in the preceding section.
You can expand a folder by clicking the plus box to the left of it, or you can
collapse the folder by clicking the minus sign. Click in any of the folders to
get samples of all the effects within each folder; the preview window on the
right side gives you a tiny preview of what the effect does to your image. If
you have a selected area (or if the active layer contains only one filled-in
area), that area fills the preview window.
Figure 13-1:

of an effect’s

your image.
243
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

Note: A folder named Adjustments has a bunch of filters and corrections that
you can apply in order to improve photo quality. We go over most of the rele-
vant adjustments in Part II, but feel free to click the Adjustments folder if you
want to see a constellation of color shifts, blurs, and focusings.
If your computer is taking a long time to render the effects, click the Quick
Render check box on the right side, which creates a quick-and-dirty thumb-
nail version of the effects. If you want the full Monty in finely rendered glory,
feel free to uncheck the box.
A given subfolder often holds several variations on a single effect. For example,
an Artistic effect named Chrome makes your image look shiny and reflective.
But, when you look in the Artistic Effects folder, you can see many different
Chrome effects — Dark and Rough Chrome, Underwater Chrome, Toxic Chrome,
and Smooth and Bright Chrome.
All those effects were created by entering different settings in the dialog box
that appears when you choose Effects➪Artistic Effects➪Chrome. (The Effect
Browser is where Jasc, the creator of Paint Shop Pro, likes to show off, so some
truly spectacular effects are hidden in the browser.) If you want to tweak those
settings, you can click the Modify button, which brings up the dialog box of
whatever effect you’re viewing. You can alter those settings and click OK to
apply them to your image. If you want to rename an effect, click Rename and
enter a new and snazzier moniker for your effect.
Technically speaking, these different effects are called presets, and you can
create your own — which then show up in the Effect Browser. For details, see
the section in Chapter 18 about saving tool and effect settings as presets.
Then again, if you like what you see, simply click the effect you want and
click Apply. That effect is then applied to your image. If you don’t like the
results, press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo button on the toolbar.
3-D: Holes, Buttons, and Chisels
Except for the Buttonize effect, you must select an area before you apply any of
the 3-D effects. The area you select is what is turned into a button, chiseled, cut
out, or beveled inside or outside the selection marquee. Also, if you intend to
use background color for the Buttonize, Chisel, or Inner Bevel effect, choose
it now.
Choose Effects➪3D Effects. Then, choose one of these options from the menu
that appears:
244
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Buttonize: Creates a raised appearance (inside your selection if you have
made a selection). Because it’s a Web thing, we discuss buttonization in
Chapter 15, in the section about creating buttons.
 Chisel: Creates a raised appearance by making an edge outside your
selection. In the Chisel dialog box that appears, increase the edge width
by increasing the Size value. Choose Transparent Edge to see through
the edge, or Solid Color otherwise. Choose a color for your chiseled
edge by clicking the Color box.
 Cutout: Creates the illusion of cutting out your selected area and extend-
ing a shadow in two directions. Drag the Vertical and Horizontal sliders
left or right to extend the shadow from different edges. Increase the
Opacity setting to darken the shadow, or increase Blur to blur the
shadow’s edge. You can change the color of the shadow or the underly-
ing surface by clicking the Shadow Color swatch or the Fill Interior with
Color swatch, respectively. Then, choose a color from the Color dialog
box that appears.
 Drop Shadow: Drops a shadow in any direction from your selected area,
as though that area were floating over a surface. In the Drop Shadow
dialog box that appears, drag Vertical and Horizontal sliders to change the
shadow location — or, if you want something a little more intuitive, you
can click the crosshairs in the left window and drag them around the cen-
tral circle to indicate which way (and how far away) you want the shadow
to fall. The Opacity, Blur, and Color settings work exactly the same way
as they do in the Cutout section.
 Inner Bevel or Outer Bevel: Creates a framelike effect around the selected
area by raising it up as though it were a pyramid. The pyramid’s sloping
sides (the bevel) appear within your selection area for Inner Bevel or
outside the area for Outer Bevel. A rather complex-looking dialog box
appears. Click the Bevel illustration to choose a bevel profile from a
gallery. (Each profile is like the cross sections of wood moldings you see
in a hardware store.)
Art and Artistic Effects: Simulating
Traditional Art Media and Beyond
Welcome to Fun Central. The Art and Artistic effects are where you get to
turn your casual snapshots into Monet-style paintings, transform your shot of
London Bridge into a charcoal scribble, or turn your senior prom photo into
an Andy Warhol–style halftone.
245
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

Paint Shop Pro offers far too many artistic effects for us to discuss them indi-
vidually here. Besides, we don’t want to rob you of the pleasure of squealing
“Hey, look! It did that!” So, rather than explain every item on the two menus,
we show you a couple of examples in this section and move on.
Choose Effects➪Artistic Effects or Effects➪Art Media Effects and Paint Shop
Pro reveals a large menu of possibilities. (As we said earlier, Art Media effects
tend to simulate things you can do in real life, like turning your picture into a
pencil drawing, and Artistic effects transform your picture into another media
entirely, like an old newspaper or hot chrome.) Choose one from the list.
246
Part III: Painting Pictures 
Scripts as an alternative to effects
Not all Artistic effects are under the Artistic
Effects and Art Media Effects menu selections!
Paint Shop Pro 9 also includes several scripts
designed to transform a picture into nice-looking
watercolors, charcoals, and airbrush paintings.
Because scripts can apply multiple commands
to an image, the results are often far superior to
a single effect. In the following figure, compare
the simple Black Pencil effect, on the left, to the
Black and White Sketch script on the right.
To run a script, select the Artistic category from
the drop-down list on the Scripts toolbar, and
then choose the effect you want to see. Next,
click the Run Selected Script button, and watch
in awe as Paint Shop Pro applies several care-
fully tuned effects to your image.
For more information about scripts, see the sec-
tion in Chapter 18 about using scripts to auto-
mate repetitive tasks.

Nearly all these effects display an adjustment dialog box. See the section
“Common Adjustments,” later in this chapter, for help regarding more spe-
cialized controls. For the most part, your best approach is to fiddle with the
controls for a while. A few effects take place immediately. If you don’t like the
result, press Ctrl+Z to undo it.
Here are a few more general tips for using artistic effects:
 If the result is too fuzzy, try decreasing various values, (especially density,
if that adjustment exists). Most effects do some blurring, so if you turn it
down a bit (decrease the effect), the image becomes clearer.
 If the result is too speckly or has too many lines, look for a detail adjust-
ment and if you find one, turn it down.
 Some effects that do stuff with edges need a little help. Try running the
Edge Enhance effect (choose Effects➪Edge Effects➪Enhance) or boosting
contrast before applying your artistic effect. Or, in the adjustment box
for your edge-fiddling effect, look for an intensity control and increase it.
Example 1: Topography
Topography is, for no particularly good reason, one of our favorite artistic
effects. Its result is an image that looks like stacked, cut sheets of cardboard or
foamboard (like the ones architects use in models to simulate sloping ground).
Figure 13-2 shows the creation of Sir Topography.
Figure 13-2:

247
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

The controls do the following:
 Width: At low Width settings, contours follow the details of the picture
more closely. At high Width settings, contours are broad and without
sharp turns; detail is lost.
 Density: Density controls the number of layers in the virtual stack of
layers. A higher density results in a surface that conforms more to the
original detail. A lower density gives a more abstract result.
 Angle: The Angle control in the Lighting section determines the direc-
tion from which light is coming to illuminate the side of the stack. Drag
its clock-hand-like control to point in the direction you want this light to
shine.
 Color: Color determines the color of light that strikes the stack from the
side. Originally, the Color control is set to white. To change it, you can
left-click the swatch to bring up the Color palette.
Example 2: Brush Strokes
The Brush Strokes effect has lots of things to fiddle with, and you probably
have to spend some time fiddling to get a result you like. It gives the appear-
ance of applying thin or thick paint with a brush. In real life, the edges of
paint strokes catch any incidental light, and in this effect you can simulate
that appearance in varying degrees. Figure 13-3 shows a photograph of faith-
ful Alex, who stays there forever as long as you keep stroking his fur.
The Brush Strokes controls work as follows:
 Length: Short lengths (low values of Length) create a stippled effect, like
someone poking the end of a brush into the canvas. Longer lengths pro-
duce visible stroke directions.
 Density: Density determines the number of strokes. The greatest sensi-
tivity of this control is at the very low end. A very low density (1 or 2)
gives the appearance of a few strokes made over a photograph. Higher
density makes a more abstract effect of many overlaid strokes.
 Bristles: A higher value of Bristles gives the distinct patch of paint that a
nice, new, neatly trimmed brush, packed densely with bristles, lays down.
A lower value simulates the scratchy result of a brush where the bristles
are few or frazzled.
 Width: The Width control determines the width of the brush stroke. A
higher value makes a wider brush.
 Opacity: The Opacity control sets the density of the paint. A low value
gives a blurred effect that is more like looking through frosted glass than
anything else. A high value makes paint look like it was applied thickly,
as though with a palette knife.
248
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Softness: The Softness control gives a smoother look to the paint sur-
face, with less speckling.
 Angle: The Angle control determines the direction of the incident light
that glints off the edges of thick paint strokes. Drag the clock-hand-like
control to point toward the source of the light.
 Color: To change the color of incident light striking the paint edges, click
the Color swatch and choose from the Color dialog box. (Or, right-click
to choose from the Recent Colors dialog box.) Black gives no incident
light, a dark color (low lightness value) gives a little, and so on. High
lightness values strongly emphasize the stroke edges.
As with many effects, if you return to this adjustment dialog box later, it nor-
mally resumes whatever settings you last used. This intelligent behavior saves
you from lots of time spent returning to settings you like.
If you use this effect often, you may want to save any given combination of
settings as a preset for later use. See the section in Chapter 18 about presets.
Geometric, Distortion, and Image Effects:
Curls, Squeezes, Wraps, and Waves
Paint Shop Pro has enough curls, squeezes, and waves to outfit an entire army
of cute toddlers. If you want anything bent, distorted, or wrapped, Paint Shop
Pro can tie it up in a knot.
Figure 13-3:

249
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

Choose Effects➪Geometric Effects, Effects➪Distortion Effects, or Effects➪
Image Effects and then choose from the large list that appears. As with the
Artistic effects, Paint Shop Pro has too many effects for us to try to cover
completely. Fortunately, most controls are either self evident or do some-
thing that you can easily figure out by playing with them. We give you a
couple of examples, though.
Here are a few tips for using Geometric effects:
 Some effects are centered on a particular location. To move the center,
adjust the Horizontal and Vertical controls. A setting of zero centers the
effect horizontally or vertically. Negative horizontal values are to the left
of center; negative vertical values are above center.
 Remember that you can apply any effect to a particular area by selecting
that area first. Using a feathered edge on the selection feathers the modi-
fied image into the original image.
Need a thinner face? If you have a portrait on a plain background, Paint Shop
Pro can help. First, carefully select the face. Then, equally carefully, remove
areas around the eyes, nose, and mouth from the selection. (See Chapter 3
for help with removing areas from a selection.) Apply the Pinch effect from
the Distortion Effects menu.
The Page Curl effect is, for some reason, one of the most enduringly popular
image effects. It seems that we never tire of remarking, “Why, Martha, that
photo looks like it’s a-peelin’ right off the page!” We guess that the Page Curl
effect (easily accessible by choosing Effects➪Image Effects➪Page Curl) is just
plain a-peelin’. Figure 13-4 shows this remarkable effect.
Here’s how to control your curl, with the most important stuff listed first:
 Corner: Which corner do you want to curl? Click the button depicting
your chosen corner.
 Curl Bounding Rectangle Width and Height: To set the position of the
curl, drag the tiny gear-shaped widgets at either end of the black line
that diagonally crosses the left preview window. As Figure 13-4 shows
you, your cursor becomes a four-headed arrow when it’s over the line’s
end. Alternatively, you can adjust the Width or Height values to move
those points; watch the line as you do so, and see how the Width and
Height values affect it.
 Radius: How broad do you want the curl to be? The smaller the Radius
value, the tighter the corner is rolled up. The smaller the corner you’re
curling (that is, the lower the X and Y values), the smaller the Radius
value usually needs to be.
250
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Curl Settings Color: This setting controls the color that appears on the
highlight of the curl (the underside of the curled picture). Paint Shop
Pro makes the rest of the curl, the shaded part, the same hue, but
darker.
 Edge Mode: This setting controls the shade that appears on the flat
page revealed by the lifted corner. Click the box to choose a different
color from the Color dialog box, or right-click to choose from the
Recent Colors dialog box, or select Transparent to do away with any
nasty colors.
Bear in mind that besides curling the edge of the entire image, you can select
a rectangle — a stamp on an envelope, for example — and curl that. (Other
selection shapes don’t usually work as well.)
Illumination Effects: Sunbursts 
and Flares
If you need a sparkle of sunlight, unwrap the Paint Shop Pro Sunburst effect.
It places a bright spot on your image, with rays of light and circles of lens
flare. The adjustment dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-5, on top of
the image that it’s modifying, to better show the effects.
Figure 13-4:
Choose
a corner,

window,

251
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

Each of the controls for the three different components has its own area:
Light Spot, Rays, and Circle Brightness. All share the same color setting.
Here’s how to use these adjustments:
 Color: Click the Color sample to choose some color other than white
from the Color dialog box.
 Light Spot Brightness: Increase to brighten the light spot.
 Light Spot Horizontal/Vertical: Adjust to position the spot. Or, if you
can see a tiny set of crosshairs in the left preview window, drag that
instead. When your cursor is over the crosshairs, the cursor becomes
a four-headed arrow.
 Rays Brightness: Set this option higher to bring out the rays of light you
can see in Figure 13-5.
 Rays Density: Adjust this setting lower to see fewer rays or higher to see
more rays.
 Circle Brightness: Set this option higher to make the lens flare circles
brighter. On light photos, these circles are barely visible, even at full
brightness.
Reflection Effects: Mirrors and Patterns
The Reflection effects are a funhouse phenomenon. You can choose a single
mirror, or multiple mirrors in various configurations, turning your image into
a pattern. Choose Effects➪Reflection Effects and then one of the four menu
items that appear:
Figure 13-5:

tion into his

252
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Feedback: The mirror-reflecting-into-mirror effect you get in barbershops
with mirrors on opposite walls. See “Common Adjustments,” later in this
chapter, for help with this effect’s controls.
 Kaleidoscope: A humdinger of an effect, like looking at your image
through a kaleidoscope.
 Pattern: Another way, besides Kaleidoscope, to turn your image into a
pattern. See the following two sections.
 Rotating Mirror: Similar to putting a mirror edge-down on your image.
You can rotate a reflection to any angle and position the mirror horizon-
tally and vertically on the image.
You can limit any of these effects to a particular area by making a selection first.
Texture Effects: Bumpy Surfaces 
from Asphalt to Weaves
Texture is the neglected third dimension of an image. Texture, the surface on
which the image is constructed, is a quality that most of us don’t think about
when we think about images, but it’s very much a part of the visual experience.
An image made up of mosaic tiles, for example, feels very different from the
same image painted on canvas.
To choose a Texture effect, choose Effects➪Texture Effects and then choose
from the extensive menu that appears. Paint Shop Pro has too many textures
to cover in detail, but the next few sections should help you sort things out.
All effects except one (the Emboss effect) open an adjustment dialog box, in
which you should feel free to fiddle while watching the effect.
Relating texture effects to the 
Materials palette’s textures
You may be a bit confused because Paint Shop Pro gives you two ways to use
texture in your images. If you’re painting an image, you can apply texture by
using the Properties dialog box (as we show you in Chapter 9). If you already
have an image, the Texture effects are the way to go.
Texture effects offer more variety and more powerful effects than the Properties
box does. For example, you can’t paint fur texture or leather crinkling over
an image by using the Material box, but you can apply it as an effect. Also,
unlike Texture effects, which offer scads of ways to change each effect, with
Properties box textures you’re stuck with three options: the texture, the angle,
and the size. That’s it; take it or leave it.
253
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

If you find that this isn’t nearly enough meddling, you can select a sort of
superpowered Properties box texture from the Texture Effects menu by
choosing — surprise — Texture. In that effect’s dialog box, you can achieve
all kinds of variations using the texture effects that you can’t achieve within
the Properties box itself.
(Why didn’t Jasc just provide a separate tab for textures in the Properties box
that had all this stuff in one place, the way it does for gradients and colors?
Heck if we know.)
Just as the Texture effect gives you more leverage over the Material box’s 
textures, the Sculpture effect lets you leverage the Color palette’s patterns.
The effect’s main job is to turn your image into a sort of etching or emboss-
ing, but it also applies patterns. Patterns are sort of like textures, but come
with their own colors. The Sculpture effect applies a Paint Shop Pro pattern,
which allows you to set a number of variables that are unavailable on the
Properties box palette. In the Sculpture effect, for example, you can give a
pattern a (uniform) color or change its size (scale).
Using Texture effect controls
Texture adjustments have, in general, two main types of controls:
 Those for the virtual substance that puts ridges and valleys in the image
 Those for the light that strikes at some oblique angle and reveals that
unevenness
In addition, the virtual substances that make up some textures have optical
qualities you can adjust, like transparency and blurring.
If a texture or pattern is unclear at some settings, try zooming out in the
adjustment dialog box. (Click the magnifier-with-a-minus-sign button.)
The best way to understand most texture controls is to fiddle with them while
watching the right preview window in the adjustment dialog box. (Only the
Emboss effect goes to work immediately, without displaying a dialog box.)
Some of the more common controls you find in the adjustment dialog boxes
are shown in this list:
 Length (and occasionally Width) or Size: The dimensions of the ridges
and valleys that make up the texture.
 Blur: The overall fuzziness imparted to the original image.
 Detail: How much detail the lines of texture inherit from the edges of the
original image.
 Density: The degree to which ridges and valleys are packed closely
together.
254
Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Transparency: The ability to let the original image show clearly through
the virtual substance that overlays the image.
 Angle: The direction from which incident light strikes the surface.
 Elevation: The height of the light source above the image. Low elevations
show the ridges and valleys more strongly. High elevations make a brighter
image. Some textures allow you to set the intensity or luminance and
color of the incident light as well.
 Ambience: The overall brightness (ambient light) of the image.
Example 1: The Fur texture effect
A simple texture effect is Fur, excessively applied to Alex in Figure 13-6. The
Fur effect causes fibers to radiate from clusters throughout your image,
giving a result not unlike the fur of a cat engaged in discussion with a
member of the canine profession.
You can go “fur” with this effect if you interpret your controls in the follow-
ing ways:
 Blur: A kind of fluffiness control. Increasing the blur minimizes the visi-
bility of individual hairs and also makes the original image less clear.
 Density: Determines the number of hairs; very low settings give a cac-
tuslike, whiskered appearance.
 Length: Sets the length of individual hairs. High length values tend to
give more of a frosted-glass appearance than a furry one.
 Transparency: Determines the extent to which the original image shows
through the hair, undisturbed. High transparency values give an effect
like hair sprinkled on a photograph.

255
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

Example 2: The Texture texture effect
The Texture effect you see when you choose Effects➪Texture Effects➪Texture
gives you access to the same textures you may use for painting with the Paint
Shop Pro Color palette. Here, rather than paint with them, you apply them to
an existing image. Figure 13-7 shows faithful Alex, this time receiving a cob-
blestone texture.
The controls of this dialog box provide enough fiddles to outfit a symphony
orchestra. Here’s how to make them play in tune:
 Texture: Click here and choose a texture from the Paint Shop Pro gallery
of textures that appears.
 Size (%): Make the texture pattern larger by increasing this value above
zero. Decrease the value (to make the value negative) for a smaller pattern.
 Smoothness: To blunt the sharp edges of your texture, increase this
value.
 Depth: To have deeper valleys and higher hills in your pattern, increase
this value. This action usually makes the pattern more visible, so you
can also think of it as a kind of strength control.
 Ambience: Adjust this control for a brighter or darker image.

Part III: Painting Pictures 

 Shininess: A higher value of shininess puts a bright glint on the edges
and corners of your texture pattern.
 Color: Click this swatch to choose a different color of incident light from
the Colors dialog box.
 Angle: Drag the clock-hand-like control to point toward the imaginary
light source that illuminates the texture.
 Intensity: Higher intensity increases the incident light that reveals the
contrast.
 Elevation: Lower values emphasize the hills and valleys; higher values
brighten the flat hilltops and valley bottoms. (Reduce the Ambience
value to avoid washout at high elevations.)
Common Adjustments
Effects use a wide range of adjustments to set their various variables. In most
cases, the function of a control becomes apparent as soon as you fiddle with
it, but in complex dialog boxes, you may need to understand what does what.
This list helps you distinguish one variable from another:
 Ambience: General illumination. Determines the image brightness with
the incident light source’s intensity and elevation.
 Amplitude: The degree to which the effect is applied.
 Angle: The direction of incident light in the plane of the image. Drag the
clock-hand-like control to point toward the source.
 Blur: A fuzziness that affects mostly the original image showing through
the texture. It makes the texture fuzzier in some textures.
 Color: A swatch showing the color of light that glints off the texture’s
hills and valleys. Click the swatch to choose a new color from the Color
dialog box. (To find out how to adjust color, refer to Chapter 9.) Right-click
the swatch to choose from the Recent Colors dialog box.
 Density: The closeness and number of hills and valleys in the texture.
 Detail: The degree to which the texture picks out the detail in the original
image.
 % Effect: The degree to which the effect is applied.
 Elevation: The height of the incident light above the plane of the image.
Low elevations show the ridges and valleys more strongly. High elevations
make a brighter image.
257
Chapter 13: Adding Artsy Effects

 Height: The height of the hills in the texture.
 Horizontal/Vertical Center: The position of the center of the effect.
 Horizontal/Vertical Offset: The position of the overall resulting pattern.
 Intensity: The strength of the incident light that reveals the texture.
 Length: The length of the ridges and valleys that make up the texture.
 Opacity: The degree to which the blobs of virtual substance pick up
color from the underlying image, as opposed to letting the image’s 
original pixels show through.
 Presets: A drop-down list that lets you choose from among any named
collection of settings you have saved or your Last Used settings. After
you change any setting, the Presets selection says Custom.
 Radius: The broadness of any curve or curl; smaller radius values make
curves or curls tighter.
 Save As: A button leading to the Preset Save dialog box, in which you
enter a name to label your current collection of settings. Choose the
name from the Presets list box to recall the setting.
 Shininess: The glare off the sloping sides of the hills and valleys of the
texture.
 Size: The overall size of the elements of the texture.
 Smoothness: How rounded the bumps are that make up the texture.
 Symmetric: A check box that makes an effect work the same way in all
directions.
 Transparent/Background color: Options that either make an edge reveal
the underlying image color (Transparent) or color the edge with the cur-
rent Paint Shop Pro background color.
Framing Your Art
So, you may have transformed a picture of Fido into an oil painting, complete
with sweeping strokes and a little bit of texture to flesh it out. But, you still
feel unsatisfied. That’s only natural — after all, what masterpiece is complete
without an elegant frame?
Choose Image➪Picture Frame to display the Picture Frame dialog box, as
shown in Figure 13-8. Clicking the arrow next to the Picture Frame drop-down
list displays a gallery of frames to choose from, including modern art frames,
edge brushings, filmstrip frames, or the ever-popular masking-tape-on-the-
corners look. Select a frame to see a preview of your framed image on the
right side.
258
Part III: Painting Pictures 

Two radio buttons give you the option to have your frame placed on the out-
side of your image or to have the frame jutting into the inside (and potentially
obscuring something on the edges of your picture, just like a real frame). Two
other radio buttons give you the option to frame just the current layer, or
your image as a whole. (We can’t see a reason that you would want to frame
just a single layer, but somebody must have asked for it.)
Only a few frames have transparent edges. You can opt to keep them trans-
parent by clicking the Keep Transparent check box, or you can click the
check box to choose a color to fill in the gaps.
Three check boxes allow you to flip, mirror, and rotate the frame, exactly
the same as you would flip, rotate, or mirror an image (we show you how in
Chapter 2). When you’re ready to frame, click OK.

A
ll this electronic image stuff is just fine, but in the end, many of us want
our images printed on dead, flattened, bleached trees — paper. As a
good friend once said, “The paperless office of the future is just down the hall
from the paperless bathroom of the future.” Paper will be around for a little
while yet.
Paint Shop Pro has some great features for making the printing job easier: It
automatically fits the image to the page, prints a collection or album page of
images, prints browser thumbnails, and more. Read on for ways to make
paper printing work better and faster for you.
Fitting Your Print to the Paper
“Let the punishment fit the crime,” said Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado, who
prescribed the death penalty for flirting. With the help of the few hints in this
section, your image should fit your page with far less pain.
If you have multiple images open in Paint Shop Pro, click the title bar on the
window of the image you want to print. That makes it the active window.
You can find all the controls for sizing and positioning your print on paper 
by choosing File➪Print to bring up the Print dialog box and then clicking 
the Placement tab if it’s not already shown. You can see the handy-dandy
Placement tab, as shown in Figure 14-1, and then consult the following bul-
leted list for help.

Keep in mind that when Paint Shop Pro changes the size of your print, it’s not
changing your image. It’s only resizing the printed output; the image itself
isn’t changed in any way. If your image is 500 pixels across, it remains 500
pixels across. Stretching a small image to fill a page may result in quite a
grainy printed copy!
Use these options in the Placement dialog box to fit your print to your paper:
 Number of copies: This option is self-explanatory. You can print as
many as a hundred copies at a time, but we wouldn’t advise it unless
you have lots of ink hanging around.
 Printing sideways (orientation): Paint Shop Pro initially sets you up to
print in portrait orientation on the paper, in which the paper’s long
dimension runs vertically. For prints that are wider than they are high,
however, you may want to print sideways, or in landscape orientation.
Click either Portrait or Landscape to choose orientation.
 Centering: Often, you want your print centered on the page. Click the
Center on Page radio button to do just that.
 Filling the page: To fill the page with your image (to the maximum
extent possible), click the Fit To Page radio button, and your print is
enlarged until it fills either the width or height of the paper, within the
allowable margins of your printer.
 Upper left of page: What else can we say? It’s in the upper-left corner.
 Offset: If having your image in the middle or the upper-left corner isn’t
good enough for you, selecting the Custom Offset value allows you to
position your image on the paper wherever you want it. The Left and 
Top Offset values — which are grayed out unless you specifically choose
Custom Offset — control how far your image is placed from the left or top
margin. Enter however many inches you want your image to be shoved
away from either side, and the result is shown in the preview window.

tab fits your

Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

 Making the image larger or smaller: You can print your image as small
as .025 percent of its original size or scale it up to a Godzilla-sized 1,000
percent (ten times larger). Adjust the Scale value in the Size and position
area to whatever percentage you want. A setting of 100 percent means
that the image’s resolution, assigned at its creation, is observed. An
image that’s 144 pixels wide, for example, at a typical resolution of 72
pixels per inch, is printed 2 inches wide. (This option is grayed out in
the Fit to Page feature, which scales your image automatically.)
Another method of scaling your printed image is to specify a specific
size, in inches, at which the image is printed. Enter a value for either the
width or the height; the image scales proportionately, so if you double
the width, the height is also doubled. (If for some reason you want to
print a squashed image, we refer you to the Distortion tool — described
in Chapter 4, in the section about doing the deformation — where you
can presquash it.)
When you print an image at a scale much greater than 100 percent, your
pixels may begin to show. Scandalous! Rather than scale your print, try
closing the Print dialog box (click Close), scaling your image by that
same percentage, and resampling it via Smart Size. Refer to Chapter 2 for
help with resizing. Your image may be a bit blurred, but it doesn’t look
as pixelated.
Printing in Greyscale and Other Options
If you’re looking to save some colored ink, you can choose File➪Print to bring
up the Print dialog box and then click the Options tab. It gives you a choice of
three colors in which to print: Color, Greyscale (black and white), and CMYK
separations. (Don’t worry about printing CMYK separations unless you’re a
professional artist — if you are, you’ll know what to do when you see it.)
If you’re going to print lots of images, you may want the filename of the image
on the print. If so, enable the Image Name check box. (If you have entered a
title on the Creator Information tab in the Current Image Information dialog
box, that title appears in place of the filename.)
In some instances, you may want to trim the margins off the print when
you’re done. If your image has a white background, however, finding those
margins may be hard. To solve that problem, enable the Print Corner Crop
Marks and Print Center Crop Marks check boxes.
Printing an Image
After you have set everything to your liking, it’s time to get printin’!

Chapter 14: Printing

1. If you haven’t done so already, choose File➪Print, press Ctrl+P, or
click the Print button on the toolbar.
The Print dialog box appears.
2. If necessary, choose your printing options.
By clicking the Properties button, you can adjust the usual controls that
come with any Windows program: the printer you’re using, the number
of copies you want, and a Properties button that takes you to the
printer’s driver software. (That’s where you can set the print quality,
speed, paper type, and other variables. Refer to the section “Printing at
Different Speeds or Qualities,” later in this chapter.)
3. Click Print after you have set all the options you want.
Shortly, you’ll have a hard copy of your hard work.
Printing Collections or Album Pages
One of the most popular Paint Shop Pro features is its ability to print multiple
images. It’s a great way to create album pages or make collages of photos to
celebrate an event.
You can use one of two ways to choose the pictures you want to add to a col-
lection, which allows you to print several images on a single page:
 Use the image browser to select the pictures you want to add. Hold
down the Ctrl key as you click each picture.
 Open all the images that you want to add to your collection. Paint Shop
Pro automatically adds any open images to the Print Layout screen.
Next, choose File➪Print Layout. Your entire Paint Shop Pro window changes
to the multi-image printing tool shown in Figure 14-2.
The multi-image printing tool occupies the entire Paint Shop Pro window. To
close it and return to the normal window, choose File➪Close Print Layout.
Unless you have saved your layout (see the section “Saving and reusing your
template,” later in this chapter), closing the tool discards your layout.
With the multi-image printing tool onscreen, here’s the basic procedure:
1. Choose the page orientation.
Paint Shop Pro initially gives you a portrait-oriented page (with the long
dimension vertically). If you want a landscape- (sideways-) oriented
page, choose File➪Print Setup and then click Landscape in the Print
Setup dialog box that appears. Click OK.
266
Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

2. If you want to use a template for your images, choose File➪
Open Template.
A template is a prefab layout you can use to arrange your photos to save
time. As a bonus, templates look nicer than dragging pictures helter-
skelter onto the page (well, better than the way we drag them, anyway).
Paint Shop Pro gives you a dialog box with three categories of templates
you can choose from: Avery, Combinations, and Standard Sizes. Click a
category to bring up the following gallery of templates, as shown in
Figure 14-3:
• Avery and Avery International templates: Intended for the indus-
try standard Avery labels — sheets of precut stickers you can use
in your printer. Yes, you can print stickers with your baby’s picture
on them! Each Avery template has a number underneath it, like
Avery 8386; this number refers to the product number of a specific
Avery label sheet, which you can buy at your local office supply
store. Use the right sheet with the right template, and you have
perfect stickers.
• Standard sizes: Templates in which all the images are one size:
5x7, wallet-size photos, miniwallets, and the like.
• Combination sizes: Templates with mixtures of sizes, generally
one or two larger photos at the top and a bunch of smaller ones 
at the bottom.

Chapter 14: Printing

Each template has a small thumbnail that shows you what its layout is
like; click a template and click OK to apply it or click Cancel to escape.
3. Drag images, one at a time, from the left column to the page.
If you have a template applied, drag the photo into each of the boxes;
Paint Shop Pro automatically resizes the photo so that it fits as best it
can into the box.
If you don’t have a template applied, you have to resize the photos manu-
ally. If the images are too large for the page, Paint Shop Pro asks whether
you want to scale it. If you click Yes, your image appears with handles
(square dots) at the corners that you can drag to resize the image. Choose
No if you want to use the Paint Shop Pro autoarrange feature (see Step 4)
to place and size the image for you.
If an image is rotated 90 degrees the wrong way, drag it to the page and
click the Rotate Clockwise 90° or Rotate Counterclockwise 90° button on
the toolbar to rotate the image.
4. If you haven’t applied a template and want to position the images
yourself, drag them into position.
If you don’t want to use a template and still want everything lined up
neatly, you can choose View➪Auto Arrange, which lines up your images
for you sans template.
5. To print your page, click the Print icon on the toolbar or choose File➪
Print.
Neither choice gives you a Print dialog box, but immediately sends the
page to your printer. If you need to change any printer settings, do so
before sending the page to the printer. Choose File➪Print Setup and click
the Printer button in the Print Setup dialog box that appears.

Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

If you’re done, return to the normal Paint Shop Pro window by choosing File➪
Close Print or click the Close button on the toolbar (the door-with-arrow icon).
If you’re using a pregenerated template and Paint Shop Pro asks “The current
template has changed, do you wish to change it?” when you exit, do not
accept the default name if you choose to save it. (Avery templates in particular
don’t like being fiddled with — and, by just clicking OK, you’re overwriting
the template and potentially changing vital placement information.)
Instead, if you want to save both pictures and layout, flip ahead to the section
“Saving and reusing your template.”
Fooling with the pictures and layout
You can fiddle with the pictures and their arrangement all you want, after
they’re on the page. Most controls for fiddling are duplicated on the menu
bar (the toolbar across the top of the window) or, if you right-click an image,
on the context menu that appears. Nearly everything can be done fastest by
using the right-clicking approach, so that’s mainly what’s in the following list.
Here are some basic fiddlings you may want to do:
 To select a picture so that you can do something with it, click it.
(Handles appear at its corners.)
 To move a picture, drag it.
 To position a picture in the center or at any of the four corners of the
page, click any of the five positioning buttons in the center of the tool-
bar. The icon indicates the position the button delivers. Pause your
cursor over the button for a text indication of its positioning (such as
Place Lower Right).
 To resize a picture, drag any of its handles.
 To remove a picture from the layout, either click it and press the Delete
button on your keyboard or right-click it and choose Remove from the
context menu.
 To rotate a picture, right-click it and choose Rotate Clockwise 90
Degrees or Rotate Counterclockwise 90 Degrees from the context menu
that appears.
 To see an alignment grid, right-click the white page background and
choose Show Grid from the context menu. (Repeat to turn the grid off;
this action doesn’t work if you have a template loaded.)
 To make photos snap to the grid when you move them, right-click the
white page background and choose Snap to Grid from the context menu.
(The grid must be on first, or else this command is grayed out.)
269
Chapter 14: Printing

Saving and reusing your template
To save this attractive arrangement of photos, choose File➪Save Template. In
the Save dialog box that appears, enter a name for your layout in the filename
text box. Unless you tell Paint Shop Pro otherwise, it saves the layout as a set
of empty boxes, forgetting which photos were there; you can tell it to remem-
ber the photos by checking the Save with Images check box.
To reuse this layout, reopen the Print Layout screen and then choose File➪
Open Template. Select your template in the Open dialog box that appears.
When you open a template, it brings up the image in its current condition,
whatever that may be. For that reason, be sure not to move any images to
other folders or rename them because the multi-image print tool won’t be
able to find them.
Printing at Different Speeds or Qualities
Paint Shop Pro itself doesn’t have much to do with choosing the quality or
speed of printing your printer delivers. That falls in the province of the soft-
ware that runs your printer, known as its driver. To access that piece of 
software, click the Properties button in the Print dialog box. Because what
happens next depends on your printer, we can’t tell you exactly what you 
will see from then on.
Speed, size, and ink
Quality comes at the cost of speed and of ink. Most printers have draft and
quality settings. If you want just a general idea of how your image will look
and want to save time and ink, choose Draft. Your image is printed lighter 
and fuzzier than if you choose the quality (or nondraft) setting, but is printed
more quickly.
The size of your printed image also costs you time and ink. Doubling the size
increases by four the amount of ink you need.
Many inkjet printers do a much better job on special photograph-quality
paper. In that case, the printer driver generally has a setting where you can
tell it that you’re going to use special paper.
270
Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

Printer and image resolution
One aspect of print quality is resolution, or dots per inch. A higher resolution
generally gives a better-quality image. That resolution number is often con-
fusing because your image has resolution too, in pixels per inch. The two
don’t match, either. The printer resolution is always a higher number than
image resolution.
What’s going on? Your printer creates its range of colors by putting out tiny
dots in four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. It needs many tiny dots
to make a pixel of a particular color, so your printer needs many more dots
per inch (dpi) than your image has pixels per inch. Dave’s printer, for exam-
ple, can print 1440 dpi. So, each pixel of a 72-pixel-per-inch image covers an
area of 20 x 20 dots of ink. For an image twice that resolution, Dave gets an
area of only 10 x 10 dots, giving him one-forth the number of possible colors.
The bottom line? Although using a higher image resolution when you create
your image gives you more detail in your prints, don’t push it too high and
don’t try to match your printer’s resolution. If you use a higher image resolu-
tion (pixels per inch), each pixel uses fewer printer dots, so color accuracy
may suffer. Although your printer driver does a few tricks to keep things
accurate, the laws of physics eventually win.

 Improving download times
 Choosing the best file type
 Creating GIF and JPEG images
T
he Web makes special demands on graphics. Images have to be stored as
particular file types, and they can’t take too long to download or else
people get bored. In this chapter, we show you how to make your Web images
look their best while downloading as fast as possible.
If you’re a professional (or even semiprofessional) Web designer, Paint Shop
Pro has automated Webtools that can quickly generate Web pages and
rollover icons. Because that topic is a little advanced if you’re just interested
in creating snazzy Web graphics, we show you how to do that in Chapter 18.
Paint Shop Pro offers a special Web toolbar for the Web features we discuss
here. With the Web toolbar enabled, you simply click a button for an effect
rather than use the menu commands. To enable the toolbar, choose View➪
Toolbars➪Web.
Making Images Download Faster
The key trick with images on the Internet is to make sure that they don’t take
any longer to download than they have to. Web users are fickle: Why should
they stick around and watch a blank screen when more amusement is simply
a mouse click away? If you make your audience wait, they don’t stay around.
Images are downloaded faster when their files are smaller, which is especially
handy when you’re sending pictures via e-mail. The following list describes a
few general tips for making sure that your images are downloaded as fast as

possible — some you do when you’re creating the Web page and others you
do in Paint Shop Pro:
 Reduce image size: The main mistake beginners make is to use exces-
sively large images on their Web pages. Web page authoring tools some-
times give the illusion of having made an image smaller, but in fact they
just squeeze a large image into a small space. Size or resize your image
in Paint Shop Pro to exactly the size you need on the Web page; refer to
Chapter 2 for details.
 Repeat images: In your Web page authoring software, if your page uses
the same image over and over again (for a bullet icon, for example),
insert exactly the same image file each time. Don’t use multiple files that
are identical copies of the same image.
 Use solid colors: Gradient fills, dithered or airbrushed areas (hues made
up of multicolored pixels), and scanned printed images (made up of visi-
ble dots) require larger files. Paint with solid colors wherever possible if
you want to keep file sizes down. Noise effects, such as Edge Preserving
Smooth on the Paint Shop Pro Effects menu, can help reduce dots to uni-
form colors.
Exporting Images for the Web
The images that appear on Web pages are almost always stored as one of two
main types of file: GIF or JPEG. (Sometimes, they’re stored as PNG files, a new
and improved type of file, but that type is still rarely used.) To make your
image viewable on a Web browser, all you have to do is make sure to save a
copy of the image as one of these file types.
To create a Web file from your image, you can go either of two ways:
 Save the image as a particular type of file (choose File➪Save As or File➪
Save Copy As).
 Export the image to a particular type of file.
Exporting takes you immediately into an optimizer dialog box for that type of
file, where you choose features and trade-offs.
Always store your image as a Paint Shop Pro file before you create Web image
files from it. Paint Shop Pro files retain lots of features that are lost when you
store an image as a Web image.
274
Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

Choosing features and file types
Each file type has its own advantages and features. Table 15-1 lists attributes
you may want and the file type or types that are generally best to use. Best

Chapter 15: Creating Web-Friendly Images

Creating GIF files
GIF files are the most widely used graphics files on the Web. They offer cer-
tain popular features, such as transparency (as shown in Figure 15-1), but are
also limited to 256 colors. If you’re displaying simple text or cartoony images,
though, they’re also much smaller than JPEG files; used properly, they save
lots of downloading time. To export a GIF file from your image, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪GIF Optimizer.
The GIF Optimizer dialog box (the optimizer) appears and contains five
tabs of settings that we cover throughout the next few sections. The
optimizer has before and after preview windows (left and right, respec-
tively) that show what effect your choices have. Click the magnifier with
the + to zoom in or the one with the – to zoom out.
2. Click the OK button.
The familiar Save As dialog box appears.
3. Choose a filename and folder for the file and click OK.
You can (and should) make image files smaller so that they’re downloaded
faster; see the section “Reducing download time,” later in this chapter.
Creating transparent areas
To prepare an image to have transparent portions on the Web, first save your
image as a Paint Shop Pro file. Then choose any one of the following alterna-
tive approaches to mark a transparent area — whichever approach seems
easiest:
 Color: If all the pixels in the area you want to become transparent are
roughly the same color (a white background, for example), you don’t
need to do much more in preparation. Just make sure that your chosen
color does not appear in any pixels where you don’t want transparency,
such as the whites of people’s eyes. If the color does appear elsewhere,
try one of the two following approaches instead.
 Selection: Select either the object that you want to be visible (opaque)
or the background that you want to be transparent. You have to make
the selection before you begin to export.
 Transparency: If the object (your logo, for example) that you want to be
visible (opaque) isn’t already on its own layer or layers, select it and pro-
mote it to a layer. On the Layer palette, turn off the visibility of the back-
ground layer and any other unwanted layers, and the transparent portions
of the logo layer are apparent (display a checkerboard pattern).
276
Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

To have the edges of a selected area blend gradually into the Web page’s
background, contract the selection by a certain number of pixels (4, for
example). Then, feather the selection by that same number of pixels. (Refer
to Chapter 3 for help with contracting and feathering a selection.)
A tab in the GIF Optimizer dialog box lets you translate your chosen area into a
transparency. In the GIF Optimizer dialog box, click the first tab, Transparency.
This tab asks “What areas of the image would you like to be transparent?” Your
choices are shown in this list:
 None: Choose this option if you want no transparent areas whatsoever.
 Existing image or layer transparency: Choose this option if your image
already has transparent areas (appearing as a gray checkerboard pat-
tern) that you want to remain transparent on the Web page. This is the
Transparency approach, as described in the preceding bulleted list.
 Inside the current selection: Use this option if, using the Paint Shop Pro
selection tools, you have selected the area (the background, for exam-
ple) that you want to become transparent (the Selection approach in the
preceding bulleted list). If you have selected instead the area that is to
remain opaque, choose Outside the Current Selection.
 Areas that match this color: Choose this option (the Color approach in
the preceding bulleted list) if the areas you want transparent are all the
same color. If the color that is already displayed in the adjoining color
swatch is not the one you want to make transparent, move the cursor
outside the dialog box, over the image, and click any area of your
chosen color. The result appears in the right preview window. Increase
the Tolerance value to make a wider range of similar colors transparent
or decrease it to narrow the range of colors made transparent.
Choosing image fade-in
As GIF images are downloaded, they build gradually onscreen. You can
choose whether they build from top to bottom or fade in from fuzzy to
increasingly detailed. For small images that are downloaded quickly, the
choice doesn’t matter much. To choose a method, click the Format tab.
On the Format tab, choose Non-Interlaced if you want the image to build from
top to bottom. Choose Interlaced if you want the image to fade in. Leave the
option labeled What version do you want the file to be? set to Version 89a
unless someone specifically requests a file of Version 87a.
Reducing download time
For GIF files, you can reduce download time in two ways: Reduce the physical
size of the image, and reduce the number of colors in it. (We tell you how 
to resize in Chapter 2.) Removing unused colors saves time, which makes
sense — why send 256 colors across the Internet when you can send only 40?
277
Chapter 15: Creating Web-Friendly Images

To reduce colors, select the Colors tab of the GIF Optimizer. You have several
options:
 How many colors do you want? The lower the number of colors, the
quicker the file is downloaded. Take out too many colors and the image
may start to look grainy or choppy. Experiment with this value, by set-
ting it as low as you can until you find something acceptable in the pre-
view window.
 How much dithering do you want? It sounds like if you set this option
high, Paint Shop Pro would just waste your time, saying “Oh, I don’t
know — what do you want?” In reality, though, if you have removed a
bunch of colors, this setting controls how much Paint Shop Pro attempts
to simulate those removed colors by filling them in with the colors it
does have. That helps to make a low-color image look smoother, but at
high values it may add weird moiré patterns or make it look spotty.
Again, experiment to find the right value for you.

Part IV: Taking It to the Street 
Opening and using transparent GIF files
If you open a transparent GIF file in Paint Shop
Pro, you may be surprised at what you see:
Areas that appear transparent in a Web
browser are filled in with a color. That result
occurs because GIF transparency is a special
trick used mainly in Web browsers. Paint Shop
Pro shows the reality behind the trick.
GIF files achieve transparency by designating
as transparent a particular color on the palette.
Web browsers pay attention to that designation
and show the underlying Web page background
where that color occurs. Paint Shop Pro, how-
ever, shows the color itself — unless you tell it
otherwise.
To tell Paint Shop Pro to show the transparency,
choose Image➪Palette➪View Palette Trans-
parency. Repeat this command to return to
viewing the color.
If you want another color on the file’s palette to
be displayed as transparent, choose Image➪
Palette➪Set Palette Transparency. In the Set
Palette Transparency dialog box that appears,
click the option Set the Transparency Value to
Palette Entry and then click your chosen color
in the image window. To turn off transparency,
choose the No Transparency option. Click OK
when you’re done.
Be careful when you’re choosing a color. It may
be used in places where you’re not expecting 
it — white, for example, may appear in some-
one’s eyes, giving a spooky result when the
whites of that person’s eyes become transpar-
ent! Likewise, you may find that the area you
want transparent is composed of more than one
color, which leaves an unseemly halo of not-
quite-your-selected color around everything
else in the image. To fix it, you have to select the
area and tell Paint Shop Pro to make it trans-
parent; refer to Chapter 3 for an example of this
halo problem and how to select it properly.
Remember that GIF files are palette-type files,
so many Paint Shop Pro features don’t work
unless you convert the file to 16.7 million colors
first. (Press Ctrl+Shift+0.)

 What method of color selection do you want to use? You need to be
concerned with only two options:
• Existing Palette: Uses the colors in the original image, although
they may not look right on other computers.
• Standard/Web-safe: Ensures that the image looks the same on all
computers, although it may not look quite like what you originally
created.
When you’re done selecting all these options, you can select the Download
Times tab to see a chart of how quickly your image is loaded at various
speeds. People with modems are generally running at 56 Kbps; unless you
know for a fact that the people who will view these images have something
other than a modem, assume that they use a modem. (High-speed connections
are increasingly common these days, but at least 40 percent of all Internet
users are still stuck with dial-up.)
Using the GIF Wizard
Alternatively, you can choose to click the Use Wizard button at the bottom of
the GIF Optimizer dialog box. The GIF wizard asks you five questions dealing
with palettes, backgrounds, and quality, all of which we detail in the preced-
ing section.
Creating JPEG files
JPEG files tend to be smaller than GIF files for many kinds of images, so
they’re downloaded faster. The main trade-off is that JPEG files are lossy.
They lose some detail in your original image, and the clean lines of text can
look fuzzy. You can choose how much detail to trade off for a reduction in 
file size, however.
The second trade-off is that JPEG files can introduce artifacts: blurs, spots,
and rectangular blocks that weren’t present in the original image. Again, how-
ever, you can choose how many artifacts you’re willing to live with to get a
smaller file.
To export to JPEG, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪JPEG Optimizer.
The JPEG Optimizer dialog box appears. It has three tabs. It also has
before-and-after preview windows (left and right, respectively) that
show the effect of your choices. To zoom in or out, click the magnifier
icons. Click the magnifier with the + to zoom in or the one with the – to
zoom out. To view different parts of your image, drag in a window.
279
Chapter 15: Creating Web-Friendly Images

2. Click the Quality tab to trade off file size for quality.
Adjust the Set Compression Value To value box to a value from 1 to 99.
Higher values make the file smaller, but give it lower quality. You can see
changes in the file size under the right preview window, in the line that
says Compressed bytes. As you can see in Figure 15-2, you can save lots
of time with comparatively little loss in image quality.
A menu offers Chroma Subsampling options. This deep juju tells Paint
Shop Pro when to average the color information for any given block of
pixels, and the best subsampling approach is a subject of debate among
graphics professionals. To make things simple, we just say that you
should go with the default value (unless you feel like experimenting).
A check box on the quality tag also asks you whether you want to save
EXIF data into the JPEG. Whether you even have EXIF data depends on
what camera the image was taken with, as we explain in Chapter 5. If you
leave this box unchecked and save the image, the camera settings and
artist information aren’t saved with the new image.
To see estimates of how fast your file is downloaded, depending on the
viewer’s Internet connection speed, click the Download Times tab. A
table there gives estimated download times for various connection
speeds. Unless you have specific knowledge that the people who will
view this image have anything faster than a modem, always assume that
they’re running at 56 Kbps.
Figure 15-2:

280
Part IV: Taking It to the Street 

If you can’t get your image to download fast enough, don’t forget that
resizing, as shown in Chapter 2, saves lots of time. Do people really need
to see a poster-size picture of your baby?
3. Click the Format tab to control how the image fades in.
JPEG files normally assemble themselves from top to bottom as they’re
downloaded to a Web browser. If you would rather have your image fade
in from blurry to detailed, choose Progressive on this tab. Otherwise,
leave the choice set to Standard.
4. Click the OK button.
The familiar Save As dialog box appears.
5. Choose a filename and folder for the file and click OK.
Using the JPEG Wizard
Interestingly enough, the JPEG Wizard is available at the bottom of the 
JPEG Optimizer, but it involves clicking more times than the regular JPEG
Optimizer. Our advice is to skip the wizard and just use the optimizer, which
allows you to see your download time in one click, as opposed to three.
Doing Common Webbish Tricks
Unless you’re Spider-Man, creating Web pages is a complex business. But
Paint Shop Pro can make some aspects of Web design much easier! This sec-
tion describes two tricks that Paint Shop Pro can help you with.
Creating buttons
Paint Shop Pro offers an effect that’s great for creating graphical buttons for
Web pages. The buttonize effect makes any image (or selected part of an
image) look like a raised button by shading around the edges.
Choose Effects➪3D Effects➪Buttonize. The Buttonize adjustment dialog box
that appears offers two styles of button. Click the Solid radio button for a
button that has flat sides (and then choose your color in the palette box), 
or choose Transparent Edge for a button with rounded sides. The Buttonize
dialog box also offers three adjustments:
 Height and Width: These controls adjust the vertical and horizontal
dimensions, respectively, of the top surface of the button.
281
Chapter 15: Creating Web-Friendly Images

 Opacity: Increasing opacity makes the edges of the button darker and
obscures the underlying image more.
The right preview window in the Buttonize dialog box shows the result of
your choices.
Matching image colors to HTML colors
You may want to match colors used in your image to colors used in the text
of your Web page — or vice versa. Text colors are often given in cryptic,
geekish codes called hexadecimal in the HTML code used to write Web pages.
They’re written like this: #FFC0FA. These codes always begin with a # symbol,
followed by six characters — digits or the letters A through F.
If you’re creating a Web page and want to match the text color to a color 
in your image, the Materials box can help. (Press F6 to display it if it’s not
already visible.) Click the Dropper tool on the Tools toolbar and then click
your chosen color on the image. The Foreground and Stroke Properties box
inside the Materials box changes to match that color; click that box. Select
the Color tab in the Material Properties dialog box that appears. Use the
HTML code shown at the bottom of the dialog box in your Web page author-
ing software to set the color of your text.
If you’re creating an image and want to match a color in your image to a text
color, the solution is similar: Click the Material box to bring up the Materials
palette. In the HTML code value box on the Color tab, enter the HTML code
you obtained from your Web page authoring tool. Click OK and your chosen
color swatch now matches the HTML document’s text color.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
P
erplexed? Annoyed? Both? Hey, join the club. But 
we Dummies authors have long been channeling the
spirit of David Letterman, and in that spirit we offer The
Part of Tens: the ten top things that perplex and annoy us,
and some solutions. Among them are ten things that we
are annoyed about because they’re too advanced to
include in a Dummies book.

Chapter 16
Ten Perplexing Problems
In This Chapter
 Fixing a tool that doesn’t seem to work
 Stopping those annoying Paint Shop Pro questions
 Finding a missing toolbar
 Seeing images in their real size
 Figuring out why colors come out wrong
 Avoiding creating new text when editing old text
 Fixing broken brushes
 Making the Magic Wand tool work better
 Getting tools to work your way
 Getting Paint Shop Pro to open your images
I
n real life, your paint brush doesn’t suddenly start painting in plaid, your
canvas doesn’t double in size, and (unless you have kids) your tools don’t
suddenly become unavailable. In software, however, all the laws of nature are
repealed and then reformulated by people whose idea of a good time is to
make your brush paint in plaid: software engineers.
When the bright colors you see before you are the result of a migraine and
not paint, this chapter is a good place to start. Take a deep breath, get a
chocolate chip cookie, and repeat, “I am smart, software is stupid. I am
smart, software is stupid.” Then read on.

“The Tool or Command Doesn’t 
Do Anything”
If a tool or command doesn’t seem to do anything as you apply it to an image,
the cause is probably related to selections or layers. Specifically, the problem
may be one of the following:
 You have in your image a selected area (called a selection) that you’re
unaware of. Tools and commands are almost always constrained to
working within a selection, if one exists. You’re probably either not
working on, or not looking at, that selection. If you don’t really want 
to be working within a selection at the moment, simply press Ctrl+D to
remove the selection.
One reason you may be unaware of this selection is that you have
somehow hidden the selection marquee, the moving dashed line
that indicates a selection’s presence. Choose Selections and exam-
ine the square button next to Hide Marquee on the menu that
appears. If the button has a black outline around it, the marquee is
hidden. Click Hide Marquee to unhide it.
Another reason you may be unaware of the selection is that your
image is larger than the window and the selected area isn’t visible.
Zoom out (right-click with the Zoom tool, the magnifying glass icon
on the tool palette) until you can see the whole image, including
the selection marquee.
 You’re mistakenly working on an image layer that’s empty (transparent)
in the area you’re trying to work in. Switch to the background layer and
try the tool again. If that doesn’t work, pause the mouse cursor over the
names of the various layers to see tiny, thumbnail images of the contents
of each layer. Click the layer that contains the content you’re trying to
modify. Refer to Chapter 11 for more help with layers.
 You’re painting in exactly the same color as the background you’re
painting on! Change the foreground color or background color (refer 
to Chapter 9).
If you have been trying to use a menu command with no apparent effect, you
may have been having an effect within your selection, without knowing it!
When you find the area, check it. If it has been altered unintentionally, press
Ctrl+Z repeatedly until the change goes away.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

“Paint Shop Pro Keeps Asking 
Me Confusing Questions!”
Many tools have requirements that have to be met before you can use them;
for example, you can’t use any of the tools from the retouch tool group on an
image that has fewer than 16 million colors, and the Text, Shape, and Pen
tools all require the creation of a new vector layer.
Thankfully, Paint Shop Pro is smart enough to automatically take these
actions whenever you use the appropriate tool; for example, try to dodge or
burn on an image containing fewer than 16 million colors and Paint Shop Pro
automatically increases the number of colors for you.
Sadly, Paint Shop Pro defaults to asking you for confirmation on all these
minor changes — which is annoying because not only do these questions
sound terrifyingly complex, but you also can’t do what you want until you
click OK anyway. It’s sort of like asking “You can’t leave the house until the
door is open; is it okay if I open it for you?” If you want to go for a Sunday
drive — or any drive — chances are that you’re going to say yes.
You can stop all these confusing questions by choosing File➪Preferences➪
General Program Preferences and clicking the Auto Action tab. Then click the
Always All button and click OK; Paint Shop Pro always takes these actions by
default. (If it turns out that you really don’t want to do whatever it was that
Paint Shop Pro did automatically, pressing Ctrl+Z undoes your last action,
complete with any changes that Paint Shop Pro made to accomplish it.)
While you’re there, we may as well tell you how to disable the annoying
splash screen that Paint Shop Pro displays when it’s starting up; click the
Miscellaneous tab and uncheck the box labeled Show Splash Screen When
Application Starts.
“The Tool or Palette Just Isn’t There!”
You can accidentally close or move one of the toolbars or palettes that holds
the tool you need, thus stashing the Paint Brush tool where you can’t get at
it. If you don’t see what you need, choose View➪Toolbars or View➪Palettes
and look for a likely candidate that would contain the tool you’re looking for.
(The main offenders are generally one of these three: View➪Toolbars➪Tools,
View➪Palettes➪Layers, or View➪Palettes➪Materials.)
287
Chapter 16: Ten Perplexing Problems

If the toolbar or palette is open but has been dragged somewhere that it’s not
supposed to be, its icon on the menu has a thin gray box around it; choose it
twice from the menu to “flash” it, by turning it off and then on so that you
know where it is. If it doesn’t have a box around it, you have accidentally
closed it; select it to open it again.
“The Image Is the Wrong Size Inside 
or Outside Paint Shop Pro”
Paint Shop Pro displays an image in different sizes to fit the Paint Shop Pro
window. The program doesn’t change the size of the image — it just displays
it with a different zoom factor. As a result, an image may look much smaller in
Paint Shop Pro than it does in some other program. To see an image in its
true size in Paint Shop Pro, press Ctrl+Alt+N.
If you need to change the true size of an image — which is the size it usually
appears in other programs (in Web browsers, for example) — refer to
Chapter 2. If you need to change its size as it’s printed on paper, refer to
Chapter 14.
“The Paint Doesn’t Come Out Right”
Paint Shop Pro has a Stroke Properties box, which can make life complicated
if you’re not sure what’s going on. The usual result is that you end up apply-
ing paint that isn’t what you had in mind. The best solution is to get a good
grip on the Stroke Property boxes’ features, so turn to Chapter 9 to see how
they’re used. In addition, settings on the Tool Options palette can make paint
come out in unwanted ways. Here are a few specific things to check:
 If the paint is too light and kind of dappled, you may be applying a
texture unintentionally. To paint without a texture, see whether the
Texture button (the one in the middle) directly underneath either of the
Stroke Property boxes is indented. If one of them is, click them to reset
them to No Texture.
 If the color you’re applying doesn’t match the color in either of the
Foreground or Background Stroke Property boxes, you’re applying a
gradient or pattern, not plain paint. Click and drag down on the Style
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

button (the one on the left) directly underneath the Stroke Property
boxes, and drag it up to the solid circle to resume using plain paint.
 If paint is too thin or too thick, adjust the opacity on the Tool Options
palette; higher opacity makes a thicker paint.
“New Text Appears Whenever 
I Try to Change Text”
The Text tool, in its normal vector mode of operation, lets you click existing
text to change it. When you click, the Text dialog box is supposed to appear
and display the current text so that you can edit it. You have to click right 
on the text character, not the space between characters — not even within a
character’s outline, if that character has no fill! Otherwise, you start creating
new text. The cursor displays an A in brackets, like this, [A], when it’s posi-
tioned correctly for editing text.
“The Text or Shape Comes Out the 
Wrong Color, Texture, or Pattern”
Although you may logically expect your text, drawings, and shapes to appear
in the foreground color, sometimes they appear in the background color!
Sometimes, too, the colors can be weak or mottled or otherwise weird. Here’s
what’s going on.
Shapes, drawings, and text are made up of outlines in one color and are filled
with another color. The Stroke Property box controls those colors. The out-
lines are done in the foreground color (or gradient or pattern) and in the 
foreground texture — although outlines can be very thin or even turned off.
In that case, nearly all you can see is the fill color. The fill color is the back-
ground color (or gradient or pattern) and background texture (if any). If the
background Stroke Property is turned off (you see a circle with a slash), you
may see very little — just the outline.
If patterns, textures, or gradients are unintentionally turned on in the
Foreground or Background Style swatches, the result can be strangely mot-
tled or even nearly invisible.
289
Chapter 16: Ten Perplexing Problems

To get plain text, choose a background stroke property and then click the
Transparent button (the one on the right), directly underneath the
Foreground Stroke Property box.
“The Magic Wand Tool 
Doesn’t Select Well”
The Magic Wand tool, which selects an area based on color (or other pixel
qualities), is sometimes not so magic. What looks like a perfectly uniform
color to you — one that the wand should be able to select cleanly without
gaps or overlaps into unwanted areas — is apparently not so uniform. You
may find that when you increase the Tolerance setting, you close the gaps
but get more unwanted areas. Here are a couple of things to try besides fid-
dling with the tolerance:
 Try different match modes on the Tool Options palette, by choosing RGB
Value, Color, Hue, or Brightness from the menu.
 Don’t fuss any more with the Magic Wand tool. Use it to do the basic
selection job and then use other selection tools to add or subtract from
the selected area. For example, switch to the Freehand tool, set it to
Freehand on the Selection Type menu on the Tool Options palette, and
with the Shift key depressed, drag a circle around any gaps in the selec-
tion. Likewise, hold down the Ctrl key and drag a circle around any
unwanted areas.
 Choose Selections➪Modify to fill in gaps, expand or contract your selec-
tion, or exclude specific colors. See Chapter 18 for details about
advanced selection techniques.
“The Tool Works, but Not Like I Want”
The key to a tool’s behavior is its Tool Options palette. For painting tools, it
controls brush size, shape, edge fuzziness, paint thickness, how speckly the
paint comes off, and how close together the individual dots are that make 
up a stroke. For other tools, it may also control how the tool chooses which
pixels to operate on (by color, hue, or other attribute) and exactly what effect
the tool has. Refer to Chapter 1 for details about the Tool Options palette,
which you can enable or disable by pressing F4 on the keyboard.
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Sometimes, though, the Tool Options palette hides some options from you
because it doesn’t have enough room; look for a small vertical row of single
gray dots on the palette and hover your mouse over it. If the cursor turns
into a double-headed arrow, Paint Shop Pro is hiding some options from you!
Click and drag the arrow down to reveal all the options this tool has to offer.
(Sometimes, Paint Shop Pro hides things with a small rightward arrow; if
that’s the case, just click it and then look for the vertical dotted row.)
“Paint Shop Pro Doesn’t Open Images!”
Have you ever been in line at a grocery store when some rude person shoved
his way in front of you and took your place? Some programs are equally rude,
but rather than brusquely take your place in line, they take over responsibil-
ity for opening your JPEG, GIF, and PNG files without asking you.
You see, whenever you double-click a file to open it, Windows knows what
kind of file it is and assigns one program to open that file type. Certain poorly
designed programs assign themselves to be that program when you install
them, which can be annoying. To put Paint Shop Pro back in charge, choose
File➪Preferences➪File Format Associations, click Select All, and click OK.
Paint Shop Pro is then your default image handler.
If you’re using Windows XP, double-clicking an image may bring up the
Windows Viewer instead, which gives you a preview of your image; press
Ctrl+E to open it in Paint Shop Pro.

espite all attempts by camera makers to make photography foolproof, we
all still make less-than-perfect pictures. Sometimes, we’re the problem —
we’re too close or too far away or can’t figure out how to use the camera’s fool-
proofing features. Sometimes, the problem is that reality stubbornly refuses to
comply with our expectations: The sky is overcast, Great-Grandma can’t be
present for the family photo, or management has decided to cancel a product
that appears in the product-line photograph.
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro has a wide range of solutions, which range from
quick-and-dirty fixes to professional-level retouching. In this chapter, we give
the fastest possible solutions to the most common problems. For more in-
depth looks, check out the chapters in Part II, which tell you everything a
casual hobbyist needs to know about digital photography.

Rotating Right-Side Up
Photos that lie on their side are a pain in the neck. Don’t put up with it! Take
these simple steps:
1. Press Ctrl+R — a fast way to pop up the Rotate dialog box.
2. In the Direction area of the dialog box, click either the Right (for
clockwise rotation) or Left (for counterclockwise rotation) option
boxes.
If you have added layers to your photo, click the All Layers check box.
You probably haven’t done so, however, or else your neck would already
be stiff from turning your head sideways!
3. Click OK or press the Enter key on your keyboard.
Chances are, all your sideways photos need rotating in the same direction.
Fortunately, the Rotate dialog box remembers which rotation you chose in
Step 2; for future corrections, all you may need to do is press Ctrl+R and the
Enter key!
Getting the Red Out
Suffering from a little too much red-eye? Photo flashes tend to make the nor-
mally black pupil of the eye glow red. Here’s the fast fix for getting the red
out. It works in nine out of ten cases — where only the pupil is red and the
iris is unaffected; for tougher cases or more finicky retouching, refer to
Chapter 7. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Adjust➪Photo Fix➪Red-eye Removal.
The Red-eye Removal dialog box appears.
2. In the right preview window, drag the image to center the eye.
3. Click the Zoom In icon (the magnifier with the + sign) repeatedly until
the eye fills the preview windows.
Repeat Step 2 as needed to keep the eye centered.
4. Set the Iris Size option to zero.
This setting should be zero unless the red covers any of the iris (the col-
ored part of the eye). If the red does affect the iris, refer to Chapter 5 for
help.
294
Part V: The Part of Tens 

5. In the left window, click the red area.
A circle appears in a square frame in the left window. The circle should
be centered on the pupil and cover it to some degree. (If not, refer to
Chapter 5.) In the right window, the red area is partly or entirely obliter-
ated. (If that isn’t true at first, drag the Refine slider a bit to the left.)
6. Drag the Refine slider left until a bit of red reappears and then to the
right just until that red is gone.
7. Click OK.
Repeat these steps for the other eye.
Photos without Enough Flash
If things are looking a bit dim in a photograph, Paint Shop Pro can often
brighten your outlook. Follow these steps for a too-dim photo:
1. Choose Adjust➪Photo Fix➪Fill Flash.
The Fill Flash dialog box springs into action. The photo may already
show sufficient improvement in the sample in the right window. If so,
click OK and skip the rest of these steps.
The preview window on the right shows the result of any changes in this
and the following steps.
2. Choose a Strength.
The Strength bar shows you how much virtual light will be shed on your
darkened scene. Larger numbers equal more light.
(Unfortunately, larger numbers also tend to wash out the rest of the
image and make it pale; if you can’t fix it with the Fill Flash alone, try
reading Chapter 7 for more options.)
3. Click OK.
If the colors appear a bit too washed out after you’re done, see the section
“Making Colors Zippier,” at the end of this chapter.
If this effect doesn’t do the job, check out Chapter 7 for more help with
brightness, contrast, and saturation. Nothing can restore image data that just
isn’t there, however. Things that are way dim will never look natural — unless
you do some touch-up brushing.
If you can’t see an image well in the right preview window of this dialog box,
click the button with the eye icon to see the effect in the main image window.
Click the button again whenever you want to see the result of your changes.
Refer to Chapter 7 for more help with effect dialog boxes.
295
Chapter 17: Ten Fast Fixes for Photo Failures

Photos with Too Much Flash
If you got a little too close in a flash photo, Paint Shop Pro may be able to
help you back off a bit. Try this fast fix:
1. Choose Adjust➪Photo Fix➪Backlighting.
The Backlighting Filter dialog box comes to your aid. The photo may
already look better in the sample in the right window. If so, click OK and
skip the rest of these steps.
2. To make the picture darker, drag the Strength bar to the right.
Larger strength values dim the overall light values of the photo.
3. Click OK.
Photos with way too much flash are washed out, which may be harder to fix.
If, for example, portions of someone’s face are practically white, you need to
restore skin tone without affecting the rest of the picture. A little work with
the Smudge tool (refer to Chapter 8) can help you push skin color into small
white areas. Alternatively, try carefully selecting the entire face area with a
feathered edge and then using the Manual Color Correction effect, which we
describe in Chapter 6, to change the white area to skin tone. (You may have
to disable the Preserve Lightness check box in that effect.)
Revealing Dark Corners
If you need to cast light into the dark corners of your life, Paint Shop Pro can
help. Of course, nothing can reveal totally dark details, and — as in life itself —
details that are very dark are generally not too attractive anyway, when
brought to light. But, given those limitations, here’s something you can do 
to reveal dark corners or other dark areas of your photo.
This approach is the computer equivalent of an old darkroom trick known as
dodging. Dodging requires a little eye-hand coordination because you, in
effect, brush lightness and contrast onto just the dark portions of your
photo. Follow these steps:
1. Choose the Dodge tool (the white comet-looking icon) from the
retouch tool group.
2. Locate or open the Tool Options palette.
Press F4 on your keyboard to toggle the palette on or off.
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. Make these choices:
Size: To lighten broad areas, the best setting for this value is about
25 percent of the width or height of the image, whichever is larger.
(Image dimensions appear on the status bar, in the lower-right
corner of the Paint Shop Pro window.)
Hardness: Set this option very low, or at zero, unless the dark area
has well-defined edges and you have a steady hand.
Opacity: A good typical setting is about 20. A higher number gives
you a stronger effect per stroke. A lower number gives you a
weaker effect.
Step: A good typical setting is about 25. If you set it too high, you
may see a dotty effect.
Density: 100.
4. Drag over the dark areas of the image to lighten those areas.
Keep the mouse button down and do a first pass over the area. Then
release the mouse button and drag again over areas that need more
lightening. Return to Step 3 and adjust any settings that you think may
be necessary, especially Opacity (strength of effect) or Size. Press Ctrl+Z
to undo your most recent pass at the image, if necessary.
As you brush the image, objects in the dark become brighter and the con-
trast against any black or very dark background is increased. The improve-
ment can be dramatic!
Removing Unwanted Relatives
Removing unwanted relatives is much easier in Paint Shop Pro than in real
life. You’re not limited to relatives, though. You can use the same Paint Shop
Pro tricks to remove other unwanted features, like power lines or passing
automobiles.
Like removing unwanted relatives in real life, this task requires some skill. It
also requires some sort of continuous or repeated background, like the clap-
boarded side of a building, a grassy field, a rail fence, some water, or some
shrubbery. If the unwanted relative is blocking more than half of some unique
feature (like a fireplace, chair, or china cabinet), the job gets nearly impossible.
The main tool for the job is the Clone Brush tool, which you use to extend
the background over the unwanted feature. For example, you can brush out
junk on a lawn by brushing lawn taken from just below or alongside the junk.
297
Chapter 17: Ten Fast Fixes for Photo Failures

Refer to Chapter 8 for a full-fledged example (we removed a mat, but the prin-
ciple is the same). Here’s the general idea:
1. Click the Clone Brush tool (the 2-headed icon) on the Tools toolbar.
2. Right-click the background that you want to brush over your object, in
an area that has no unique features.
For example, if you’re removing a pile of junk from your lawn, right-click
the lawn, not the junk. Don’t click too near the object you want to
remove, either. Because backgrounds tend to have horizontal strips of
stuff, like grass at the bottom, trees in the middle, and sky at the top,
clicking to the left or right of the object you want to remove usually
works best.
3. Drag carefully across the object you want removed.
If, in Step 2, you right-clicked to the left or right of that object, move the
cursor only horizontally before you drag. That precaution ensures that
you extend the correct strip of background and don’t paint grass, for
example, where you want trees. As you brush, the Clone Brush tool
picks up pixels from under an X that starts where you right-clicked and
follows your motion. Keep an eye on the X to make sure that it doesn’t
pick up pixels you don’t want. You may need to reset the X in a new loca-
tion periodically; return to Step 2 to do so.
You probably need some trial and error to get a feel for the process. Press
Ctrl+Z to undo any errors.
One problem with removing relatives and other objects is that if they were
initially blocking a unique object, that object now has a hole in it. For exam-
ple, the relative may well be blocking one arm of a person or half of a piano
(if that relative is fairly wide). Fortunately, many objects are symmetrical; if
Aunt Katy’s left arm is now missing, you may be able to copy her right arm
and paste it in place of the left one. (You can even mirror half a face to make 
a whole one in some instances. Your results may be unsatisfactory.)
Use any selection tool (the Freehand tool, for example) to select the object
you need to copy (refer to Chapter 3). Press Ctrl+F to float the selection, press
Ctrl+M to mirror it, drag it to the correct position, and then press Ctrl+Shift+F
to defloat it. Press Ctrl+D to remove the selection marquee. You may need to
do a little painting and retouching because any light striking the object is now
coming from the wrong direction.
Adding Absent Relatives
If Great-Grandma just couldn’t make the wedding, boost her spirits (or seri-
ously confuse other missing relatives) by creating a picture that includes her
with the happy couple. The same trick works for adding anyone or anything.
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Have a new product to add to your product line? Just add it to the product
family photo. Here are the basic steps, with references to other parts of the
book that provide more detail:
1. Open the original photo (the one without Great-Grandma) in a
window.
2. Press Ctrl+B or choose File➪Browse to open the image browser.
The browser window opens. Arrange the browser and image windows so
that you can see both. (For example, choose Window➪Tile Vertically.)
3. Drag the thumbnail of the new image (Great-Grandma) from the
browser to the main image window.
The new image becomes a new layer of the original photo. You can close
the browser window now, if you like. (Click the X in its upper-right
corner.)
4. With the Eraser tool (refer to Chapter 9), erase everything except the
part of the new image that you want (leave Great-Grandma).
5. Click the Deformation tool on the Tools toolbar (second from the top)
and drag the new image (Great-Grandma) to the place where you
want it.
Refer to Chapter 4 for help with the Deformation tool.
6. If the image isn’t the correct size or rotation, drag the handles
(squares) that appear around the new image to make adjustments.
The image may need some repositioning; if so, drag it from any place
except on one of the handles.
7. Double-click the image, when you’re done sizing and positioning, to
apply the deformation.
Repeat Step 4 to make any additional erasures that you discover are neces-
sary at this point. For example, if Great-Grandma’s head and shoulders are to
appear behind the wedding couple, erase her from the shoulders down.
You’re done! Note that you now have an image with layers, so if you save it,
Paint Shop Pro asks whether you want to merge layers. Reply Yes.
Zapping Zits
One noticeable difference between professionally done portraits and the
ones you (and we) take is that the pros retouch their photos to get rid of
unsightly blemishes. Throughout this book, we describe lots of tools that are
useful for retouching and even devote one whole chapter (Chapter 8) to
removing or adding elements to your photo.
299
Chapter 17: Ten Fast Fixes for Photo Failures

To get rid of a simple blemish, however, is a matter of a few steps. Zoom in on
the blemish and then try these steps:
1. Choose the Smudge tool (the comet streaking to the upper left) from
the retouch tool group on the Tools toolbar.
(Refer to Chapter 8 for more information about this tool.)
2. Open the Tool Options palette, if it’s not already open.
Press F4 to toggle the window on or off. Refer to Chapter 1 for more
information about this palette.
3. Set the brush size to roughly zit-size on the Tool Options palette.
See the discussions of setting tool options in Chapter 1 for help with
other options.
4. Click just to one side of the blemish, on clear skin of similar (but
unblemished) color.
5. Drag across the blemish.
Dragging along, rather than across, any natural folds or wrinkles is usu-
ally a good idea. Also, don’t drag from one area of unblemished skin
color into a differently colored area.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 from the opposite direction.
Making Gray Skies Blue
Don’t let an overcast day rain on your parade. You can make the skies blue in
a photo, and, even though a snapshot may never look completely natural, it
will probably be more attractive. You can’t make a gray day look too natural
because if it were really taken on a sunny day, the sun would appear to shine
on all the subjects in the photo, casting highlights and shadows. Paint Shop
Pro has several tools you can use. The following steps, however, outline the
simplest approach:
1. Click the Magic Wand tool from the selection tool group on the Tools
toolbar.
2. On the Tool Options palette, set the tolerance to about 20 or 30 for a
typical gray sky.
Press F4 on the keyboard to toggle the Tool Options palette on or off.
Refer to Chapters 1 and 4 for more information about this window and
its options, like brush size.
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. Click the overcast area of the image, to select it.
If the whole sky isn’t selected, press Ctrl+D to clear the selection and
then try again with a higher Tolerance value on the Tool Options palette.
If more than sky is selected, try again with a lower value. Chapter 3 has
more ways to help you select just sky.
4. Press Shift+U to open the Red/Green/Blue dialog box.
5. Increase the number in the Blue value box.
As you adjust, keep an eye on the right preview window in the
Red/Green/Blue dialog box, which is showing you the new sky color.
Stop adjusting whenever you like the color, and click the OK button.
Making Colors Zippier
As we take a photo, we find that our mind’s eye makes the colors livelier than
they turn out to be in reality, and the photo looks a bit dull. Perhaps it’s just
that our antidepressant doses need adjusting, but if you have the same prob-
lem, try adjusting the saturation (of your image, that is). Take these steps and
don’t call us in the morning:
1. Choose Adjust➪Automatic Saturation Enhancement.
The Automatic Saturation Enhancement dialog box springs into action.
2. Choose the More Colorful option on the left side of the box.
3. If the photo contains a significant amount of skin, click the Skintones
Present check box.
4. Choose the Weak, Normal, or Strong option on the right side of the
box, depending on which choice gives better results in the right pre-
view window.
Click the button with the eye icon whenever you want to see the effect of
your chosen options in the image window.
5. Click OK.
If that doesn’t brighten up your day, check out Chapter 7 or see your friendly
primary care physician.

C
hris Rock, a famous comedian, has a routine that discusses creepy guys
who hang around hip nightclubs. “They’re not old,” he says. “Just a little
too old for the club.”
That’s what the ten items in this chapter are: just a little too advanced for the
rest of the book. Thankfully, none of them is difficult (or creepy) — and, after
you have mastered the essentials of Paint Shop Pro, these ten techniques
save you lots of time.
Saving Tool and Effect 
Settings As Presets
Paint Shop Pro has lots of options for each of its tools and effects, and setting
them all by hand can be tedious. If you painstakingly set the opacity, shape,

blend mode, stroke width, and thickness to get a watercolor-style effect from
the Brush tool, you can save those settings as a single preset. Then, the next
time you want to paint in watercolors, you can load all your carefully tweaked
tool options with a single click. Then, you don’t have to remember each of
the controls’ settings and set each of them individually.
You can find presets in one of two separate places, depending on whether the
settings you need to save are in a tool, like the Magic Wand, or in a dialog box
that pops up whenever you try to apply an effect or adjustment, like the
Mosaic effect or the Automatic Color Balance:
 In Effects and Adjustments, the preset controls are along the top of the
dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-1.
 For tools, the presets are in the upper-left corner of the Tool Options
palette. Click the small arrow next to the tool’s icon to display the drop-
down Presets list.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 

To save a particular group of settings, set all the dials, slider bars, menus,
colors, and other options to the settings you want to remember — and don’t
do anything else! When you have everything tweaked to perfection, press the
Save Preset button (the one with the little floppy disk) and enter a memo-
rable name for the effect. (If you want, you can also add your name, a copy-
right notice, and a description by clicking the Options button in the Save
Presets dialog box.)
Then, the next time you want to call up a group of settings, just choose the
appropriate preset from the drop-down list and Paint Shop Pro automatically
enters all the numbers you saved. If you feel that you have made too many
changes and want things back to the way they were originally, click the Reset
to Default button, which sets the controls back to the way they were when
you first installed Paint Shop Pro.
To delete a preset, click the Resource Manager button, as shown in Figure
18-1, which pops open the Resource Manager dialog box. Select your preset,
click the Delete button, and then confirm the deletion.
The Materials palette has no presets, but you can save textured gradients
and colors as swatches, which are similar to presets; refer to Chapter 10 for
details.
Masking
You have probably used masking tape, or at least you admire those people
who do. (They’re so tidy!) Masking tape hides certain areas and lets others
remain visible.
In Paint Shop Pro, masking also hides certain areas while letting others
remain visible. A mask is a special type of layer that turns parts of an under-
lying layer transparent, thus allowing a third layer to show through. (Alas,
the similarities between masking and masking tape end there.)
You can put any image you like on a mask layer. Where the image on the mask
layer is darker, the pixels on the layer underneath it become more transpar-
ent and reveal the background (or perhaps another layer). Where the image
on the mask layer is lighter, the pixels on the layer underneath are more visi-
ble. In fact, you can think of masking as applying a special transparency paint
to a layer.
If you don’t know what layers are, you have gone too far! Quick — go to
Chapter 11 and get the knowledge you so desperately need!
305
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

But, what exactly can masking do for you that erasing, selecting, cutting, and
pasting can’t do? Here are a few instances where masking may work better
for you than some alternatives:
 Brush rather than cut and paste intricate shapes: Rather than meticu-
lously select the area of an image you want to combine with another and
then cut it and paste it as a layer, do this: Paste the entire image or a
roughly selected portion of it as a layer and mask out the portions you
don’t want. This approach lets you brush an area in or out, which is
often easier than trying to carefully select the area.
 Create shapes or letters out of an image: If you put letters or shapes on
a mask layer, the background image is blocked except for those letters 
or shapes. This process is much like using a pattern to create nice text
(refer to Chapter 12 for details), except that the pattern is a real-life
photo.
 Gradually feather or fade an image into another image: If you fill a
selected area in an opaque layer with a gradient fill of transparency
paint, you fade the overlaid image smoothly into the underlying image.
 Brush or spray transparency in a creative way: You can use any of the
painting, drawing, or shape tools on a mask. For example, you can spray
(using the Airbrush tool) creative transparent (or opaque) images.
The following section shows you two quick ways to use masks.
Loading a premade mask
Paint Shop Pro comes with several mask layers already built-in, which allows
you to create cool effects. To use them effectively, you should have two
layers: the primary layer you want up front and the bleed-through image on
the background layer.
For this example, we use a simple set of layers, as shown in Figure 18-2: a layer
with the text Paint Shop Pro and a background layer of a simple gradient.
Figure 18-2:
Two layers,
waiting for 
a mask.
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

To add a pregenerated mask, follow these steps:
1. Click the layer you want the mask to affect.
Remember that the mask blocks out certain parts of the layer under-
neath, so make sure that you add it to the right layer.
2. Choose Layers➪Load/Save Mask➪Load Mask from Disk.
The Load Mask from Disk dialog box pops up, as shown in Figure 18-3,
and provides you with several options:
Mask: Click the down arrow in the Mask area and then choose a cate-
gory from the drop-down list in the dialog box that appears. Three basic
sorts of masks are stored within Paint Shop Pro:
Edge Mask: Designed to highlight the center of a picture. Think of
this type of mask as sort of a fancy frame.
If you want a real frame — one that looks like wood — around 
your image, Paint Shop Pro has a tool to do just that. Check out
Chapter 13!
Texture Masks: Overlay an image with some sort of repeating pat-
tern, like a plaid or brick background.
Masks: A central image, like a sunburst or a set of boxes. This type
of mask isn’t terribly useful, but at least it’s free.
In any case, select your pregenerated mask by clicking it. It’s that easy!
Orientation: Here’s where you decide how big you want your mask to 
be (and saved masks tend to be on the small side). You can choose to 
fit the mask so that it stretches across your selection (that’s handy if
you’re just applying it to a bit of text), have it stretch across the entire
canvas, or leave the mask’s size as is.

307
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

Create Mask From: This setting controls how the image on your mask
blots out the layer underneath it.
Source Luminance: In this default setting, darker pixels produce
more of a masking effect and lighter pixels let more of the underly-
ing image show through. (The color of the image on the mask, 
incidentally, matters not one whit; only the light and dark values
count.)
Any Non-Zero Value: There’s no subtlety with this setting. Any
pixel with a color, no matter how light that color is, blocks out the
underlying layer. Only transparent or nonexistent pixels let the
layer shine through.
Source Opacity: This setting uses the mask image’s opacity, rather
than its color, to control how much of the underlying layer gets
through. Opacity, you may recall, is a fancy word for how dense an
area is; areas of low opacity are near-transparent and show almost
everything, whereas areas with 100 percent opacity (most pictures
by default) block it all out.
Options: You’re given a couple of options to work with, just in case you
feel like getting kooky:
Invert Transparency: If you check this box, Paint Shop Pro
reverses its normal habit of “Dark areas block, light areas show
through” and instead switches to a “Light areas block, dark areas
show through” mode.
Hide All Mask, Yadda Yadda: This area has advanced stuff, and
you really don’t need to know about it. (A quick explanation is that
determines whether the surrounding pixels are white or black or
whether they’re taken from previous mask information. We told
you that this setting isn’t that useful.)
3. When you have selected everything you need, click OK.
The mask is now applied, as shown in Figure 18-4. It’s a simple spiral
mask, but you can see how the spiral mask we have applied to the words
Paint Shop Pro has rendered parts of the words transparent, which
allows the background gradient to show through in a spiral pattern.
Using an image as a mask
If the pregenerated masks don’t sound terribly useful (and they’re not), you
can use any old image as a mask. You need three layers in order to create an
effective mask, each containing a separate image:
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 The image you want to have masked
 The background image that you want to show through the masked
image
 The image you use as a mask
That’s a little complex — so to show you how it’s done, we put text on a mask
layer to cut words out of a background. Follow these steps:
1. Select the image that you want to have masked.
This image is blocked out by the mask layer and has the background
image show through it.
2. If the image is on the background layer (as most photos are), choose
Layers➪Promote Background Layer to move it to a separate layer.
As we just said, you need three separate layers to create a mask. This
step makes sure you don’t accidentally swap the background image and
the masked image.
3. Open (or create) the background image, and then paste it into the
canvas as a new layer.
Move the layer containing the background image so that it’s underneath
the layer containing the image that is masked. (If you don’t know how to
move layers around, or how to paste images in as layers, Chapter 11
explains it.)
For this sample masking, we mask a picture of an Amish countryside (as
shown in Figure 18-5). The background layer we use is plain white — but
it could just as well be another photo, or a gradient, or anything else you
can create in Paint Shop Pro. (It could even be transparent, for that
matter.) The important thing is that whatever is on that background
bleeds through the mask.
Figure 18-4:
The words

Pro are

mask, which
allows the

to show
through.
309
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

4. On a separate canvas, load (or create) an image to use as a mask.
You can use any image you want as a mask — words, shapes, even
another picture. Just remember that the dark areas on that canvas
reveal the background layer when it’s used as a mask and that the light
areas reveal the masked layer.
In Figure 18-6, you can see the image we have created for our mask; note
how it’s mostly black, with a fuzzy spotlight effect in the center. That’s
because we want to block out most of the Amish countryside.
To invert a picture’s colors with one click, by turning black into white
and vice versa, choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Negative Image.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

5. Switch back to the canvas that contains the two layers. Select the layer
containing the image you want to have masked.
6. Choose Layers➪New Mask Layer➪From Image.
Paint Shop Pro then asks you which canvas you want to use to create
your mask and lists all images you have open in Paint Shop Pro. Choose
the canvas containing the image you want to use as a mask and click OK.
The image is inserted as a new layer, and the image underneath it is
masked, as shown in Figure 18-7.
If you don’t like the way your mask looks, you can edit the mask directly on
the layer. Select the mask layer, and then use the Eraser to remove parts of
the mask so that the masked image shows through. Alternatively, you can 
use the Paint Brush tool to add more blocked-out parts to your mask.
Although your Paint Brush tool keeps whatever colors you have loaded, a
mask cannot contain colors. All it has are shades of gray.
Drawing Smooth Curves
We show you how to draw single lines and freehand lines over in Chapter 12 —
but if you’re anything like us, your mouse hand isn’t nearly steady enough to
draw a smooth curve. Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro offers another option for
curve lovers: Bezier curves.
Bezier curves are like a high-tech connect-the-dots — you click to create a
series of dots, called nodes, and Paint Shop Pro draws nice, neat curved lines
between the nodes. You can use those nodes to adjust the angle of the curve
that connects the two dots, and to change which way the curve turns.
Figure 18-7:
The Amish
countryside,
with the
mask shown
in Figure
18-6 applied.
311
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

This capability makes it very easy to create professional-looking curves, and
they’re easily edited, to boot. Is your pretty curlicue absolutely perfect except
for one curve in the corner? Adjusting the one node that controls that corner
section straightens out that segment and leaves the rest of your snaky line
untouched!
To play connect-the-dots with Paint Shop Pro, choose the Pen tool on the
Tools toolbar, choose your foreground (stroke) and background (fill) mater-
ial, and then follow these steps:
1. Select Draw mode on the Tool Options palette, as shown in Figure 18-8.
(If you don’t see the Tool Options palette, press F5.)
2. Also on the Tool Options palette, click the Draw Point to Point button,
under the word Mode.
By default, Paint Shop Pro assumes that you want to draw a two-node
line — a single curve between two points. If you want to create a 
multiple-node line, like a spiral or a curve with several bends, click the
Connect Segments check box.
3. Set the Width value, still within the Tool Options palette, to the
desired width of your line (in pixels).
4. Set the Background and Fill Properties box (on the Materials palette)
to transparent if you want just a line or outline, or select a material if
you want it filled.
To make the line transparent, click the Transparent button on the right
side on the Materials palette, just underneath the Background and Fill
Properties box.
5. Click and drag to set the node’s properties.
Each click you make creates a node, although you still have to tell Paint
Shop Pro how steep the curve’s angle is and which way it’s pointing.
Click where you want to place the node — as you drag the mouse, you
pull out an arrow by its tip. Here’s how that arrow works for you:
Figure 18-8:
To create
professional
Bezier
curves, you
need the
Tool Options
palette.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

• As you drag the arrow farther away from the node and make it
longer, the angle of the curve gets sharper as it approaches the
node. If you make the arrow shorter again, the curve becomes
rounder as it approaches the node.
• As you drag the front end of the arrow around the dot, the curve
follows the arrow’s direction as best it can while still ending up at
the node.
Figure 18-9 shows the effect of dragging the tip of the arrow: Even
though the two dots don’t move, the curve that connects the dots
changes radically. On the left, a curved line is created and the arrow
appears for the latest dot. On the right, the arrow’s tip is being extended
and dragged upward a bit. You can see how the curve broadens and
changes its angle to follow the arrow’s direction.
As you create this line, if you discover that you have placed a node in
the wrong position, you can go back and edit it later. (In fact, we show
you how to do that in the following section.) However, Paint Shop Pro
doesn’t show you all nodes as you’re drawing the line — only the one
you’re working on. If you want to see all previous nodes as you drag 
the mouse, click the Show Nodes check box.
6. If you want a shape (with a closed line), click the Close Selected Open
Contours button when you’re done.
The Close Selected Open Contours feature finishes the Bezier curve by
drawing a line between the first and last nodes, which makes it a closed
shape. Your line now appears in all its colorful glory.
If you have selected Connect Segments and you don’t choose Close
Selected Open Contours, you need to tell Paint Shop Pro when you’re
done drawing this particular curve. Otherwise, when you click a new
node into existence, it’s added to the end of the preceding curve. To
stop drawing when you’re in Connect Segments mode, click the Start
New Contour button.

Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

You’re done! Hopefully, your curve looks perfect. If it’s not, you need to edit
your nodes. Read on to the next section!
Editing Bezier curve nodes
Paint Shop Pro users have an old saying: “You can pick your friends and you
can pick your nodes, but you can’t pick your friend’s nodes.” It’s not true, of
course, but that doesn’t keep users from saying it. You can freely pick, or pick
at, all your nodes — including your friend’s nodes, if that person gives you a
Paint Shop Pro file with vector lines or shapes in it.
If you want to alter a shape or a line after you have drawn it, you need to get
down and dirty and start changing the nodes.
To start fiddling with nodes, you need to select the Pen tool and click the Edit
button on the Tool Options palette.
To enter Node Edit mode, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. From the Tool Options palette, choose Edit Mode, as shown earlier, in
Figure 18-8.
After you’re in Node Edit mode, you can manipulate your nodes all you want.
Here are some changes you can make:
 To select a node for any action (like deleting, dragging, or changing its
type), click it. You know that you can select it when a four-headed arrow
appears under the cursor; you know that a node is selected when it’s
solid black.
 To move a node, drag it. You can move multiple nodes at one time as
long as they’re all selected.
 To delete a node, press Delete.
 To select several nodes, hold down the Shift key while clicking them.
 To select several nodes at one time, make sure that you’re in Node Edit
mode (this action doesn’t work if you’re in Drawing or Knife mode) and
draw a square around the nodes you want to select.
 To select all nodes, right-click a node and choose Edit➪Select All from
the context menu that pops up.
 To join two line segments that are part of the same object (for example,
if they were created by cutting a line in half with the Pen tool in Knife
mode), select the two ends you want to join by Shift+clicking both of
them and then right-click your image and choose Edit➪Join.
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Note that a line has direction, based on the order in which you create the line.
The control arrow that appears on a node in Node Edit mode points in the line’s
direction. The word Start or End that appears when you pause your mouse
cursor over the end nodes of a line also tells you the direction. A few things you
do may be dependent on direction, such as aligning text to the line or shape.
Slicing shapes in half
The Pen tool is mightier than the Sword tool — or would be, if a Sword tool
existed. Ironically, though, Knife mode is a part of the Pen tool, and it’s might-
ier than the rest of the Pen tool because it slices in half the lines and shapes
you have drawn.
Select Knife mode from the Tool Options palette and drag a line through your
vector object. This action separates the object into two separate sets of
nodes, cut cleanly where you drew through them with the Knife. Be warned
that even if you separate an image in two with the Knife, both still count as
one vector object.
Aligning Objects
After you have painstakingly added all the text, shapes, and Bezier curves to
an image, quite often you must complete one more step: You want these ele-
ments to line up cleanly. The right edge of the text should match up with the
end of your Bezier curve, or the elements all should be aligned to the bottom,
as shown in Figure 18-10. Fortunately, you can easily align all the objects in
your file.

and text are

Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

Unfortunately, one of the sillier things about Paint Shop Pro is that you have
no way (or at least no easy way) to convert a layer or selection into an object.
And, you can use this technique only to align objects. You can’t align, for
example, a pasted-in image with a text object in one click; if you need to do
that, you have to do it by hand. Sorry!
Simply select all the objects you want lined up (refer to Chapter 12 for details
on how to do that) and choose Objects➪Align. You’re presented with a daz-
zling array of options:
 Top, Bottom, Left, Right: Paint Shop Pro aligns all the selected objects
along the margin you have chosen. For example, if you choose Right, the
objects are all moved so that their right margins are placed on the same
line.
 Vertical Center, Horizontal Center: These items are aligned along their
vertical or horizontal axis.
 Center in Canvas, Horizontal Center in Canvas, Vertical Center in
Canvas: These options move all selected items (even if it’s just one item)
so that it’s in the appropriate place in the canvas.
Distributing Objects
When you have several objects on a page, you often want to space them in
some manner — so that a row of hand-drawn Christmas lights is evenly
spread across the page or items are arranged neatly by their center.
Simply select three or more objects (you can’t distribute just two items!), 
and then choose Objects➪Distribute. You’re given a couple of choices:
 Vertical Center: The centers of the objects are spaced out evenly along
a vertical axis, as shown in Figure 18-11. Notice that their uneven hori-
zontal positions have been left untouched.
 Horizontal Center: The centers of the objects are spaced out evenly
along a horizontal axis.
 Vertical Bottom, Horizontal Bottom, Vertical Top, Horizontal Top:
Sometimes, when you have objects of differing sizes, spacing out items
by their centers looks funny, as you can see in Figure 18-12. In that case,
you can space your objects according to where their bottom or top mar-
gins are, which can make things easier.
 Space Evenly Horizontal, Space Evenly Vertical: This option spaces the
selected objects evenly across the canvas height or width, depending on
whether you choose Horizontal or Vertical.

Using the Paint Shop Pro Grids
If you’re the sort of person who really likes to have your ducks in a row, Paint
Shop Pro can display a grid so that you know precisely where your objects
are at all times. (As an unexpected bonus, it also makes your image look
much like a game of Battleship.) The grid is handy for lining up items.
Furthermore, you can set the grid so that when you drag a selection, object,
or layer to within a certain distance of a gridline, the item’s edge “snaps” to
the grid and moves the edge automatically so that it’s aligned with one of the
lines.
To see the grid, choose View➪Grid. A fine tracery of gray lines now overlays
your image; you can’t draw over or erase the grid lines. If you want to have
your selections snap to the grid, choose View➪Snap to Grid.
To adjust the grid’s properties, choose View➪Change Grid, Guide and Snap
Properties, which brings up the not-at-all-interestingly-named Grid, Guide &
Snap Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-13.
From there, you can adjust both the default settings for all grids and the set-
tings for the grid in this particular image. In either case, the controls are
fairly intuitive as Paint Shop Pro goes:
 Units: In this area of the dialog box, you can decide which style of mea-
surement Paint Shop Pro should use to set grid lines: pixels, centime-
ters, or inches.
 Horizontal Grids: This option controls how far apart your horizontal
grid lines should be, as measured in whatever units you choose.

The Matrix
has you, but
the grid
merely

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Vertical Grids: This option controls how far apart your vertical grid
lines should be. (Note that you can set the vertical and horizontal grid
lines to different values, though we can’t imagine why you would want to
do so.)
 Color: By default, this option is set to a neutral gray, but you can choose
a vibrant pink or muted yellow for your grid lines, if you like. Clicking
this box brings up a dialog box much like the Color palette, which we
explain thoroughly in Chapter 9.
 Snap Influence: This option controls how strong an influence your grid
lines have when you turn on the Snap To option. By default, it’s set to
100 pixels, which means that if a selected item’s edge comes within 100
pixels of a grid line, the edge is automatically aligned with the line. You
can reduce this number, which allows you to move your items about the
grid without always having your items snap to an edge.
When you’re done, click OK. To stop displaying your grid (which also tem-
porarily disables any snap-to settings), choose View➪Grid once more.
Advanced Selecting Techniques
Sometimes, you want to select lots of areas that are the same color, scattered
throughout your image — for example, you want to select only the sky, as
seen through the intersecting branches of a tree. You could Shift+click each
spot manually with the Magic Wand tool and painstakingly add area after
area. But, fortunately, Paint Shop Pro offers an automatic version of that
same task.
First, use any selection tool to select one area. Then, choose Selections➪
Modify➪Select Similar. Paint Shop Pro selects all pixels similar to the colors
within your selection.
How similar? The Select Similar command looks to the Magic Wand tool’s
Tolerance control to determine how similar to the original color a selected
pixel should be. A high tolerance means that a color can be significantly dif-
ferent and still be selected; a low tolerance selects only colors that are very
close to those in your original selection.
A difference between the Magic Wand tool and the Select Similar command 
is that it asks whether you want to select an area contiguously. A contiguous
Select Similar action adds only the areas that are right next to the current
selection; discontiguous selections add parts from all over your image, regard-
less of where they are.
You can also add or remove selections based on how close they are to certain
colors. For example, if you’re trying to cut and paste The Artist Formerly
319
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

Known As Prince Who Is Back to Being Called Prince Again (and who is
known for wearing purple outfits), you may want to expand your selection 
to only lavender areas. Choose Selections➪Modify➪Select Color Range, 
and choose a nice shade of magenta in the color box.
Sometimes, you don’t really want all the pixels of similar color, just those
within a certain region of the image. Fussy, fussy. For example, you may want
all the blue sky, including the stuff that peeks through the tree branches, but
not the blue pond. No problem. Just draw a freehand selection around the
pond while pressing the Ctrl key to subtract that area.
Creating Interactive Web 
Pages from Graphics
Paint Shop Pro not only creates static Web images (images that just sit there),
but can also create the interactive graphical portion of the Web page itself.
For example, Paint Shop Pro can help you
 Slice a single image into a multi-image grid and create the Web page that
assembles the pieces into a grid and makes each image a hot link.
 Create graphical rollovers — images that change as you pass your mouse
cursor over them — and write the Web page code to make the rollover
happen.
To accomplish its Webbish wonders, Paint Shop Pro writes HTML files (Web
pages), not just image files. You can then use these HTML files on their own
or copy their HTML code (including JavaScript code) into other Web pages.
You probably need to understand how Web pages, hot links, and rollovers
work before trying to use Paint Shop Pro to make these features. Check out
the Wiley Web site, at www.wiley.com, to find various books on Web pages
and design.
Creating image slices
Professional Web designers rarely design in HTML; instead, they create an
image of how they want their Web page to look, by using multiple layers and
futzing with the page until it looks perfect. Then, when they’re done, they
slice that image into multiple images (known as cells) and assign a link to
each cell. Paint Shop Pro creates the HTML code (a table) that’s necessary 
to hold the images in a grid and also creates a series of new images from 
your original, single image.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You can use another technique, called image mapping, but it has two major
disadvantages: The entire image has to be downloaded completely before 
the viewer can do anything (and haven’t we told you about the importance 
of speedy downloads?), and you can’t use rollovers effectively. We advise
skipping this technique unless you have a pressing need.
To slice an image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪Image Slicer, as shown in Figure 18-14.
2. Zoom and position your image in the Image Slicer so that you can see
the whole area you intend to slice.
To zoom, click either of the magnifier icons below the image: + to zoom
in or – to zoom out. To position (pan) your image, click and hold the
mouse button on the Pan icon and drag in the preview window until you
see what you want.

3. Click either the Slice tool or the Grid tool.
The Grid tool divides your image by using a grid of evenly spaced lines.
You can adjust the lines and their positions afterward. The Slice tool,
although tricky to control, enables you to slice wherever you like.
4. Slice your image.
If you use the Grid tool, click anywhere on the image. In the Grid Size
dialog box that appears, enter values for the number of rows and
columns in your grid.
If you use the Slice tool, click where you want the center of your cut to
be and drag either horizontally or vertically; the Slice tool creates a hori-
zontal or vertical cut that expands in both directions from where you
originally clicked. You don’t need to drag entirely across the image; the
line automatically extends to the image edge or to the next line it
encounters.
Note that you can use both the Slice tool and the Grid tool to provide
extremely fine control; for example, you can create a grid of boxes and
then subdivide each of those boxes with the Slice tool.
5. Use the Delete tool to remove any extra lines.
Click the Delete tool in the Tools area and click lines you don’t want.
6. Use the Arrow tool to drag any lines that need moving.
If your image has any solid white cells, you can improve the Web page’s
downloading speed by not placing an image in that cell. Using the Arrow tool,
click the cell and then uncheck the Include Cell in Table check box. This trick
also works for other solid-color areas, but you have to edit the resulting
HTML file to set the background color to match the image color.
At this point, you’re ready to enter the hyperlink (Web address) information
that describes what Web page appears when the person viewing your page
clicks a cell (see the following section).
Entering links
After you have created your hot spot areas or cells, the next step is to enter
the Web address that you want each hot spot or cell to link to when someone
clicks it on the Web. Follow these steps:
1. Choose the Arrow tool (in the Tools area) and click a hot spot or cell.
2. Enter the URL (address of the Web page) you want to link to in the
URL text box.
If you intend for the page to appear in a named frame of the current
page, enter the frame name in the Target area.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. Enter a text description of that new page in the Alt Text text box.
4. Select where you want the new page to open on the Target menu.
If you want the page to open in the same browser window, you can leave
this area blank. Otherwise, you can force the user’s browser to display
the URL in a new and exciting way.
The only target that’s universally useful is _blank, which opens the 
URL in an entirely new browser window and leaves the original page
untouched. The other three — _top, _self, and _parent, respectively —
are useful only if you’re using an HTML technique called frames to design
your page (which is something that’s generally considered bad form these
days, so we just pretend that they don’t exist).
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 for all the cells you have created.
You may also want to save the work you have done so far, which we describe
how to do in the section “Saving and reloading your work,” a little later in this
chapter.
Optimizing cells
Unless you tell it to do otherwise, Paint Shop Pro saves all your cells as GIF
files, which can create grainy images and horribly lengthy download times. 
A little compression can make all the difference; remember that the JPEG
used in Chapter 15 took four minutes to download before it was squeezed
down. Is your page so cool that you would watch a blank screen for five min-
utes before you saw it? (Studies have shown that people don’t wait for more
than 12 seconds.)
To optimize your images, follow these steps:
1. Select the Arrow tool (in the Tools area) and click a hot spot or cell.
2. Choose whether your cell should be a GIF or JPEG image.
Refer to Table 15-1 in Chapter 15 for a comparison of formats. (You can
use PNG, but not all browsers support it.)
3. If you want to optimize the image — and you should — click the
Optimize Cell button.
This step brings up the GIF Optimizer or the JPEG Optimizer, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 15; pay special attention to the Download Times tab.
If you want all your cells to be optimized the same way, click the Apply
Optimization to Whole Image check box.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for all cells you have created.
323
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

Saving and reloading your work
You may want to go back and change your hot spots, cells, or links later, or
perhaps use similar settings on a slightly different image. For those reasons,
save your work as a file. (Note that this file isn’t the Web page file or an image
file; to create those, see the following section.)
Click the Save Settings button. The Save Slice Settings dialog box that
appears works just like any other file-saving dialog box. Enter a name and
choose a folder for your file, and then click Save.
If you want to use or edit your settings later, open the Image Slicer tool as
before and click the Load Settings button. Open your file in the Load Slice
Settings dialog box that appears. The hot spots or cells you defined earlier
are now set up for the current image.
Saving the result as a Web page
For all this slicing and dicing to be of any use, you need to transform it into a
Web file. The Paint Shop Pro Webtools feature produces the two kinds of files
you need for your Web page: one or more image files (in GIF, JPEG, or PNG
format) and a single HTML file. You create as many image files as you have cells.
The Web page (HTML) file that’s created incorporates those image files and 
provides the links, hot spots, and other programming that makes it all work.
Before you produce the final files, you can test your Web page by viewing it in
your Web browser. In the Image Slicer, click the Preview button. Your Web
browser is launched and displays the result. You can test all the hot spots or
other features you have created.
To create your Web files, click the Save or Save As button. If you haven’t cre-
ated any Web files since you launched the Image Slicer, the Save As dialog
box appears. As with the Save As dialog box in any program, you enter a file-
name and choose a folder. The name and folder you choose is the name and
location of the HTML, or Web page file, you’re creating. (The Save As dialog
box doesn’t appear if your Web page file already has a name and folder.)
Paint Shop Pro creates a series of cell images in the same folder as the HTML
file; although each cell file’s name begins with the name of the original image
file, Paint Shop Pro appends additional characters to distinguish the cell.
Making rollovers
Rollovers are images (typically, buttons) that change appearance whenever
you position your mouse over them or whenever you do various other mouse
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

or keyboard actions. For example, a button may get darker. Rollovers are
popular Web page features because they provide immediate feedback to the
user’s cursor motion.
The basic mouseover rollover, which we describe here, simply changes as the
mouse passes over it. It requires two images: the original image (a button, for
example) and the one that substitutes for the original when a mouse cursor
passes over it (a darkened version of the button, for example).
To create a rollover, follow these steps:
1. Prepare the pair of images for each rollover.
For each rollover, you need the image that first appears on the Web page
and the image that takes the first image’s place. If you like using sliced
images, first use the Image Slicer to slice a large image into separate cell
images and save your settings. Close the Image Slicer, load into Paint
Shop Pro all the cell images created by the slicer, and modify them in
some way; for example, you can make them darker. Save each one with 
a modified filename so that the original cell images remain unchanged.
2. Open the original image in Paint Shop Pro, if it isn’t already open.
For example, open the large image you originally sliced in Step 1.
3. Launch the Image Slicer and load your earlier settings.
Load the settings you saved in Step 1 to restore the slicing.
4. With the Arrow tool, click in the Image Slicer the cell you want to pro-
gram with a rollover.
5. Click the Rollover Creator button.
The Rollover Creator dialog box appears.
6. Click the Mouse Over check box.
7. Click the file folder icon on the same line as the Mouse Over check box.
The Select Rollover dialog box appears.
8. Choose the image file that you want to appear when the mouse passes
over and click Open.
For example, this file is the darkened version of the original file.
9. Click OK in the Select Rollover dialog box.
10. Repeat Steps 4 through 9 for each cell or hot spot.
Proceed to save your settings and create your Web files as we describe in ear-
lier sections in this chapter.

Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

Advanced Undoing and Redoing
Have you made a mistake? Paint Shop Pro has a classic fix: Choose Edit➪
Undo. Or, press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo button. Each time, you back up a
step and undo the preceding action. If you accidentally undo too far, you can
redo the step with Edit➪Redo. (Or, because Paint Shop Pro never gives you
just one way to do something when several will do, you can also press
Ctrl+Alt+Z or click the Redo button on the toolbar.)
What if you make lots of mistakes? Or, what if you realize that you made one
mistake a while back, but have done several things correctly since then? If
you undo all the way back to the point where you made your mistakes, you
also undo the valid changes you have made since your mistake.
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro 9 adds a command history to allow you to see
more precisely what commands you’re undoing and redoing. Choose View➪
Palettes➪History (or press F3) and the History palette appears. It provides
enough command of history to finally understand the Peloponnesian War.
Okay, so nobody really understands (or even correctly spells) the
Peloponnesian War, but you can undo and redo your Paint Shop Pro com-
mands with more insight now. Most (but not all) commands are undoable.
Only undoable commands are normally shown on the History palette. To 
see even the ones you can’t undo, click the Show Non-Undoable Commands
button, second from last at the top of the History palette.
Previous commands are marked with an eyeball to indicate that their effect is
currently visible. Click any eyeball to undo a step; it gets crossed out. Click
that same eyeball to redo that step. In this way, you can undo a single mis-
take without annihilating everything you have added since your mistake.
To prepare to undo several steps, Ctrl+click on multiple steps you want to
undo. Click the Undo Selected button at the top of the History palette and
your highlighted steps are undone.
To undo everything back to a specific step, click on that step. Then click the
Undo to Here button at the top of the palette.
Undone steps are now marked with a crossed-out eyeball to indicate that
their effect is no longer visible. The History palette Redo buttons (Redo
Selected and Redo to Here) are the complements to the Undo buttons. Select
the step or steps you want redone and click the Redo Selected button. Or,
click one of the X’d-out steps and click Redo to Here. If you’re permanently
done with undone commands, you “clear” them from History. Click the Clear
Selectively Undone Commands button, third from the right at the top of the
History palette.

Using Scripts to Automate 
Repetitive Tasks
William works as a webmaster for an online shop. Three times a year, new
products get released and he has to scan in and upload 350 pictures. Of
course, the scanned images all have to be the same size, and they all have to
have their colors adjusted so that they’re clear and vibrant images, and they
have to have a black border around their edges.
Doing that by hand 350 times would drive William stark-raving bonkers.
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro 8 debuted a fantastic new scripting feature,
which allowed William to save that repetitive series of commands as a single
script. Now, whenever William scans in an image, he clicks one button — and
the script adjusts the image’s colors, resizes it, and adds a black border in
one go.
The Paint Shop Pro scripting features record a series of commands and then
replay those commands as you entered them, which saves you valuable time.
If you have ever used macros in Word or Excel, you should be familiar with
this concept.
Recording a script
Here’s how you record an item:
1. If you don’t see the Script toolbar, as shown in Figure 18-15, choose
View➪Toolbars➪Script.
2. Click the Start Script Recording button.
Script selection menu

Cancel Script Recording

327
Chapter 18: Ten Topics a Little Too Advanced for the Rest of This Book

3. Perform the sequence of actions you want recorded, just as you would
normally do in Paint Shop Pro.
Keep in mind that the settings for the tools you use are saved within the
script; for example, if you paint a circle with a 50 percent opacity and 25-
pixel brush, that script is always drawn with a 50 percent opacity and
25-pixel brush, regardless of what the Brush tool may be set to.
4. If you need to pause recording in the middle to do something that you
don’t want replayed later, click the Pause Script Recording button.
Click it again to continue the recording where you left off.
5. When you’re done, click the Save Script Recording button and enter a
name, and then click OK. Or, if you have done something wrong and
you don’t want to save it, click the Cancel Script Recording button.
You have three options when you’re saving:
 Click the Save Materials check box. This option ensures that the script
draws with the material (the color, gradient, or pattern) that was used
when you recorded the script, thus ensuring that a red line is always a
red line; unchecking this option causes this script to draw with what-
ever materials are selected when you run it.
 Click the Save Dialog Positions check box. Choosing this option is a
strange business. Normally, Paint Shop Pro doesn’t pay attention to
where you click — it pays attention to what you did. Put another way, if
you record an application of the Topography Artistic effect (as shown in
Chapter 13), the script isn’t paying attention to where you moved the
mouse or when you clicked OK — it’s paying attention to the settings
that were used when the topographical effect was applied.
This capability is A Good Thing. For one thing, it allows Paint Shop Pro
to zip through the scripts; it doesn’t have to wait two seconds to move
the mouse to the OK button, like you did.
If, however, you had a script that needed to place a click at some posi-
tion in a certain dialog box, you could check this box and ensure those
dialog boxes are in the same places. Realistically, though, you can proba-
bly ignore this part.
 Click the Remove Undone Commands check box. We hope that you did
everything perfectly when you recorded your script. If you made a mis-
take, though, all is not lost! You can undo during a script recording. If the
Remove Undone Commands option is checked, those commands aren’t
carried out in the final script. (Why you would want to uncheck it is a
complete mystery, but, hey — that’s a question that only Jasc can
answer.)
You can also, if you’re so inclined, select the Description box and enter
the author, copyright, and description of your script. This is handy if
you expect to pass it on.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Scripts are saved by default in the My Documents/My PSP Files/
Restricted-Scripts folder. You can send them to other users, who 
can put them in their folders and run them as though they had been
recorded on their own PCs.
Running a script
Running Paint Shop Pro scripts is much simpler than recording them. Follow
these steps:
1. Click the arrow on the drop-down list on the Script toolbar, as shown
in Figure 18-16.
By default, you’re shown the scripts stored in the Scripts-Restricted cat-
egory, but you can click other script folders, like Artistic and Photo, to
see what other exciting scripts Paint Shop Pro has given you for free.
Note that some scripts are already there. Paint Shop Pro comes bundled
with several scripts to automate common tasks, like creating thumb-
nails, and also gives you some artistic transformation scripts that can
turn a photograph into, for example, a watercolor painting. Feel free to
experiment.
2. Click the Run Selected Script button.
Certain advanced scripts may have dialog boxes that ask for user input,
but most just zip through and go about their business in no time.
