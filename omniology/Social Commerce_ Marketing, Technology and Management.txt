 Social commerce, also known as social business, is an emerging ﬁ eld driven by the explosive 
growth of the social Web and social media. The ﬁ eld includes social network services such as 
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; user-generated content networks such as YouTube and 
Pinterest; products and services review sites (e.g., Trip Advisor); and social shopping sites 
(e.g., Groupon, Polyvore). Social commerce (SC) can be viewed as a subset of electronic com-
merce where the electronic transactions and associated product conversations are conducted on 
social networks and other social media platforms. 
 To date, major activities of social commerce are facilitated by marketing communication, 
online sales transactions, and customer service areas. There are also signiﬁ cant activities in the 
areas of collaboration, recruiting, and problem solving within organizations (known as 
Enterprise 2.0). Social commerce networks also beneﬁ t organizations by moving them closer 
to their markets for collaboration and research purposes that often result in product innovation 
and greater customer value. 
 SC is expected to maintain its rapid growth, disrupting several current business models in 
the process. An understanding of the strategies and tactics in this ﬁ eld is critical for the future 
of any organization. This book is a snapshot of SC in 2015/2016, and it includes many resources 
and references so the reader can learn about the state of the art and monitor current strategies 
and tactics. 
 THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK 
 This book was written as a multidisciplinary textbook by leading authors of e-commerce and 
e-marketing textbooks, with contributions by several industry experts. It is the ﬁ rst comprehen-
sive textbook and resource collection ever written on this topic and it can be used in one or 
more of the following ways:
  (a)  Textbook for an elective course at the undergraduate or graduate levels (including MBA 
and executive MBA programs). 
 (b)  Supplementary text in marketing, management, or information systems disciplines. 
  (c)  Material for training courses in industry. 
 (d)  Support resources for researchers and practitioners in the ﬁ elds of marketing, manage-
ment, and information management.  
 Multidisciplinary Approach 
 Social commerce is a multidisciplinary ﬁ eld combining marketing, IT, management, sociol-
ogy, behavioral sciences, and more.

 FEATURES OF THIS BOOK 
 Several features are unique to this book. It includes both management and theoretical 
approaches to improve business strategies and tactics. 
 Managerial Orientation 
 Social commerce can be approached from two major viewpoints: technological and manage-
rial. This text uses the second approach. Most of the content is about SC applications and 
implementation. However, we do recognize the importance of the technology and present tech-
nological topics as needed. In addition, we provide many technology resources.  
 Real-World Orientation 
 Extensive, vivid examples from large corporations, small businesses, governments, and non-
proﬁ t agencies from all over the world make concepts come alive. These examples show the 
readers the capabilities of SC, its cost and justiﬁ cation, and the innovative ways these entities 
are using SC in their operations.  
 Solid Theoretical Background 
 Chapter   3 is dedicated to the theoretical foundations necessary for understanding SC, ranging 
from consumer behavior to social inﬂ uence. Furthermore, we provide website resources, many 
exercises, and extensive references to supplement the theoretical presentations. 
 Most Current Leading-Edge Topics 
 The book presents the most current topics related to SC, as evidenced by many recent sources. 
Topics such as crowdsourcing, social CRM, reputation management, social games, mobile 
social, the Hype Cycle, social analytics, and sentiment analysis are presented from the 
 theoretical point of view as well as from the application perspective. 
 Global Perspective 
 The importance of global competition, partnerships, and trade is increasing rapidly. Social 
commerce can facilitate global collaboration, the management of multinational companies, 
and electronic trading around the globe. International examples are provided throughout the 
book, including some from developing countries.  
 Links to Resources 
 Several hundred links to research reports, companys’ products, books, guides, free e-books, 
etc. are provided.
 Note #1.  We do not mark a www. in front of the URLs. If the page is not loaded try to add 
www. 
 Note #2.  The dynamic nature of the ﬁ eld makes some of the links obsolete. 
 Note #3.  In many cases, we provide only the name of a company or its URL, but not both.

 User-Friendliness 
 While covering all major SC topics, this book is clear, simple, and well organized. It provides all 
the basic deﬁ nitions of terms as well as logical conceptual support. Furthermore, the book is easy 
to understand and is full of interesting real-world examples that maintain the readers’ interest.  
 ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK 
 The book is divided into 11 chapters grouped into four part (see Fig.   1.6 ). In addition, there are 
two primers, one on e-commerce and one on e-marketing, which provide the foundations 
needed as prerequisites to a course on social commerce. An appendix to the book lists dozens 
of SC-oriented websites. 
 COURSE SYLLABUS AND LEARNING OUTCOMES

 Student Learning Strategies 
•  Learn the important terminology for this emerging ﬁ eld, as presented in the book’s exten-
sive glossary. 
•  Follow links within each chapter to learn many of the topics more thoroughly. 
•  Read case histories within each chapter and answer challenging questions about the com-
pany’s social media strategies. 
•  Study the end-of-chapter review questions that can help self-assessment of knowledge learned. 
•  Engage in social commerce topics with end-of-chapter activities: discussion, debates, and 
Internet exercises. 
•  Watch videos and answer relevant questions about them. 
•   Delve more deeply into chapter topics with end-of-chapter team assignments and activities.  
•  Solve interesting, current case problems and video cases introduced in each chapter. 
 PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES 
 The text offers a number of learning aids for the students:
•  Book’s Learning Outcomes. The book’s learning outcomes are included in the proposed 
course syllabus. 
•  Chapter Outlines. A listing of the main headings (“Content”) at the beginning of each 
chapter provides a quick overview of the major topics covered.  
•  Chapter’s Learning Objectives.  Learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter help 
readers focus their efforts and alert them to the important concepts to be discussed. The sum-
maries at the end of each chapter are organized to correspond with the learning objectives.  
•  Opening Cases. Each chapter opens with a real-world example that illustrates the major 
topics to be covered in the chapter. Following each case, a short section titled “Lessons 
Learned from the Case” links the important issues in the opening case to the subject matter 
of the chapter. Questions for the opening cases are provided in the “Team Assignment” 
 section at the end of each chapter. 
•  Application Cases and Examples. In-chapter cases and numerous examples highlight 
real-world SC solutions used by organizations. Questions follow each application case to 
help direct students’ attention to the implications of the case material.  
•  Exhibits. Numerous attractive exhibits (both illustrations and tables) extend and supple-
ment the text discussion.  
•  Chapter Summary. The chapter summary is linked one-to-one with the learning objectives 
introduced at the beginning of each chapter. 
•  Review Questions. Each chapter ends with a series of review questions. These are intended 
to help students summarize the concepts introduced and understand the essentials of each 
section before proceeding to another topic.  
•  End-of-Chapter Exercises. Different types of questions measure students’ comprehension 
and their ability to apply knowledge. “Topics for Class Discussion and Debates” are 
intended to develop critical thinking skills. “Internet Exercises” are challenging assign-
ments that require students to use the Internet and apply what they have learned. More than 
100 hands-on exercises direct students to interesting websites to conduct research, 
investigate applications, download demos, watch videos, or learn about state-of-the-art

 OPENING CASE: STARBUCKS GOES SOCIAL 
 Starbucks Corp. (“Starbucks”) is the world’s largest coffee 
house chain. As of October 2014, the company has over 
21,000 stores in 66 countries (per  starbucks.com ). In addi-
tion to its coffee houses, Starbucks sells coffee and related 
products from its online store ( store.starbucks.com/ ). In 
2012, Starbucks began turning itself into a digital and social 
company (Van Grove  2012 and case study at  storify.com/
MerMaeMarNat/starbucks-social-media-case-study ). 
 The Problem 
 Starting in 2007, the company’s operating income declined 
sharply (from over $1 billion in 2007 to $504 million in 2008 
and $560 million in 2009). This decline was caused by not 
only the economic slowdown, but also by the increased com-
petition (e.g., from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters), which 
intensiﬁ ed even during the recession. 

4
 The Solution: Going Social 
 Starbucks is a tech-savvy company. As such, the company has 
one of the best social media programs (see Moth  2013 ). Social 
media are Internet-based systems that support social interac-
tions and user involvement (see Sect.  1.2 ). The company’s 
focus is geared toward developing relationships based on the 
needs, wants, and likes of existing and future customers. 
 Starbucks’ major social media activities include My 
Starbucks Idea (a community of about 300,000 members that 
cast over 1,000,000 votes by 2014), a Facebook page, and a 
presence on all other major social networks (see Moth  2013 ). 
 Exploiting Collective Intelligence: 
My Starbucks Idea 
 My Starbucks Idea ( mystarbucksidea.force.com ) is a 
platform in which consumers and employees can make 
suggestions, vote on the suggestions, ask questions, col-
laborate on projects, and vent their frustrations (see York 
 2010 ). The consumer-generated ideas (70,000 in its ﬁ rst 
year; 150,000 by 2014) range from thoughts on rewards 
cards and elimination/recycling of paper cups to ways to 
better serve customers. The site acts as a place for open 
dialogue and collaborative environment and a place for 
sharing ideas and information. 
 The company also interacts with the community via its 
‘Ideas in Action’ blog. The blog provides statistics on the 
ideas generated, by category (e.g., product ideas, service 
ideas), as well as their status (under review, reviewed, in the 
works, and launched). The company may provide monetary 
incentives for certain ideas. For example, in June 2010, 
Starbucks offered $20,000 for the best ideas concerning the 
reuse of its cups. 
 Starbucks’ Activities on Facebook 
 Starbucks maintains a strong social media presence on 
Facebook ( facebook.com/Starbucks ), with over 38 million 
“Likes” (as of December 2014). Their Facebook page 
encourages consumers to drop by for conversation and share 
ideas, feedback, and constructive criticism. 
 The millions of people who ‘like’ Starbucks on Facebook 
verify that the company has one of the most popular fan 
pages (see current statistics at  fanpagelist.com ). Starbucks 
is offering one of the best online marketing communication 
experiences on Facebook to date, along with mobile com-
merce engagement. For example, users can pay for coffee 
with their smartphones. 
 Starbucks posts diversiﬁ ed information (e.g., news, discus-
sion) on its Facebook “wall,” whether it is content, questions, 
or updates. The company also advertises on Facebook (e.g., 
contests, events, new products) and posts job openings.  
 Starbucks’ Presence on LinkedIn and Google+ 
 Starbucks has proﬁ les on LinkedIn and Google+ sites with 
millions of followers. It provides business data about the 
company, shows employee proﬁ les, and advertises available 
jobs. Note that Starbucks is regularly assessing the cost- 
beneﬁ t of advertising on social networks. 
 Starbucks’ Activities on Twitter 
 In December 2014, Starbucks had over seven million follow-
ers (Follow@starbucks) on Twitter ( twitter.com/starbucks ), 
organized in lists (e.g., @starbucks/friends). Each ‘list’ has 
its own followers and tweets. Whenever the company has a 
new update or campaign (e.g., discounted drinks) it posts a 
tweet. By July 2013, Starbucks was the number one retailer 
to follow on Twitter. 
 Starbucks’ Activities on YouTube, Flickr, Pinterest, 
and Instagram 
 Starbucks runs ad campaigns and has its own channel on 
YouTube ( youtube.com/user/starbucks ) and a “group” for 
fans on Flickr ( ﬂ ickr.com/groups/starbuckscoffeecom-
pany ), with fans sharing over 12,000 photos and videos. For 
details on these and other networks, see Moth ( 2013 ). 
 Early Adoption of Foursquare—A Failure 
 Not all Starbucks social media projects have been a success. 
For example, the company decided to be an early adopter of 
geolocation by working with Foursquare. The initiative sim-
ply did not work, and the project ended in mid-2010. As an 
early adopter, Starbucks did not fully understand how to use 
the site effectively for its social media needs (see Teicher 
 2010 for an analysis). With the general lack of interest in 
geolocation, it looks like Starbucks may stop using this 
technology. 
1 Introduction to Social Commerce

 Social Media Marketing 
 According to Gibb ( 2013 ), Starbucks excels at social media 
marketing because:
•  It has “super inﬂ uencers” 
•  It encourages sharing 
•  It customizes the experience 
•  Its causes are timely and consistent 
•  It uses social cross-promotion to reach new audiences 
•   Its mission is “to inspire and nurture the human spirit one 
person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.”  
 Starbucks Digital Network 
 When customers are at Starbucks, they have more than Wi-Fi, 
they get access to the Starbucks Digital Network from all 
major mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones (see 
 starbucks.com/coffeehouse/wireless-internet/starbucks- 
digital-network ). The Network, in partnership with Yahoo!, 
features free premium online content, such as news, enter-
tainment, business, health, and even local neighborhood 
information channels. In 2014, Starbucks switched to Google 
Wi-Fi, instead of AT&T, to give their customers faster Wi-Fi 
and network speeds.  
 The Results 
 Starbucks turned sales around by effectively integrating the 
digital and the physical worlds. In 2010, its operating income 
almost tripled ($1.437 billion versus $560 million in 2009) 
and so did its stock price. In addition, earnings doubled from 
2010 to 2013. In 2013, the operating income reached $2.68 
billion. Sales are lifting due to digital and social media pro-
motions (see York  2010 ). 
 The company’s social media initiatives are widely recog-
nized. In 2012, Starbucks was listed by  Fortune Magazine as 
one of the top ten social media stars (per  archive.fortune.
com/galleries/2012/fortune/1205/gallery.500-social- 
media.fortune/5.html ), and in 2008, it was awarded the 
2008 Groundswell Award by Forrester Research. Starbucks 
attributes its success to ten philosophical precepts that drive 
its social media efforts (see Belicove  2010 ).

1.1 
 SOCIAL COMPUTING AND THE SOCIAL 
WEB 
 The ﬁ rst generation of e-commerce (EC) involved mainly 
e-trading, e-services, and corporate-sponsored collaboration. 
We are now in the middle of the seconds generation of EC, 
which includes what we call  social commerce . It is based on 
the emergence of social computing and on a set of tools, mar-
ketplaces, infrastructure, and support theories, all of which 
are socially-oriented (see Meeker and Wu  2013 ). 
 In this chapter, you will discover the importance of social 
commerce to customers, retailers, and other organizations. 
 Social Computing 
 Social computing is a type of computing that includes an inter-
action of computers and social behavior. It is performed with a 
set of social media tools that includes blogs, wikis, social net-
work services (see Chap.   2 ), and social marketplaces. For 
details, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_computing . 
 In social computing, individuals produce information, which 
is available to all, usually for free. For an interesting study about 
social computing, see Ericson ( 2011 ). Many universities and 
corporations (e.g., IBM, Microsoft, Intel, HP and Carnegie 
Mellon University) have centers for social computing.  
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 The opening case illustrates how a large company uses 
both an enterprise and a public social network. In addi-
tion, the company uses social media platforms and 
Web 2.0 tools to connect and build relationships with 
its customers for advertising and customer service. At 
the same time, a central activity is to involve customers 
in improving the company’s operations by soliciting 
and discussing ideas. It is a large “electronic sugges-
tion box,” but it is visible to everyone using the com-
pany’s in-house enterprise social network. The major 
objective is to increase the ﬂ ow of visitors to the physi-
cal stores as well as to the online sites. Using special 
promotions and rewards, Starbucks has attracted a 
record number of visitors, considerably improving its 
revenue and proﬁ ts. 
 In this chapter, we cover the essentials of social 
commerce and describe the content of this book. 
1.1 Social Computing and the Social Web

6
 The Social Web 
 According to Appelquist et al. ( 2010 ), the term  Social Web “is 
a set of social relationships that link together people over the 
[World Wide] Web.” For details, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Social_web . The Social Web is quickly changing work, enter-
tainment, learning, and human interactions. According to

htm , the Social Web, is “the seconds generation of the World 
Wide Web which focuses heavily on user- generated content, 
communities, networking and social interaction.” 
 Welcome to the Social Web Revolution 
 Social computing interrelates with social consumers. Many 
experts have found that the Social Web is transforming peo-
ple’s individual and group behaviors as well as the power 
structure in corporations and marketplaces. This change is 
very rapid and signiﬁ cant, so we can classify it as a  revolution . 
For an overview of this revolution, read Fraser and Dutta 
( 2008 ) and watch the video titled “Social Media Revolution” 
(4:22 minutes) at  youtube.com/watch?v=sIFYPQjYhv8 . 
For a description of this change, see Amerland ( 2011 ). The 
major social network that is currently changing the world 
and business is Facebook.  
 F-Commerce 
 A major force in the Social Web revolution is Facebook, 
which, in late 2014, had over 1.35 billion monthly active users 
worldwide. Facebook is considered the “king” of social net-
works and the implementer of many commercial innovations 
what is known as F-commerce (see Shih  2011 ; Kirkpatrick 
 2010 , and  facebook.com/commerce ). For additional details, 
see  webopedia.com/TERM/F/f-commerce.html .  
 Some Interesting Statistics About the Social 
Web and Social Media 
 There are many sources of statistics about social commerce 
and media. A good place to start is with the “100 Fascinating 
Social Media Statistics and Figures From 2012” posted by 
Honigman on  Hufﬁ ngton Post , and corresponding info-
graphic, for 2013 (with recapping statistics from 2012) at 
( digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-social-media-statis-
tics-for- 2013  ). For social media and video statistics for 
2014, watch the video at  youtube.com/watch?=QfVVfB_
UHeA . See also Pant ( 2013 ). Note: These statistics are 
dynamic, changing with time. 
 The following examples were compiled from  bazaarvoice.
com/research-and-insight/social-commerce- statistics  and 
 pewinternet.org/2013/12/30/social-media-update-2013 . 
•  It was predicted that Internet use will quadruple in 
size from 2011 to 2015 (Goldman  2011 ), with much 
of the expected growth attributed to  social network-
ing activities . 
•  Since March 2010, there have been more Internet 
visits to Facebook than to Google.  
•   As of December 2014, Facebook hosts pages for 
over 30 million businesses, and has more than 1.5 
million advertisers (per  techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/
facebook-usage-time ).  
•  The ﬁ rst ‘Funny or Die’ comedy user-generated 
video, “The Landlord,” had 70 million viewers in its 
ﬁ rst 6 months. 
•   In March 2011, a teenager from New South Wales 
had to cancel her 16th birthday party after she 
posted an invitation on her Facebook page, intend-
ing to invite people in her class only. The invita-
tion went viral and close to 200,000 people 
replied that they were attending, prompting her to 
cancel the party. (See  news.com.au/national/
chatswood-girl- cancels-facebook-party-after-
20000-said- they-would-attend/story-e6frfkwi-
1226021517747 ).  
•  The Internet start-up Groupon, a leader in daily 
deals social shopping, had annual revenues of $500 
million in its seconds year of operations. This 
prompted Google to offer $5.4 billion to acquire the 
site in October 2010. Groupon rejected the offer 
and went public with an IPO in 2012 (see opening 
case to Chap.   6  ). 
•  Among the Y generation, 96 % have joined a social 
network. 
•  Of the 77 % of American adults who surf the 
Internet, more than 67 % are members of social net-
works. The time spent social networking by Internet 
surfers is growing rapidly. According to comScore 
Media Metrix, in 2013, the world spent more than 
120 billion minutes using social networks and blogs 
each month, which totaled 24 % of all the time 
spent online. These numbers are growing over time. 
•   In July 2014, over 645 million active users  worldwide 
were on Twitter (more than 255 MAUs), sending 
about 500 million tweets every day  ( statisticbrain.

1.2 
 FUNDAMENTALS OF WEB 2.0 
AND SOCIAL MEDIA  
 The Social Web is based on the concept of Web 2.0. These 
two terms are often used interchangeably, although some 
experts deﬁ ne them differently. 
 What Is Web 2.0? 
 O’Reilly Media introduced the term  Web 2.0 in 2004. 
O’Reilly viewed this term as describing a seconds genera-
tion of Internet-based tools and services. Some properties 
cited by O’Reilly were: user-generated content, online col-
laboration and information, and sharing data interactively. 
For comprehensive coverage, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Web_2.0 and McDonald ( 2010 ). In 2006, O’Reilly updated 
his deﬁ nition of Web 2.0. 
 Note that the term is deﬁ ned in several ways. 
 O’Reilly ( 2006 ) expanded and clariﬁ ed his ‘What is Web 
2.0’ article (O’Reilly  2005 ), dividing Web 2.0 into the fol-
lowing four levels (“a hierarchy of ‘Web 2.0-ness’”): 
 Karakas ( 2009 ) categorizes Web 2.0 into ﬁ ve shifts, which 
deﬁ ne the new global landscape of business, technology, and 
innovation: “a) creativity, b) connectivity, c) collaboration, 
d) convergence, and e) community….” 
 The major characteristics and tools of Web 2.0 are pre-
sented in Chap.   2 and the applications are described in most 
of the other chapters. Web 2.0 is considered a platform for 
running social media. For a summary of Web 2.0 deﬁ nitions, 
explanations, and applications, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Web_2.0 . 
 1.  Level 3 applications, the most ‘Web 2.0’ oriented, 
exist only on the Internet, deriving their effec-
tiveness from (interpersonal) connections and 
from the network effects that Web 2.0 makes pos-
sible, are growing in effectiveness as people 
make more use of them. O’Reilly cited eBay, 
Craigslist, 
Wikipedia, 
Delicious, 
Skype, 
Dodgeball, and Google AdSense as examples of 
level 3 applications.  
 2.  Level 2 applications can operate ofﬂ ine but gain 
advantages from going online. O’Reilly cited 
Flickr, as an example, which beneﬁ ts from its 
shared photo database and from its community- 
generated tag database. 
 3.  Level 1 applications operate ofﬂ ine but gain fea-
tures online. O’Reilly cited examples such as 
spreadsheets, and iTunes (because of its music 
store). 
 4.  Level 0 applications work as well ofﬂ ine as they do 
online. O’Reilly gave the examples of Google 
Maps, Yahoo! Local, and MapQuest. 
depending on the source consulted (see, e.g., Craig 
Smith’s “By the Numbers” post [last updated 
December 21, 2014] at  expandedramblings.com/
index.php/march-2013-by-the-numbers-a-few-
amazing-twitter-stats/#.U9FtuvldWSo ; not all of 
Twitter’s registered users use the service with any 
consistency; see  venturebeat.com/2013/09/16/
how-twitter-plans-to-make-its-750m-users-like- 
its-250m-real-users ).  
•  Before making a purchase, about 90 % of customers 
conduct research online after they get recommenda-
tions from family or friends (July 2014).  
•  30 % of big companies offer customer service on 
Twitter (per Dougherty  2013 ). 
•  Over 72 % of adult Internet users in the U.S. use 
Facebook at least once a month (per  marketingpil-
grim.com/2014/03/google-plus-cant-beat-
facebook- but-can-it-win-seconds-place.html ). 
Again, this data can ﬂ uctuate depending on the source.  
•  Microsoft paid $250 million for a 1.6 % ownership 
of Facebook in 2011. Many people thought that the 
price paid was too high. However, based on its stock 
price in July 2014, the valuation of Facebook was 
estimated to be $180 billion, making Microsoft’s 
investment worth $2.6 billion, an ROI of over 
1,000 % in 3 years—not bad!  
1.2 Fundamentals of Web 2.0 and Social Media

 What Is Social Media? 
 Many people equate the terms Web 2.0 and social media and 
use them interchangeably; however, a deeper understanding 
of the differences helps improve academic and practical 
research and corporate implementation strategies. While 
social media uses Web 2.0 and social computing tools and 
technologies, the social media concept includes the  philoso-
phy of connected people, the interactions among them, the 
social support provided, the digital content, and other prop-
erties that contribute to successful applications. In essence, it 
is a product of the  social economy (see Chui et al.  2012 ). 
 Social media can be deﬁ ned as online text, image, audio, 
and video content created by people using Web 2.0 platforms 
and tools for social interactions and conversations, mainly to 
share opinions, experiences, insights, and perceptions. They 
also generate content. The key is that  users , in addition to orga-
nizations, generate, control, use, and manage content, often at 
little or no cost. Social media “is the collective of online com-
munications channels dedicated to community- based input, 
interaction, content-sharing and collaboration. Websites and 
applications dedicated to forums, microblogging, social net-
working, social bookmarking, social curation, and wikis are 
among the different types of social media” (per  whatis.techtar-
get.com/deﬁ nition/social-media , which also offers examples). 
 Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2010 ) deﬁ ne social media as “a 
group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideologi-
cal and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow 
the creation and exchange of user-generated content.” For deﬁ -
nitions, examples, and infographics, see  boundless.com/mar-

of social media. For a 2013 infographic by Altimeter, see  slide-
share.net/Altimeter/infographic-29122697 . For comprehen-

 youtube.com/watch?v=zxpa4dNVd3c . New versions of both 
videos are created annually. 
 Social media/Web 2.0 are key drivers of social commerce.

 SOCIAL COMMERCE: DEFINITIONS 
AND EVOLUTION 
 As it is a new ﬁ eld that involves several academic and profes-
sional disciplines, there is no agreed-upon deﬁ nition or 
description of the content and boundaries of the social com-
merce area. The following are some working deﬁ nitions. 
 Deﬁ nitions and Characteristics 
 Social commerce (SC) refers to e-commerce transactions 
delivered via social media. (For a primer on e-commerce, see 
Online Appendix A.) Some consider social commerce to be a 
subset of e-commerce. More speciﬁ cally, it is a combination 
of e-commerce, e-marketing (for a primer on e- marketing, 
see Online Appendix B), the supporting technologies, and 
social media content. This deﬁ nition is illustrated in Fig.  1.1 . 
The ﬁ gure shows that social commerce is created from the 
integration of e-commerce and e-marketing using Web 2.0/
social media applications. The integration is supported by 
theories such as social capital, social psychology, consumer 
behavior, and online collaboration, resulting in a set of useful 
applications that drive social commerce.
 The social commerce ﬁ eld is growing rapidly; from 2011 
to 2015, it was projected to rise to $30 billion in revenues, 
according to Booz & Co. (reported by Cuccureddu  2011 ). 
For the impact of the technology, see ShopSocially ( 2013 ). 
The magnitude of the ﬁ eld can be seen in the statistics and 
infographic provided by Bennett ( 2013 ). For other interest-
ing social commerce statistics, see  bazaarvoice.com/
research-and-insight/social-commerce-statistics . 
 Wang and Zhang ( 2012 ) provide a list of 11 deﬁ nitions, 
including that of Stephen and Toubia ( 2010 ), who deﬁ ne SC 
as “a form of Internet-based ‘social media’ that allow[s] peo-
ple to participate actively in the marketing and selling of 
products and services in online marketplaces and communi-
ties.” They distinguish  social shopping that connects cus-
tomers, from  social commerce that connects sellers. Dennison 
et al. ( 2009 ) provide an IBM deﬁ nition: “…social commerce 
is [the concept of]  word of mouth , applied to e-commerce.” 
(Emphasis added.) Marsden ( 2011 ) collected 24 different 
deﬁ nitions of SC that include several of SC’s properties 
(such as word of mouth, trusted advice, and buying with the 
opinions and assistance of friends). 
1 Introduction to Social Commerce

 For additional discussion, see  bazaarvoice.com/research-
and-insight/social-commerce-statistics  and Baekdal ( 2011 ). 
Note that social business is about a large collection of tools 
that need to be assembled in the right way and tied to under-
lying business processes and strategies (Greengard  2014 ). 
 Social Commerce and Social Business 
 The term social commerce is frequently confused with the 
term  social business . The problem is that there are several 
deﬁ nitions and explanations of social business. Here are 
four: 
 1) Social Commerce Is the Same as Social Business 
 The two terms are often used interchangeably. 
 2) The Business That Addresses a Social Problem 
 The term social business was ﬁ rst deﬁ ned by Nobel Peace 
Prize Laureate Prof. Muhammad Yunus. He described the 
framework of social business as being based on seven princi-
ples (see  muhammadyunus.org/index.php/social- business  ). 
According to Yunus, “social business is a non-loss, non-divi-
dend company dedicated entirely to achieve a certain goal” 
(per 
 forbes.com/2010/06/15/forbes-india- muhammad-
yunus-social-business-opinions-ideas- 10-yunus.html ) and 
should be self-sustainable (attempting to avert losses).  
 3) IBM’s Deﬁ nition 
 Any business that embraces networks of people to create 
business value (see description in Sect.  1.5 ; for a comprehen-
sive discussion, see the IBM White Paper titled ‘The Social 
Business’ at  ibm.com/smarterplanet/global/ﬁ les/us__en_
us__socialbusiness__epw14008usen.pdf ). 
 4) Our Working Deﬁ nition 
 We deﬁ ne social business as any business that uses social 
media extensively in most or all of its operations. Such busi-
nesses also promote the social dimension in their operation. 
Many companies are transforming themselves to become 
social businesses. According to this deﬁ nition, social com-
merce can be viewed as a subset of social business. Namely, 
a company that conducts extensive social commerce can be 
labelled a social business. This deﬁ nition is close to that of 
Enterprise 2.0, which is presented later in this chapter and in 
Chap.   8 . 
 For other working deﬁ nitions of social business, see  soci-
alenterprisecanada.ca/learn/nav/whatisasocialenter-
prise.html . 
 The Evolution of Social Commerce 
 In Fig.  1.1 , we illustrated the essential idea of social com-
merce. Let us look at this idea in more detail. 
 Social commerce emerged from the integration of several 
ﬁ elds, which are shown in Fig.  1.2 . For example, Marsden 
and Chaney ( 2013 ) show how social media contributes to 
sales, making it a social commerce application. Spenser et al. 
( 2013 ) describe how social commerce increases sales and 
brand reach.
 The development of Web 2.0 technologies comes with 
social computing. With these technologies came commercial 
applications, which included activities in social networks 
and the use of social software such as blogs and wikis. A 
major driver of SC is the globalization of business. This 
prompted the  need for collaboration of employees, business 
partners, and customers. Web 2.0 applications created an 
efﬁ cient and effective platform for such collaboration. 
 The development and rapid growth of mobile comput-
ing and smartphones has also facilitated social com-
merce. Mobile commerce is the basis for SC models such 
as location- based applications, virtual communities, vir-
tual worlds, and consumer/company networking. Social 
commerce also relies on communication and collabora-
tion theories. 
 A major emphasis of SC is its marketing orientation. 
Traditional marketing activities were applied to Internet 
marketing in the mid-1990s, when companies began build-
ing websites and using e-mail only to advertise their prod-
ucts for sale ofﬂ ine. As the Web developed, marketers applied 
the Internet to facilitate e-commerce  transactions . Until that 
point, marketers controlled brand messages and continued 
their advertising and other communication monologues to 
customers and potential buyers (prospects). With the emer-
gence of social media, marketing communication changed to 
a dialog with Internet users, and many marketing strategies 
evolved or completely transformed to support social 
commerce.

 Note: The original term s ocial marketing referred to the 
application of marketing strategies and tactics to social 
causes, such as the American Heart Association. This concept 
was not related to marketing activities in social media. Today, 
however, many practitioners and academicians use the term 
 social marketing to describe  social media marketing . 
 Marketing, technology, consumer, and management evo-
lutions paved the way for SC, just as they prompted 
e- commerce development. The major differences between 
social commerce and e-commerce are illustrated in Table  1.1 . 
Huang and Benyoucef ( 2013 ) describe the evolution to SC 
by looking at design features.

stones in the development of social commerce, see  socialtimes.

the development of social business, see Solis and Li ( 2013 ).

 The landscape of social commerce is multidisciplinary (see 
Marsden (2009)) “Simple Deﬁ nition of Social Commerce 
With Word Cloud and Deﬁ nitive Deﬁ nition List. [Updated

ally expressed as  social media marketing activities. However, 
several other areas are emerging in the ﬁ eld, especially activ-
ities within organizations that are referred to as  social enter-
prise or Enterprise 2.0 . Liang and Turban ( 2011 /2012) 
illustrate the social commerce landscape in Fig.  1.3 . 
Discussions of the other activities of the ﬁ gure are provided 
throughout the book. Note that, the term  non-Internet refers 
to other electronic systems, such as intranets and private 
networks.

keting facilitates social commerce, increases brand exposure, 
repairs brand reputation damages in social media, and fosters 
long-term customer relationships, among other things. 
 Today, integrated marketing communications is the appli-
cation of the traditional marketing tools in innovative ways, 
integrating them with social media, such as in viral market-
ing. (See Chaps.   4  and   5 of this book for more details.) For 
additional information and a free toolkit titled “Social Media 
Marketing 101,” see  act-on.com/resources/social-media-
marketing-toolkit . 
 The emergence of Web 2.0 allows marketers to connect 
directly with increasingly smaller target markets, including a 
single individual. For example, savvy marketers now build 
brands and respond to questions and complaints on social net-
works instead of (or in addition to) sending press releases to 
traditional journalists. They can also build social interactions 
with customers and conduct market research. (For ﬁ ve ways 
for managing feedback and complaints on social media, see 
 surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2014/03/11/feedback- 
complaints-social-media/ .) The various topics of social 
media marketing communication are described in Chaps.   4 –  7 , 
by Singh and Diamond ( 2012 ), and through various e-books at 
 salesforcemarketingcloud.com/resources/ebooks . For an 
infographic, see Wood ( 2014 ). For a description of visual 
social marketing, see Neher ( 2014 ). For marketing tips, see 
McCarthy ( 2013 ) and Walker ( 2014 ). Finally, for the future of 
social media marketing, watch “The Future of Social Media 
Marketing w/ Gary Vaynerchuk” (28:55 minutes) at  youtube.

 Examples of Social Commerce Applications 
in Marketing 
 Marketing-related applications in public social network sites 
include the following examples: 
 Social commerce also occurs in companies’ internal (pri-
vate) social networks, which are known as  enterprise social 
networks . In such a case, we refer to the networks as ‘social 
enterprise’ or ‘Enterprise 2.0.’ 
 Enterprise 2.0 
 The seconds major type of social commerce is  Enterprise 2.0 
(see Fig.  1.3 , p. 11), which is used by an increasing number 
of companies to conduct several social media and social 
commerce activities inside the enterprise (e.g., idea genera-
tion, problem solving, joint design, and recruiting). 
 There are several deﬁ nitions of  Enterprise 2.0. The 
term “Enterprise 2.0” was ﬁ rst coined by McAfee ( 2006 ). 
The initial deﬁ nition connected the term to Web 2.0 and 
collaboration. McAfee revised his deﬁ nition several 
times. His reﬁ ned deﬁ nition (“Enterprise 2.0, Version 
2.0”), as posted on his blog, is “…the use of  emergent 
social software platforms within companies ,  or between 
companies and their partners or customers ” (per 
 a n d re w m c a f e e . o rg / 2 0 0 6 / 0 5 / e n t e rp r i s e _ 2 0 _ 
version_20 ); see also McAfee ( 2009 ). McAfee further 
revised his deﬁ nition to include the “why” of Electronic 
Commerce 2.0 to “… the use of emergent social software 
platforms by organizations in pursuit of their goals ” 
[emphasis 
added] 
(per 
 andrewmcafee.org/2009/08/
deﬁ ning- moment/ ; see also McAfee  2009 ). A similar def-
inition says that Enterprise 2.0 is a social software plat-
form that helps employees, customers and partners to 
share, collaborate, innovate, and communicate. 
 Note: For more deﬁ nitions and concepts of Enterprise 2.0 
technology, see the slide presentation titled “What is Enterprise 
2.0?” at  slideshare.net/norwiz/what-is- enterprise- 20  . For 
other deﬁ nitions, see  erp.asia/enterprise2.asp  and  whatis.

•   In March 2010, Dell claimed that it made $6.5 mil-
lion by selling computers on Twitter since 2007 
(see Nutley  2010 ). 
•   In 2013, Disney allowed people to purchase tickets 
on Facebook (without leaving the social network).  
•  Mountain Dew attracts video game lovers and 
sports enthusiasts via “Dewmocracy” contests. The 
company also entices the most dedicated commu-
nity members to contribute ideas. The company 
uses Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to encourage 
consumers with common interests to participate in 
the contests. 
•  Levi’s enabled consumers on Facebook to place 
orders based on what their friends might like. There 
was also a video “Social Shopping Comes to Levi’s” 
to educate consumers on how to use Facebook to 
shop for Levi’s with the preference of their friends 
at  youtube.com/watch?v=Ed5vJeaEuzA . This 
service was discontinued. 
•  Wendy’s used Facebook and Twitter to post videos they 
created that are so funny, customers must talk about 
them. (See  forbes.com/sites/caroltice/2013/10/28/

2.0 conferences are held every year, some providing addi-
tional deﬁ nitions that may even change with time (e.g., see 
 e2conf.com ). For example, e2conf.com provided a white 
paper (see Enterprise 2.0 Conference 2009) in which it com-
pared Enterprise 2.0 to Enterprise 1.0, listing the following as 
some of the characteristics of Enterprise 2.0: ease of informa-
tion ﬂ ow, agility, ﬂ exibility, user-driven technology, bottom 
up communication, global teams, fuzzy boundaries, transpar-
ency, folksonomies (rather than taxonomies), open standards, 
and on-demand (rather than scheduled) activities. In addition, 
important characteristics are ﬂ at organizations (rather than 
hierarchical) and short time-to-market cycles. 
 The beneﬁ ts of Enterprise 2.0 (social enterprise) are simi-
lar to those of social commerce (see Sect.  1.5 ). 
 For an extensive slide presentation titled “What Is 
Enterprise 
2.0?,” 
see 
 slideshare.net/norwiz/what-is- 
enterprise- 20  . Enterprise 2.0 can be viewed as being the 
intersection of social media, e-marketing, social networks, 
and e-collaboration (see Fig.  1.4 ).
 For more on Enterprise 2.0, see Chap.   8 and Chui et al. 
( 2013 ). 
 Simply put, Enterprise 2.0 means using Web 2.0 tools in 
the workplace. For a comprehensive discussion of the state 
of Enterprise 2.0, with a history and infographics, see 
Hinchcliffe ( 2007 ).

 THE BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS 
OF SOCIAL COMMERCE 
 According to many practitioners and researchers, social 
commerce is making signiﬁ cant impacts on organizations 
and industries (e.g., ShopSocially  2013 ). For example, a 
major impact has been seen in the fashion industry (e.g., see 
Little  2013 ). 
 Several surveys have conﬁ rmed that social commerce 
results in signiﬁ cant monetary and strategic beneﬁ ts to busi-
nesses (e.g., Leggatt  2010 ). See also success stories at IBM 
( 2011b ) and 67 case studies that prove social media ROI at 
 barnraisersllc.com/2010/10/33-case-studies-prove-social- 
media-roi . See also Butlion ( 2013 ). 
 SC beneﬁ ts are organized here in three categories: bene-
ﬁ ts to customers, beneﬁ ts to retailers, and beneﬁ ts to other 
types of enterprises. 
 Fig. 1.4   The foundation of Enterprise 2.0 
•  Dell, Starbucks (see opening case), IBM, and many 
other companies solicit ideas from large groups of 
employees, customers, and business partners on 
how to improve their business operations (e.g., 
Dell’s IdeaStorm site). 
•  More than 50 % of medium and large corporations 
use LinkedIn and Facebook to announce available 
positions and to ﬁ nd potential employees. 
•  Best Buy provides state-of-the-art customer service 
via Twitter. They also have an idea generation 
forum on their website called “Best Buy Unboxed.” 
 
1.5 The Beneﬁ ts and Limitations  of Social Commerce

14
 Beneﬁ ts to Customers 
 The success of social commerce depends mostly on its ben-
eﬁ ts to customers. The major beneﬁ ts appear in the following 
list: 
 Beneﬁ ts to Retailers 
 Retailers are also major benefactors of social commerce. For 
example, Leggatt ( 2010 ) reported that over 40 % of busi-
nesses globally ﬁ nd new customers via social networks (in 
2015, the ﬁ gure is higher). In addition, over 27 % of compa-
nies invest in social networking in order to acquire and retain 
customers. 
 Retailers may beneﬁ t from social commerce in the fol-
lowing ways: 
 Example 
 Popular ﬁ rearms manufacturer Beretta Inc. increased its rev-
enue in 2013 by 15 % by introducing social commerce into 
its e-commerce store, using ShopSocially’s SC platform. For 
details, see  digitaljournal.com/pr/1655392 . 
 For a comprehensive presentation of social commerce 
beneﬁ ts and impacts on retailing, see Dennison et al. ( 2009 ). 
 Beneﬁ ts to Other Types of Enterprises 
 In addition to increased sales and revenue, enterprises can 
beneﬁ t from social commerce in several ways (see Chap.   8 ): 
•  It is easy to get recommendations from friends and 
other customers (e.g., via Twitter, in social media 
discussion groups, and on product review sites). 
Recommendations result in more conﬁ dence and 
trust, helping customers decide about purchasing 
products and services. 
•  Customers are exposed to special deals (e.g., via 
Groupon and messages from friends on Facebook) 
for large savings. 
•  Purchases can be matched with speciﬁ c needs, 
wants, tastes, and wishes of customers (e.g., see the 
Netﬂ ix case in Chap.   3 ); this increases satisfaction 
and reduces product selection decision time.  
•  It is easy for customers to use the social commerce 
technology. 
•  Social commerce ﬁ ts the mobile device lifestyle 
well. 
•  Increased trust of customers in vendors (via closer 
relationships). 
•  Social commerce allows customers to help other 
customers (social support). 
•  Customers can get better customer service from 
vendors (see Chap.   7 ). 
•  Customers can make new friends (e.g., for travel) 
and socialize online. 
•  Customers can get rich social context and relevancy 
during their purchase decision-making process.  
•  Customers can connect with individuals and busi-
nesses who otherwise are inaccessible to them. 
•  Consumers can provide feedback on market commu-
nication strategy and on product (service) design.  
•  Vendors get free word-of-mouth marketing (see 
Chaps.   3 and   4 ). 
•  Increased website trafﬁ c (recall the Starbucks open-
ing case), which increases revenue and sales. 
•  Increased sales when social inﬂ uence methods (see 
Chap.   3 ) are used. 
•  Conduct faster and less costly recruitment with 
larger reach to a large number of candidates. 
•  Reduce costs via innovative methods such as using 
the collective intelligence of employees and busi-
ness partners (see crowdsourcing, Chap.   8 ). 
•  Foster better external relationships; for example, 
with partners and channel distribution members.  
•  Increase collaboration and improve communication 
within the enterprise and with business partners (e.g., 
by using blogs, microblogs, wikis; see McAfee  2009 ). 
•  Foster better internal relationships (e.g., by increas-
ing employee productivity and satisfaction).  
•  Give free advice to small enterprises from other 
enterprises and by experts (e.g., via LinkedIn 
groups). 
•  Understand that it is usually not expensive to install 
and operate SC systems. 
•  Locate experts quickly, both internally and exter-
nally, whenever needed (e.g., see  guru.com ). 
•  Conduct market research quickly and inexpensively 
and get feedback from customers, employees, and 
business partners (see Chap.   10 ). 
1 Introduction to Social Commerce

15
 The potential beneﬁ ts in the previous list may result in: 
increasing productivity and value (Chui et al.  2012 ), provid-
ing a  strategic advantage (Bauer  2011 ), and encouraging 
companies to at least experiment with social commerce. 
Successful applications are introduced in Chaps.   4  – 8 , and a 
comprehensive list is available on Bazaarvoice. Note that the 
use of social media and commerce is turning out to be a 
global phenomenon (e.g. see Ran  2012 ). 
 The Social Business: An IBM Approach 
 The previously noted beneﬁ ts to enterprises make it desir-
able for enterprises to transform themselves to what IBM 
calls a  social business . A  social business is “a business [that] 
embraces networks of people to create business value” (IBM 
 2011a ). Many consider this term equivalent to social com-
merce and use the two interchangeably. However, IBM is 
more concerned with the structure and operations of enter-
prises. IBM and many other companies (notably Intel) are 
becoming social businesses. (For how IBM evolved into a 
social business, see Traudt and Vancil  2011 .) IBM ( 2011b ) 
sees the following three goals for social businesses: 
 In addition, IBM strategically integrates social media into 
various business processes (e.g., procurement) and is devel-
oping an organizational culture to support the integration 
process for delivering rapid and impressive outcomes. For 
details, see IBM ( 2011a ) and IBM Social Business ( ibm.
com/social-business/us/en/solutions.html ). 
 Examples of Social Business Implementation 
 IBM has developed several social business tools (e.g., 
 SmartCloud Engage ) which are used in many organizations. 
For an example of how Wakefern Foods uses IBM’s social 
business tools in their workforce, watch the 2013 video 
(2:44 minutes) at  youtube.com/watch?v=bt3_hGaUjX8 . 
 New or Improved Business Models 
 A  business model describes the method (or plan) imple-
mented by a company to meet the customer’s needs, and by 
which a company generates revenue and creates value. Note 
that, the January–February 2011 issue of  Harvard Business 
Review is dedicated to business model innovations (ﬁ ve 
articles), including several topics related to social com-
merce. For a presentation of the models’ structure and a list 
of e-commerce models, see Online Primer A. For a compre-
hensive business model presentation titled “What is a 
Business Model?” see  slideshare.net/Alex.Osterwalder/
what-is-a-business-model . 
 Social commerce provides innovative e-commerce busi-
ness models. Some are new, while others are improvements 
of regular EC models (e.g., group buying). A large number of 
 1.  Enable an effective workforce . Functional depart-
ments can increase overall employee productivity 
and job satisfaction through improved knowledge 
capture, expertise location, and collaboration. 
Travel, training, and teleconferencing expenses can 
be reduced. In addition, better and faster recruit-
ment can be done inexpensively. 
•  Increase market share and margins (see survey 
results in Bughin and Chui  2010 ). 
•  Build brands through conversations and social 
media promotions.  
•   Create small customer segments for reaching very small 
markets with brand offerings at a low cost and price.  
•  Manage company and brand reputations online. 
•  Build brand communities for positive word-of-
mouth online.  
•  Enhance customer service and support. 
•  Increase trafﬁ c and sales at the company website 
and at the physical stores. 
•  Facilitate market research by monitoring conversa-
tions online.  
•  Increase company and brand rankings on search 
engine results pages. 
 2.  Accelerate innovation.  Product research and 
development teams can invoke and accelerate idea 
generation, information, discovery, and strategy 
sharing by employees. Companies can gather 
feedback and ideas from key customers and busi-
ness partners.  
 3.  Deepen customer relationships. With easy and fast 
access to content and expertise, customer service 
representatives can work faster and more efﬁ ciently 
and provide higher-quality service. Marketing and 
sales teams can have more time to spend with cus-
tomers and concentrate on customer-focused initia-
tives, thus, strengthening relationships with 
customers. 
1.5 The Beneﬁ ts and Limitations  of Social Commerce

16
SC models are in the area of social shopping, as described in 
Chap.   6 . Several other new models are in the area of enter-
prise commerce (Chap.   8  ). Here are some brief examples:
•  Shopping business models include items such as widgets 
and “buy now” buttons on social media sites.  
•   Online software agents that connect buyers and sellers, 
such as when TripAdvisor refers travelers to providers of 
travel services. 
•  Content sponsorship—selling advertising on a site that 
supports content development (e.g., YouTube). 
•   Crowdsourcing models that allow companies to better 
design their products or logos by involving their 
customers. 
•   Sales promotions conducted in social networks that drive 
trafﬁ c to the company’s site, such as contests, discounts, 
and offering free music and software to download.  
•   Recruiting in social networks, as exempliﬁ ed by LinkedIn 
and Facebook job markets (Chap.   8 ). 
•  Collaboration models that are facilitated by blogs, wikis, 
and crowdsourcing (see examples in Chap.   8 ). 
 Many start-ups have invented these and other business 
models. For example, some companies offer person-to- 
person (P2P) services that send broadcast-quality videos 
over the Internet (see Chap.   9 ). Webkinz ( webkinz.com ) cre-
ated a huge business around a virtual pet world for kids, and 
IZEA Inc. ( izea.com ), the pioneer of Social Sponsorship, 
created a marketplace for connecting social media creators 
of content (e.g., bloggers) with the world’s biggest brands. 
 Several of these start-up companies are so prosperous that 
they went public on stock markets. Well-known companies 
are Pandora, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp, Trip Advisor and 
Zillow. 
 The potential for proﬁ table social business models is very 
large. For example,  wikia.com is using a crowdsourcing 
community in an attempt to develop a superior search mech-
anism. If it can create a successful one, Google may be in 
trouble. For the opportunities for businesses created by social 
commerce, see Moontoast ( 2011 ). For new business models 
in the fashion industry, see Knopf ( 2012 ), and  businessof-
fashion.com . For a discussion on the strategic power of 
social media, see Bauer ( 2011 ). 
 Concerns and Limitations of Conducting 
Social Commerce 
 Although social commerce presents many opportunities for 
organizations, its implementation may involve some poten-
tial risks, and possibly complex issues such as the integration 
of new and existing information systems. Representative risk 
factors are: difﬁ culties in justiﬁ cation of SC initiatives to 
upper management, security and privacy concerns, possibili-
ties of fraud, legal concerns, quality of UGC, and time wast-
ing by employees during work hours. Companies also risk 
loss of control over their brand images and reputations in 
social media conversations and product review sites, which 
can affect product sales. According to the Enterprise 2.0 
Conference ( 2009 ), the major barriers to adoption of 
Enterprise 2.0 are resistance to change, difﬁ culty in measur-
ing ROI, and difﬁ culties of integration with existing IT sys-
tems and security. For details, see Chap.   11  . A 2011 survey, 
“Social Business Shifting Out of First Gear,” reported by 
Burnham ( 2013 ), ranks the top concerns in deployment of 
social business as: (1) security and liability exposures, (2) 
doubts about ability to govern effectively, (3) poor systems 
integration, (4) doubts about ROI/value, and (5) poor organi-
zational technology adoption. We expand on some of these 
issues in Chap.   11  . 
1.6 
 THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING 
SOCIAL COMMERCE AND SUGGESTED 
RESEARCH TOPICS 
 This section of Chap.   1  deals with the process of conducting 
social commerce that drives the content and the structure of 
this book. 
 The Process of Conducting Social Commerce 
 Social commerce can be conducted in different ways, 
depending on the application and circumstances. However, 
some general activities exist in most cases. These activities 
are illustrated in Fig.  1.5 .
 Starting on the left side are the three components illus-
trated earlier in Fig.  1.1 (pg. 9). 
 Next, companies and individual customers become 
engaged in various social media activities and platforms (see 
description in Chaps.   2 and   3 ). 
 Enterprises monitor communication and other activities 
and engagements (sometimes referred to as  listening ). This 
action is done by using monitoring devices. For example, 
Google Alerts or other applications for scanning tweets and 
blogs are used to search for a speciﬁ c company’s name on 
the Web. Monitoring can be done by direct communication 
with consumers, by listening to online conversations, and so 
forth (see more in Chap.   10 ). 
 The collected information, including those portions that 
are visible in the direct communication to consumers, are 
examined via social analysis methods (Chap.   10 ), and are 
used as input for managerial decision making regarding mar-
keting communication (such as advertising, pricing, com-
petitive strategy, product design, or problem identiﬁ cation). 
1 Introduction to Social Commerce

17
Some of these are intended to inﬂ uence consumer purchas-
ing decisions (see social inﬂ uence, Chap.   3 ). Inﬂ uencing 
consumers’ decision making can be done via reviews, rec-
ommendations, and discussions. This inﬂ uence can be 
explained via social and behavioral theories and marketing 
communication models. The non-marketing activities 
include mostly social enterprise activities (such as collabora-
tion, problem solving, or recruitment) and activities in other 
areas such as government, business-to-business, virtual 
worlds, person-to-person, and entertainment. 
 Example: 
 IBM provides several products and platforms to enable 
social media applications and implementation. Such systems 
collect and analyze data and process them to enable predic-
tions, recommendations, and strategy. For details, watch the 
2013 IBM Smarter Commerce video, “Advanced Social 
Analytics Platform” (3:44 minutes), at  youtube.com/
watch?v=AxzqyMx0Mm8 . 
 Note that enterprise activities and applications in other 
areas may include some marketing/advertising actions. All of 
these issues need to be embedded in strategy, justiﬁ cation, and 
planning. Finally, a slew of issues may surface during the 
implementation of social commerce. These range from adop-
tion strategy and software selection to corporate policies. 
Successful implementation depends on the appropriate selec-
tion of social network services and sites. In May 2014, the 
leading B2C social platforms were Facebook, Twitter, 
Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, and others, while 
B2B favored social platforms were LinkedIn, Facebook, 
Twitter, followed by blogging, Google+, YouTube, and others. 
(From  blog.percolate.com/2014/05/b2b-vs-b2c- marketing-
social-media-blurred-lines , referencing Stelzner  2014 .)  
 Illustrative Research Issues 
 As a new discipline, social commerce is gradually attracting 
the attention of researchers worldwide. The number of papers 
delivered in scientiﬁ c conferences and published in profes-
sional journals is increasingly rapidly. In addition, a large 
number of books about conducting social commerce are 
appearing in speciﬁ c social networks, mostly Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest. 
 A comprehensive framework of social commerce was 
proposed by Wang and Zhang ( 2012 ). According to this 
framework, SC research was categorized into people, man-
agement, technology, and information. A historical recount 
of the ﬁ eld, from 2005 to 2011, was conducted according to 
these four categories. Within each category, Wang and Zhang 
( 2012 ) identiﬁ ed application areas (e.g., social shopping, 
business models and so forth). The researchers also provided 
several possible directions for future research. 
 Aral et al. ( 2013 ) developed a framework for research in 
the area of social media and business transformation, refer-
encing the fact that social media is fundamentally changing 
the way we communicate, collaborate, consume, and create. 
 Liang and Turban ( 2011 /2012) developed a research 
framework for social commerce. They presented an organiza-

tion framework with a representative list of topics. The frame-
work includes four major areas: social media marketing, 
enterprise management, technology support and manage-
ment, and organization. Each area is divided into subtopics 
suitable for research (e.g., viral marketing in SC). The frame-
work also includes relevant theories (e.g., social support), 
outcome measures of success, social media tools, and plat-
forms and adaptation of traditional MIS research themes (e.g., 
user behavior). 
 In the remaining chapters of this book, we provide repre-
sentative examples of relevant research issues. 
 Finally, in Online Appendix C to this book, we provide a 
comprehensive list of resources that can be used by both 
researchers and practitioners. 
1.7 
 THE CONTENT AND ORGANIZATION 
OF THE BOOK 
 We end this chapter by providing a visual summary of the 
book’s composition. 
 The book is composed of four major parts that contain 11 
chapters. In addition, there are three online appendices. 
 Figure  1.6 displays the book’s chapters (their titles are 
abbreviated) and the way they are organized in parts.
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
  1.  Social computing and Social Web. This emerging 
computing approach is situated at the intersection of 
technology and social behavior. Social computing is 
done with Web 2.0 tools; when done on the Internet, it is 
referred to as the  Social Web . Its major objectives are 
improved collaboration and social interactions. It is 
based on user-generated content, controlled by users, 
and intended for users. It is also based on social support 
of people to each other and lately it is being used com-
mercially (e.g., for advertising). 
  2.  The Social Web revolution. The emergence of the 
Social Web is considered a revolution due to the speed 
and magnitude of the changes introduced by the technol-
ogy. One measure is the size of many social networks. 
The impacts on work, services, entertainment, 
 collaboration, communication, social interactions, and 
so forth, are signiﬁ cant in many areas, as are the changes 
in the way that many companies treat their employees 
and customers. Marketing, for example, is centered 
around the social customer, and consumers are treated

with social CRM. Social games are attracting many mil-
lions of participants and trust and loyalty is increasing 
rapidly in marketplaces. Finally, many companies are 
transformed into social businesses.  
  3.  The Web 2.0 revolution and social media. Web 2.0 
refers to a new way of using the Web. It is a trend that 
makes use of the Web by people and for people. For 
example, user-created content, the use of social soft-
ware, and the rise of social networking are major charac-
teristics of Web 2.0. Social media implements Web 2.0 
tools for social interactions, conversations, engagement, 
and sharing ideas in many different ways. 
  4.  Social commerce evolution. Social commerce (SC) can 
be viewed as a subset of EC where activities are done in 
social networks and/or by using social media tools. SC 
operates at the intersection of social media, EC, 
e- marketing, and supporting theories from several disci-
plines, including social psychology, marketing, sociol-
ogy, and information technology. SC is able to add value 
to the performance of organizations, while at the same 
time increase the satisfaction and the added value to 
employees and customers. The main activities and con-
tent of social commerce are in the areas of social media 
marketing, social enterprise, and social games and 
entertainment. 
  5.  The content of the social commerce ﬁ eld. Social com-
merce refers to conducting e-commerce in social net-
works and using social media tools, such as blogs. It is a 
comprehensive ﬁ eld comprised mostly of social media 
marketing (advertising, market research, and customer 
service) and social enterprise (problem solving, recruit-
ing, and collaboration). It also includes social entertain-
ment, social games, and crowdsourcing. Social 
commerce is driven by the existence of giant social net-
works, Web 2.0 infrastructure tools, and the emergence 
of social customers. 
  6.  Social media marketing.  This is an umbrella name for 
the major marketing activities conducted via social net-
working. Most notable are marketing communication 
and advertising, social shopping, market research, and 
social CRM. It is an integrated, multifaceted marketing 
and advertising practice. 
  7.  Enterprise 2.0. Using social media technologies and 
Web 2.0 tools within an organization is called  Enterprise 
2.0, or  social enterprise . It is based upon social media 
activities, such as publishing, sharing, collaborating, and 
creating knowledge. The major practical applications 
are: social media assist in recruitment, idea generation 
via crowdsourcing, and collaboration via blogs, wikis, 
and other Web 2.0 tools. 
  8.  Beneﬁ ts and limitations of social commerce. A large 
number of beneﬁ ts are available for customers, retailers, 
and other businesses. Customers can get better prices and 
customer service, and also receive social support (e.g., 
product recommendations) from friends. Users can meet 
new people and establish new contacts. Retailers can 
reach more customers, get feedback quickly, improve 
relationships with customers, go global, and use free 
word-of-mouth marketing communication. There are 
also beneﬁ ts to businesses. Businesses can conduct fast 
and inexpensive market research, recruit employees from 
all over the globe, innovate, collaborate, and locate 
experts when needed. Companies can receive help from 
other companies, sometimes at little or no cost. The 
major limitations are the possible invasion of privacy of 
the participants, the difﬁ culty justifying the investment 
in SC, the possibility of poor quality of UGC, and the 
difﬁ culty of integration of SC , EC, and IT.  
  9.  The process of conducting social commerce. The pro-
cess depends upon the application of concern. In 
marketing- related applications, vendors monitor infor-
mation ﬂ ow to and within social networks and attempt to 
structure market communication strategy accordingly 
(e.g., ad campaigns, coupon distribution, special sales). 
In the social enterprise, companies use the wisdom of 
the crowd to solve problems via crowdsourcing and to 
reach potential job seekers via social networking. In 
addition, internal and external collaboration is a by- 
product of the SC process.  
 10.  Research topics in social commerce.  Given that this 
ﬁ eld is new, there are many evolving research opportuni-
ties, yet not much has been done. Some suggestions are 
provided in subsequent chapters.

 OPENING CASE: PINTEREST—AN 
INNOVATIVE SOCIAL COMMERCE 
PLATFORM 
 Pinterest is an innovative fast-growing social bookmarking 
website where users ‘pin’ related images and content on a 
virtual pinboard. The company started in 2010, creating a 
new opportunity for social commerce. (See a guide by 
Leland  2013 , statistics in Smith ( 2014a ), and  pinterest.com/ 
pinnablebiz/pinterest-statistics .) 
 For a free e-book about using Pinterest for business, see 
Georgieva (undated). For infographics, search Google 
Images for ‘Pinterest.’ For Pinterest “facts, stats, and rules,” 
including case studies, see  pinterest.com/wglvsocialmedia/
pinterest-facts-%2B-stats-%2B-rules . 
 The Opportunity 
 Pinterest’s roots relate to social bookmarking images, which 
have been used globally for several years. The company’s 
founders saw the business potential and the success of simi-
lar companies in Brazil and China. Furthermore, Pinterest 
succeeded in attracting initial venture capital to expand the 
business. 
 Tools and Platforms for Social 
Commerce

 The Solution 
 Pinterest is a provider of virtual pinboards that allow users to 
organize and share images found on the Web (referred to as 
pins). The pinned images are organized by topic (theme or cat-
egory). For example, one can collect pictures of sailboats and 
pin them on one pinboard, with appropriate text explanation. 
You can collect decorations for your home on another pin-
board, and you can collect Chinese recipes on a third pinboard. 
Millions of people create pinboards and anyone can search and 
view them (see Engauge  2012 ). People use Pinterest for many 
different reasons. It is an app for saving and organizing images 
and sharing those images with others. Users can add friends to 
their account and can ‘follow’ them. The company’s goal is to 
connect people according to common interests and do it while 
making proﬁ t. For a large number of infographics, search 
Google Images for ‘Pinterest Infographics.’ 
 Having many visitors and a rapid growth rate are neces-
sary, but not sufﬁ cient, for social commerce success. Viable 
business and revenue models are also needed. 
 The Business and Revenue Models 
 Pinterest’s revenue model is based on charging for advertis-
ing. (The company is privately held and it does not have to 
report its revenue to the public.) It looks as though the com-
pany’s current priority is, according to CEO Ben Silbermann, 
“to turn the site into a viable business” (see MacNeil  2014 ). 
To learn more about how the company aims to become a 
viable business, and to read an interview with the CEO, see 
MacNeil ( 2014 ). Nevertheless, many people try to speculate 
about (or suggest) revenue opportunities for the company 
(e.g., see Leland  2013 ), some of which are provided next. In 
May 2014, Pinterest began selling advertising (“promoted 
pins”) to selected marketers. These ads will show up in 
Pinterest’s search and category feeds (see  techcrunch.
com/2014/05/12/pinterest-launches-paid-ads-with-
select-brands-in-form- of-promoted-pins ). In June 2014, 
according to Pinterest’s product manager, Pinterest began 
adding “do it yourself” advertising to Promoted Pins, which 
are available on a cost-per-click basis, allowing businesses 
of all sizes to “promote their Pins to reach more people and 
get visits back to their website” (see Stone  2014 ). Pinterest 
is also adding updated analytics (see  business. pinterest.
com/en/blog/new-tools-businesses ). 
In August 
2014, 
Pinterest expanded the Promoted Pins platform to more 
businesses (see  techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/pinterest-
expands-self-serve-promoted- pins-to-more-businesses ). 
For more about Promoted Pins and how they work, see  ads.

 Yang’s Suggestions 
 Quora Inc. ( quora.com ) posted a question on its website: 
“How does Pinterest generate revenue?” One of the most 
comprehensive answers received was provided by Yang 
( 2012 ) who presented 13  potential  monetization opportuni-
ties in four categories: charging advertisers (e.g., see 
Dembosky  2013 ); charging e-commerce partners; charging 
users; and charging B2B partners. Most of these opportuni-
ties have existed in EC for years (e.g., charging for pre-
mium services, creating an online retail shop, using an 
afﬁ liate program, and building a comprehensive advertis-
ing scheme).  
 Selling Data for Market Research and Analysis 
 Brave ( 2012 ) suggested selling customer data available on 
Pinterest to retailers who can use analytics, including data 
mining (or mining “afﬁ nity data”), to conduct market 
research using this data. Customer data may reveal important 
statistical associations and relationships between consumer 
behavior, content (e.g., product recommendations, personal-
ization, ads), and services and products provided. These 
associations can be used for one-to-one relationships and 
segmentation, as well as for marketing promotions and 
advertisements. Retailers can use  afﬁ nity modeling and anal-
ysis to ascertain relationships so retailers can better under-
stand consumer purchasing behavior. This enables optimal 
marketing  communication strategies . Brave also noted that 
by pinning and repinning on Pinterest, consumers show their 
afﬁ nity for certain themes or for speciﬁ c products. 
 Other Suggestions for Doing Business 
on Pinterest 
 Many consultants offer suggestions about doing business on 
Pinterest:
•  Hemley ( 2012 ) provides 26 different suggestions in an 
A-Z guide (e.g., A = Add a Pinterest “Follow” and/or “Pin 
it” Button; B = Brands and Pinterest; C = Crowdsourcing, 
and so forth). 
•  HubSpot offers a free e-book titled “How to Use 
Pinterest for Business” (see  offers.hubspot.com/how-to-
use- pinterest-for-business ). It includes suggestions 
such as how to create Pinterest business accounts and how 
to drive trafﬁ c and leads to companies’ website using 
Pinterest. 
•  Mitroff ( 2012 ) suggests the approach that Zappos 
Corporation uses. This approach, which is called 
 PinPointing , involves product recommendations based on 
what customers pin. Pinterest may collaborate with 
2 Tools and Platforms for Social Commerce

25
 retailers such as Zappos to jointly create product 
 recommendations. 
•  Green ( 2013 ) suggests that businesses pin and repin. She 
also offers the following: making boards for anything 
(e.g., boards for inbound marketing, social media); 
 pinning images (e.g., photos with text, infographics); and 
ﬁ nding people to follow and getting followers. 
 For more suggestions, see  realbusiness.com/2013/12/

com ; not afﬁ liated with Pinterest) provides a comprehensive 
Pinterest business library with many boards and thousands of 
pins to help businesses market on Pinterest (see  pinterest.
com/pinnablebiz ). For comprehensive coverage, see 
MacNeil ( 2014 ). 
 Using Pinterest for Advertising, Marketing, 
and Other Business Activities 
 Most of the suggestions cited above, as well as suggestions 
by others, concentrate on advertising and marketing opportu-
nities. For comprehensive coverage, see Macarthy ( 2013 ), 
MacNeil ( 2014 ), Cario ( 2013 ), Hayden ( 2012 ), and Miles 
and Lacey ( 2013 ). For how retailers use Pinterest, see Jopson 
and Kuchler ( 2013 ) and Greer ( 2013 ).

Leaning ( 2013 ). 
 Results and Managerial Issues 
 According to ShareThis (as reported by  Business Insider ), as 
of Q3 2013, Pinterest was the fastest growing content- sharing 
platform 
(see 
 businessinsider.com/pinterest-is-fastest- 
growing-content-sharing-platform-2013-11 ). 
As 
of 
September 2014, Instagram is now the fastest growing con-
tent sharing platform (per  socialmediatoday.com/content/
instagram-fastest-growing-social-network-4-brands-
riding- wave  ). Also according to eBizMBA.com (August 
2014 data), Pinterest is the fourth most popular social net-
working site, behind Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn ( ebi-
zmba.com/articles/social-networking-websites ). 
 As of July 2013, the total number of users worldwide is 
70 million ( smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/30-reasons- 
market-business-pinterest-2014-infographic-184545665.
html ). In December 2014, the number topped 70 million. For 
comprehensive 2014 statistics, see Smith ( 2014a ). 
 Similar reports on this amazing growth rate and popular-
ity are provided by comScore and other reporting compa-
nies. This growth attracted over $200 million in venture 
capital in 2012 and 2013 and it has generated many sugges-
tions on money-making possibilities with Pinterest (e.g., see 
Leaning  2013 ; Loren and Swiderski  2012 ). 
 In October 2014, the valuation of Pinterest was about $5 
billion (up from $3.8 billion in late 2013). Should the  company 
be able to generate signiﬁ cant revenue, it probably will go the 
IPO route, in which case the valuation may be much higher. 
(The company plans to have an IPO in 2015). Let us look now 
at some managerial issues facing the company. 
 Legal Concerns 
 Many people collect images from the Internet to build their 
pinboards (and possibly a brand) without asking permission 
from the content creators, giving them an attribute, or com-
pensating them. Some of the collected material is formally 
copyrighted; other material may be considered copyrighted. 
A similar problem exists with material used on Facebook or 
by bloggers. According to Pinterest’s ‘Terms of Service,’ 
members are “solely responsible for” the content they post 
on Pinterest. Furthermore, users must have explicit permis-
sion from the owners of the content to post them. According 
to Shontell ( 2012 ), one lawyer deleted all her Pinterest 
boards out of fear of copyright violations. Note that Pinterest 
places all blame and potential legal fees on its users (who 
also may pay the legal fees incurred by Pinterest). Pinterest 
has taken several steps to alleviate the legal concerns of users 
(e.g., see Hempel  2012 ). The company is continuously add-
ing measures to minimize the legal problems (see  en.wikipe-
dia.org/wiki/Pinterest ). For example, in May 2012, the 
company added automatic attribution of credit to content 
creators. For a discussion, see Hornor ( 2012 ). Finally, legal 
concerns may include dealing with the spammers who are 
busy on the site.  
 Pinterest’s Competition 
 The popularity of Pinterest has resulted in many attempts to 
clone the company. Since the core concept is basically image 
sharing, it may not be patentable. Competitors are emerging in 
niche markets. For example, TripAdvisor concentrates on travel; 
Gentlemint.com focuses on “manly things” (e.g. cars, world 
news, ﬁ tness); and Dribbble.com is for designers to share their 
creations. An emerging competitor to Pinterest is  fancy.com , 
which partnered with Google+ in February 2013.  Boxnutt.com 
is very similar to Pinterest, but concentrates on funny images 
and clips. Indirect competitors include several Chinese compa-
nies that operate in a culturally different environment, (see 
McKenzie  2012 ). Companies such as Facebook and Google 
may initiate a competitive service. According to Hempel ( 2012 ), 
Pinterest is more business oriented than Facebook or Twitter, 
and visitors tend to buy more there, although Facebook and 
Twitter drive more visitors to their sites.

 Conclusion 
 It seems that Pinterest has some potential beneﬁ ts for small 
businesses (e.g., designers). Many companies already use 
Pinterest to derive beneﬁ ts (e.g., see Etsy.com and Volpe 
 2012 ). However, these applications do not provide any reve-
nue to Pinterest at the moment. The success of Pinterest will 
be determined by its revenue model and the company's 
proﬁ tability.

2.1 
 SOCIAL MEDIA: THE BASICS 
 In this book we use the word  media to mean digital text, 
sounds, pictures, and videos that are shared via the Internet 
or other computing systems. Social media, like all media, 
delivers content to audiences for marketing, entertainment, 
learning, collaboration, for other purposes. Let us ﬁ rst deﬁ ne 
social media. 
 Social Media: Many Deﬁ nitions 
 The term  social media was deﬁ ned in Chap.   1 as: online 
media content using Web 2.0 tools and platforms conducting 
social interactions and conversations. These can be sharing 
opinions, creating content, providing recommendations, and 
so forth. 
 Social media is a powerful force of socialization, 
enabling interactions, communication, and collaboration 
on a massive scale. For a comprehensive description, see 
Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2010 ), who define social media as 
“a group of Internet-based applications that build on the 
ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, 
and that allow the creation and exchange of user-gener-
ated content.” 
 Here are some additional deﬁ nitions of social media 
adopted from Kawasaki and Fitzpatrick ( 2014 ), Safko 
( 2012 ), and Luttrell ( 2014 ): 
 Note: Tommasi ( 2011 ) provides 50 different deﬁ nitions 
of social media. This is typical in a developing interdisci-
plinary ﬁ eld. (Available for viewing as part of a Datasift 
SlideShare presentation (posted April 3, 2012), titled 
“Follow the Content”: see  slideshare.net/datasift/follow-
the-content .) 
 A common thread running through all the deﬁ nitions of 
social media is that they are a blend of technology, content, 
and social interactions for the co-creation of value. For 
details about social media, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Social_media , Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2010 ), and Kawasaki 
and Fitzpatrick ( 2014 ). For a critical history of social media 
see Van Dijck ( 2013 ). For a brief history of social media 
(1969–2014), references, news and more, see  uncp.edu/

•  Any website that utilizes Web 2.0 concepts. This 
includes microblogs, blogs, wikis, social videos, 
and so on. 
•  Software tools that enable people to generate con-
tent (text, video, audio, etc.) and engage in person-
to- person sharing, publishing, conversations, and 
dissemination of content in a social environment.  
•  Media that is frequently designed by users and is 
disseminated through social networking.  
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 Pinterest is a unique platform for conducting social 
media and e-commerce activities. The participants 
form a social network which connects people who 
ﬁ nd interesting images on the Web and organize 
them by topic. Pinterest is also a platform on which 
several activities of SC can be supported. For exam-
ple, companies can build pinboards that promote 
their brands. Pinterest can be used as a platform for 
facilitating innovations via idea-generation and shar-
ing. Pinterest is a derivative of Web 2.0 and social 
media, and as such, it is a new mechanism for sup-
porting social commerce. Other mechanisms covered 
in this chapter are social networks, crowdsourcing, 
and virtual worlds. Note: In addition to the tools and 
platforms described in this chapter, social commerce 
requires the generic tools of e-marketing and 
e-commerce.

 The complexity and richness of the social media ﬁ eld 
can be seen in the  social media map available at  social
mediatoday.com , in Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2010 ), and in 
Safko ( 2012 ). A comprehensive slide show (115 slides) on 
social media implementation is available at  slideshare.net/

on the state of social media, see Eitel ( 2015 ). 
 It is useful to organize the diversiﬁ ed content of social 
media into a framework or model that enables the organiza-
tion of the content as illustrated next.  
  The Landscape of Social Media 
 Social media can be viewed as containing three major types 
of entities: (1) application tools for media components for 
applications (e.g., text, images, audio, and videos); (2) deliv-
ery platforms, mainly social network sites and services; and 
(3) social media activities such as conversations, sharing, 
and recommendations. These three parts are illustrated in 
Fig.  2.1 (the corners of the large triangle), and they are inter-
connected by a networked community of people, organiza-
tions, society, and technology. For comprehensive coverage, 
see Divol et al. ( 2012 ). For social media statistics, see  Pring 
(2013) and Wallace ( 2013 ). For 2014 major social network 
statistics, see  mediabistro.com/alltwitter/social-media- 
statistics-2014_b57746 . For 2014 social media statistics

infographic  . For a video on the social media revolution 
(2013), see  youtube.com/watch?v=QUCfFcchw1w .  
 The Major Parts of Social Media 
 The details of the three parts of social media are:
 1.  Media components and applications . These include text, 
audio, images, and video. Social media uses a wide vari-
ety of content presentations, known as  rich media . 
  2.  Social network sites and services . These are websites that 
are platforms for social media. They enable people to meet 
in communities of shared interests, hobbies, or causes; 
these are referred to as  social network sites . Starting with 
well-known names such as Facebook and LinkedIn, there 
are thousands of social network sites around the globe 
(e.g., see Van Belleghem et al.  2011 ). According to 
Webopedia, a social networking site is “any website that 
enables users to create public proﬁ les within that website 
and form relationships with other users of the same web-
site who access their proﬁ le” and are “community- based” 
(see  webopedia.com/TERM/S/social_networking_site.
html ). Several different types of these services are 
described in Sects.  2.4  and  2.5 . These sites enable the third 
part of our model (Fig.  2.1 ), social media activities.  
 3.  Social media activities . Many activities can be performed 
using social media. The major ones are:

 Functional Building Blogs 
 In what they describe as the “jungle of social media,” 
Kietzmann et al. ( 2011 ) identify seven social media func-
tionalities that they consider the  building blocks of the ﬁ eld. 
 The building blocks are: 
 A large number of social media guides for some of the 
above activities, for social network sites, and for the major 
social media tools are provided (some for free) on the  Social 
Media Examiner website. For the impact of social media on 
commerce, see the infographic, at  staging.socialmediatoday.
com/ritu-pant/1586661/social-currency-effect-social-
media- commerce  , Wildﬁ re, Inc. ( 2012 ), and Kaplan and 
Haenlein ( 2010 ). For a framework for research, see Aral 
et al. ( 2013 ). Schaefer ( 2014a ) explains the business trend of 
social media. 
 Social Media Marketing (SMM) 
 A major area of application of social media is  social media 
marketing (SMM) , which is the process of conducting mar-
keting activities, such as marketing communication, engage-
ment, and advertising. The major objective of SMM is to 
attract the attention of potential buyers through social media 
tools and platforms (Media  2014 ). In SMM, marketers create 
content for this purpose by themselves, or by using user gener-
ated content. In addition, by using social media tools and plat-
forms, marketers try to have the created content shared over 
the Internet. For 500 social media marketing tip, see Macarthy 
( 2013 ). Also, see the tips and strategy suggested by Walker 
( 2014 ). For a list of successful campaigns, see  en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/social-media-marketing . Many of SMM activities 
are done in the major social networks (see Macarthy  2013 ). 
 Details of SMM are presented in Chaps.   4 and   5 . 
 Web 2.0 Tools and Applications 
 The social media tool kit includes a large number of tools, 
and these can be deﬁ ned and categorized in several different 
ways. Popular tools are blogs, wikis, and RSS feeds. The 
tools’ capabilities are ever changing. 
 In Table  2.1 , we provide a fairly comprehensive list of 
social media tools. We describe some of these tools in 
Sect.  2.3 .
 Software Applications (Apps) 
 Software applications (abbreviated as “apps”) are closely 
related to, and frequently confused with, social media tools. 
A  software application (app) , also known as  Web applica-
tion , is a piece of software (usually small) that is run on the 
Internet, or on an intranet on your workplace computer, or on 
your wireless device, such as a smartphone or tablet. Apps 
are designed for end-users. 
 Numerous apps are available for social media. For exam-
ple, Facebook offers Facebook Local Currency Payments—a 
payment application that offers a method of paying for digi-
tal and virtual goods in games and apps used across Facebook. 
Unfortunately, the distinction between software tools and 
apps is not always clear. This may not be an important issue 
for users, but it is important for developers. 
 A list of the top 1,000 Web 2.0 tools and applications in 
60 categories is available at  sites.google.com/a/vmbulldogs.
com/van-meter-secondary-library-voice/web-2-0-tools . 
A similar list of Web 2.0 tools and applications is provided at 
 go2web20.net . A comprehensive resource with links to 
Web 2.0 tools is provided at  xmarks.com/site/www. 
web20searchengine.com/web20/web-2.0-list.htm . 
•  Sharing: Sharing content among users (e.g., in dis-
cussion forums, chats, or video and photo exchanges; 
e.g., on Snapchat). It is the extent to which users 
exchange, distribute, and receive content.  
•  Presence: Finding where your friends are at a given 
time. It is the extent to which users can know if oth-
ers are accessible. 
•  Conversations: There are many ways to have con-
versions using social media tools, ranging from 
Twitter to Facebook to Whatsapp. It is the extent to 
which users communicate with other users in a 
social media setting. 
•  Relationships: Users can relate to each other in 
many ways. For example, you can join a group in 
LinkedIn or follow somebody on Twitter. It is the 
extent to which users can be related to other users. 
•  Reputation:  Users like to know the social standing 
of others. For example, endorsements at LinkedIn. 
It is the extent to which users can identify the stand-
ing of others, including themselves, on a social 
media setting. 
•  Identity: Disclosing who you are is an integral 
part of many social networks. Having a proﬁ le is 
essential to build relationship. It is the extent to 
which users reveal their identities in a social media 
setting.  
•  Groups: Given the large size of social networks, 
many social media platforms offer smaller commu-
nities. It is the extent to which users can form com-
munities and sub-communities. On LinkedIn you 
can join professional groups, and on Facebook and 
Twitter you have friends and followers.

 The three parts shown in Fig.  2.1 are interconnected by 
 people (individuals, groups), organizations, and communities, 
and are enabled by Web 2.0 tools and applications and their 
characteristics (i.e., the technology and processes). Social media 
is recognized today as an effective tool with proven ROI. For 
166 case studies and a free e-book, see Petersen ( 2011 ).  
2.2 
 WEB 2.0 AND ITS MAJOR 
CHARACTERISTICS 
 In Chap.   1 , we introduced the essentials of Web 2.0. Web 2.0 is 
a major element of social media because it provides the tools 
people use when engaging in social media activities. The terms 
 Web 2.0 and  social media are frequently used interchangeably 
to describe the same things. However, many treat Web 2.0 as 
tool-oriented technology only, and social media as a broader 
concept of innovative applications, tools, content, and strategy 
(e.g., see Edwards  2013 ). For a comprehensive handbook of 
research on Web 2.0 (47 chapters), see Murugesan ( 2010 ). 
 Representative Characteristics of Web 2.0 
 The major characteristics of Web 2.0 are presented in 
Table  2.2 .
 Of these characteristics, here we will discuss only the 
topic of user-generated content. Other characteristics are 
described in various chapters of this book (e.g., new business 
models were described in Chap.   1 ). 
 User-Generated Content 
 User-generated content (UGC) , also known as  consumer- 
generated media (CGM), refers to media content that is pro-
duced by end-users and is publicly available. It is also used

 Table 2.2   Major characteristics of Web 2.0 
 The following are representative characteristics of Web 2.0: 
 User-created content (self-publishing) 
 • 
The ability to tap into the collective intelligence of users. The 
more users who contribute, the more popular and valuable a Web 
2.0 site becomes 
 • 
Unique communication and collaborative environment 
 • 
Making data available in new and innovative ways 
 • 
Web 2.0 data that can be remixed or “mashed up,” often through 
Web services interfaces, much like the way a dance-club DJ 
mixes music 
 • 
The presence of lightweight programming techniques and tools 
that lets nearly anyone act as a developer (e.g., wikis, blogs, RSS, 
and podcasting) 
 • 
The virtual elimination of software-upgrade cycles that makes 
everything a perpetual beta, or work in progress, and allows rapid 
prototyping using the Web as a platform 
 • 
Unique sharing of content of all types 
 • 
Networks as platforms, delivering and allowing users to use 
applications entirely through a browser 
 • 
Open source architecture, which makes connectivity to 
computing resources simple 
 • 
Users own the data on the site and exercise control over that data 
 • 
An architecture of participation and digital democracy that 
encourages users to add value to the application as they use it 
 • 
Creation of new business models 
 • 
A major emphasis on social networks 
 • 
A rich, interactive, user-friendly interface based on Ajax or similar 
frameworks. Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a Web 
development technique for creating interactive Web applications 
 • 
More productive organization communication due to improved 
search, links, user authority, and so on 
 • 
Global spread of innovation. As soon as a successful idea is 
deployed as a website in one country, similar sites appear worldwide

to describe a wide range of applications, content creation, 
and other activities. Examples include reviews, recommen-
dations, problem solving, marketing communication (such 
as user-generated ads), news, word of mouth, and entertain-
ment. Some social media sites are entirely populated by 
UGC, such as YouTube (videos), Flickr (photos), Meetup 
(network of local groups), LinkedIn, Google+, Twitter, 
Instagram, and other social networks. Note that, according to 
research reported by Knoblauch ( 2014 ), millennials trust 
UGC 50 % more than they trust other content. 
 For details about UGC, including its limitations and legal 
concerns, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User- generated_con-
tent . Regarding commercial applications, UGC is used in 
writing Wikia and Wikipedia entries and similar collective 
intelligence projects. It is also used to engage an organiza-
tion’s markets by preparing (or contributing to the prepara-
tion of) ads, encouraging comments to blog entries, and 
soliciting product improvement recommendations (such as 
My Starbucks Idea). Sites entirely populated by UGC, such 
as YouTube, attract a multitude of visitors and thus provide 
revenue through an advertising business model. 
 With an increase in user-generated content on the Web, 
the user (or consumer) is largely in control of brand conver-
sations. As a result, traditional marketing strategies (such 
as banner ads) may not work as well in social media 
environments. 
 Following the traditional word of mouth, consumers 
want to be associated with, and receive, product recom-
mendations from friends and family. They want to visit and 
participate in online “environments” where trust, interest, 
and knowledge is shared by communities. Web 2.0 tech-
nologies allow consumers to listen and contribute to UGC 
on a large scale. However, some major issues related to 
UGC include its quality, fairness, how current the content 
is, and the potential invasion of privacy of those cited in 
speciﬁ c UGC. This is inevitable in an environment where 
everyone is a publisher with little editing control; however, 
several commercial systems are in place to moderate online 
discussions and other UGC (see reputation management 
systems in Chap.   5 ). 
 As stated earlier, social media activities are enabled by a 
set of tools that are referred to as Web 2.0 or  social software . 
These are described next. 
2.3 
 THE MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS: 
FROM BLOGS AND MICROBLOGS 
TO WIKIS AND SUPPORT 
TECHNOLOGIES 
 Social software encompasses a range of software tools that 
allow users to interact and share data and other media. The 
major social software tools were listed in Table  2.1 . For com-
prehensive coverage, see  social7.org . For comprehensive 
coverage of social media tools, tactics, platforms, and strate-
gies, see Safko ( 2012 ). 
 Many of the applications performed with social media 
tools share the common characteristics described earlier, as 
well as having the ability to easily upload data/media. Major 
advocates of using social media tools believe that they are 
the backbone needed for creating online innovative commu-
nities and applications. 
 Note that these tools are also popular in social networks. 
For example, photo sharing and blogging are integral parts of 
many social networks. However, several of the tools are also 
written in traditional information systems such as blogs in 
corporate portals. 
 In this section, we will cover only representative tools that 
are used more extensively in social commerce: blogs and 
microblogs (e.g., Twitter), wikis, and social search. 
 Blog (Web Log) 
 The Internet offers the opportunity for individuals to  publish 
on the Web using a technology known as  Web logging , or 
 blogging. A  blog is a personal website, or part of a website, 
open to the public, where the owners express their thoughts 
and opinions, and provide information and expertise. Blogs 
are “a publicly accessible personal journal” and “new con-
tent is published by the author on a regular basis” (per  etc.
usf.edu/techease/mac/internet/what-is-blogging-and-
how- can-i-use-it-as-a-classroom-activity ). 
Blogs 
can 
become a two-way communication that may facilitate col-
laboration. Blogs can be used on the Internet or internally 
within the enterprise on intranets. The totality of blogs is 
known as the  blogosphere . For comprehensive coverage of 
blogs, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog . Blogging is proba-
bly the most popular Web 2.0 tool among the largest U.S. 
corporations. For the top ten business blogs for entrepreneurs 
(in 2013), see  onlinebusiness.volusion.com/articles/best-
business- blogs  . For the top 50 business blogs (Blog Rank), 
see  blogmetrics.org/Business . 
 Many blogs provide commentaries on a particular sub-
ject; others function mostly as personal online diaries. A 
typical blog includes text, videos, images, and links to rel-
evant sources. A  video blog (vlog)  is a blog with video 
content. Because it is getting easy to embed videos in 
blogs many blogs are changing to vlogs. According to WP 
Virtuoso, in November 2013, there were over 152 million 
blogs on the Internet, with a new blog created somewhere 
in the world every half seconds (172,800 per day; per 
 wpvirtuoso.com/how-many-blogs-are-on-the-internet , 
which also provides an infographic with interesting facts 
about blogs). Note that almost 10,000 fake or spam blogs 
are each created daily (out of 150,000–200,000 total). 
Most blogs are written in English. Note that, while most 
blogs are written by one individual, there are some blogs 
2 Tools and Platforms for Social Commerce

31
that are written by two or more people (sometimes by 
many employees of a company). 
 Building Effective Blogs 
 It is becoming much easier to build blogs. Programs from 
Google ( blogger.com ) and other vendors (e.g.,  typepad.
com ) are very user-friendly, allowing blog authors to write 
directly on theirs or on any other website (e.g., when they 
write for a vendor). Blog space is free; the goal is to make it 
easy for users to create their own blogs.  Bloggers (the people 
who create and maintain blogs) invite others to their blogs. 
Blogs can easily be edited and forwarded. Blogging plat-
forms, such as  wordpress.org or  movabletype.org , have 
more complex features and also allow users to host their 
blogs at a third-party site, such as  godaddy.com or directly 
on WordPress. Bloggers also use special terminology, such 
as 'blog storm,' where thousands of bloggers in the blogo-
sphere write about the same topic, event, or activity in order 
to push the story to mainstream news. See  whatis.techtar-
get.com/reference/Blog-terms-Glossary for a glossary of 
blog terms. For building effective blogging business for 
proﬁ t see Murdoch ( 2014 ). 
 To review the legal and social consequences of blogs, 
including the dangers of defamation or liability, political 
dangers, issues in relation to employment, and court cases, 
see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog . For the potential impact of 
blogs on the reputation of brands or organizations, see Chap. 
  5 . For EFF’s Legal Guide for Bloggers, see   eff.org/issues/
bloggers/legal .  
 Commercial Uses of Blogs 
 The blog concept has transferred quickly and extensively 
to the corporate world. For coverage, see Rich ( 2014 ) 
and Schaefer and Smith ( 2013 ). Typical applications 
include: 
 Example: How Stonyﬁ eld Farm Uses Blogs 
 Stonyﬁ eld Farm ( stonyﬁ eld.com ) makes the number-one 
selling brand of organic yogurt and is the third largest overall 
yogurt company in the U.S. The company’s core values are 
promoting healthy food (organic) and protecting the environ-
ment. The company guarantees the use of only natural ingre-
dients in its products and it donates 10% of its proﬁ ts each 
year to environmental non-proﬁ t groups (see their videos at 
 youtube.com/user/stonyﬁ eldorganic/videos ). 
 The company uses word-of-mouth marketing approaches 
that are compatible with its grassroots “people-friendly” 
image. As of 2007, Stonyﬁ eld has turned to blogs to further 
personalize its relationship with its customers and connect 
with even more people. The blogs provide the company with 
what the management calls a “handshake” with customers. 
Stonyﬁ eld publishes six different categories of blogs on its 
website, including “on the farm,” “at home,” and “in the 
cup.” Each category includes sub-categories. 
 Stonyﬁ eld hires bloggers to post new content to each of the 
blogs on a regular basis. When readers subscribe to the blogs, 
they receive automatic updates, and they can also respond to 
the postings. The blogs have created a positive response for 
the Stonyﬁ eld brand by providing readers with topics that 
inspire them and pique their interests. The blog readers are 
encouraged to try Stonyﬁ eld products. Management believes 
that blogs are an excellent method of communication with the 
customers, as well as for public relations.  
 Microblogging and Twitter 
 Microblogging is a form of blogging that allows users to 
write short messages, post an image, or embed a video, and 
then publish them on a forum. These messages can be deliv-
ered as text messages from mobile devices, as instant mes-
saging, through e-mail, or just posted on the Web. The 
messages are delivered in real-time or close to it (e.g., com-
mentary during a sporting event). 
 The content of a microblog differs from that of a regular 
blog due to the limited amount of characters per message 
(e.g., Twitter has a limit of 140 characters on any device). 
 The most popular service is Twitter, although in 2014, 
there were hundreds of competitors (e.g.,  tumblr.com and 
see Frasco  2013 ). A very large and popular microblog ser-
vice in China is Sina Weibo ( us.weibo.com/gb ). Note that 
many of the microblogging sites include social media and 
social networking functionalities. 
 Twitter and Tweeting 
 Twitter is a microblogging service with some social network 
features, that enables its users to send messages and read other 
•  Building brands. 
•  Demonstrating company or individual expertise to 
attract clients. 
•  Attracting many readers for the purpose of selling 
advertising on the blog.  
•  Providing customer support for problem resolution, 
interactions, and encouragement of customer 
engagement. 
•  Using search engines to increase trafﬁ c to the own-
er’s other sites. 
•  Setting up blogs for partner and customer feedback.   
2.3 The Major Social Media Tools: From Blogs and Microblogs to Wikis and Support Technologies

users’ messages and updates, otherwise known as  tweets , which 
are short text-based posts. Tweets can be read directly online or 
delivered to users (followers) who sign up to read them. Twitter 
can be viewed as a social media platform for broadcasting infor-
mation and opinions. According to Twitter’s homepage, “Twitter 
is a service … to communicate and stay connected through the 
exchange of quick frequent answers to one simple question: 
‘What are you doing?’” However, the service additionally 
includes social networking capabilities, such as user proﬁ les, 
lists of friends, and dozens of applications, so Twitter can also 
be considered a social network. For capabilities and details, see 
Collier ( 2014 ), Fitton et al. ( 2014 ), and  tweeternet.com . Twitter 
and its business applications are described in detail on  business.
twitter.com/basics  and by Schaefer ( 2014 b). The shares of the 
company are publically traded and their price advanced rapidly 
(in 2014). Also see  twitter.com/101Guide . The latter is also a 
guide to using Twitter for business. 
 As of August 2014, Twitter claims to have more than 271 
million monthly active users (per  about.twitter.com/com-
pany ). For 250 amazing statistics see Smith ( 2014b ). Twitter 
is used by customers and it is also becoming a useful enter-
prise tool. Socialtext ( socialtext.com ) is a social software 
company that offers functionality including a Twitter-like ser-
vice for the enterprise (see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialtext ). 
 Twitter is an important social commerce tool because it: 
 For Twitter statistics, see  statisticbrain.com/twitter- 
statistics  , and Smith ( 2014b ). 
 For the beneﬁ ts of using Twitter for business, see Dessau 
( 2013 ), and Bennett ( 2014 ). 
 Wikis 
 A  wiki , also called a  wikiblo g, is a tool that enables users to 
jointly create digital documents. According to Wikipedia, 
Wikis are powered by wiki software. They also are deployed 
via corporate intranets and in knowledge management sys-
tems (e.g., create and update knowledge). 
 A wiki can be viewed as a continually revised, multi- 
authored blog. Whereas a blog usually is created by an 
 individual (or maybe a small group) and frequently has an 
attached discussion board or a continuous list of comments, 
a wiki essentially is a blog that enables anyone to participate 
as a co-editor. Any user may add, delete, edit, or change con-
tent. (In contrast, content blogs cannot be changed by anyone 
but the original poster.) A wiki is like a loose-leaf notebook 
with a pencil and eraser left in a public place. Users can read 
it, scrawl notes, tear out a page, add an image, and so on. 
Wikis can be implemented in many ways. One way is through 
contributions by many, as in the case of Wikipedia (see 
Waters  2010 ). A similar concept is employed by sites such as 
 investopedia.com . For a comprehensive list of wikis, see 
 wikiindex.org . For characteristics, e-commerce applica-
tions, resources, and more, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki . 
For collaborative wiki types, see  pbworks.com and WikiHub 
( getwikihub.com ). 
 Business Applications of Wikis 
 Wikis are becoming an important enterprise collaboration 
tool. Even universities use them for project collaboration, 
such as working on accreditation materials for business 
schools. An interesting example is Wind River ( windriver.
com ), a software company that uses wikis extensively to sup-
port teamwork (see details at  twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/
TWikiSuccessStoryOfWindRiver ). 
 Other Useful Tools and Apps 
 Hundreds interesting tools can be classiﬁ ed as social media 
tools. Here are few representative examples: 
•  Enables the contribution of information by people 
whose opinions are important to a company and its 
management. This includes idea generation and 
improved innovation.  
•  Helps rapid dissemination of information and news 
and consequently is facilitating word-of-mouth 
information, so it is can be used as a marketing 
communication tool.  
•  Allows people to interact with others, which helps 
them ﬁ nd business partners and sales leads. 
•  Helps employees ﬁ nd colleagues, understand what 
their colleagues are doing and share advice and get 
help. 
•  Helps with customer care and problem resolution. 
•  Snapchat —A mobile photo messaging app used 
for taking photos, videos and drawings, and sending 
them to recipients on a desired list.  
•  WhatsApp —A free cross-platform messaging 
exchange app for smartphones that allows users to 
send SMS messages at no charge (a Facebook 
company). 
•  Ortsbo —Enabler of real-time conversational trans-
lation mainly in social media settings.  
•  DROTR (Formerly Droid Translator)—Translates 
voice, videos calls, and chats into 29 different lan-
guages. The program has been upgraded and is now 
a completely separate VoIP service for mobile 
devices. See Petroff ( 2014 ) and  droid-translator.

 Social Search 
 Searching information available in social networks can be 
improved with tools such as “Graph Search” from Facebook. 
The tool is integrated with Facebook’s  Social Graph (see 
Chap.   3 ). Social Graph can process information available in 
natural language, including queries. Social search discovers 
social connections and much more. For details, see  face-
book.com/about/graphsearch . Graph Search ads provide 
income to Facebook. Google also incorporates social fea-
tures to its standard search engine. 
 Specialized Search Engines for Social Networks 
 Several search engines are designed speciﬁ cally for search-
ing social networks and networking. Representative exam-
ples are:  pipl.com ,  wink.com ,  peekyou.com ,  yoname.com , 
and  zabasearch.com . For ways to make it easier for people 
to ﬁ nd others online, see Cockburn ( 2014 ).

 Using Multiple Tools to Improve Performance 
 Many companies combine Web 2.0 tools to improve 
performance. 
 Now that you have an idea about social media tools, we 
can move on to the seconds of our framework (see Fig.  2.1 , 
p. XX), describing social networks.  
2.4 
 SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES AND SERVICES 
 There are several deﬁ nitions of the basic concepts related to 
social networks. 
 First, there is a community of people with common inter-
ests that exist online and are referred to as a  virtual commu-
nity. (For example, Trimdownclub.com is a community of 
people that are interested in reducing their weight.) A com-
munity is using a website to communicate and share ideas, 
etc. Such a website is referred to as a  social network site (or 
 service ). 
 A  social network , in general, is a structure that 
describes social relationships and ﬂ ows of information 
and activities among the participants in a community. The 
structure is made of nodes that describe the participants 
(people, computers, other objects). These nodes are con-
nected by lines that describe the relationships and activi-
ties in the community. The nodes in a network are 
connected by one or more interdependencies, such as 
ideas, values, visions, ideologies, ﬁ nancial interest, 
friendship, or similar interests. The structures can range 
from simple to very complex. 
 In its simplest form, a social network can be described by 
an image of all relevant connections among the nodes. The 
network can also be used to determine the social capital (see 
Chap.   3 ) of individual participants. These concepts are often 
displayed in a social network diagram, where nodes are the 
objectcs and participants, and the lines are the ties. 
 Social Network Services (Sites) 
 Social network services (SNSs) (also known as social net-
work sites), such as LinkedIn or Facebook, provide and host a 
free Web space for people to build their public proﬁ le. They 
also provide communication and support tools (e.g., blogs, 
forums, polling, e-mail, and chatting capabilities), and apps 
that enable different activities. Social networks are people- 
oriented. Today, corporations have a great interest in the busi-
ness aspect of social networks, for professional reasons as well 
as for networking and for promoting products and services. An 
example is  linkedin.com , the largest business- oriented social 
network that connects professionals and businesses by indus-
try, functions, geography, and areas of interest (see Chap.   8  ). 
 The following are some examples of representative social 
network services.
•  Facebook.com . The largest and the most visited social 
network service. 
•  Tagged —A maker of  social discovery products. It 
enables people to meet and socialize with other 
people through advanced browsing and matching 
features, shared interests, etc. 
•  Viber, Line, etc. Several new companies are 
 centered on mobile devices. For example, providing 
mobile apps for free texting, free phone calling, 
photo messages, and location sharing with others. 
Line Inc. also provides stickers and the latest news 
and coupons. As social networks, these companies 
allow creation of reviews, etc. See Macarthy ( 2013 ). 
Several companies provide free voice and video 
calls for mobile devices and desktops (e.g. Viber for 
Desktop). 
•  Hashtags —Enables users to click on a hashtag on 
Facebook and see all public content related to a spe-
ciﬁ c keyword. Also enables users to join any public 
conversation related to a posted hashtag (see 
Vandermeersch  2013 ). 
•  Google+ Hangouts —Google’s Messaging and 
chatting tool for the mobile environment (see Tech2 
News Staff  2014 and  plus.google.com/hangouts ). 
•  We Chat —A popular mobile text, images, video 
and voice messaging communication service; now 
with real-time location service (owned by Tencent 
Holdings of China). It is similar to WhatsApp (see 
Tech2 News Staff  2014 ). 
2.4 Social Networks and Social Networking Sites and Services

websites  . For a 2014 social media infographic with statistics 
and other information, see   blog.digitalinsights.in/social-
media- users-2014-stats-numbers/05205287.html .  
 Social Networking 
 It is useful to distinguish between  social networks  and  social 
networking .  Social networking refers to the execution of any 
social media activity listed in Sect.  2.1 , including having a 
presence in social networks. It is the act of exchanging infor-
mation, private or public, through various forms of network 
technology, such as the Internet, cellphones, and other devices 
and services, using social media tools, apps, or networks. 
 Social networking includes all social media activities, 
regardless if they are done in social networks or in any other 
website (e.g., corporate portal). 
 Social networking is viewed as being all about people and 
relationships, basically describing the activities conducted in 
social network sites. 
 The Social Networking Landscape 
 The social networking landscape can be categorized as 
follows: 
 For a comprehensive list of social network websites, see 
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites . 
 Note that, in each of the social network sites, you may 
ﬁ nd social software tools and socially oriented applications 
(apps). Also note that, thanks to mashups, it is possible to 
have content from several sites combined. For instance, a 
Facebook page might include photos from Flickr, videos 
from YouTube, and news from Twitter. Social media and net-
working are becoming new communication venues that 
impact the manner in which people interact. Finally, note 
that the capabilities and business models of social network 
sites are changing constantly (e.g., regarding Facebook, 
see  Hutchinson 2013 ). For a comprehensive guide to social 
•  Leisure-oriented sites. Socially focused public 
sites are open to all users. However, companies also 
use these for promoting their products. For exam-
ple, Facebook, hi5, and Google+. MySpace is 
known as a place where musicians sell their music. 
•  Professional networking sites. Sites focusing on 
business networking. Examples: LinkedIn, Xing, 
and Biznik. 
•  Media sharing sites. Sites that enable focusing on 
the display and sharing of user-generated multime-
dia content, such as video and photos. Examples: 
YouTube, Flickr, and Instagram. 
•  Virtual world sites. 3D virtual worlds built and 
owned by their residents (the users). Examples: 
Second Life, Webkinz, and Hobbo. 
•  Communication sites that possess social net-
working capabilities. Many socially oriented web-
sites facilitate communication. For example:
 ○ Microblogging/presence applications, such as 
Twitter, Plurk, and Sina Weibo 
 ○ Uniﬁ ed communication products such as 
Microsoft’s SharePoint, Salesforce’s Chatter, 
Microsoft’s Yammer, and IBM Connections 
(formerly Lotus Connections) empower and 
enable communication, conversations, collabo-
ration, and other social networking activities.  
 ○  Enterprise-owned sites. These are  private sites 
owned by companies. Examples include: 
Starbucks, Disney, or Dell.

categories of social networks, see  webtrends.about.com/
od/socialnetworking/u/list-of-social-networks-guide.htm . 
 A Global Phenomenon 
 Although Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn attract the major-
ity of media attention in the United States, in general, many 
other social network sites are proliferating and growing in 
popularity worldwide (e.g. see  emarketer.com/Article/
Which-Social-Networks-Growing-Fastest- Worldwide/
1009884 ). 
 For popularity around the world, see  royal.pingdom.
com/2013/01/16/internet-2012-in-numbers 
(2012 
data); 
Alexa’s top 500 ( alexa.com/topsites/global ); and  statista.
com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by- 
number-of-users . (However, it is important to note that rank-
ings differ depending on the source and manner of calculation 
and ﬂ uctuate between dates.) For example,  renren.com , Qzone 
( qzone.qq.com ), and  weibo.com  are premier social network-
ing services in China.  Mixi.jp has attained widespread adop-
tion in Japan,  tuenti.com in Spain, studiVZ ( studivz.net ) in 
Germany, and Vkontakte ( vk.com ) in Russia. In Poland one 
can ﬁ nd Nasza-Klasa ( nk.pl ).  Hi5.com  has been adopted glob-
ally. Additionally, previously popular communication services 
have begun implementing social networking features. For 
example, the Chinese QQ (an instant messaging service), cited 
earlier, instantly became one of the largest social networking 
services in the world once it added proﬁ les and made friends 
visible to one another. Note that international entrepreneurs, 
inspired by the success of the largest social network sites in the 
USA and their capabilities, have created their own local knock-
offs. Information about social networks is changing rapidly; 
therefore, to get the most up-to-date data, go to  alexa.com , 
 expandedramblings.com , or  comscore.com . 
 For a comprehensive slideshow about the spread of social 
media globally, see Van Belleghem et al. ( 2011 ). 
 The Major Capabilities and Services Provided 
by Social Network Sites 
 Social network sites provide many capabilities and services 
such as: 
 Although not all networks have all these capabilities, 
some have even more. These capabilities can make social 
networks useful for consumers (see Zeisser  2010 ). 
 To learn about Facebook and its capabilities, see the free 
tutorial at  gcﬂ earnfree.org/facebook101 . 
 Business-Oriented Social Networks 
 Business-oriented social networks , also known as  profes-
sional social networks , are networks whose primary objec-
tive is to facilitate business activities and connections. The 
prime example here is  linkedin.com , which provides business 
•  Users can construct a Web page where they are able 
to present their proﬁ les to the public. 
•  Users can create a circle of friends who are linked 
together. 
•  The site provides discussion forums (by subgroup, 
by topic). 
•  Photo, video, and document viewing and sharing 
(streaming videos, user-supplied videos) are 
supported. 
•  Wikis can be used to jointly create documents. 
•  Blogs can be used for discussion, dissemination of 
information, and much more.  
•  Some social network sites offer community e-mail 
and instant messaging (IM) capabilities.  
•  Experts (including paid and non-paid) can be made 
available to answer members’ queries. 
•  Consumers can rate and comment on products and 
services. 
•  Online voting may be available to poll members’ 
opinions. 
•  Some sites provide an e-newsletter. 
•  Some sites support conference (group) chatting, 
possibly combined with (document and image) 
sharing. 
•  Users can chat both by text (Instant Messaging) and 
voice. 
•  Message and bulletin board services are available 
for posting information.  
•  Some social network sites provide storage for con-
tent such as photos, videos, and music.  
•  Users can bookmark their self-created content. 
•  Users can ﬁ nd what is going on in others' networks, 
or in topics of interest.  
•  Users can shop, relying on advice received from 
friends and other shoppers.

contacts and interactions and enables job searching and 
recruiting (see Chap.   8 ). 
 Businesses increasingly use business social networks for 
building professional networking, and introducing them-
selves online. Social networks also make it easier to keep 
connected globally. 
 Example of a Business-Oriented Social Network: XING 
 Originated in Germany, XING ( xing.com ) is a business net-
work for business professionals—job seekers, recruiters, 
salespeople and managers from many countries, mostly in 
Europe (mostly German-speaking countries; see details at 
 corporate.xing.com/no_cache/english/company/xing-ag ). 
The site offers secure services in 16 languages serving 200 
countries. Users can visit the site to:
•  Establish new business contacts and ﬁ nd sales leads. 
•  Expand and manage their contact with networks of 
professionals. 
•  Promote themselves to employers in a professional busi-
ness context. 
•  Find experts that can give advice on any topic (for fee or 
for free). 
•  Organize professional conferences and related events. 
•  Control the level of privacy and ensure that their personal 
data are protected. (XING handles members’ data in 
accordance with strict German data protection regula-
tions.) This is especially important in the European Union, 
where data privacy issues are more important and legis-
lated than in the United States and most other countries.

security policies. 
 For more on XING, see  xing.com/help . Services also are 
available for mobile devices. 
 Enterprise Social Networks 
 Business-oriented social networks can be  public , such as 
LinkedIn. They are usually owned and operated by indepen-
dent companies. Another type of business-oriented social 
network is  private , owned by corporations and operated 
inside them. These are known as  enterprise social  networks , 
such as My Starbucks Idea. They can be available to custom-
ers, or solely to the company’s employees (see Chap.   8 ).

 MOBILE SOCIAL COMMERCE 
 Mobile computing is growing faster than any other type of 
EC computing. According to Cisco Systems’ 2014 Visual 
Networking Index (as reported by  Sartain 2014 ), global 
mobile data trafﬁ c increased by 81% (from 820 petabytes per 
month in 2012) to 1.5 exabytes per month in 2013. (To access 
Cisco’s White Paper, see  cisco.com/c/en/us/ solutions/collat-
eral/service-provider/visual-networking- index-vni/white_
paper_c11-520862.pdf .) This growth clearly facilitates 
global mobile commerce. According to a survey conducted 
by eDigital Research and Portaltech Reply (as reported by 
 The Retail Bulletin  2012 ) 64% of smartphone consumers use 
mobile devices to shop online, a fourfold increase since 
2010). For research regarding the explosion of mobile social 
media, see Redsicker ( 2013 ). In subsequent chapters, we will 
discuss many mobile applications. Here we present the basic 
deﬁ nitions, technologies, and a few examples. 
 Mobile Social Networking 
 Mobile commerce is spreading very rapidly in social media 
and social commerce applications (Redsicker  2013 ). 
 Mobile social networking refers to social networking where 
members chat and connect with one another using any mobile 
device. Most major social networking websites now offer 
mobile services. By Q1 2014, Facebook had over 1 billion 
mobile monthly active users out of a total 1.28 billion monthly 
active users (see  techcrunch.com/2014/04/23/facebook-
passes-1b-mobile-monthly-active-users-in-q1- as-mobile-
ads-reach-59-of-all-ad-sales . Some social networking sites 
offer mobile-only services (e.g.,  path.com  and  in-galaxy.com ). 
 Mobile social networking is especially popular in Japan, 
South Korea, and China, generally due to better data pricing 
(ﬂ at rates are widespread in Japan).The network can be only 
mobile or the site can offer both mobile and non mobile 
access. In Japan and South Korea, where 4G networks offer 
more bandwidth, the leaders in social networking are  mixi.jp 
and game-centric Mobage by DeNa ( mbga.jp ) in Japan, and 
 cyworld.com in South Korea. For an infographic of 2013

infographic-2013-mobile-growth-statistics . 
 Experts predict that mobile social networks will experi-
ence explosive growth, as evidenced since 2012. For how 
social platforms are powering mobile commerce, see Gupta 
( 2011 ). For opportunities of mobile social networks see Wu 
and Wang ( 2014 ). 
 Video Sharing 
Mobile video sharing, which sometimes is combined with photo 
sharing, is a relatively new technological and social trend. 
Mobile video-sharing portals are becoming popular (e.g., see 
 vimeo.com ). Many social networking sites offer video sharing 
features (e.g., see  mfubo.com ). 
 Examples of Social Mobile Commerce Applications 
 There are several types of social mobile applications. 
Illustrative examples are provided next.

 Example 1 
 IBM is a leader in social commerce adoption of mobile 
devices. Following are some examples of IBM’s initiatives 
according to Taft ( 2011 ): 
 Example 2 
 A poll conducted by TravelClick in October 2011 revealed 
that half of the participating hoteliers around the globe are 
investing in mobile technologies to support social commerce 
(see 
 bizreport.com/2011/10/travelclick-hotels- to-invest-
more-in-mobile-social-marketing.html ). 
 With the current technology, we also see a trend toward the 
sophisticated mobile interactions of Internet social networks 
with images, voice, and videos. This is expected to be a pow-
erful managerial and marketing feature in the near future. 
 Experts predict that mobile access to social networks will 
experience explosive growth. For the connection between mobile 
computing and social media marketing, see Sanovy ( 2013 ).  
 Mobile Community Activities 
 In many mobile social networks, users can utilize their 
mobile devices to create their proﬁ les, make friends, cre-
ate and participate in chat rooms, hold private conversa-
tions, and share photos, videos, and blogs. Some 
companies provide wireless features that allow their cus-
tomers to build their own mobile community (e.g., using 
 sonopia.com ).  
2.6 
 CROWDSOURCING 
AND CROWDFUNDING: 
AN INTRODUCTION 
 Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding are relatively new plat-
forms for conducting social commerce. 
 Crowdsourcing 
 Crowdsourcing is a platform for using collective intelligence 
for conducting social decision support and other social com-
merce activities (see  crowdsourcing.org ). Crowdsourcing is 
usually managed over the Internet. Here we present the 
essentials of the technology. In Chap.   8 we present the appli-
cations that are based on this technology. 
 Deﬁ nitions and Major Concepts 
 The term  crowd refers to any group of people, (usually large 
one) such as a group of consumers, employees of a corpora-
tion, or members of a social network, who usually possess 
expertise, when used for crowdsourcing. 
 Crowdsourcing utilizes the wisdom of crowds to collec-
tively execute tasks such as solving problems, innovating, or 
completing large projects by dividing the work among many 
people. The term was coined by Jeff Howe in a June 2006 
 Wired  article (Howe  2008 ). In the crowdsourcing process, the 
initiator recruits a crowd (e.g., customers) to create content, 
accomplish a cumbersome task (e.g., additions to Wikipedia), 
or conducting research and development. This is based on the 
idea that many heads are better than one. The collective intel-
ligence of large groups is assumed to be able to solve complex 
problems at low cost (see Sherman  2011 ; Brabham  2013 ). 
 The basic elements of crowdsourcing are illustrated in 
Fig.  2.2 . Three elements are involved: the task(s) to be  carried 
out, the  crowd , which is used to work on the  task , and the  tools 
and processes  used by the crowd to execute the task. These ele-
ments are connected by features related to the task(s) and the 
crowd (such as the composition or size of the crowd), the tech-
nologies used (such as idea generation and voting), and imple-
mentation issues such as incentives paid to the participants.  
 The Process of Crowdsourcing 
 Crowdsourcing can be viewed as a collective problem- 
solving or a work-sharing process and usually is conducted 
on the Web. In a typical example of crowdsourcing, problems 
•  IBM Mobile Connect . This is a mobile version of 
IBM Connections (formerly Lotus Connections; 
social media and social networks building soft-
ware). Customers can get immediate access to 
blogs, wikis, and other tools. They can also share 
photos, videos, and ﬁ les on major mobile devices 
(e.g., Android, Blackberry, Apple). 
•  IBM Connections allows people to create business 
value. For example, employees can use the Ideation 
Blog to generate and vote on ideas at work (see 
 ibm.com/connections/blogs/SametimeBlog/?
lang=en ). 
•  The new capabilities in IBM Connections 4.5, such as 
the Moderation application, or Ideation Blogs, enable 
workers to embrace networks of engaged people.  
2.6 Crowdsourcing and Crowdfunding: An Introduction 

38
are broadcasted either to a known crowd (e.g., employees or 
business partners) or to an  unknown  group of participants 
(e.g., expert problem solvers or consumers). The communica-
tion usually starts as an open call for solutions (see ﬁ rst step 
in Fig.  2.3 ). The members of the crowd are organized as 
online communities, and members submit individual solu-
tions. The crowd may also discuss the solutions and may vote 
for a ﬁ nal short list. (The short list can be prioritized [e.g., 
ranked].) The ﬁ nal selection can be made by the crowd or by 
management (Fig.  2.3 ). The winning individuals in the crowd 
are compensated, either monetarily or with special recogni-
tion or acknowledgement of a job well done. In other cases, 
the only rewards may be the intellectual satisfaction.  
 Example 
 In 2008, Starbucks introduced My Starbucks Idea ( mystar-
bucksidea.force.com ), a social media site designed to solicit 
ideas and feedback from Starbucks’ customers (see opening 
case in Chap.   1 ). The site was built around three key themes: 
1) ideas are user generated, 2) users can vote to short list the 
submitted ideas, discussing them before and/or after the 
vote, 3) company employees act as “idea partners,”’ provid-
ing answers to questions and leading discussions. 
 The process is visible to the entire community. The mem-
bers can see the status of each proposal. 
 Note that crowdsourcing focuses on innovation, creativ-
ity, and the problem-solving capabilities of a crowd organi-
zation. An overview of crowdsourcing is provided in videos 
about 
crowdsourcing 
at 
 youtube.com/watch?v=F0- 
UtNg3ots  , at  crowdsourcing.org , and by Sherman ( 2011 ). 
Crowdsortium ( crowdsortium.org ) sees crowdsourcing as a 
network of specialists. These specialists have developed best 
practices for the industry. 
 Beneﬁ ts of Crowdsourcing 
 The major perceived beneﬁ ts of crowdsourcing include the 
following: 
 Fig. 2.3   A typical 
crowdsourcing process  
•  Problems can be analyzed or solved at compara-
tively little cost. (Payment can be determined by the 
results; however, sometimes there is no monetary 
payment, just praise or accolades). 
•  Solutions can be reached quickly since many peo-
ple work on the needed research. In addition, prod-
uct designs may be expedited.  
•  The contributing crowd may reside within the orga-
nization, so talents may be discovered.  
•  By listening to the crowd, organizations gain ﬁ rst 
hand insight into their customers’ (or employees’) 
desires. There is built-in market research when the 
crowd is composed of customers.  
•  Crowdsourcing can tap into the global world of 
ideas. The crowd may include business partners, 
customers, academicians, etc. 
•  Customers tend to be more loyal if they participate 
in a company’s problem solving process.

 Uses of Crowdsourcing in Social Commerce 
 There are several social commerce applications used in 
crowdsourcing—notable are idea generation, such as used 
by Starbucks and the creation of Wikipedia. Sherman ( 2011 ) 
presents many other successful applications; the major ones 
are described in Chap.   8 . 
 Crowdfunding 
 Crowdfunding is an Internet platform for collecting small 
amounts of money from many individuals (a crowd). The 
money is collected for several possible purposes. Most com-
mon ones are:
•  Equity funding. This is one way for funding start-ups. 
The contributors get shares of the company. For an over-
view see Lennon ( 2014 ). The recipient of the funds can 
get an idea off the ground very quickly (see examples in 
Chap.   8 ). Equity funding is done by intermediaries such 
as Kickstarter. 
•  Rewards crowdfunding. According to  en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/crowdfunding : “entrepreneurs pre-sell a prod-
uct or service to launch a business concept without incur-
ring debt or sacriﬁ cing equity/shares.” 
•  Contribution to a cause. People raise money as a philan-
thropy activity for individuals in need and for civic 
projects. 
 For further discussion, examples of application see Chap. 
  8 and the Wikipedia entry. 
2.7 
 VIRTUAL WORLDS AS 
A SOCIAL COMMERCE 
PLATFORM 
 A  virtual world is a site for online communities situated in 
a computer-generated setting, where users socialize and 
work with one another through the use of avatars. Objects, 
jobs, homes, and businesses are created in a 3D environment, 
and are owned by the residents. It is an interactive environ-
ment, which is fun and satisfying. Virtual worlds (also 
referred to as  digital worlds or  metaverse ), usually structured 
as interactive 3D virtual environments, and are created for 
users to inhabit and interact. Users feel as if they are actually 
within the environment because they have the ability to con-
trol certain features of the virtual world. Virtual worlds, 
according to Wikipedia, initially appeared in massively mul-
tiplayer online games; however, they are not limited to 
games. Players can create a character that travels between 
buildings, towns, and even planets and stars, as well as con-
duct activities there. In a virtual world, you can be anyone 
you want. You can build a dream house, decorate it, have a 
job, or ﬂ y a  spaceship. For a comprehensive overview, see 
Malaby ( 2009 ). For research issues see Wasko et al.  2011 . To 
learn more about Seconds Life, see  wiki.secondlife.com/
wiki/Video_Tutorials , and the video titled “Philip Rosedale: 
Seconds Life, Where Anything Is Possible” (28:31 minutes) 
at  youtube.com/watch?v=lHXXsEtE3b4 . 
 Major Features 
 There are several different types and purposes of virtual 
worlds; however all share the following features (compiled 
from The Virtual Policy Network’s ‘A Virtual Worlds Primer’ 
( virtualpolicy.net/resources/virtual-worlds-primer ), and 
the authors’ experiences: 
 Avatars 
 Residents of virtual worlds can represent themselves by 2D 
or 3D images known as avatars.  Avatars are interactive, ani-
mated, computerized characters that are graphical images 
designed to look like people and are programmed to exhibit 
human behavior. Avatars have unique names and can move 
around. Advanced avatars can “speak” and display behaviors 
such as emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. They can 
be fully automated to act like robots. Avatars are designed to 
gain the trust of users. Many companies use avatars as tour 
guides or to staff virtual reception desks. For a demonstra-
tion of avatars in action, see  meez.com . 
 The purpose of avatars is to make the human–computer 
interface more realistic. Thus, they are sometimes referred 
•  The worlds can be used by many users who access 
them via an online interface. 
•  The interface is mostly 3D, which is more engaging 
than 2D. 
•  All interactions are in real time from anywhere. 
•  Most of the content is user-generated. It is facili-
tated by tools provided on the sites.  
•  The virtual world is always in motion, regardless of 
the presence of its residents. 
•  Socialization is encouraged. Tools are provided for 
engagement and for creating groups and socially- 
oriented activities. 
•  Communication among users can include text, 
graphical icons, visual gestures, video clips, sound, 
and so forth. 
•  Use of avatars is a common way to represent the 
residents of the virtual worlds.  
2.7 Virtual Worlds as a Social Commerce Platform

to as interactive  conversational characters . They are being 
used extensively to support users’ Internet chat with 
 companies (e.g., Live Chat), representing the company’s 
 employees or “help desk.” A popular use is the live chat with 
avatars. You ask questions and the avatar, using natural lan-
guage processing, attempts to understand your questions. 
The avatar then matches an answer from a database to each 
 question. For an example, see “Ted” at TD Ameritrade 
( tdameritrade.com ). Instant-messaging programs such as 
 google.com/hangouts use avatars (e.g., see  hangoutapps.
com ). Avatars can improve customer satisfaction and reten-
tion by offering personalized, one-to-one service. They also 
can help companies get to know their customers in order to 
better design promotions. For more on avatars, you must see 
the 2009 movie  Avatar . 
 Example 1: Jetstar Airline 
 According to  Business Wire ( 2013 ), Nuance Communications, 
Inc. announced that Jetstar “has launched a new virtual assis-
tant called ‘Ask Jess,’ which is based on Nuance Nina Web, 
an intelligent virtual assistant that delivers a human-like, 
conversational customer service experience. Customers sim-
ply type their request to Jess, and Jess provides the answers. 
The new Ask Jess virtual assistant draws on Nuance Nina, an 
intelligent virtual assistant that leverages innovative technol-
ogy for natural language understanding and delivers a con-
versational interface to Web visitors which stimulates human 
conversation. By understanding what customers want, Ask 
Jess makes getting information on booking, baggage, and 
seating easier than navigating pages on a website. Jetstar’s 
‘Ask Jess’ virtual assistant is also fully integrated with the 
company’s existing live chat service.” (To ask Jess a ques-
tion, see  jetstar.com/au/en/customer-service .) 
 Example 2: Market Research 
 Starwood Hotels constructed a prototype of its Aloft brand 
hotels before they were built in 2008. People using Seconds 
Life were asked to view the prototype and give the company 
their opinions on the model. Using the feedback, the com-
pany completed the design and built the hotels.  
 Example 3 
 Avatars guide and advise passengers in airports. As of 2012, 
you can see human-sized avatars acting as greeters in many 
airports in Europe (e.g., Paris) and the U.S. (New York), that 
are there to help passengers by giving them information 
about ground transportation, etc. (see  abcnews.go.com/
Travel/york-airports-introduce-avatars-assist- passengers/
story?id=16957584 ). For a demonstration of the avatars 
in the New York airports, watch WNYC’s video titled 
“Airport Avatar Demonstration” (47 sec.) at  youtube.com/
watch?v=tI3YBf36twk . Advanced avatars can conduct 
vocal conversations with passengers (sometimes in several 
languages). Similar avatars act as guides in some companies, 
universities, and tourist attractions. New York airports are 
developing interactive avatars that allow customers to ask 
questions about the airport (see  digitaltrends.com/cool-
tech/new-york-airports-are-installing-virtual-avatars-
to- help-visitors ). 
 Virtual Shopping 
 You can go shopping with friends while each shopper is 
located at his or her individual home. You enter a virtual 
store in the virtual mall and ﬁ nd jeans on sale. Your avatar 
tries on the jeans (the avatar’s body’s size is the same as 
yours) and displays it to your friends. They provide an 
assessment. Then, if you like it, you may buy the pants online 
or visit the physical store later. Virtual shopping is gaining 
popularity (see Chap.   6 ). 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
  1.  Deﬁ ne the landscape of social media. Social media is 
composed of three parts. First, there are Web 2.0 tools, such 
as blogs or mashups. In addition, there are applications that 
act in a similar fashion to the tools, enabling different activi-
ties. Seconds, there are social network sites and services, 
notably Facebook and LinkedIn. They are equipped with 
the tools and apps. In this seconds category, we also ﬁ nd 
social networks that enable users to conduct many activi-
ties, including media sharing (such as YouTube), or support 
communication (such as Twitter). The third category is the 
activities people conduct with the help of social media 
and its tools, such as sharing, interacting, recommending 
products, and connecting with people. 
 The previously noted parts are interconnected via net-
works of people, organizations, technology, and society. 
  2.  Web 2.0 characteristics. Web 2.0, the seconds generation 
of the Web, is based on social computing. It is all about 
people and their interactions and relationships. A major 
characteristic is the generation of content by users and for 
users. These users are engaged in many activities that 
increase trust and loyalty. Web 2.0 also enables the wis-
dom of crowds and several other business models. 
Notable activities are reviews and recommendations, as 
well as the ability to post questions and get answers from 
friends and other people. The many characteristics enable 
the creation of online communities where people with 
similar or shared interests can congregate and act. Web

2.0 operates in an open source technological environ-
ment, and it is ﬂ exible and inexpensive, or completely 
free. 
 3.  The major social media tools. Blogs and wikis are 
 probably the most mature tools of social media. Other 
well- known tools are microblogging, ﬁ le sharing, idea 
generation (ideation), social search engines, recommen-
dation engines, and voting (polling) tools. Web 2.0 tools 
can be combined (e.g., via mashups), and are embedded 
in many social networks. They are also used extensively 
inside enterprises (e.g., blogs in a company’s portal). 
 4.  Social networks. Social networks are websites for large 
Internet communities. The networks enable sharing of 
content including text, videos, voice, and photos. Social 
networks promote online socialization and interaction. 
Many thousands of networks are popping up around the 
world, some of which are global. These social networks 
compete for advertising money. Millions of corporations 
advertise, entertain, and even sell on social networks. 
 Business-oriented communities concentrate on busi-
ness issues, either in only one country or worldwide (e.g., 
conducting recruiting, ﬁ nding business partners). Social 
marketplaces meld social networks and some aspects of 
business. Notable business-oriented social networks are 
LinkedIn and XING. Some companies use their own pri-
vate social networks, whereas others conduct business in 
public social networks, such as Facebook. Enterprise 
social networks are those owned and operated inside one 
company. Their members usually are present and former 
employees. Business networks are used mainly for col-
laboration, recruiting, personal networking, knowledge 
creation preservation and sharing, training, and socializa-
tion. Many large companies have such networks (e.g., 
IBM, Wells Fargo, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and Disney). 
  5.  Mobile social commerce. Many users of social networks 
are also users of wireless technologies. Therefore, conduct-
ing business as mobile commerce is exploding in social net-
works and in mobile applications in the enterprise. In 
addition, there is an explosive growth in social entertainment 
and gaming, part of which is commercial. All major social 
networks enable wireless activities. In fact, some social busi-
ness models (notably location-based services) are delivered 
mostly wirelessly. Social and business connections can be 
made in real time or close to it (e.g., via Twitter).  
 6.  Crowdsourcing . Crowdsourcing is a process of outsourc-
ing work, including problem solving to large communi-
ties (a crowd). The community members can be chosen 
based on the nature of the tasks to be performed. The 
technology is used for idea-generation, performing large 
tasks, social collaboration, and facilitating engagement. 
It is considered a social commerce activity because 
 certain applications, such as team problem solving, and 
crowdfunding involve social interactions. Crowdfunding 
involves raising small amounts of money from a group of 
individuals for purposes such as funding a start-up com-
pany or contributing to a cause. Crowdfunding is usually 
done on the Internet. 
 7.  Virtual worlds.  Virtual worlds provide entertainment 
and education through trading virtual properties, discus-
sion groups, learning, training, and much more. 
Everything in a virtual world is simulated, animated, and 
supported by avatars. Starting with playing 3D games, 
people can create imaginary worlds where they can do 
almost anything they like. They can build virtual houses, 
cities, schools, or factories, and then do almost anything 
they can imagine there. Thousands of companies have 
established presences in virtual worlds, especially in 
Seconds Life, which also offers dissemination of infor-
mation and advertising.

 OPENING CASE: NETFLIX INCREASES 
SALES USING MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS 
BY CUSTOMERS 
 Netﬂ ix ( netﬂ ix.com ) is the world’s largest online movie and 
TV show (streaming library) rental company, with more than 
57 million paid subscribers worldwide (Q4 2014). Netﬂ ix’s 
customers receive DVDs either by mail from an extensive 
selection or by streaming media (of selected titles) over the 
Internet to PCs, tablets, smartphones and TVs, allowing con-
sumers to watch them immediately. Netﬂ ix also offers origi-
nal series (e.g.  House of Cards ,  Orange is the New Black ), 
which are very successful. Among the ever-expanding base 
of devices compatible for streaming, Netﬂ ix includes game 
consoles (e.g., Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Nintendo’s Wii, and 
Sony’s PS3 and PS4); Blu-ray disc players; HD TVs; Apple’s 
TV, iPhone, and iPad; set top boxes (e.g., Roku); and hand-
held devices (e.g., Amazon’s Kindle, Barnes & Noble’s 

48
Nook). In all, more than 200 devices can stream Netﬂ ix. The 
company’s success is built on providing a large selection of 
DVDs, an easy to navigate catalog, recommendations of 
what to view based on users’ taste preferences, and fast, free 
delivery. Netﬂ ix distributes millions of video programs each 
day. The growth history of Netﬂ ix is described by Gallaugher 
( 2008 ) and Smith ( 2014 ). 
 The Problem 
 Because of the large number of available titles, customers 
often have difﬁ culty deciding what they want to watch. 
Often, customers choose the most recent and popular titles, 
which means that Netﬂ ix has to stock many copies of the 
same title to send via postal mail. In addition, some less pop-
ular titles do not rent well, even though they could match 
many customers’ preferences. For Netﬂ ix, it is critical to best 
match titles with customers’ proﬁ les, yet maintain a reason-
able level of DVD inventory. 
 A seconds major problem facing Netﬂ ix is the competi-
tive nature of the movie rental business (e.g., see  us-dvd-
rental- websites.no1reviews.com ). 
Netﬂ ix 
competes 
against several online rental companies (e.g., Café DVD), 
as well as against companies such as Amazon Instant Video 
and Hulu and Hulu Plus that offer movies, TV shows, and 
videos to download and watch instantly. DVD rentals, at 
prices as low as $1/day (e.g. Redbox), are also being offered 
from kiosks located at supermarkets and malls. In 2008, 
Blockbuster started offering online movie rental subscrip-
tions, but shut down this service in 2013. In 2013, 
Blockbuster started a video streaming service called 
Blockbuster On Demand ( blockbusternow.com ), offering 
thousands of movies available on devices such as PCs, tab-
lets, and Roku. (Blockbuster closed its physical stores in 
2013.) Other online content providers such as Apple iTunes, 
the television broadcast companies, and Google Play have 
also become direct competitors. HBO is planning a stream-
ing service in 2015, but Netﬂ ix believes that both compa-
nies will prosper since they have different shows; however, 
according to Morgan Stanley, increased competition from 
Amazon, Hulu, and HBO GO “could take away Netﬂ ix’s 
ability to grow its subscriber base in 2014” (see  forbes.
com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/01/07/amazon- and-hulu-
could-slow-netflix-growth-in-2014- morgan-stanley-
says ). Another issue is that there is a clear trend for more 
and more viewers to watch videos online (some for free). 
Hence, in 2008, Netﬂ ix decided to bring a “watch instantly” 
service to attract Internet subscribers. Netﬂ ix wants to rid 
itself of the DVD business since online streaming has no 
shipping costs. Redbox started an online streaming service, 
but it was not successful.  
 The Solution 
 Netﬂ ix reacted successfully to the issue of matching view-
ers and movies and the competitive pressure with a recom-
mendation service that was called  Cinematch (it is now 
referred to as “ recommendation algorithm ”). This service 
uses data mining tools to analyze more than three billion 
ﬁ lm ratings made by customers, as well as through histories 
of customers’ rentals. Using proprietary algorithms, the sys-
tem recommends to customers what titles to watch. It is a 
personalization service similar to the one offered by 
Amazon.com that recommends books to customers. The 
recommendation is accomplished by comparing an individ-
ual’s preferences with people that have similar tastes, by 
using the  collaborative ﬁ ltering software (described later in 
this chapter). 
 For the accuracy of their matching algorithms, Netﬂ ix 
started a contest in October 2006, offering $1 million to 
the ﬁ rst person or team to write a computer program that 
would beat Cinematch’s prediction accuracy by 10 %. The 
company understood that this would take quite some time; 
therefore, it offered a $50,000 Progress Prize each year the 
contest ran. After more than 2 years of competition, the 
grand prize of $1 million went to “BellKor’s Pragmatic 
Chaos,” a 7-member team. Netﬂ ix’s recommendation sys-
tem is constantly changing and improving. For example, in 
2013, Netﬂ ix introduced “Max,” a new personal recom-
mendation system that talks back to the user (for use with 
PlayStation, but will roll out to other devices [e.g., iPad] in 
the future). For a description of “Max” and how it works, 
see 
 blog.netﬂ ix.com/2013/06/let-max-be-your-netﬂ ix-
guide-on-ps3.html . 
 Netﬂ ix subscribers can also invite one another to become 
“friends” and make movie recommendations directly to each 
other, view one another’s rental lists, and share movies rating 
using a social network called  FriendsSM. All of these per-
sonalized functions make the online rental store very cus-
tomer friendly. 
 In March 2013, Netﬂ ix unveiled a sharing program called 
“Netﬂ ix Social.” You can connect your Netﬂ ix account with 
Facebook to connect you with your friends that use Netﬂ ix. 
Social features include sending recommendations to 
Facebook friends, and sharing what you watch with them 
automatically. For information, see  slashgear.com/netﬂ ix-

 The Result 
 Netﬂ ix has seen very fast growth in sales and membership. 
The beneﬁ ts of the algorithms-based recommendation sys-
tem include the following: 
 Netﬂ ix advertises extensively on the Web using several 
promotional techniques. Primarily, it places static banner ads 
on high-trafﬁ c sites, but it also uses permission-based e-mail 
marketing, blogs, social networks, classiﬁ eds, Really Simple 
Syndication (RSS) feeds, and more. The domain  netﬂ ix.com 
attracted over 34 million unique visitors in October 2014, 
according to Compete.com (go to  siteanalytics.compete.
com/netﬂ ix.com/#.VFao0vnF-So for more information). 
 The recommendation system has become the company’s 
core competency. Netﬂ ix’s future depends heavily on this 
system making accurate recommendations and subscribers 
accepting them, which is why Netﬂ ix strives to increase the 
system’s accuracy. For the science behind these algorithms,

 LEARNING ABOUT ONLINE 
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 
 Companies are operating in an increasingly competitive 
environment: therefore, sellers must try to understand cus-
tomers’ needs and inﬂ uence them to buy their products and 
services. Customer acquisition and retention are key success 
factors, both ofﬂ ine and online. This is particularly impor-
tant for online businesses, as most interactions with their 
customers are online. For a summary of factors affecting 
consumer behavior, see  aipmm.com/html/newsletter/
archives/000434.php .

shopping-habits-behavior-0952526 . 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS CASE 
 This case illustrates the use of the social Web to inﬂ u-
ence customers. In particular, Netﬂ ix uses software 
intelligent agents in its recommendation system to 
gain a substantial advantage over its competitors by 
making personalized movie recommendations to inﬂ u-
ence its members to rent DVDs that they might possi-
bly like, based on previously viewed ﬁ lms. Netﬂ ix’s 
recommendation algorithms are designed to increase 
customer satisfaction and loyalty. The algorithms use 
several theories to create recommendations; one is 
inﬂ uencing consumer behavior via other customers’ 
reviews and recommendations, another one is by 
checking what customers with similar proﬁ les are 
ordering, and inferring from that data what a speciﬁ c 
customer may like; and yet another is using a large 
number of reviewers to build a knowledge base and 
use it for an input to the recommendation algorithms. 
 Several consumer behaviors and other theories are 
related to social commerce. In this chapter, we will 
deal mainly with those relating to inﬂ uencing people’s 
buying decisions. These include consumer behavior 
models (generic), online consumer behavior, consumer 
behavior in social commerce, word of mouth, social 
psychology, online collaborative ﬁ ltering, ratings, 
reviews and recommendations, social inﬂ uence, social 
capital, and social support. 
•  Effective recommendations. Approximately 60 % 
of Netﬂ ix members select their movies based on 
one-to-one movie recommendations.  
•  Customer satisfaction. Before 2011, more than 
90 % of Netﬂ ix members said they were fully satis-
ﬁ ed with Netﬂ ix. Customer satisfaction dropped 
signiﬁ cantly in 2011 when Netﬂ ix hiked up their 
prices for instant streaming service and divided 
DVDs by mail in to a separate service. (Satisfaction 
picked up as of 2013.)  
•  Finance. Netﬂ ix has experienced a signiﬁ cant 
growth in membership and ﬁ nancial performance. 
•  Ratings. Netﬂ ix has more than 3.5 billion movie 
ratings from members in their database. (Each 
member has rated about 200 movies.)  
•  Rental habits.  Members rent twice as many movies 
per month as they did prior to getting the recom-
mendations. As a result, the rental queues (movies 
members want to rent) grew rapidly. 
•  According to the  Hufﬁ ngton Post , 75 % of what 
people watch on Netﬂ ix comes from the site’s rec-
ommendations ( hufﬁ ngtonpost.com/2013/08/07/
netﬂ ix-movie-suggestions_n_3720218.html ). 
3.1 Learning About Online Consumer Behavior

50
 This section is divided into three parts: First, we introduce 
the generic topic of consumer behavior. Then, we move to 
online behavior, and ﬁ nally, we present consumer behavior 
in the social commerce environment. 
 A Model of Consumer Behavior 
 For decades, market researchers have tried to understand 
consumer shopping behavior, and develop various models to 
summarize their ﬁ ndings. 
 Consumers can be divided into two groups: individual 
consumers and organizational buyers, including govern-
ments, private corporations, resellers, and nonproﬁ t organi-
zations. These two types of buyers tend to have different 
purchasing behaviors and usually are analyzed differently. 
In this chapter, we focus on individual buyers. 
 An individual consumer behavior model often includes 
 inﬂ uential internal and external factors that affect the buyer’s 
 decision process and the process for making a purchasing 
decision. 
 Figure  3.1 shows a consumer behavioral model, which is 
divided into the following two parts:
•  Inﬂ uential factors . Factors inﬂ uencing purchasing deci-
sions fall into ﬁ ve major dimensions. They are:  consumer 
characteristics, environmental factors, merchant and 
intermediary factors, product/service factors (which 
include market stimuli), and  EC selling systems . The ﬁ rst 
three dimensions are not controllable by the sellers, while 
the last two are mostly controlled by the sellers. The 
dimensions are shown in Fig.  3.1 . The inﬂ uential factors 
affect the buyers’ decision process. (For more about fac-
tors that inﬂ uence the online shopping experience, see 
 blog.profitero.com/competitor-monitoring-what- 
factors-influence-the-online-shopping-experience- 
comscore  , and Perreau  2013 ). 
•  The attitude-behavior decision process . The inﬂ uential 
factors affect the buyers’ decision process. The seconds 
part of a consumer behavior model is the decision-mak-
ing process, which usually starts with an awareness of 
the situation and a positive attitude, and ends with the 
buyer’s decision to purchase and/or repurchase (see the

oval part in Fig.  3.1 ). A  favorable attitude  would lead to 
a stronger  buying intention , which in turn would result in 
the  actual purchase and repurchase behavior . Previous 
research has shown that the links between attitude, pur-
chase intention, and actual purchase and repurchase 
behavior are quite strong.  
 The Major Inﬂ uential Factors 
 Major inﬂ uential factors of consumer purchasing behavior 
fall into the following categories: 
 Consumer Characteristics 
 Consumer (personal) characteristics, which are shown in the 
top-left portion of Fig.  3.1 , refer to  demographic  factors, indi-
vidual  preferences , and  behavioral  characteristics (e.g., social 
psychological variables). Several websites provide informa-
tion on online customer buying habits (e.g.,  emarketer.com , 
 clickz.com ,  and  comscore.com ). The major demographics 
that such sites track are gender, age, marital status, race, edu-
cational level, and occupation (some are listed in Fig.  3.1 ), 
which can be correlated with Internet usage and SC data. For 
example, both males and females have been found to perceive 
market information differently, depending on their levels of 
purchase, conﬁ dence, and internal knowledge. Several stud-
ies show that shopping experience has a signiﬁ cant effect on 
consumer attitude and intention to purchase and repurchase 
online (e.g., Crespo and del Bosque  2010 ; Chiu et al.  2014 ). 
 Marketers also study psychological variables, such as per-
sonality and lifestyle characteristics. These variables are 
brieﬂ y mentioned in several places throughout this book. To 
read about the impact of lifestyle differences on online shop-
ping, see Wang et al. ( 2006 ). 
 Merchant and Intermediary-Related Factors 
 Online transactions may also be affected by the merchant that 
provides the product/service. This group of factors includes 
merchant reputation, size of the transaction, trust in the mer-
chant, and so on. For example, people generally feel more 
secure when they purchase from Amazon.com (due to its repu-
tation) than from an unknown seller. Other factors such as 
marketing strategy and advertising can also play a major role. 
 Product/Services Factors 
 Another group of factors is related to the product/service 
itself. The consumer’s decision to make a purchase is affected 
by the nature of the product/service in the transaction. These 
factors may include the price, appearance, quality, design, 
brand, and other related attributes of the product.  
 EC and/or Social Commerce Trading Systems 
 The EC (and SC) platforms for online transactions (e.g., 
security protection, payment mechanism, and so forth) 
offered by the merchant and the type of computing environ-
ment (e.g., mobile vs. desktop) may also have effects. EC 
design factors can be divided into payment and logistics sup-
port, website features, and consumer services. Liang and Lai 
( 2002 ) classiﬁ ed them into  motivational and  hygiene factors 
and found motivational factors to be more important than 
hygiene factors in attracting online customers. Another fac-
tor that we include here is the type of EC. For example, con-
sumer behavior in m-commerce may be unique and so is 
behavior during social shopping. 
 Motivational Factors 
 Motivational factors are functions available on the website to 
directly support the purchasing process (e.g., search engine, 
shopping carts, multiple payment methods).  
 Hygiene Factors 
 Hygiene factors are functions available on the website. Their 
objective is to make the website functional and serviceable 
(e.g., ease of navigation, show items added to the cart); their 
main purpose is to protect consumers from risks or unex-
pected events in the transaction process (e.g., security 
breaching and site technical failure). 
 Environmental Factors 
 The environment in which a transaction occurs may affect a 
consumer’s purchase decision. As shown in Fig.  3.1 , envi-
ronmental variables can be grouped into the following 
categories: 
 Social Variables 
 People are inﬂ uenced by family members, friends, cowork-
ers, and current styles. Therefore, social variables (such as 
customer recommendations, word of mouth) play an impor-
tant role in SC. Of special importance in SC are social net-
works and discussion groups, where people communicate 
via chat rooms, electronic bulletin boards, tweeting, and 
newsgroups. A study by Liang et al. ( 2011 /2012) shows that 
social support in online communities signiﬁ cantly enhances 
the intention to purchase online.  
3.1 Learning About Online Consumer Behavior

52
 Cultural/Community Variables 
 The inﬂ uence of culture on buying behavior varies between 
countries and regions (e.g., rural vs. urban areas). For exam-
ple, the purchases made by consumers in California’s Silicon 
Valley will likely be different from those made by individu-
als who live in the mountains in Nepal. Bashir ( 2013 ) con-
ducted a comprehensive study about online shopping for 
electronics in Pakistan. 
 Other Environment Variables 
 These include aspects such as available public information, 
government regulations, legal constraints, and situational 
factors. For example, tax rates (Chap.   11  ) may affect online 
shopping (see Einav et al.  2014 ). 
 Note that this model may be somewhat different in the 
mobile environment. For information on mobile marketing, 
browse  mashable.com/category/mobile-marketing . 
 We now turn to the process that buyers use while making 
product-purchasing decisions (the center of Fig.  3.1 ) and its 
relevant models. 
3.2 
 THE CONSUMER 
PURCHASING-DECISION PROCESS 
 In Sect.  3.1 we described the factors inﬂ uencing the con-
sumer purchasing decision. Here, we describe the process of 
purchasing. 
 Several models were developed in an attempt to under-
stand and explain the consumer’s purchasing process deci-
sion. We will describe two major categories of these models. 
The ﬁ rst is a model developed from the perspective of mana-
gerial decision making. The seconds is a model developed 
from the marketing management perspective. 
 The purchasing decision process is another major element 
in analyzing consumer behavior. It is composed of several 
phases, as discussed next. A generic model is introduced below. 
 Generic Purchasing Decision-Making Phases: 
A Managerial Decision-Making Approach 
 From the consumer’s perspective, a generic purchasing- 
decision model for decisions involving ﬁ nancial, social, or 
other factors (e.g., high involvement) consists of a sequential 
process of ﬁ ve major phases (Hawkins and Mothersbaugh 
 2012 ). In each phase, we can distinguish several activities 
and, in some, more than one decision. The ﬁ ve phases are (1) 
 need identiﬁ cation , (2)  information search , (3)  evaluation of 
alternatives , (4)  purchase and delivery , and (5)  post- purchase 
activities . Although these phases offer a general guide to the 
consumer decision-making process, one should not assume 
that every consumer’s decision-making process necessarily 
proceeds in this order. In fact, some consumers may proceed 
to a speciﬁ c decision point and then revert to a previous 
phase, or they may skip a phase altogether. The ﬁ ve phases 
are discussed next in more detail. 
 1.  Need identiﬁ cation. The ﬁ rst phase in the pur-
chasing process is for a customer to recognize a 
need. This occurs when a consumer is faced with a 
gap between the current state of what the customer 
has and the desired state (e.g., his mobile phone 
needs a useful new feature, such as a bigger 
screen). A consumer can recognize a need in dif-
ferent ways (e.g., by internal stimuli, hunger or 
thirst; or external stimuli, exposure to an adver-
tisement). A marketer’s goal is to get the consumer 
to recognize such a gap and then convince the con-
sumer that the product or service the seller offers 
will fulﬁ ll the need.  
 2.  Information search.  Once the need has been rec-
ognized, the customer seeks information on how to 
fulﬁ ll that need. Here, we differentiate between two 
decisions: what product to buy ( product brokering ) 
and from whom to buy it ( merchant brokering ). 
These two decisions can be separate or combined. 
The consumer’s search for information, catalogs, 
advertisements, promotions, and reference groups 
could inﬂ uence decision making. During this phase, 
online product searches and comparison engines 
can be very helpful. See examples at  shopping.
com ,  pricegrabber.com , and  mysimon.com , as 
well as discussions in some social networks.  
 3.  Evaluation of alternatives. The information search 
usually yields a few feasible options. From these, 
the would-be buyer will further evaluate the alter-
natives and, if possible, negotiate terms. In this 
phase, a consumer needs to generate and rank crite-
ria for making the ﬁ nal choice. For online consum-
ers, the criteria may include product prices, payment 
terms, and product features. 
 4.  Purchase and delivery. After evaluating the alter-
natives, the consumer will make the purchasing 
decision, arrange for payment and delivery, pur-
chase warranties, and so on. 
  5.  Post-purchase activities. The ﬁ nal phase in the pro-
cess is a post-purchase phase, which consists of cus-
tomer service and evaluation of the usefulness of the 
product. Customer service and consumer satisfaction 
will result in a positive experience and positive word 
of mouth and/or positive written reviews (e.g., “This 
product is really great!” or “We really received good

 The Consumer Brand Decision-Making 
Process Models 
 Marketers often view the purchasing decision model as a 
three-phase process, which they use for designing marketing 
communication strategies and tactics. These phases are: 
 If the consumer forms a positive attitude, it may trans-
form a  buying intention into an actual purchase. Marketing 
research has shown that the linkages among these three 
phases are quite strong. Therefore, developing a positive 
consumer  attitude about the product and website experience 
plays a central role in the ﬁ nal purchase decision. 
 This decision-making model, displayed in a circular fash-
ion in Fig.  3.2 , reﬂ ects the idea that consumers can begin 
activities at any point on the circle and not necessarily pro-
ceed in any regular order, as previously mentioned. The fol-
lowing sections describe two variations of this model.
 The AIDA Model 
 The  Attention-Interest-Desire-Action (AIDA)  model describes 
a common set of events that may occur as a reaction to an 
advertisement. (Some add “S” for satisfaction, to form 
AIDAS.) The model is commonly used by advertisers to cre-
ate messages that inﬂ uence a buyer’s awareness, attitude, or 
behavior (see  mindtools.com/pages/article/AIDA.htm and 
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDA_(marketing) ). This model 
argues that consumer processing of an advertisement or other 
promotional message includes the following events or stages: 
 Fig. 3.2   Social commerce brand decision process 
 1.  Awareness and knowledge of the product’s features 
and beneﬁ ts. This is a cognitive stage happening 
inside the consumer’s mind. 
 2.  Attitude about the product (positive or negative). 
This stage is about the consumer’s feelings, such as 
liking, disliking, or preferring the product and post- 
purchase satisfaction level. 
 3.  Behavior involves the consumer actually doing 
something, such as purchasing, repurchasing, writ-
ing an online product review, or visiting a website.  
 1.  A—Attention (awareness). The ﬁ rst step is to get the 
customer’s attention (e.g., be quick and direct; use 
powerful words or phrases to catch a customer’s 
eye). This is done usually by advertising.  
 2.  I—Interest . By demonstrating features, advantages, 
and beneﬁ ts, the customer becomes interested in 
the product (e.g., engage the customers by getting 
them interested). 
 3.  D—Desire . After evaluation, the consumer gener-
ates a desire to acquire the product or service (e.g., 
build the reader’s interest and create a desire in 
them—a motivation to act).  
 4.  A—Action . Finally, the consumer will take action 
toward purchasing (e.g., act on their desires and buy 
the product/service). 
 5.  S—Satisfaction . Customer post-purchase satisfac-
tion will generate higher loyalty and lead to repur-
chase after using a product/service. 
service when we had problems”). If the customer is 
satisﬁ ed with the product and services, loyalty will 
increase, repeat purchases will occur, and the cus-
tomer will recommend the product to others. 
Alternatively, unsatisﬁ ed customers may dissemi-
nate negative word of mouth (see the discussion of 
reputation management in Chap.   5  ).  
 
3.2 The Consumer Purchasing-Decision Process 

54
  A recent version of AIDA is the AISAS model proposed 
by the Dentsu Group,  dentsu.com/crossswitch/diction-
ary/index.html that is tailored to online behavior. The 
model replaces  desire with  search and adds  share  to show 
the increased word-of-mouth effect on the Internet. It 
indicates that consumers go through a process of 
 Attention-Interest- Search-Action-Share  in their online 
decision  process. The model, which is particularly suitable 
to social commerce, is described next. 
 Social Commerce Brand Decision Process 
 The Dentsu Group model is particularly suitable for social 
commerce, so we have integrated it into the appropriate areas 
in Fig.  3.2 . The center of this model reﬂ ects actions particu-
lar to social commerce. Buyers use Google and other search 
engines during their information search and product evalua-
tion stages. They share this information with others before, 
during, and after their purchase. Marketers make sharing 
easy by providing “like” buttons, comment boxes, and sev-
eral other tactics (discussed throughout this book). Finally, 
consumers read and write recommendations on product 
review sites, social networks, and other online sites. For a 
video from Reevoo regarding these and other consumer SC 
shopping habits, titled “Consumer Research on Social 
Commerce” (3:06 minutes), see  vimeo.com/25357746 . For 
consumer behavior in social media, see Heinonen ( 2011 ). 
 Players in the Consumer Decision-Making Process 
 Several different people may play roles in various phases of 
the purchasing decision process. In B2B, they usually act as 
a team to make the buying decision(s). The following are 
ﬁ ve major roles: 
 The roles apply both to the organizational and to the indi-
vidual consumer buying process. For example, a recent col-
lege graduate (initiator, decider, and buyer) considered 
buying a car for his mother (user), and his father and friends 
(inﬂ uencers) offered brand suggestions. Finally, he took his 
father’s advice and purchased the car. 
 The sellers need to decide which of the roles is more 
important to be inﬂ uenced and try to do it. Sellers should use 
the most beneﬁ cial role to inﬂ uence the buyer based on each 
situation. 
 In social media, we can use a variation of these roles that 
include: 
 Example: Inﬂ uencers at Sony
 Dragon ( 2014 ) describes Sony’s  Sony Club , an annual pro-
gram for recruiting successful bloggers to act as inﬂ uencers. 
The selected bloggers need to have a natural afﬁ nity for the 
brand. The bloggers, who are not paid for their time (but are 
reimbursed for all expenses), attend a 3-day conference where 
they are provided with Sony products. After the conference, 
the bloggers share their experience and review the products.  
 Note 
 A study conducted in April 2013 by First Direct ( ﬁ rstdirect.
com ) found 12 social media personalities: the dippers, the 
ultras, the deniers, the virgins, the lurkers, the peacocks, the 
ranters, the changelings, the ghosts, the informers, the 
 quizzers, and the approval seekers. For deﬁ nitions of these 
and more details, see  newsroom.ﬁ rstdirect.com/press/

revealed . See also “A New Breed of Social Media 
Personalities” at  pinterest.com/pin/16888567325374584 . 
 When more than one individual is involved in the buying 
process, it becomes more difﬁ cult to properly target social 
commerce marketing communications strategies. Different 
marketing efforts may be designed to target people who are 
playing different roles. This is especially true when those 
responsible for the buying decision in a business are consid-
ering purchasing online. Note that major enterprise purchases 
 1.  Followers. These are social media users (the major-
ity) who seek advice from others and are inﬂ uenced 
by the advice. 
 2.  Inﬂ uencers. These are people who have large net-
works of followers, or have reputations as being 
experts and fair (e.g., bloggers, review writers). 
 3.  Advocates.  These are usually loyal customers who 
are satisﬁ ed with certain products or services and 
are willing, when asked, to provide testimonials to 
this effect. 
 1.  Initiator. The person who recognizes and suggests 
the need to buy a speciﬁ c product or service. 
 2.  Inﬂ uencer. A person who tries to convince other 
people to make a purchase. 
 3.  Decider. The person who makes the ﬁ nal buying 
decision. 
 4.  Buyer. The person who purchases the product or 
service and pays for it. 
 5.  User. The customer who uses the product.

are being made by several users, inﬂ uencers, buyers, and so 
on. In such cases, there is a group decision process.  
 Corporate Buyers’ Behavior and the Players 
in the Buyer Decision Process 
 Buyers for businesses and governments are also inﬂ uenced 
by most of the factors in Fig.  3.1 . The main difference is that 
corporate buyers’ characteristics do not play as big a role; 
nevertheless, the buyers are often motivated by personal 
desires 
for 
promotion, 
pay 
increases, 
and 
career 
marketability─for example, getting a great bargain with an 
online purchase can help the buyer’s reputation as an efﬁ -
cient employee. 
 Consumer Behavior in Social Media 
and Commerce 
 Understanding both online and ofﬂ ine consumer behavior 
can be helpful, but in social commerce, we are especially 
interested in knowing about consumer behavior in social 
media systems, and particularly in social networks. One 
issue is that many people come to social networks to social-
ize and not to conduct business. However, this situation is 
changing. More users come to social networks for both 
“pleasure and business.” For example, rating and recommen-
dations for products (Chap.   6 ) have become popular. One 
issue for sellers is to identify the speciﬁ c behavior relevant to 
their customers’ social commerce activity. According to 
Rayson ( 2013 ), vendors can enhance their social media strat-
egy if they know the various personalities and roles of their 
customers. For more information, see  conversionxl.com/how-to-use-
social-media-to-drive-sales . 
 One of the major social networks that increases its com-
mercial activities by learning and manipulating consumer 
behavior is Facebook. For example, in 2013 the company 
stopped direct sales of real products, concentrating on selling 
virtual products. Many researchers and consultants have 
investigated this topic, ranging from how social media inﬂ u-
ences purchasing behavior (Peneycad  2013 ), to using social 
media to market to women (Walter  2013 ). For other aspects, 
see Lee ( 2012 ). 
 The Shop.org Study 
 A joint study conducted in 2011 by Shop.org, comScore.
com, and Social Shopping Labs found some interesting facts 
about consumer behavior in social commerce. Partial results 
were reported by Grannis ( 2011 ). The results include data in 
how customers interact with Facebook, Twitter, and registered 
blogs. The study also surveyed group-buying and location- 
based sites. 
 What Prompts Users to Share on Social Media 
 Sharing content is a major behavior on social media. One rea-
son is that sharing helps deﬁ ne the user’s personality. Another 
reason is “to promote an issue.” For ﬁ nding your social media 
personality, see  pinterest.com/pin/16888567325446527 and 
Exercise #9 in “Topics for Discussion and Debates” at the end 
of this chapter.  
3.3 
 PERSONALIZATION AND BEHAVIORAL 
MARKETING 
 A major characteristic of Internet-based social commerce (as 
well as with many ofﬂ ine purchases) is that consumers are 
inﬂ uenced by recommendations made by family, friends, 
other customers, and experts. Such recommendations can be 
general to all buyers (e.g., service or product ratings/reviews), 
or they can be targeted to a speciﬁ c individual, such as in the 
Netﬂ ix case. 
 There are several major ways that recommendations can 
be done online. First, customers may initiate a request to 
friends or other consumers (e.g., via e-mail, text message, 
tweet, or post a query on Yahoo! Answers). Seconds, com-
panies (e.g., as done by Netﬂ ix and Amazon.com) may 
attempt to make individually tailored recommendations 
based on a speciﬁ c consumer’s social interactions or prefer-
ences, or based on that of similar customers. For example, 
vendors can integrate Facebook Platform (formerly 
Facebook Connect) with a user’s proﬁ le to connect to a site, 
or they can use ‘social sign-on,’ also known as ‘social login,’ 
which is a single sign-in using existing information from a 
social networking site like Facebook. This means that 
brands can access users’ social activity to present them with 
the products or services that are tailored to their tastes. Most 
large online retailers have already implemented social sign-
on into their sites. 
 In this section, we will address three key methods relating 
to social commerce:  personalization ,  behavioral targeting , 
and  collaborative ﬁ ltering . All these methods intend to inﬂ u-
ence customers to buy. 
 Personalization in Social Commerce 
 Personalization refers to the matching of services, products, 
and/or marketing communication content to individuals, 
based on their preferences. The matching process is based 
on what a company knows about the individual user. This 
knowledge usually is expressed in a  user proﬁ le. The  user 
proﬁ le describes customer preferences, behaviors, and

demographics. It can be created by getting information 
directly, by observing the user’s online clicking behavior 
(i.e., what people are doing online), or by asking customers 
to ﬁ ll in a questionnaire. Another way for vendors to create 
proﬁ les is through the use of software tools such as a cookie 
(also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser 
cookie), which is a data ﬁ le that is placed, without the knowl-
edge of a user, on the user’s hard drive. For details about 
‘cookies,’ see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie and 
 searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/cookie . 
In addition, proﬁ les can be built from previous purchase pat-
terns. Finally, vendors can build proﬁ les by conducting mar-
keting research (as in the Netﬂ ix case) or by making 
inferences from information known to them about similar 
customers. 
 Once a customer proﬁ le is constructed, a company can 
match the proﬁ le with a database of products, services, or 
marketing promotions. Manual matching is a time- consuming 
and expensive process; therefore, the matching process is 
usually done by software (intelligent) agents. One-to-one 
matching can be implemented by using one of several differ-
ent methods. One well-known method is  collaborative ﬁ lter-
ing (discussed later in this section). 
 Many vendors provide personalization tools that help in 
customer acquisition and retention. Examples of such ven-
dors are Sidecar ( hello.getsidecar.com ) and Magnify360 
( magnify360.com ). For a comparison of personalization 
done in e-commerce and social commerce see Li and 
Karahanna ( 2012 ). 
 Web Cookies in Social Commerce 
 Cookies are small ﬁ les sent from a website and stored in a 
designated area in your computer. They allow companies to 
save certain information for future use. According to 
Webopedia, “the main purpose of cookies is to identify users 
and possibly prepare customized Web pages for them” (per 
 webopedia.com/TERM/C/cookie.html ). 
 The use of cookies is a well-known method of monitoring 
consumers that enables the identiﬁ cation of a customer dur-
ing future visits to the same computer (see  whatarecookies.
com ). Are cookies bad or good? The answer is “both.” When 
users revisit Amazon.com or other sites, they are greeted by 
their ﬁ rst name. Amazon.com knows a user’s identity by 
using cookies. Vendors can provide consumers with consid-
erable personalized services if they use cookies that signal a 
consumer’s return to a site. Cookies can provide marketers 
with a wealth of information, which can then be used to tar-
get speciﬁ c ads to customers. The vendors can then recom-
mend products similar to what the customer previously 
purchased. A variation of cookies is known as  e-sugging 
(“SUG-ing,” from “selling under the guise of research”). 
 Thus, marketers get higher rates of “click-throughs,” 
and customers can view information that is most relevant 
to them. Cookies can also prevent repetitive ads because 
vendors can arrange for a consumer to not see the same ad 
twice. Finally, advanced data mining companies (e.g., 
such as SPSS and Sift) can analyze information collected 
and stored in cookie ﬁ les so vendors can better meet their 
customers’ needs. 
 However, some people object to cookies because they do 
not like the idea that “someone” is watching their activity on 
the Internet. Users who do not like cookies can disable them. 
On the other hand, some consumers may want to keep the 
“friendly” cookies. For example, many sites recognize a per-
son as a subscriber by accessing their cookies so that they do 
not need to re-register every time they visit the site. 
 Cookies can be removed if the user does not like them. 
For instructions on deleting cookie ﬁ les from your Internet 
browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox), 
see  whitecanyon.com/delete-cookie . 
 Using Personalized Techniques to Increase 
Social Commerce Activities 
 It has become common practice for vendors to provide per-
sonalized services to customers in order to increase cus-
tomer satisfaction and loyalty. A prime example is Amazon.
com, which provides many personalized services, the most 
common one being product recommendations. Amazon.
com automatically generates such recommendations based 
on the buyers’ purchasing and browsing histories, and upon 
the purchasing history of other customers with similar pur-
chasing histories. 
 Personalized services can be facilitated when the compa-
nies know more about their customers. Information for per-
sonalization is provided by vendors such as TowerData.com 
( towerdata.com ; formerly Rapleaf), which offers a service 
that helps businesses learn more about their customers so 
they can personalize content (go to  intelligence.towerdata.
com/developers/personalization-api ). For a free e-book 
about the 40 best ways to personalize your website, see  qub-
itproducts.com/content/40-best-ways-to-personalize . 
 Laengin ( 2013 ) provides a slide presentation on personal-
ization and social commerce. For a vendor that specializes in 
e-commerce personalization and social shopping, see

 Behavioral Targeting and Collaborative 
Filtering 
 A major goal of marketing is to enhance customer value 
through delivering the right product or service to the cus-

tomer. One of the most popular ways of matching ads with 
customers is  behavioral marketing , which is identifying a 
speciﬁ c customer behavior on the Web and designing a mar-
keting plan for this customer accordingly. 
 Behavioral Targeting 
 Behavioral targeting  uses consumer browsing behavior 
information and other information about consumers, to 
design personalized ads that may inﬂ uence consumers better 
than mass advertising does. It also assumes that users with 
similar proﬁ les and past shopping behavior may have similar 
product preferences. Google tests its “interest-based adver-
tising” to make ads more relevant and useful. Representative 
vendors of behavioral targeting tools are PredictAd ( predic-
tad.com ) , Boomerang Digital Marketing Solutions ( boo-
merang.com ) , 
Criteo 
( criteo.com ), 
and 
Conversant 
( conversantmedia.com ). 
 Behavioral targeting refers to the one-to-one targeting 
of ads to consumers base on individuals’ Web-browsing 
behavior, such as search history. Many vendors believe 
that this approach can help them deliver more accurate 
online advertisements to consumers, inﬂ uencing the con-
sumers to buy their products. A well-known example is 
Google AdWords ( google.com/adwords ), which presents 
ads to users on the search engine results pages based on the 
key words typed into the search engine (called “sponsored 
links”). Behavioral targeting can be used on its own or in 
conjunction with other forms of targeting, such as using 
the customers’ real time location, their demographics, or 
the content they are interested in. Google is offering its 
“interest-based advertising,” in its Display Network 
( google.com/ads/displaynetwork ) to make ads more rel-
evant and useful. For social media behavioral targeting, 
see Lee and Kotler ( 2011 ) and for additional information, 
see Hiam ( 2014 ). A major method of behavioral targeting 
is  collaborative ﬁ ltering .  
 Collaborative Filtering 
 When (or even before) new customers come to a business, it 
would be useful if a company could predict what products or 
services are of interest to them without asking them or view-
ing their previous records. A method that attempts to do just 
that is  collaborative ﬁ ltering . Using proprietary formulas, 
collaborative ﬁ ltering automatically connects the prefer-
ences and activities of many customers that have similar 
characteristics to predict the preferences of new customers 
and to recommend products to them. For a free tutorial of 
119 slides about collaborative ﬁ ltering from Carnegie Mellon 
University, see  Cohen (undated) . Many commercial systems 
are based on collaborative ﬁ ltering. 
 Amazon.com’s “Customers who bought this item also 
bought…” is a typical statement generated by collaborative 
ﬁ ltering, which intends to persuade a consumer to purchase 
the recommended items. 
 For a comprehensive discussion and more information 
about data collection, targeted advertising, and 105 compa-
nies that catch data, and so forth (including an infographic), 
see Madrigal ( 2012 ). 
 Legal and Ethical Issues in Collaborative Filtering 
 A major issue in using collaborative ﬁ ltering for personaliza-
tion is the collection of information from users without their 
consent or knowledge. Such a practice is illegal in many 
countries (e.g., the U.S.) because of the violation of privacy 
laws. Permission-based practices solve this problem. In fact, 
empirical research indicates that permission-based practices 
are able to generate better positive attitude in mobile adver-
tising (Tsang et al.  2004 ). The negative effect of behavioral 
targeting can be seen in the case of Facebook. In June 2014, 
Facebook made a major shift in the way it collects consumer 
data, by announcing that they would now include members’ 
Internet behavior to ﬁ ne-tune its interest-based advertising. 
This means that Facebook collects their members’  external 
Web surﬁ ng behavior and compare it with their members’ 
 internal  behavior on Facebook. This will help advertisers 
better understand users’ interests and provide members with 
more relevant ads (see  ghosteryenterprise.com/facebooks-
new-behavioral-targeting-program- internet-
advertising-hits-high-ghostery-dispatch ). Since there are 
many members who believe their privacy is being violated, 
Facebook is providing them with stronger privacy controls, 
and a way to opt-out of the program by visiting a website 
built by the Digital Advertising Alliance, which lets 
Facebook and other companies know that users do not want 
to receive these specially targeted ads.

 WORD OF MOUTH IN SOCIAL 
COMMERCE 
 As you may recall from Chap.   1  , IBM’s deﬁ nition of social 
commerce states that it is an application of word of mouth. 
Therefore, it follows that a basic understanding of word of 
mouth may be a useful precondition for building a social 
commerce strategy. 
3.4 Word of Mouth in Social Commerce

58
 What Is Word of Mouth (WOM)? 
 According to Investopedia,  word of mouth refers to oral 
communication that passes information from person to per-
son. An important area of marketing is called  word-of-mouth 
marketing (WOMM) , also known as  viral marketing, which, 
according to Wikipedia, relies on the added credibility of 
person-to-person communication (e. g., a personal recom-
mendation). Marketers do not have control over this form of 
communication as they do with company-generated market-
ing tactics; however, they try to stimulate positive WOM and 
monitor to see if it works. There are several variations of this 
method. For more about word-of-mouth marketing, see 
 investopedia.com/terms/w/word-of-mouth-marketing.
asp , 
 entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/word-of-mouth- 
advertising  , and  businessdictionary.com/deﬁ nition/word-
of- mouth-marketing.html . For use of word of mouth in 
business, see Sernovitz ( 2012 ). 
 What Makes Content Go Viral? 
 According to Horton ( 2013 ), “content goes viral if it spreads 
very fast on the Internet.” An infographic from Mashable.
com shows that content will go viral if it is hilarious, pro-
vokes emotional responses (positive or negative), is thought- 
provoking and ready for good gossip. For more information, 
see  mashable.com/2011/12/03/viral-infographic . 
 Using Word of Mouth in Social Commerce 
 Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) is a subset of elec-
tronic WOM, whose major subject is marketing. According 
to  Entrepreneur , word-of-mouth advertising (marketing 
communication) is “an unpaid form of promotion in which 
satisﬁ ed customers tell other people how much they like a 
business, product, or service” (per  entrepreneur.com/ency-
clopedia/word-of-mouth-advertising ). WOMM is a pow-
erful promotional tool and should be considered as a part of 
almost every business marketing strategy. 
 WOMM is highly valued by vendors, social media users, 
and performance marketers (this is called “earned media” in 
Chap.   5  ). It is transmitted via e-mail, videos (e.g., see  mash-
able.com/2011/01/26/viral-videos-infographic ), and discus-
sions in social networks, etc. Marketing strategies use WOMM 
to increase credibility and trust. Research has revealed that cus-
tomers are inclined to believe WOM rather than company-gen-
erated promotions. The consumer tends to believe that users 
who deliver WOM are not receiving a beneﬁ t from the com-
pany. According to Nielsen’s 2013 “Global Survey of Trust in 
Advertising,” 84 % of consumers worldwide say they trust 
word-of-mouth recommendations from their trusted friends and 
families (per  mediapost.com/publications/article/209286/
nielsen-consumers-trust-wom-over- other-messaging.
html#axzz2gntQPihd ). Word-of-mouth content depends on 
both the extent of customer satisfaction with a product or a ser-
vice and the degree of the perceived value of the WOM. To 
promote and manage word-of-mouth communications, market-
ers can focus on  brand advocates , the people who are the most 
brand-loyal and proactively recommend their favorite brands 
and products online and ofﬂ ine without being paid to do so 
(such as people who own iPads).  Inﬂ uencer marketing is 
WOMM used to target key individuals who have authority and 
a high number of personal connections (the inﬂ uencers). 
Chapter   5  describes several WOMM techniques in social 
media (see  forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2014/07/17/
why-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-the-most-important- 
social-media ). 
 Viral content spreads fast in social commerce due to the 
large number of contacts and connections in social networks. 
In addition, microblogging, such as posting on Twitter, 
accelerates the spread of WOM. 
 The Process of Digital WOM 
 Digital WOM is a cyclical process whereby messages are 
transmitted electronically, starting with one person who 
sends the message to his friends on his network. Some of the 
friends then send the message to their friends on different 
networks, and from there the messages are spread to more 
and more people. The process is described in Fig.  3.3 . Digital 
WOM is sometimes laughingly called “Word of Mouse.”
 The Power of WOM 
 Several studies show the power of WOM. For example, 
Bazaarvoice provides detailed statistics on WOM at  bazaar-
voice.com/research-and-insight/social-commerce- 
statistics  ; including the following (you will see varying 
ﬁ ndings of these stats in later chapters): 
•  Close to 90 % of online customers trust recommen-
dations from people they know. 
•  70 % of online customers trust recommendations 
from other customers that they do not know. 
•  67 % of shoppers spend more money online because 
of recommendations from friends.  
•  53 % of people on Twitter recommend products 
and/or vendors on their tweets.  
•  80 % of all recommendations in bazaarvoice.com 
are positive (four or ﬁ ve stars). 
•  44 % of all online purchases of consumer electron-
ics are inﬂ uenced by WOM.

net/fbarrenecheaf/the-power-of-eword-of-mouth-
adding- social-media-to-the-marketing-mix . For WOM as 
a facilitator of customer driven innovation, see G. Brown 
( 2014 ). 
 For factors inﬂ uencing the adoption of WOM (such as 
gender, age, type of product, etc.) in online shopping in gen-
eral, see Cheung et al. ( 2008 ). 
 The Major Types of WOM 
 There are two major types of WOM: (1)  Analog: This is per-
son-to-person, face-to-face communication, as well as the 
traditional written, printed, and telephone media. (2)  Digital: 
Information is digitized and possibly stored in a format that 
can be sent and re-sent electronically. 
 The digital format is used in social media marketing. You 
tell something to your network, then people in your network 
tell people in their networks, and it continues to expand 
exponentially. Web 2.0 tools and social networks such as 
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube make the spread of infor-
mation easy and fast. A practical issue is what channels 
should one use to entice information dissemination. This 
topic will be discussed in Chap.   5 . 
 Consultants help companies improve WOM. For exam-
ple, in order to draw attention to their products or help build 
a mailing list, a vendor may offer a gift giveaway of a new 
game or video that people will like and probably share with 
their friends. Companies can also hold contests, giving away 
a game or video and advertise on social networking sites. 
Vendors can use e-mail, Facebook, or Twitter for the initial 
dissemination and information about the product based on a 
deep knowledge of the brand’s target market. According to 
Marketing Made Simple, a message spread through YouTube 
can be much faster than face-to-face communication (see 
 marketing-made-simple.com/articles/word-of-mouth- 
advertising.htm ). 
 Viral Marketing and Social Networking 
 Viral marketing refers to a word-of-mouth method by 
which people tell others (frequently their friends) about a 
product they like or dislike. Viral marketing and advertising 
has many variations and it plays a major role in e-commerce 
and social commerce (see Logan  2014 ). 
 Viral marketing is especially popular among young adults 
and on Facebook and Twitter. Thus, information (good or bad) 
can spread quickly to millions with minimal cost to the compa-
nies’ advertisers. For example, when YouTube ﬁ rst started, the 
site conducted almost no traditional advertising in its ﬁ rst few 
months, but millions joined because of WOM. For the “power 
of WOM,” see  ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/
Pages/The-Power-of-Word-of- Mouth.aspx . For comprehen-
sive coverage, see Wilde ( 2013 ). 
 Viral Blogging 
 Many retailers are capitalizing on WOM marketing by using 
bloggers. See some examples at  buildabetterblog.com/
business-blogging-articles-to-get-you-started.html . (This 
is known as  blogger outreach.) When viral marketing is done

by bloggers, it is referred to as  viral blogging . Viral blogging 
can be very effective with the use of tools such as Twitter 
(e.g., see  slideshare.net/LizBullock1/how-dell-is- using-
social-media-to-deepen-customer-relationships-and- 
build-trust ). For a video describing a viral blogging system, 
see Payne ( 2013 ). 
 Note: A collection of videos tagged “viral blogging system” 
is available at  vimeo.com/tag:viral+blogging+system . 
 Example 
 PayPerPost ( payperpost.com ) runs a marketplace where 
advertisers and bloggers, video bloggers, online photogra-
phers, and podcasters can connect with each other. Those 
who need services describe what they want and how much 
they are willing to pay. Providers then bid on the jobs.  
 PayPerPost checks the reputation of the bloggers and 
matches them with the advertisers’ requirements. PayPerPost 
also arranges payment to the bloggers. Note that the 
PayPerPost bloggers are required to disclose that they are 
being paid for their postings. (For details, see  payperpost.
com/bloggers/blogger-how-it-works and  payperpost.com/
advertisers/how-it-works ). 
 Viral Videos 
 A  viral video is a video that is spread rapidly through the 
process of online information sharing. These videos become 
popular when they are circulated via e-mail, SMSs, social 
networks, microblogging, blogs, discussion forums, and so 
forth. This way, people share videos that receive more atten-
tion, sometimes drawing millions of viewers in a short time. 
Popular sites that are used for sharing viral videos include 
YouTube and VEOH. For the top viral video ad campaigns, 
see  www.visiblemeasures.com/insights/charts/adage . 
 Viral videos are liked (or disliked) so much that viewers 
send them to others, spreading the word about the videos 
quickly across the Internet. Marketers are using viral videos 
by inserting ads in videos or by using ads as pop-ups prior to 
the start of presentations; see  adage.com/section/the-viral- 
video-chart/674 . Note that, if the reactions to a video are 
positive, the buzz can be useful, but negative reactions can 
hurt the brand (see the discussion on reputation systems in 
Chap.   5 ).  Baseline magazine periodically provides a list of 
the ten best viral marketing videos. For viral video marketing 
case studies (the best virals of 2013), see  digitalstrategy-
consulting.com/intelligence/2013/12/viral_video_market-
ing_case_studies_the_best_virals_of_2013.php . 
 Consumer-Generated Videos 
 Many companies are utilizing user-generated videos for their 
online ads and even for their TV commercials. 
 YouTube is the largest advertising platform for video ads. 
It has billions of videos and is growing rapidly. YouTube per-
mits selected marketers to upload videos with ads to the site. 
Google’s AdSense ad distribution network also offers ad- 
supported video clips. Another way for advertisers to use 
viral videos is by creating contests (see  onlinevideocontests.
com and  onlinevideocontests.com ). 
 Example: Crash the Super Bowl 
 Doritos runs an annual online contest, inviting fans to create 
their own Doritos ads. The winners get a bonus prize of up to 
$1 million and their ad airs during that year’s Super Bowl. In 
2010, Doritos invited Pepsi Max to be a part of their fourth 
contest, receiving over 3,000 entries. In 2013, the contest 
was moved to Facebook, attracting over 3,500 submissions 
and over 100 million views. In 2013, for the ﬁ rst time, 
Doritos took its contest globally, opening it to fans world-
wide. This resulted in a sizable advertising effect. 
 Other Viral Marketing Methods 
 Viral marketing is done in most social networks through 
e-mail, messaging, and forwarding of videos, stories, and 
special offers. In addition, there are other innovative ways to 
go viral. Carter ( 2013 ) provides 15 examples of viral marketing 
mostly related to social commerce. 
 Note: An interesting question was raised by Seraj ( 2012 ): 
“Does electronic word of mouth in social media help or con-
fuse?” Extensive research was conducted by Seraj, who pro-
vided a conceptual model of how electronic WOM affects 
the buying decisions of customers and what the role of social 
media is in inﬂ uencing buying decisions.

 CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT 
IN SOCIAL COMMERCE 
 Several interdependent social behavioral theories are related 
to  engagement . We will describe the essentials of engage-
ment in this section. 
 Engagement in Social Commerce 
 Today’s customers are socially-oriented and engaged. One of 
the most talked about concepts in social media is  customer 
engagement (see Sherman and Smith  2013 ). Unfortunately, 
there are many deﬁ nitions for this umbrella term. 
 Deﬁ nitions of Engagement 
 En.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement ) 
deﬁ nes 
 customer engagement (CE)  as “the engagement of customers 
3 Supporting Theories and Concepts for Social Commerce

61
with one another, with a company, or a brand. The initiative 
for engagement can be either consumer- or company-led and 
the medium of engagement can be on or ofﬂ ine.” 
 According to Wikipedia,  online customer engagement 
refers to:
 1.  “A  social phenomenon enabled by the wide adoption of 
the Internet in the late 1990s and taking off with the tech-
nical developments in connection speed (broadband) in 
the decade that followed. Online CE is qualitatively dif-
ferent from the engagement of consumers ofﬂ ine. 
 2.  The  behavior of customers (who) engage in online com-
munities revolving, directly or indirectly, around product 
categories (cycling, sailing) and other consumption top-
ics. It details the process that leads to a customer’s posi-
tive engagement with the company or offering, as well as 
the behaviors associated with different degrees of cus-
tomer engagement. 
 3.  Marketing practices that aim to create, stimulate, or inﬂ u-
ence CE behavior. Although CE-marketing efforts must 
be consistent both online and ofﬂ ine, the Internet is the 
basis of CE-marketing. 
 4.  Metrics that measure the effectiveness of the marketing 
practices which seek to create, stimulate, or inﬂ uence CE 
behavior.” 
 Rhoads and Whitlark ( 2008 ) deﬁ ne engagement as “the 
emotional bond or attachment that a customer develops dur-
ing the repeated and outgoing interactions accumulated as a 
satisﬁ ed, loyal, and inﬂ uencing customer.” To show the 
diversity of deﬁ nitions, you may want to watch the video:

watch?v=sF0U- OYuKFU  . According to  staging.socialme-
diatoday.com/heatherrast/324809/brand-interest-not-
outdone-brand- engagement    , no one can pinpoint what 
engagement really means. However, despite the lack of an 
agreed upon deﬁ nition and the skeptics that call it a fad and 
buzzword, the majority of people agree that it is a useful con-
cept. We view engagement as a link between a company and 
customers, as illustrated in Fig.  3.4 .
  For many visual examples of various types of engage-
ment, search Google Images for: ‘engagement in social 
media.’ For an interesting infographic that shows the 
potential complexity of value chains needed for customer 
engagement,

 The Beneﬁ ts of Engagement 
 The following are the major beneﬁ ts of customer engagement: 
 For additional beneﬁ ts, see Sherman and Smith ( 2013 ) and 
Barnes and Kelleher ( 2015 ). Epstein ( 2013 ) describes how 14 
companies beneﬁ t from engagement. Wikipedia also sees loy-
alty as a contributor to strengthen customer relationships that 
emotionally tie them more closely to companies. Wikipedia also 
connects engagement to satisfaction, WOM, awareness, trust, 
loyalty, and helping customers engage and assist each other.

( 2014 ). For an example, see Case  3.1 .

the slideshow at  slideshare.net/JenniferKesik/wholefoods-
social-media-marketing-31878552 . 
 In order to engage its customers, the company is success-
fully using social networks. Here are some examples: 
 Facebook Presence 
 The central feature of Whole Foods Market’s social media 
campaign is its presence on Facebook ( facebook.com/
wholefoods ). It not only has a central Whole Foods Fan Page 
where the company runs campaigns and contests, posts reci-
pes and product information, and supports customers’ con-
versations, but all of the local outlets also maintain an 
individual fan page, which is controlled and updated mostly 
by the individual store. 
 Engagement on Facebook 
 To encourage easy customer engagement, according to 
Loayza ( 2010 ), Whole Foods:
  (a)  Assigned and trained “a speciﬁ c employee at each store 
to become the Community Manager (CM)” (per Loayza 
( 2010 )). 
   (b)  Created guidelines so that the CM knows what content 
can be posted and what content must be avoided.  
   (c)  Developed moderation rules and guidelines to be used in 
case there are any belligerent fans on their Facebook wall. 
 (d) Recommended FB post-tree items to keep the CM orga-
nized and keep the content on the wall alive and fresh. 
(A post-tree can be health tips, career opportunities, and 
so forth.) 
 The campaign’s objective, according to Loayza ( 2010 ), is 
to provide a platform that allows the community to interact 
and become engaged with their local Whole Foods store. The 
brand’s goal is to “belocal.” 
 For how Whole Foods marketing uses social media to 
its advantage, see  digitalsparkmarketing.com/creative- 
marketing/social-media/whole-foods-marketing . 
 Engagement on Twitter and by Blogging 
 In addition to its company website, Whole Foods has a 
company blog ( wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/whole-story ) 
and a Twitter account ( twitter.com/wholefoods ). 
 Why Engagement? 
 According to Loayza ( 2010 ), “Whole Foods interacts with 
consumers and provides them with relevant content. News 
features are posted on the FB Fan Page and receive more 
feedback and shares from the FB Fan Page than on the actual 
blog. The FB Community Manager doesn’t just post the link 
and let it happen, the CM actually takes the time to write a 
descriptive paragraph describing what the post is about…. 
Furthermore, Whole Foods has not linked the blog to its Notes 
feed of the Facebook fan page. Instead, they only post highly 
relevant posts that their FB community would like to read.”

providing 
a 
unique

pulse/20141124223243-43172975-how-to-create- customer-
engagement-by-providing-a.unique-experience . 
 As of 2012, Whole Foods uses Pinterest for customer 
engagement (Drell  2012 ). 
 Involvement with Whole Foods Employees 
 Finally, according to Loayza ( 2010 ), “Whole Foods embraces 
transparency, and features real-life employees in its videos to 
support the campaigns that it is holding. Again, this is in line 
with the ‘Local’ brand and allows FB Fans to see the real 
people that make Whole Food[s] happen.”

media, see Moth ( 2013 ).

 Mobile Engagement 
 A major trend in social engagement is to use mobile devices 
and mobile commerce systems. Each interaction channel that 
is used by customers provides for different experiences and 
opportunities. According to IBM ( 2014 ), none of the com-
munication channels is as personally and effectively engaging 
as the mobile channels. Mobile channels allow companies to 
engage with their customers regardless of location. Therefore, 
it can be most beneﬁ cial for companies to interact with cus-
tomers with the right messages in the right place and time, by 
using the right business processes, creativity, and technology 
(which IBM and other vendors provide). To learn more about 
how this is done, see IBM ( 2014 ). Also, see Adobe ( 2013 ).

 The Measure of Engagement 
 Since there are many ways for customers to be engaged, 
there are different measurements and metrics that companies 
can use to gauge engagement. The following are some com-
monly used measures of engagement: 
 Papworth ( 2011 ) relates the measurement of engagement 
to the seven stages in the following list, starting from shallow 
engagement (e.g., photo sharing) to deep engagement (e.g., 
collaboration). 
  For details on the levels of engagement, see Papworth 
( 2011 ). Another measure of engagement level is the ratio of 
brands engaged to those not engaged. See Chap.   5 for another 
engagement categorization system. A special social engage-
ment index for buyers was developed by Zambito ( 2011 ). 
For tools to monitor and analyze engagements, see Radian6 
(a SalesForce company). Finally, there is an interesting 
aspect of engagement—psychology (see Solis  2012 and the 
next section). 
 Note: In addition, to customer engagement, one should 
consider employee engagement (see Kelleher  2013 ).

 SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY THEORIES, 
SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, 
AND THE SOCIAL GRAPH 
 Given the strong inﬂ uence of friends, family, and other cus-
tomers on consumers’ purchasing decisions, it is useful to 
explore some of the supporting behavioral and social theo-
ries behind this inﬂ uence. 
 Social Psychology and Social Commerce 
 There are many deﬁ nitions of the term  social psychology . 
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary,  social psy-
chology is “the study of the manner in which the personality, 
attitudes, motivations and behavior of the individual inﬂ u-
ence and are inﬂ uenced by social groups.” Our interest here 
is the study of inﬂ uences that are related to social commerce 
in general and online shopping in particular. There are many 
theories and studies about social commerce psychology 
(e.g., see Marsden  2009 ; Solis  2012 ; DeLamater and Ward 
 2013 ). Here, we present only some of the theories. 
 Social Commerce Psychology 
 Social shopping relies on social psychology that “harnesses 
the human capacity for  social learning , learning from the 
knowledge and experience of others we know and/or trust. 
This social learning faculty is part of our  social intelligence , 
the ability to understand and learn from each other and proﬁ t 
from social situations. However, social shopping tools also 
work at a more fundamental level, by playing to cognitive 
biases in how people are inﬂ uenced by other people when 
shopping” (Marsden  2009 ). 
 Note: A cognitive bias, according to Princeton University, 
is “a pattern of deviation in judgment that occurs in particu-
lar situations.”

3.6 Social Psychology Theories, Social Network Analysis, and the Social Graph

 Cognitive Styles and Morphing in Behavioral 
Marketing 
 Cognitive styles that deﬁ ne how people process information 
has become a subject of research in Internet marketing and 
advertising. The underlying rationale is that people with dif-
ferent cognitive styles have different preferences in website 
design and marketing messages. Speciﬁ cally, an attempt is 
made to connect the Web with users in their preferred cogni-
tive style. This can make one-to-one advertising messages 
more effective. MIT designed an empathetic Web that is uti-
lized to ﬁ gure out how a user processes information and then 
responds to each visitor’s cognitive style. For a comprehen-
sive description, see Urban et al. ( 2009 ). 
 The topic of social inﬂ uence (Sect.  3.7 ) is closely related 
to social psychology. 
 The Universal Heuristics of Shopping 
 Research has found that shoppers do what is popularly 
known as “thinslicing” when they are out shopping (see 
Marsden  2009 ).  Thinslicing  is a style of thinking (psy-
chologists call it  heuristic-thinking and marketers call it 
 decision heuristics ). This style of thinking involves ignor-
ing most of the information available, and instead “slicing 
off” and using a few salient information cues, often social 
in nature, along with a set of simple, but usually smart 
mental rules of thumb (heuristics) to make intuitive pur-
chasing decisions. According to Marsden ( 2009 ), psy-
chologists have identiﬁ ed six universal heuristics 
developed by Robert Cialdini ( 2008 ,  2001a ,  b ) that shop-
pers use to process thinsliced information:  social proof 
(follow the crowd),  authority (follow the authority),  scar-
city (scarce products must be good),  liking (follow those 
you like),  consistency (be consistent), and  reciprocity 
(repay favors). For extensive coverage, see Goleman 
( 2006 ). Social shopping tools are powerful because they 
harness these heuristics to make purchase decisions more 
likely. For example, the “Black Friday” online retailer 
discounts, good only on the day after Thanksgiving, 
evokes the scarcity principle. (However, the deals are now 
offered online for weeks prior to the Thanksgiving holi-
day and afterwards.)  
 Social Network Theory and Analysis 
 To apply social commerce properly, it may be helpful to 
learn about the foundation of social network sites. Two major 
topics are described here: social network theory and social 
network analysis. 
 Social Network Theory 
 According to Wikipedia, a  social network “is a social struc-
ture made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or 
organizations) and a set of the dyadic ties between these 
actors. The social network perspective provides a set of 
methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities 
as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns 
observed in these structures.” The social actors (nodes) are 
connected by lines (the dyadics) that signify relationship 
(and contacts) such as friendship, kinship, common interest, 
ﬁ nancial exchange, dislikes, beliefs, or related knowledge. 
 A  social network structure can be illustrated by a graphi-
cal display of speciﬁ c connections (also known as ties, edges, 
or links) between the nodes of the network as illustrated in 
Fig.  3.5 . The network can also be used to measure  social 
capital —the value that an individual gets from a social net-
work (to be described later).
 Figure  3.5 is simpliﬁ ed. Using computerized drawings, 
one can show hundreds, or even thousands, of nodes and 
links in one diagram. A sample of many networks, known as 
 sociograms, is shown in Google’s search results of images 
for sociograms. Note that the connecting lines are not always 
presented as arrows. This may mean that the connections are 
not known or they are bidirectional. A unidirectional arrow 
signiﬁ es one-way messaging. 
 The theory of social networks was developed by sociolo-
gists, starting in 1950, by looking at one individual and his 
relationship with 100–150 other individuals. On the Web, 
 social network sites , such as Facebook, have expanded the 
concept to include organizations and their environment (e.g., 
customers, society, suppliers, or government). The theory 
enables social network sites to allow many users to publish 
 Fig. 3.5   A simple social network structure (there are only three con-
nections between you and me)

their own content for their friends and others to see. Social 
networks also help site users to display their professional 
proﬁ les. The sites provide tools for sharing features, com-
munication capabilities, and more. The graphical display of 
the relationships is the basis for social network analysis.  
 Social Network Analysis 
 Social network analysis (SNA) is a method for analyzing 
social networks (see Scott and Carrington  2011 ). It involves 
the mapping and measuring of both relationships and infor-
mation ﬂ ows among groups, organizations, and other con-
nected entities in social networks. SNA provides a visual 
analysis of human relationships that is both quantitative and 
qualitative. In the business world, this is sometimes called 
 organizational network analysis . 
 The use of SNA depends on the availability of data that 
describe the latest in social networking. 
 One of the methods of SNA is based on ﬁ nding the center 
point in the network. This information gives us insight into 
the operation of the network, such as who are the players, 
who are the leaders and what subgroups exist. For details, 
see  orgnet.com/sna.html . 
 The Beneﬁ ts of Social Network Analysis 
 The following are the major beneﬁ ts of SNA that relate to 
social commerce: 
  For comprehensive coverage of SNA, see Scott and 
Carrington ( 2011 ). 
 The Social Graph 
 A  social graph is a diagram that illustrates the interconnec-
tions among people, groups, and organizations in a social net-
work (see  whatis.techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/social-graph ). 
 Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook, 
used the term initially to refer to the networks and relationships 
among Facebook users. This deﬁ nition was expanded later to 
refer to a social graph of all Internet users. A social graph can 
be described as a “ global mapping of everybody and how 
they’re related ” (per  cbsnews.com/news/facebook-one- 
social-graph-to-rule-them-all ). The term was used to 
explain the Facebook Platform ( facebook.com/platform ), 
which was introduced in 2007. 
 The Facebook social graph describes the relationships 
between individuals online. This is in contrast with social 
network analysis, which describes connections and relation-
ships in the real world. The two concepts are very similar. 
However, the social graph is digital; while social network 
analysis is mostly quantitative. In addition, relationships are 
deﬁ ned by the social graph more explicitly. 
 Facebook helps people and websites with the construction 
of the social graph. For details, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Social_graph . The Facebook Graph Search algorithm ﬁ nds 
information from within a user’s network of friends. See 
 search.fb.com displays a Facebook ad created from an indi-
vidual’s information and sent to other members using a 
social graph. 
 A social graph is exempliﬁ ed by a sociogram similar to 
that of social networks (as illustrated earlier in Fig.  3.5 ). The 
diagram depicts all personal relationships of an individual 
with others. By searching Google Images for ‘social graph 
and Facebook,’ one can ﬁ nd hundreds of visual images of 
social graphs. 
 Graph Search 
 A Graph Search is Facebook’s search engine, which is inte-
grated with the Social Graph. It can process natural language 
queries to return information from social networking. It also 
helps to ﬁ nd people and things. It is used for advertising on 
Facebook (see Constine  2013 ). For how marketers can lever-
age Facebook’s Graph Search, see  socialmediaexaminer.
com/facebook-graph-search-marketing . 
In 
2014, 
Facebook brought Graph Search for mobile systems. For 
details, see  recode.net/2014/12/08/facebook-ﬁ nally-brings-
graph-search-to-mobile . 
   The Power of the Social Graph 
 According to Whitney ( 2010 ), the “Social Graph is a way to 
model social networks and help make the connections 
between people in those networks clearer. It [is] an 
extremely powerful tool for understanding the connections 
between people. The question is, how much information 
does [a company’s] brand get from the Social Graph? The 
answer is, as much as the social network owners and par-
ticipants of the social network allow (the brand) to have.” 
Several companies help retailers utilize the power of the 
•  Leverage peer support 
•  Facilitate innovation and learning 
•  Identify the individuals, teams, and subgroups who 
play the inﬂ uencers roles in social networks. 
•  Find information ﬂ ow problems and identify those 
who are not getting information properly as a result 
of the problems 
•  Help in reﬁ ning social commerce strategies.

of the social graph, see  psfk.com/2013/01/social-graph-

between social graph, consumer behavior and online shop-
ping, see Guo et al. ( 2011 ).  
3.7 
 SOCIAL INFLUENCE, SOCIAL CAPITAL, 
AND SOCIAL SUPPORT 
 Of the several social theories that are related to social com-
merce, here we present only three. 
  Social Inﬂ uence 
 As described earlier, one objective of SC vendors is to inﬂ u-
ence consumers. When the inﬂ uencers are friends, or socially 
connected, the inﬂ uence may be stronger. For details, see 
Singh and Diamond ( 2012 ). To some extent, “everyone is an 
inﬂ uencer on something” (see Kramer  2013 ). 
 There are several deﬁ nitions of social inﬂ uence. For 
example, according to Changing Minds.org,  social inﬂ uence 
“is the change in behavior that one person causes in another, 
intentionally or unintentionally, as a result of the way the 
changed (persons) perceive themselves in relationship to the 
inﬂ uencer, other people and society in general” (see  chang-
ingminds.org/explanations/theories/social_influence.
htm ). According to  qualities-of-a-leader.com/personal-
mbti- type-analysis , “Social inﬂ uence occurs when one’s 
thoughts, feelings, or actions are affected by others. Social 
inﬂ uence takes many forms and can be seen in conformity, 
socialization, peer pressure, obedience, leadership, persua-
sion, sales, and marketing.” (See  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Social_inﬂ uence .) It is also one of the social psychology 
heuristics for consumer decision making, as previously men-
tioned. Vendors use social inﬂ uence theories, such as com-
municating about the large number of people who purchase 
a product, to  persuade people to purchase online (see Lee 
et al.  2006 ). Note that social inﬂ uence may be the result of 
social engagement (e.g., see Hall  2013 ). Social inﬂ uence is 
important in e-commerce (Grimes  2013 ). For mobile social 
inﬂ uence, see Martin ( 2013 ). 
 Types of Social Inﬂ uence 
 Several areas of social inﬂ uence are distinguished (per 
Wikipedia, based in part on Herbert Kelman):
 1.  Identiﬁ cation is when people are inﬂ uenced by someone 
who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity. 
 2.  Internalization is when people accept a belief or behavior 
established by those people or groups who are inﬂ uential 
to them. 
 3.  Conformity is changing how you behave to be more like 
others. 
 4.  Compliance refers to a case in which people publicly 
appear to conform to the majority, but keep their real feel-
ings and beliefs private. 
 5.  Obedience is a form of social inﬂ uence that is derived 
from an authority ﬁ gure. 
 Social Media Inﬂ uence 
 In social commerce, vendors and other organizations tend to 
inﬂ uence consumers mainly by conformity and voluntarily 
compliance. Social psychology, for example (Sect.  3.6 ), 
includes several different methods of social inﬂ uence. One, the 
 social exchange theory , explains social exchange as it relates to 
beneﬁ ts and rewards. This theory is used by vendors who pro-
vide rewards for social-based actions (such as a discount for 
writing a product review). Companies such as Groupon and 
Foursquare utilize this theory in their SC strategy. 
 Persuasion , according to Wikipedia, is also “a form of 
social inﬂ uence. It is the process of guiding oneself or another 
toward the adoption of an idea, attitude, or action by rational 
and symbolic (though not always logical) means.” For details 
and tactics of inﬂ uences in general, see Harvard Business 
Essentials ( 2005 ). Note that social media is used also to inﬂ u-
ence the inﬂ uencers (see  socialbro.com/blog/make-friends- 
inﬂ uence-the-inﬂ uencers-using-social-media ). 
For 
an 
infographic showing how social media inﬂ uences business, 
see  go-gulf.com/blog/social-media-inﬂ uence-businesses . 
 The presence of social networks is changing people’s 
shopping habits. For a study, see Bowling ( 2012 ). 
 Tracking and Measuring Social Media Inﬂ uence 
 Vendors may be interested in measuring the effect of social 
media inﬂ uence so they can evaluate the success of their 
social commerce strategy. For a coverage of tools, see Hall 
( 2013 ). For a further discussion, see McCue ( 2013 ). 
 Social Capital in Social Commerce 
 Social capital refers to the value created by connections 
among individuals and within social networks. It highlights 
the value of social relations and the role of cooperation. It

also helps to get economic results. Like any other economic 
capital, people can save and spend social capital. The term 
 social capital  is frequently used in different interpretations 
depending on the perspective. 
 There are several deﬁ nitions of social capital that share 
the idea that social networks have or facilitate value (social 
capital). The concept is similar to that of  human capital and 
 physical capital . Social contacts, for example, can affect the 
productivity of individuals, teams and organizations. For 
details, see  go.worldbank.org/C0QTRW4QF0 . For social 
capital research activities, see  facebook.com/social.capital.
research . 
 An example of using social capital theory for explaining 
customer information sharing in social communities is pro-
vided by Liu et al. ( 2013 ). 
 Effects of Social Networking on Social Capital 
 Social networking activities can positively affect an organi-
zations’ social capital. In our book, social capital refers to the 
network of social connections that exist between people and 
their shared values. That is, social networks have value and 
social capital refers to the collective value in the network. 
For example, using network sites, crowdsourcing, and infor-
mation sharing may increase innovation, which increases 
social capital. The ability for a quick connection (e.g., via 
Twitter) facilitates social interactions and collaboration. 
 Impact on Sales and Marketing 
 Social capital theory, if properly used, can increase reputa-
tion and sales. The concept of  brand can be facilitated by 
using social capital. Vendors can use social capital to  inﬂ u-
ence consumers (e.g., see McCue  2013 ). 
 Social Support in Online Communities 
 As indicated earlier, social networking facilitates social 
interactions and brings social values to its users (e.g., see 
Bambina  2007 ). This facilitates social support. 
 Social support  refers to one’s perception of being cared 
for, receiving responses, and being helped by people in their 
social group. Social support can also be viewed as a vehicle 
for satisfying one’s psychological needs. Users can obtain 
social support from an online community. For a discussion, 
see Huang et al. ( 2010 ) and Hampton et al. ( 2011 ). For how 
social support facilitates e-commerce, see Liang et al. 
( 2011 /2012). 
 Social support can help a person feel better, by providing 
direct assistance to solve personal problems when they occur. 
Therefore, such good experiences may make people more 
satisﬁ ed with social interactions. For a guide to social sup-
port in social commerce see Strother ( 2014 ). 
 Since interactions on the Internet are virtual in nature, 
online social support can help social media users, usually in 
intangible ways, such as giving informational and emotional 
support (Huang et al.  2010 ). For a study about the linkage 
between social support and intention to conduct social com-
merce, see Liang et al. ( 2011 /2012). 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  Factors 
inﬂ uencing 
online 
consumer 
behavior. 
Consumer behavior in SC is similar to that of any con-
sumer behavior, but it has some unique features. It can be 
described by several decision models that are inﬂ uenced 
by factors including the consumer’s personal characteris-
tics, environmental characteristics, product/service fea-
tures, merchant and intermediary, and SC systems 
(logistics, technology, and customer service). All of these 
characteristics may inﬂ uence the consumer purchasing 
decision. A major objective of social commerce is to 
inﬂ uence consumers by using social theories, relation-
ships, and connections.  
 2.  The online consumer decision-making process. A 
major objective of marketing research is to understand 
the consumers’ online decision-making processes, and 
formulate strategies accordingly to inﬂ uence the consum-
ers’ buying decisions. For each of the ﬁ ve steps in the 
traditional process, sellers can develop appropriate strate-
gies. Another model, the Attention-Interest-Desire-Action 
(AIDA) model, can help design ads and marketing cam-
paigns. 
The 
Attention-Interest-Search-Action-Share 
(AISAS) model is tailored to the online behavior in the 
decision process. This model is particularly suitable for 
social commerce. Social media tools can be used in each 
step of the process. For example, friends can help with 
need identiﬁ cation, information search, and product eval-
uation (see Chaps.   4 and   5 ). 
 3.  How consumer behavior can be analyzed for creat-
ing personal services. Consumer behavior can be 
observed (e.g., via cookies or monitoring browsing his-
tory), or it can be derived from questionnaires. Given 
the information about the consumers, vendors can cre-
ate a consumer proﬁ le where they try to infer what the 
consumer likes and/or needs. Consumer behavior can

68
also be predicted by having information about other 
consumers with similar proﬁ les or shopping habits. 
Given the availability of such information, vendors can 
tailor ads or messages targeted to individual consumers 
on a one-to-one basis. The analysis and targeting is 
done by using proprietary formulas based on theories 
such as collaborative ﬁ ltering.  
  4.  Word of mouth online. The information in online WOM 
travels via electronic communication channels such as 
e-mail, blogs, notes on pages of social networks, tweets, or 
other social media tools. It also can be transmitted via vid-
eos, photos, sounds, or any other communication device. 
 The beneﬁ t for the receivers is that they get information 
that may add value to them. WOM may result in conversa-
tions and discussions that clarify issues and reduce ambi-
guity. WOM increases interactions and engagement. 
 Vendors may get free publicity that can travel very 
fast. They also may get information on what needs to be 
corrected (see reputation management in Chap.   5 ). 
Furthermore, vendors can devise marketing strategies 
based on what they hear through WOM, so that they can 
improve marketing plans.  
 5.  Deﬁ ne online engagement and describe its inﬂ uence 
on trust, loyalty, and satisfaction. Engagement describes 
the various social networking activities used by custom-
ers, employees, and others on social networks, and in par-
ticipating in social networking (e.g., writing blogs). This 
includes activities that involve sharing videos and stories, 
using WOM, reviewing, voting, discussing, recommend-
ing, 
collaborating, 
posting 
questions, 
answering 
 questions, and more. By engaging in these activities, peo-
ple increase the bond with participants, including ven-
dors, 
governments, 
and 
service 
providers. 
The 
relationships and contacts generated by social media 
engagement facilitate trust (in others, including vendors), 
increased loyalty to brands and products, and elevated 
customer satisfaction, thus inﬂ uencing them to buy more 
products and services. 
 6.  Social psychology, social network theory, and social 
graph. Social psychology, as it relates to consumer 
behavior online, is a prime supporting theory in social 
commerce. The issue is how to inﬂ uence consumers to 
shop for certain brands. A primary approach is via social 
networks. This involves collecting consumer data and the 
analysis of the structure and operation of social commu-
nities and networks. Facebook’s social graph is also a 
useful theory in social commerce. Social graph theory 
was created initially in order to help people with social 
networking. Later, the social graph was also used to facil-
itate social inﬂ uence. 
 7.  Social inﬂ uence, capital, and support. The theories that 
are well-known in social psychology can be used in social 
commerce to inﬂ uence and assist consumers. People can 
be inﬂ uenced by other people who they may know or be 
connected to. Social capital reﬂ ects the value added to 
people as a result of social interaction and engagement. 
Social capital, like human capital, can be preserved and 
used by vendors to inﬂ uence people. Finally, social net-
works and engagement can provide support to individuals 
and facilitate their shopping decisions.

  TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATES 
  1.  How can you describe the process of the purchase deci-

iPhone? What can an online store do to attract this cus-
tomer to purchase an iPhone from them?  
  2.  Why is personalization becoming an important element 
in SC? 
  3.  What techniques can be used to learn about online con-
sumer behavior? 
  4.  Distinguish between social network theory and social 
network analysis (SNA). 
  5.  Discuss the role of social capital in social commerce. 
  6.  Debate: Some say that people come to social networks 
to socialize, and they will not accept ads or conduct trad-
ing there. Others say that people do not mind the ads, but 
may ignore them.  
  7.  Debate: Netﬂ ix.com, Amazon.com, and others use cus-
tomers’ historical purchases as a part of their recommen-
dation systems. Is this an invasion of privacy?  
  8.  McCafferty ( 2011 ) claims that the inﬂ uence of social 
media on purchasing is overrated. View his slide show 
and gather additional information. Debate the statement.  
  9.  Enter  pinterest.com/pin/16888567325446527 . Try to 
match the suggested personalities to several students. 
Comment on the value and accuracy of the suggested

 10.  Some claim that social inﬂ uence can be negative. 
Discuss the issue and how empowered consumers may 
not always be swayed by the decisions of others (e.g., 
see Brooks  2013 ). 
  11.  C. Brown ( 2014 ) claims that customers do not want to 
be “one,” but prefer to be one out of the “many.” Debate 
this issue.

 OPENING CASE: JOHNSON & JOHNSON 
USES NEW MEDIA MARKETING 
 The Problem 
 Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest health care, medi-
cal devices, and diagnostics company. It has more than 
128,000 employees worldwide (2014 data). A major problem 
facing the company is that its production and marketing must 
comply with strict global government regulations. With high 
Internet and mobile usage, it is important for companies to 
use online communication tools to reach and support its cus-
tomers. Moreover, the company has about 30,000 Internet 
domains. In the past several years, Johnson & Johnson has 
applied Internet media extensively, and as a result, achieved 
signiﬁ cant performance improvement. 
 Using Internet Media Channels 
 Using social media, Johnson & Johnson has grown in online 
strategies over the years . The following include some of its 
strategies. 

76
 Web 1.0 Stage 
 In 1996, for the ﬁ rst time in the company’s history, Johnson 
& Johnson launched its ﬁ rst website,  jnj.com , and began 
advertising in the cyberworld. This Web 1.0 website pre-
sented a simple online brochure to promote the company’s 
products. 
 Web 2.0 Stage 
 Several activities were conducted:
 1.  Kilmer House (First Blog) . In 2006, the company intro-
duced its ﬁ rst Web 2.0 promotional tools after using Web 
1.0 for over 10 years. Kilmer House was named after the 
company’s ﬁ rst science director, Dr. Frederick Barnett 
Kilmer. The goal for the blog was to “offer a way to tell 
some of the stories about the early days and history of 
Johnson & Johnson, and the people who worked here.” 
The blog was a perfect way for the company to enter the 
Web 2.0 era. 
 2.  JNJ BTW (The Corporate Blog).  In 2007, the company 
launched its seconds blog. This blog promised to become 
“the voice for the company.” JNJ BTW became a place 
where the company joined the online conversation about 
subjects that are related to Johnson & Johnson, and it 
became a great venue to offer public education about 
health care. More recently, the company added a blog for 
parents, called “JNJ Parents Blog.” ( jnjparents.com ). A 
blog for parents by parents, it covers a multitude of top-
ics, from family safety and wellness to social responsibil-
ity and holiday celebrations.  
 3.  JNJ Health Channel on YouTube. Through the company’s 
ﬁ rst three new social media channels, Johnson & Johnson 
gained the experience of producing good content without 
violating regulatory rules. In May 2008, the company 
launched two JNJ health test videos on YouTube: “Ask 
Dr. Nancy—Prostate Cancer” and “Obesity and Gastric 
Bypass Options.” In mid-2014, Johnson & Johnson had 
over a hundred videos with over ten million views and 
10,570 subscribers. The content covers a wide spectrum 
from health and wellness stories to innovations, company 
news, philanthropy, and sustainability. 
 4.  Twitter and Facebook. In March 2009, the company 
launched its Twitter channel, monitored and updated by 
Marc Monseau, the editor of the former JNJ BTW blog. 
J&J now has several Twitter accounts. Their “Johnson & 
Johnson Cares” Twitter account currently has 34,900 fol-
lowers and the company is excellent at posting frequent 
tweets, videos, and images. JNJ Cares uses the hashtag: 
#howloveworks. Its “J&J News” account posts updates 
and information for the media, and has over 69,000 fol-
lowers. In April 2009, the company created its ﬁ rst 
Facebook page ( facebook.com/jnj ), which, as of 
 mid-2014, had over 624,000 “likes.” The page contains a 
company overview, biographical information and focuses 
on “caring for the world, one person at a time.” Twitter 
and Facebook also serve as “bridging communicative 
tools” to integrate viewers into JNJ BTW for further 
details about Johnson & Johnson. The company’s 
Facebook page has links to some of its various websites 
including the J&J Channel.  
 5.  Other social media channels. Johnson & Johnson also 
maintains a Foursquare presence. People can check in 
when they visit the worldwide headquarters in Brunswick, 
New Jersey. In June 2013, Johnson & Johnson teamed up 
with the company (RED) to raise AIDS awareness. J&J 
donated $1 to the Global Fund to Fight Aids for every 
person who shared on social media (retweeting, pinning, 
etc.). J&J made a specially created infographic, which 
documents the progress the world has made ﬁ ghting 
AIDS since 2003 (see  mashable.com/2013/06/10/
share-red-campaign ). 
 Mobile Advertising Campaigns 
 In a classic example, Johnson & Johnson also integrated sev-
eral mobile promotional campaigns from 2007 to 2009.
  1.  Johnson & Johnson ACUVUE campaign with IM . J&J in 
Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan wanted new 
vibrant methods of engaging potential target consumers, 
and helped them understand the beneﬁ ts of the product 
(ACUVUE Moist Disposable Contact Lenses). In response 
to research showing that 85 % of daily contact lens wearers 
use instant messaging (IM) to stay in touch with their friends 
via chat throughout the work day, and their target audience 
would be “highly attracted” to images that are “friendly, 
cute, and fun,” the company worked with Microsoft Digital 
Advertising Solutions in 2007 to come up with a three-way 
strategy using linked components. They created a game 
called Saving Momo (hosted within Windows Live 
Messenger), a Theme Pack to be added to IM, and Windows 
Live Alerts. The theme pack included branded wallpapers, 
display pictures, and emoticons that enabled users to express 
their feelings while chatting. The “Saving Momo” game 
hinged on stopping the cartoon ﬁ gure Momo from getting 
dry eyes by giving him Acuvue, while they ran promotional 
banners on Hotmail Live and Messenger. All three strate-
gies highlighted the Johnson & Johnson’s ACUVUE 
brand of contact lenses. J&J was pleased with the results 
of 
the 
campaign 
(see 
 docstoc.com/docs/9919750/
Industrial-Marketing-Report-Update-johnson-and-
johnson-company ).  
 2.  Using a multichannel mobile campaign . In 2008, the 
company used in-call audio ads (ads played while people

are on hold on the phone), SMS, and mobile websites to 
create a new way to send out promotional messages to its 
target audiences. The company used VoodooVox In-Call 
Networks to attract target audiences to ﬁ ll out a form on 
the company’s Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 
page. Once an audience user ﬁ lls out the form, 
MindMatics, a German mobile services provider, alerts 
VoodooVox on the behalf of J&J, and it sends a free trial 
offer of One-Day ACUVUE Moist Lenses for consumers 
to try. 
 3.  Johnson & Johnson’s Zyrtec and iPhone 2.0 . Zyrtec is an 
over-the-counter allergy medication that generated 
$315.9 million of sales in 2008. In 2009, Johnson & 
Johnson conducted a mobile advertising campaign with 
The Weather Channel (TWC), putting a banner ad on 
TWC promoting a free application for iPhone users to 
download. TWC reaches more than 38 million users 
online each month, and it is the most popular online 
weather source in North America. The special feature is 
that it when the consumer clicks on the banner ad (giving 
an option to click on the “try it free” icon), it expands to 
take up most of the screen without closing the Weather 
Channel app. Therefore, the mobile advertising created a 
win- win situation for both the consumers and the brand, 
combining the latest forecast with an increased awareness 
of the Zyrtec brand. 
 Social Networks 
 Johnson & Johnson is very active in the use of social media. 
For example, on the company’s main Facebook page  face-
book.com/jnj , the company provides a link to its YouTube 
channel (J&J Channel), which offers extensive health infor-
mation. The Facebook page has over 625,000 million 
‘Likes’ and the most engaged city is São Paulo, Brazil 
(August 2014 data). J&J’s most active Twitter account is its 
@JNJNews. Finally, J&J is using social media to save lives 
(the “RED” AIDS awareness campaign discussed above; 
see Olenski  2013 ). 
 The results of an IMS Health Report (January 2014) 
revealed that J&J Pharma is #1 for social media engagement. 
Of the ten pharmaceutical companies that were active on 
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, Johnson & Johnson came out 
on top—by a wide margin (see Munro  2014 ). In June 2014, the 
FDA issued proposed social media guidelines for the pharma-
ceutical and medical devices industry. The guidelines proposed 
by the FDA include restrictions on product advertising on plat-
forms with character limitations, such as Twitter, and require 
companies to post the risks and beneﬁ ts associated with a prod-
uct (for more details, see  medcitynews.com/2014/06/
fda-finally-proposes-social-media-guidelines-pharma-
medical- device-makers ).  
 Results 
 The intensive campaigns on various new social media 
 platforms have resulted in signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial and manage-
rial performance improvements.
 1.  Robert Halper, director of video communication for 
Johnson & Johnson, explained the ROI (return on invest-
ment) of using new media: “There is certainly a subjec-
tive ROI in terms of our reputation. Look at some of the 
comments on our Nursing videos…Management that I 
report to is extremely positive about the channel, particu-
larly the large amount of views (over 700,000) and cost 
(essentially $0).” Halper goes on to state, “YouTube pro-
vides an excellent metric, including views over time, 
trends, most popular videos, even viewer retention rates. 
I provide this data to senior management in my depart-
ment, and sometimes to the operating companies, when 
applicable” (See Ploof  2009 ). 
 2.  Mobile advertising has shown positive results with mini-
mum effort over the years. In 2007, ACUVUE’s 1-month 
campaign recorded nearly 300,000 Theme Pack down-
loads and 200,000 game plays of Saving Momo. The 
campaign drove sales, improved the brand engagement 
within the target markets and had a positive viral impact 
on the brand. In 2008, Johnson & Johnson used the In- 
Call Network as another option to engage consumers, 
which made it easier for users to get a free trial of 
ACUVUE. 
 3.  The Zyrtec campaign achieved more than three million 
downloads in the ﬁ rst 3 months after it was launched, and 
The Weather Channel remained the number one down-
load for iPhone users in the Apple Store. Mobile advertis-
ing has been seen as “a real medium with real reach” 
because of its direct interaction between the brand and 
consumers (per Butcher  2009 ).

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 The opening case illustrates how Johnson & Johnson, 
a very large company, uses several social media tools 
to increase its customers’ awareness, positive attitude, 
and trial of its brands. The company started to com-
municate with its customers in blogs, later adding all 
major social media tools and social networks. The 
company runs several well-known campaigns with 
ﬁ nancial, administrative, and social-related success. 
We explain here, and in the rest of the chapter, how 
companies can use the above tools strategically. 
Opening Case: Johnson & Johnson Uses New Media Marketing

4.1 
 GETTING STARTED WITH SOCIAL 
MEDIA PROMOTIONS 
 The ﬁ rst step in effective and efﬁ cient social media market-
ing communication is to identify and gain a good under-
standing of an organization’s target markets and their social 
media use and behavior (see Fig.  4.1 ).
 Listening to Customers 
 This involves listening to customers, both collectively and 
individually.  Collective listening  occurs through quantitative 
and qualitative primary market research and social media 
monitoring via live dashboards. Johnson & Johnson hit gold 
when research revealed the high use of instant messaging 
(IM) among contact lens users and then used this information 
to design the Saving Momo game (hosted within Live 
Messenger).  Individual listening  occurs through participation 
in social media conversations and by monitoring these con-
versations through various techniques discussed in this book. 
 How does this listening to customers aid promotion strat-
egy and tactic selection? It helps businesses understand the 
characteristics, decision-making processes, behavior of tar-
get markets, and effectiveness of marketing stimuli to ulti-
mately increase sales and customer satisfaction, as discussed 
in Chap.   3 . In particular, marketers want to know three criti-
cal things that relate to a consumer’s experience with the 
AIDA model (Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action; see 
Chap.   3 ):
 1.   What proportion of their target markets is aware of the 
company’s brands and individual products (attention)?  
 2.  Are the attitudes of the markets positive or negative 
toward these brands (desire, interest)? 
 3.  What proportion of the market purchases the products 
and how frequently do they make repeat purchases 
(action)? 
 Developing Market Communication 
 Once marketers understand their consumer and business or 
government buyer markets on these dimensions, they can 
develop marketing communication goals for their social 
media campaigns. For example, if no one is aware of a new 
product or the features of a current product, the need to build 
market awareness will guide the communication message. If 
the blogosphere is active with product criticism, the goal will 
be to join the conversation with accurate information and 
genuine concern. For companies like Coca-Cola with nearly 
100 % awareness of the Coke product worldwide, the com-
munication goals shift to the action realm—how to motivate 
purchase among non-users or how to increase purchase 
amounts and occasions among users (such as Coke’s cam-
paigns to drink the product for breakfast). 
 Example 
 IBM believes it has a larger number of employees involved 
in social media than does any other corporation. It has over 
394,000 employees on LinkedIn, over 17,000 “likes” on its 
ofﬁ cial “Greater IBM Connection” Facebook page (global 
community of current and former employees), 89,000 mem-
bers in its LinkedIn Group and over 10,000 followers on 
Twitter. The ofﬁ cial Twitter page has 110,000 active 
 followers, while the ofﬁ cial FB page has over 531,000

“likes.” These social media participants present themselves 
as topic area experts—positioning IBM as the agenda setter, 
listening to local market discussions, gaining market insight, 
and ﬁ nding opportunities to add positive and helpful com-
ments to the social media conversations (Sysomos  2011 ). 
“We educate our sales force to be actively involved with 
social media; to make fewer calls per day, and spend the 
other time participating in conversations on LinkedIn, 
Twitter, etc. We’ve been able to create new leads that way 
and validate that time investment. We don’t host the  parties—
we need to ﬁ nd them and invite people back to ours,” accord-
ing to IBM Social Media Marketing Manager, Delphine 
Remy-Bautang. This social media involvement aids social 
commerce—in a survey of 2,300 employees, IBM found that 
its social media participation increased sales by 60 %, cus-
tomer satisfaction by 42 %, personal reputation by 64 %, and 
productivity by 74 %. Furthermore, the company expected to 
generate $4.8 billion in revenue in 2012 due to social media 
participation (Remy-Boutang  2014 ). 
 For the top 25 social media listening aids to increase your 
hearing (2014), see  biznology.com/2014/04/25-social-
media-listening-aids-to-increase-your- hearing  . 
 However, customers and prospects are not the only target 
markets for social media communication campaigns, as 
discussed next. 
 Social Media Target Markets 
 In the IBM example, social media participation increased 
employee productivity while working with customers. 
However, social media communication tactics often target an 
organization’s employees for the purpose of recruiting, 
information sharing, idea generation, or morale building. 
 Examples 
 Sharpe HealthCare posted a video on YouTube that featured 
employee interviews at a recruiting fair in San Diego. One 
employee said: “Passion, purpose, and possibility and that is 
why I’ve been here for 7 years” (see “Sharp Employees Talk 
About 
The 
Sharp 
Experience” 
at 
 youtube.com/
watch?v=25Ik9rAoQEs ). In another example, the employ-
ees of Connected Ventures created a humorous video: a “Lip 
Dub” version of the song “Flagpole Sitta” by Harvey 
Danger. It featured all the employees lip-syncing the song in 
the company ofﬁ ces. The video made Connected Ventures 
look like a really fun place to work. The company posted the 
video on Vimeo in 2007 (which went viral) with a last slide: 
“We’re hiring:  connectedventures.com/jobs.php .” Kevin 
Rose of Digg posted the video link on his Tumblr microb-
log, and many others sent tweets about it, resulting in over 
200 candidate applications in a very short time (see  vimeo.
com/173714 ). 
 In another interesting example, Orabrush created a 
humorous YouTube video about the beneﬁ ts of using its 
tongue cleaners. After it experienced 39 million views, the 
company spent only $28 on Facebook ads directed at 
Walmart retail buyers, which resulted in the distribution of 
the tongue cleaners to 3,500 Walmart stores (Neff  2011 ). 
 Starcom MediaVest Group (SMG) is a Marketing & 
Media Services company with approximately 8,000 employ-
ees in 67 countries. SMG’s ofﬁ cers went on a global tour 
with key partners: Google, Facebook, and MSN, and wanted 
to let SMG employees participate by providing meeting 
updates and answering questions while on the tour. Using the 
Yammer private enterprise social network, SMG beneﬁ ted 
by leveraging collective employee expertise, ﬁ nding key 
emerging topics and empowering and engaging the 1,549 
employees who followed the 3 day management dialogue 
(for more examples, see Yammer.com case studies at  about.
yammer.com/customers ). 
 Social media also connects business partners and distribu-
tion channel members for increased social commerce 
activity. 
 One important feature of social media communication is 
that, with their messages, companies can effectively and efﬁ -
ciently target markets as small as one person. Called  micro-
targeting , this is not possible to do with traditional media, 
except via direct postal mail, but information technology 
allows inexpensive automated messages to be sent to very 
small markets that share similar interests. 
 Social Media Communication Objectives 
 For companies, commerce is the ultimate goal of social 
media communication with customers and prospects, as 
mentioned previously. Organizations set very speciﬁ c, mea-
surable objectives before beginning any communication 
campaign, thus, helping to determine the budget/staff time. 
Companies then monitor the campaign with performance 
metrics to see if it is successfully accomplishing the objec-
tives (discussed in Chap.   5 ). An example commerce objec-
tive is to generate a 5 % increase in sales within 12 months. 
Companies can also set tactical objectives to support sales 
goals, such as increasing conversations, driving trafﬁ c to the 
website, gaining a large number of “likes” on Facebook, or 
changing negative views of the brand. The following spe-
ciﬁ c, general, and tactical objectives leading up to purchase 
will help guide communication messages or promotional 
offers, and move customers and prospects to the ultimate 
social commerce act: 
4.1 Getting Started with Social Media Promotions

 Examples of Goals and the Social Media 
Platform/Tool Tactics to Accomplish Them 
 Following steps 2 and 3 in Fig.  4.1 , we present the 
following: 
 Objectives in Non-proﬁ t and Government 
Organizations 
 Non-proﬁ t and government organizations also set goals for 
social media communication. Most seek to communicate with 
constituents for sharing information (such as “warning signs 
of heart disease”), promoting ideas (such as “stop smoking”), 
learning about constituents’ needs, and capturing innovations. 
 Examples 
 Doctors Without Borders ( doctorswithoutborders.org ) has 
a Facebook page with news, photos and videos of its work 
around the world. The page has over 702,000 Facebook 
“likes” as of July 2014 (see Shih  2011 for a full chapter on 
non-proﬁ t and government uses of social media). 
 In another government example, GovLoop, with over 
100,000 members, is a social network for any member of the 
government community, as well as students and others inter-
ested in working for the government, working on community 
service projects, or contracting for proﬁ t (see  govloop.com ). 
Speciﬁ c branches of the government also correspond with 
the public via social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogs). 
For example, the TSA blog is “sponsored by the Transportation 
Security Administration to facilitate an ongoing dialogue on 
innovations in security, technology and the checkpoint 
screening process” (see  blog.tsa.gov ). 
 As seen in previous examples, companies set communica-
tion goals for employees and partners as well, such as shar-
ing information, retaining employees, brainstorming and 
fostering creativity. The remainder of this chapter focuses on 
social media communication tools/platforms used to connect 
with a company’s selected consumer target markets. 
 Identify Social Media Hangouts 
 It can take a lot of time to monitor social media, so how does 
one know which tools and platforms are most effective for 
social commerce promotions? The answer: Go where the 
company target markets congregate. Facebook is an obvious 
•  Product Awareness: Sick Puppies is an Australian 
band that posted a YouTube video entitled “Free 
Hugs Campaign” and received over 75 million 
views in the 8 years since its 2006 upload.  
•  Interest and Desire: In 2010, Dunkin’ Donuts ran 
a Facebook campaign that invited followers to 
design a new donut, with the 12 ﬁ nalists receiving a 
prize of $1,200 worth of free donuts for life, and the 
winning entry to go on sale at the U.S. stores that 
autumn. Dunkin’ Donuts received 90,000 entries, 
tripling their Facebook fan base and gathering 
53,000 Twitter followers. WaveMetrix measured 
the conversation sentiment and discovered a sub-
stantial amount of positive conversation: 44 % 
regarding the promotion, 38 % discussing the great 
taste and nearly 20 % expressing love for the brand. 
The negative comments centered on lack of avail-
ability, inconvenient store locations and poor prod-
uct taste (see  wave.wavemetrix.com/content/
dunkin-donuts-uses-social-media-drive-
positive- brand-engagement-00107 ). 
•  Purchase: Ticketmaster created an interactive 
social seat map for over 9,000 events. When people 
want to buy tickets to an event, they can check in 
•  Current customers: Build brand loyalty, entice 
customer advocacy about the brand in social media, 
retain the customer’s business and build the pur-
chase frequency and quantity over time for all the 
company brands (more about this in Chap.   7 : Social 
CRM). 
•  Prospects:  Increase brand awareness, build interest 
and desire for the product and move to initial pur-
chase or other actions (such as registering in a social 
network or following the company’s Tweets and 
Vine Videos). 
•  Both customers and prospects: Engage customers 
through social media content by consuming infor-
mation, commenting or reviewing products, creat-
ing content, such as videos to upload and 
collaborating by posting innovative suggestions to 
improve the brands.  
from their Facebook account and view a seat map 
that shows where their Facebook friends are sitting. 
“Once people purchase their tickets, they can share 
their seat tag with friends, triggering a post about 
the seats on Facebook.” Their friends can then pur-
chase a ticket with a reserved seat nearby. This great 
new idea increased trafﬁ c to Ticketmaster by 33 % 
(see 
 facebook-successstories.com/ticketmaster 
for more information).

solution because of its huge market penetration among 
Internet users. However, there are some people who are 
either too young or who do not use technology on a regular 
basis, and if they are a company’s market, it is time for these 
marketers to stop reading this book. Low technology use 
occurs in some international markets, because only 2.9 bil-
lion people of the world’s 7.1 billion population had Internet 
access in 2014, so nearly 60 % of the world is not on 
Facebook or other social media sites—primarily in develop-
ing countries (see numbers of users by speciﬁ c country at 
 internetlivestats.com ). 
 What about Twitter? Nearly 16 % of Twitter users were 
active in 2014, according to research ﬁ rm  statista.com . Thus, 
a company will deﬁ nitely use Twitter if its customers and 
prospects are in the elite 16 %. For example, the singer, 
Beyoncé, recorded a new album and posted videos of herself 
and the album cover on Instagram. Within 12 hour there were 
1.2 million tweets about the album and more than 430,000 
copies were sold on iTunes within 24 hour (Tracy  2013 ). 
 Discovering the Best Social Media to Use 
 There are three ways to discover which social media sites the 
target markets frequent. First, following the traditional media 
model, check with each social media property to get statistics 
on user proﬁ les to see the proportion of overlap with the com-
pany’s target market(s). If there is signiﬁ cant presence in that 
medium, this is an effective place to participate. For example, 
marketers can visit the Facebook advertising section, select 
the speciﬁ c market proﬁ le desired, and ﬁ nd the number of 
users in that market. Figure  4.2 displays a Facebook ad for a 
music event narrowly targeted to 2,520 local residents, with 
interests that make them an ideal target market, as listed in 
their proﬁ les. When placing the ad, the company was able to 
specify exactly which Facebook users would be shown the 
ads on their home pages. After selecting the geographic, psy-
chographic, and demographic criteria, Facebook presents 
advertisers with the number of users in the target who will see 
the ad on their home pages. In this example, the advertiser 
selected characteristics based on the following user proﬁ les 
presented by Facebook when creating the ad:
•  Live in the United States and within 50 miles of Reno, 
Nevada 
•  Eighteen years of age or older 
•  Have the following interests in their proﬁ les: Buddhism, 
Deepak Chopra, meditating, metaphysics, Power Now, 
Reiki energy, sound healing, spirituality, tai chi, or yoga 
(Facebook presented options and the advertiser simply 
selected them). 
 The seconds way to discover the best social media for 
reaching a desired target market is to survey the company’s 
customers to see which social media they use and assume 
that prospective customers with similar characteristics are 
also using that medium. The third way is to participate in 
social media that seem appropriate and to see if customers 
and prospects engage in this content. Be careful with this 
experimental approach, however, because you do not want 
to spend too much time with trial and error if it does not 
help to achieve the social commerce objectives. In contrast, 
sometimes the social media chooses the company because 
employees may detect conversation about the brands, 
 executives, or company itself in a medium previously 
unused by the company and will want to participate in that 
discussion. 
 If the company detects many effective social media, then 
the decision is based on efﬁ ciency: Do the company’s 
employees have time to communicate in them all, or if the 
company is buying advertising, which ones are the least 
expensive to reach the market? Advertising pricing models 
will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
 The ﬁ nal consideration involves platforms preferred by 
target customers. For instance, there are many effective and 
efﬁ cient applications and other tools for mobile phone users 
that are not available on computers, and if that is where a 
company’s target market spends time, promotions should be 
tailored for the mobile phone format. 
 After the groundwork for successful promotional cam-
paigns is completed, companies will select the social media 
tools used for social commerce.

4.2 Promotional Tools: Deﬁ nitions and Use

have speciﬁ c deﬁ nitions of the ﬁ ve key marketing communi-
cation tools they use (often called the “promotion mix”). 
These deﬁ nitions help when selecting the appropriate tool(s) 
to create the desired effect in the target market. Following 
are deﬁ nitions from the best-selling textbook,  Principles of 
Marketing (Kotler and Armstrong  2013 ), along with social 
media platform examples that the company controls (versus 
user generated content): 
 In general, marketers have the least control over the 
advertising tool because they are placing messages on 
someone else’s social media platform, and the medium will 
have technical, legal, content, and ad size requirements. In 
addition, companies must develop the advertising content 
and also pay for the space, whereas the other tools only 
require staff time or technology costs to develop the con-
tent. In addition, note that marketers combine many of 
these tools for increased social commerce effectiveness, 
such as when an advertisement carries a sales promotion 
discount offer or link to a public relations content (such as 
a video). For example, an ad intended to build awareness of 
a new product will more likely compel users to purchase if 
the ad also carries a link to the product and a limited time 
discount offer. 
 In the spirit of social media transparency, we also want to 
point out that these tools have been used for decades in tradi-
tional media (such as television, radio, magazines, newspa-
pers, and outdoor spaces), but social media opportunities are 
really pushing marketers to redeﬁ ne and upgrade these tools. 
 We now move to social media carrying the marketing 
communication messages via these promotion mix tools.  
4.3 
 SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOCIAL 
COMMERCE COMMUNICATION 
 Media are communication channels used to disseminate 
news, information, entertainment and promotional mes-
sages. Like all media, social media can take many different 
forms, including text, images, audio, or video, as discussed 
in Chap.  2 . Social media are one type of media, with two dif-
ferentiating characteristics: (1) they consist of online plat-
forms and tools; and (2) they blend technology and social 
interactions for the co-creation of value. That is, people use 
social media for social interactions and conversations (refer 
to Chap.   2 ). In this deﬁ nition, “people” collectively refers to 
organizations, their employees, customers, and prospects 
and the general population of Internet users. 
•  Advertising : “Any paid form of non-personal pre-
sentation and promotion of ideas, goods, or services 
by an identiﬁ ed sponsor.” Social media examples: 
Paid message placed in a YouTube video, Facebook 
or LinkedIn ad, Google AdWords, promoted 
Tweets, paid product placement in virtual worlds or 
online games, and ad sponsored content delivered 
to mobile phones.  
•  Public relations : “Building good relations with the 
company’s various publics by obtaining favorable 
publicity, building up a good corporate image, and 
handling or heading off unfavorable rumors, sto-
ries, and events.” Social media examples: Company- 
created multimedia content (e.g., online videos, 
blogs, wikis, photos, book/product reviews, pod-
casts and answering questions on sites such as 
eHow and Yahoo! Answers), social media press 
releases, viral videos and other content, social 
media events, participation in virtual worlds, social 
bookmarking and tagging, conversation/comment-
ing on other people’s content about brands, social 
media apps for mobile phones.  
•  Sales promotion : “Short-term incentives to encour-
age the purchase or sale of a product or service.” 
Social media examples: Groupon shared discounts, 
free sampling of digital products (e.g., music, soft-
ware, research, or news stories), contests/sweep-
stakes, games (e.g., advergames, where the product 
is featured in the game can be a combination of 
advertising and sales promotion).  
•  Direct marketing : “Direct connections with care-
fully targeted individual consumers, to both obtain 
an immediate response and cultivate lasting cus-
tomer relationships—the use of direct mail, the 
telephone, direct response television, e-mail, the 
Internet, and other tools to communicate directly 
with speciﬁ c customers.” Social media examples: 
The entire Internet and social media might be con-
sidered direct marketing; however, speciﬁ c social 
commerce examples falling only in this category 
include text messaging with offers from companies, 
behavioral targeting (displaying ads based on user 
behavior online), location based systems, and RSS 
feeds of content to individuals who opt in to receive 
the data. 
•  Personal selling : “Personal interactions between a 
customer and the ﬁ rm’s sales force for the purpose 
of making sales and building customer relation-
ships.” Social media examples: Chat bots that allow 
for conversation on a website (also called virtual 
agents/assistants) and sales lead generation tools.

 Social Media Platforms 
 Marketers place multimedia content in many types of social 
media platforms. These platforms facilitate social actions, 
such as interaction and conversation. Following are repre-
sentative platforms used for social commerce, as was dis-
cussed in Chap.   2    , and in more detail later in this chapter 
and Chap.   5    . 
 Owned, Paid, and Earned Social Media 
 Over 46 % of companies reported that social media drove 
business sales in 2013, according to  Forbes (Makovsky 
 2013 ).  Forbes also reported that the following proportions of 
businesses use these social media: Facebook (89 %), Twitter 
(88 %), LinkedIn (78 %), YouTube (71 %) and corporate 
blogging (51 %). How do they select from among this pleth-
ora of social media tools to achieve social commerce goals 
within their selected target markets? To help companies sort 
out the opportunities, Forrester Industry Analyst Sean 
Corcoran developed a rubric to classify all media into three 
categories (earned, owned, and paid), giving an explanation 
of the roles, deﬁ nitions, beneﬁ ts, and challenges of each type 
(traditional, Internet, and social; Corcoran  2009 ). The 
Interactive Advertising Bureau Social Media Committee 
revised this rubric to classify only social media into the same 
three categories: 
 Table  4.1 summarizes the roles, beneﬁ ts, and challenges 
of social media. Effective social commerce campaigns will 
have both owned and paid media components as their foun-
dation in order to achieve earned media objectives—such as 
a YouTube video it creates (owned) and an ad in a related 
YouTube video (paid). These, in turn, will help motivate 
earned media components, such as when consumers com-
ment on the videos or pass the video link along on their 
Facebook pages and other media.
 Social Media Content 
 Content generated by sellers drives owned, paid, and much 
of the earned media (see Fig.  4.3  for an overview).  Content 
marketing , as deﬁ ned by the Content Marketing Institute, 
is “a marketing technique of creating and distributing valu-
able, relevant, and consistent content to attract and acquire a 
clearly deﬁ ned audience – with the objective of driving 
proﬁ table consumer action…. It is an  ongoing process that 
is best integrated into your overall marketing strategy, and it 
focuses on  owning media , not renting it” [emphasis in the 
•  Article sharing (e.g., Delicious bookmarking, Digg 
social tagging) 
•  Blogs and microblogs (e.g., Blogger, Tumblr, 
Twitter) 
•  Mobile Apps (e.g., company-speciﬁ c apps and 
many other dedicated apps like Foursquare that are 
available for both mobile and Web platforms) 
•  Multimedia sharing sites (e.g., Photo sharing: 
Flickr, Photobucket, Video sharing: Vimeo, 
YouTube, Vine, and audio sharing: e.g., iTunes, 
Pandora, Spotify)  
•  Messaging and chatting: WhatsApp, Viber, Line, 
Google+ Hangouts, WeChat 
•  Peer-to-peer consumer product selling and barter-
ing (e.g., Craigslist, peer-to-peer lending institu-
tions online) 
•  Public and private communities (e.g., Google 
Groups, Wikipedia, and a company’s private 
community)  
•  Search engine rankings (e.g., Google, Bing; Wink, 
PeekYou—for social media) 
•  Social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, dating 
sites and many more/Wikipedia lists over 100 social 
networks) 
•  Virtual worlds (e.g., Seconds Life, Webkinz) 
•  Wikis (e.g., Wikipedia, wikiHow) 
•  Mashups (e.g., Facebook Places, Google Places) 
 1.  Owned media carry communication messages 
from the organization to Internet users on channels 
that are owned and, thus, at least partially con-
trolled by, the company. 
 2.  Paid media are when the brand pays to leverage 
social media properties. These are properties owned 
by others who are paid by the organization to carry 
its promotional messages (e.g., advertising). The 
company controls the content; however, the media 
have content and technical requirements to which 
the advertisers must adhere. 
 3.  Earned media are when customer conversations 
become the channel: Messages about a company 
that are generated by social media authors (such as 
bloggers), traditional journalists on media websites, 
and by Internet users who share opinions, experi-
ences, insights, and perceptions on social media 
sites and mobile applications. Companies have the 
least amount of control over this media channel; 
however, they respond to customer conversation 
and try to guide it toward their positive brand mes-
sages (earned media are discussed in Chap.   5 ).

original quote] (see  contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-
is- content- marketing  ). This is an interesting and huge 
trend, in which companies are organizing themselves as 
online media publishers. Marketers have long created con-
tent ofﬂ ine when they create paper ﬂ yers, newsletters, bro-
chures, catalogs, infomercials, and DVDs (“interrupt” 
marketing). What is new is that marketers now use digital 
content as inbound marketing that attracts customers and 
prospects. It is about having content available to inform, 
entertain, and engage users when they seek the company —
 and most Internet users in both B2B and B2C markets do 
searches and come across this material when researching or 
shopping. For example, instead of placing a banner ad that 
might receive as little as a 0.5 % click though, many compa-
nies create video content that entertains, engages, and 
entices users to visit the company website to learn more. 
Some companies publish small items, such as videos, online 
press releases and blog posts. Others create lengthy white 
papers, infographics, and e-books. For example, we received 
e-mails about white papers on various social commerce top-
ics and clicked through to download the papers as research 
for writing this book.
 Next, we will discuss various social platforms and tools 
used for owned and paid media. Chapter   5 addresses how 
owned and paid media result in earned media to motivate 
social commerce. Keep in mind that no categorization 
scheme is perfect, and many tools can be used for more than 
just one goal. 
4.4 
 OWNED SOCIAL MEDIA 
 In this section, we discuss some of the social media channels 
that are partially controlled by the organizations that create 
the lion’s share of the multimedia content. The primary goals 
are to (1) engage consumers with the positive brand content, 
(2) entice them to pass this content along to others (earned 
media), and (3) build social CRM (customer relationship 
management). All of these goals attempt to increase social 
commerce initial and repeat purchases. Companies often 
inform consumers of sales promotion offers using some of 
these channels (such as discount offers, contests/sweep-
stakes or free product samples). 
 Controlling Social Media 
 Note that companies can monetize their owned media con-
tent in three important ways. First, they can sell digital con-
tent on their social media properties, such as white papers, 
music, software, or online Webinars (and many other prod-
ucts). In addition, the Shopify.com shopping cart service 
now offers a Facebook webstore option for selling tangible 
products. Seconds, they can accept Google’s Ad Sense or 
other types of ads and receive payment when users click on 
these ads. These ads can appear on a company’s own website 
or blog, and also in multimedia content it uploads elsewhere, 
such as ads shown in their own YouTube videos (in this case, 
the company shares revenue with the site owner, YouTube). 
The third way is to become an afﬁ liate of another website, 
such as Amazon. Companies receive revenue when users 
click on a book or other product featured on their blogs or 
other social media property and subsequently purchase it on 
Amazon (for example, see  pathtobliss.com/books.html ). 
 It is important to include visuals, such as videos and 
images, in all owned media (and paid media). This is because 
the human brain processes visuals much faster than it does 
text, (60,000 times faster) and posts with visuals increase 
content engagement by 180 %. Finally, the target market 
spends 100 % more time on sites that contain videos (Walter 
and Gioglio  2014 ). This partially explains the rapid growth 
of Pinterest, YouTube, and Instagram. Bottom line: 
Storytelling through words and images is critical to captur-
ing the user’s attention. 
 Types of Owned Social Media 
 Chapter   2  described most of the following types of owned 
media and the following expands on some of them:
•  Websites dedicated to gathering customer opinions. Some 
sites exist for consumers to provide new product ideas. 
For example, Starbucks has a site that encourages people 
to post and comment on new products, experiences, or 
community involvement suggestions. As of August 2014, 
the site had received over 198,000 suggestions (see  mys-
tarbucksidea.force.com ). Dell’s IdeaStorm invites prod-
uct suggestions and comments and votes from users. Dell 
personnel respond with a section called “Implemented 
Ideas” (see  ideastorm.com ). Providing company feed-
back encourages users to submit ideas. 
•  Online public and private communities. Companies 
create spaces for consumers, prospects and business 
customers to discuss topics of interest or seek company 
support with technical or product issues (among other 
goals). These include social networks such as Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, and numerous special 
interest- based networks and online classiﬁ ed sites 
(e.g., Craigslist). Organizations create proﬁ les and 
pages in these networks and post content to start 
conversations.  
•  Blogs and microblogs. Individuals in sponsoring organi-
zations create blogs to express opinions, discuss product 
uses, and share information in sites such as Blogger, 
Tumblr, and the WordPress publishing platform. Twitter 
started as a microblogging site that turned into a social 
4.4 Owned Social Media

network, so it spans both categories. Blogs can be added 
to a company’s Facebook page (and other social net-
works), as well as to the company’s own website. 
Sometimes blogs are authored by many employees, such 
as Kodak’s “A Thousand Words,” where employees share 
personal stories, illustrated with images they took using 
Kodak cameras (see  1000words.kodak.com ). 
•  Multimedia sharing sites. These include photographic 
image sharing (e.g., Flickr, Pinterest, Instagram, and 
Photobucket), video sharing (e.g., YouTube, Vine, and 
Vimeo), and podcast (audio) sharing (e.g., iTunes and 
Sound Cloud). Sellers can bring their products to life and 
improve their visitors’ experiences by adding video or 
audio content to their product pages on social networks or 
their corporate portals. They can further increase their 
Google search presence by uploading business photos to 
a Flickr stream, and use an app to bring the stream onto 
their website. 
•  Virtual worlds. Companies can create a presence in meta-
verses such as Seconds Life, or create their own virtual 
world to support commerce, such as Webkinz. On 
Webkinz children enter a key code from a stuffed Webkinz 
animal they purchased at a brick and mortar retailer, then 
create a life online for their animal, while connecting with 
others doing the same (see  webkinz.com ). In Seconds 
Life, companies can create a virtual webstore, multimedia 
event or talk/lecture, contest, and can also create blogs. 
They can publish a URL containing streaming audio or 
video content and publish it, so that other Seconds Life 
residents will view their content and subscribe. Companies 
can also participate in Seconds Life media, such as pro-
viding content for the in-world radio and television sta-
tions. Obviously, all of this content must be enticing 
enough for in-world residents or it will not be consumed. 
Other interesting tactics include offering visitors branded 
items, such as clothing containing logos (every avatar 
wants that Calvin Klein Beanie hat!). Finally, some com-
panies use their avatars as promotional vehicles, engaging 
other avatars in conversation about the brand and offering 
sales promotions such as coupons. For example, the 
Nesquik Bunny avatar hops around Seconds Life, attend-
ing various events (for more information see  wiki.secon-
dlife.com/wiki/Advertising_in_Seconds_Life ). 
•  Company-hosted virtual events. Organizations host 
Webinars and online events that attract participants who 
can send questions and chat with each other during the 
event. 
•  Mashups. These include many types of website combina-
tions to engage consumers. One notable example is 
Google Places for Business, which allows business own-
ers to list their business name and location so that mobile 
and computer users can ﬁ nd the business location on a 
Google Map. Lil’ Piddlers Pet Grooming & Boutique in 
Oakland Park, Florida realized a 30 % increase in sales 
within 5 years of using Google Places (search for “places 
for business success stories” at  google.com for more). 
 Focus on Pinterest 
 Pinterest (see Chap.   2 opening case) is responsible for 23 % of 
all social commerce sales (Bobowski  2014 ). Sellers build 
business by creating Pinterest boards of new products, best-
selling products, gift ideas and promotional offers. Forever 21 
ran a contest that encouraged Pinterest users to build boards 
with Forever 21 products and win a chance to get a $1,000 gift 
card. In July 2013, Shopify, a leading commerce platform for 
over 100,000 stores, recently added Pinterest’s “rich pins,” 
making it easier for shoppers to discover things they like and 
purchase from those stores directly (see  business.pinterest.
com/en/blog/welcome-shopify-stores- pinterest  ). These pins 
include meta data taking Pinterest users directly to posted 
products. Shopify reported a 70 % increase in click throughs 
from Pinterest to its merchants, based on rich pins. Shopify 
noted that Pinterest is a better marketing communication tool 
than Twitter or Facebook (see  shopify.com/blog ).  
 Focus on Twitter and Other Microblogging 
 Twitter and other microblogging social network sites allow 
sellers to create text, video, or image-based content of inter-
est for followers. Companies can tweet about their business 
and product offerings, announce sales promotions, and entice 
Twitter followers (as well as their own followers) to visit the 
virtual or brick and mortar store. For example, in 2010, 
Virgin America gave away free ﬂ ights to tweeters with a 
large number of followers who would entice conversation 
and a lot of trafﬁ c about the company’s new destination, 
Toronto, Canada. The social commerce software suites (e.g., 
from 3dCart) help merchants reach their Twitter followers by 
posting “tweets” when the merchants add new products or 
create new promotions. 
 It is extremely important to send interesting and informa-
tional posts on a microblog and not use a “hard sell” as the 
major topic of the tweet. People on Twitter want to know 
“what are you doing?” and “what can you tell me?” and not 
“what are you selling?” A smart marketer will conceal the 
promotional message in the post or comment. A very smart 
marketer will present him or herself as a subject area expert 
who happens to work at a particular company in a speciﬁ c 
ﬁ eld. Note that only one of Twitter’s competitors is really 
successful. It is an Asian mobile microblogging platform, 
“migme” (formerly Mig33; see  mig.me ). 
 The following are ways to use Twitter for successful pro-
motional campaigns (see  business.twitter.com ): 
4 Marketing Communications in Social Media

87
 Other Types of Owned Social Media 
 There are many other important owned social media proper-
ties to support social commerce activities. For example, com-
pany employees can establish expertise in their industries by 
answering questions on Yahoo! Answers or eHow, or by 
reviewing books at Amazon.com and other booksellers on 
topics related to their product categories. In the following sec-
tions, we will discuss four important avenues: Online gaming, 
gifting, branded apps and the social media press release. 
 Online Games and Advergaming 
 Games can be played on three types of hardware: Consoles, 
PCs, and portable devices. Zynga, Inc. produces online 
games and sells virtual products to players who use real cur-
rency to buy them. In “FishVille,” for example, the company 
successfully sells a virtual translucent anglerﬁ sh and other 
ﬁ sh for $3 to $4 each. Some players spend thousands of dol-
lars a month on virtual skyscrapers in “CityVille” or imagi-
nary chickens in “FarmVille.” Although the majority of the 
players do not purchase any items with real currency, the 
amount of monthly users is so large that the number of peo-
ple who buy these “imaginary” chickens and skyscrapers 
generate “big bucks” for the company (Wingﬁ eld  2011 ). 
 Advertisers sometimes use online fantasy games (e.g., 
available at Yahoo!, ESPN, and more) to send ads to speciﬁ c 
sports fans (e.g., fans of National Football League or Major 
League Baseball). Online fantasy sports attract millions of 
visitors every month. 
 Advergaming (in-game advertising) refers to (1) games 
featuring a company’s product, or (2) the integration of 
advertisements into video games, especially computer-based 
ones: both promote a company’s product or a service. Video 
games are popular in social networks and give advertisers a 
chance to reach millions of game players. For an example, 
see Intel’s gaming page “IT Manager Duels” ( itmanagerdu-
els.intel.com ).  Enter the Matrix , the ﬁ rst video game based 
on  The Matrix series of ﬁ lms, is one such game that includes 
hyperlinks for players to click on to learn more about the plot 
of the next level. Advergames are unabashedly commercial 
by nature, but if they are fun and exciting, players will enjoy 
them and tell their friends. Advergames create brand aware-
ness and viral marketing: word-of-mouth. 
 During the fall back-to-school season in 2008, JC Penney 
created an online game for girls on Facebook called Dork- 
Dodge. Players had to navigate their way past undesirable 
boyfriends to get to their dream date. The retailer also had an 
interactive video (a modern-day take on the movie  The 
Breakfast Club ) where users could choose clothes from JC 
Penney for the actors. 
 For details on advergaming, see  adverblog.com/cate-
gory/advergames . Camaret ( 2013 ) provides several deﬁ ni-
tions of social and other types of advergaming, along with 
some examples of successful advergames. 
 Online Gifting 
 GroupCard’s application (acquired by InComm) allows 
retailers to sell group gift cards on their own websites and 
social networking pages. What is unique about this app is 
that the customer who creates the card can circulate it to 
many others, who then can add additional personalized mes-
sages and contribute a dollar amount via PayPal. GroupCard 
also offers collaborative gifting so that a group of people can 
combine funds for a gift certiﬁ cate at the merchant’s own 
Web properties (see  groupcard.com ). 
 JibJab ( jibjab.com ) allows users to create videos and 
eCards using images of friends or family. Consumers upload 
•  Industry analysts, journalists, bloggers, and other 
inﬂ uencers from most sectors of the economy are 
well-represented on Twitter. Smart companies tweet 
interesting content (i.e., not just marketing materi-
als) and engage in dialog to get consumers talking, 
tweeting, and blogging about the company. 
•  Staying in touch with customers on Twitter is not 
only more real-time than many other techniques, it 
is also far more cost-effective than direct mail, 
attending trade shows, phoning, or even maintain-
ing a customer newsletter. It is not that Twitter can 
replace other touch points completely, but it can 
reduce the required cost and frequency of high- 
touch interactions. 
•   It is very likely that customers, prospects, and key 
inﬂ uencers are already having conversations about 
an industry, or the company and its competition on 
Twitter. If companies are not participating in that 
conversion, they are missing valuable intelligence, 
business opportunities, and possibly even the 
opportunity to prevent potential damage to the 
ﬁ rm’s reputation. For example, American Apparel 
uses Twitter to solicit and discuss ideas for ads, 
posts ﬂ ash sales, and do holiday campaigns to give 
away free costumes (see  blog.twitter.com/2014/
influencer-qa-with-ryan-holiday-american-
apparel-sold-50k-in-an-hours-on-twitter ). 
•  Hashtags continue to grow in popularity on Twitter 
and in other social networks. They are used to 
spread and categorize information. On Twitter, 
#hashtags are also used to categorize posts into 
“trending topics.”

a headshot from their computers and drag it into the hilarious 
and charming videos, then send the link to the person in the 
headshot or post it on a social network. These can quickly go 
viral, and more people visit the site to pay $1.99 to download 
the video or $18 a year to make more eCards and videos in a 
premier account. 
 Branded Apps 
 Many companies create branded online applications and 
widgets that support social interactions and user contribu-
tions. “ Widgets are mini Web applications that are used to 
distribute or share content throughout the social Web, down-
loaded to a mobile device or desktop, or accessed on a web-
site or blog,” according to the “Social Media Buyer’s Guide” 
(Interactive Advertising Bureau  2010 ). The content in wid-
gets can be branded information, games, or other types of 
interactive content. 
 For example, Nike+ iPod Sports Kit is a sensor applica-
tion that measures the distance and pace of a user’s walk or 
run in the physical world. It uses a unit embedded in the 
shoes that communicates with any iPod. Nike+ has many 
such apps. Facebook features hundreds of thousands of 
third- party software applications on its site. One popular 
application allows companies to run contests on Facebook 
and collect user e-mails and other information.  
 Making Press Relations Social Media Friendly 
 The traditional press release is a typed document that 
includes the “what, when, where, who, and why” of some-
thing newsworthy the company sends to journalists for pos-
sible inclusion in print or online media (e.g., a new product 
announcement). Many companies include these text heavy 
press releases as links on their websites, or worse, as PDF 
ﬁ les for download. This is changing. Now bloggers and other 
social media journalists want to gain quick bits of informa-
tion and expert quotes on topics they are writing about. 
Because they want to include images, video, and text infor-
mation for articles, news releases are beginning to become 
social media friendly. Figure  4.4 is an updated social media 
press release template created by Shift Communications 
(2012), to be used on company websites. Following is the 
key to the numbered features on this outstanding press 
release template (Social Media Press Release 2.0):
 1.  Sharing tools  (previously “simple sharing buttons”) 
allow users to share speciﬁ c content from the release. 
 2.  Shift recommends that  headlines contain fewer than 55 
characters for mobile-friendliness and easy retweeting 
and resharing in social networks. 
 3.  It is important to include a link to a  YouTube video 
because this platform is mobile-friendly, has the largest 
video audience online that loves to share, and nearly 
every social network recognizes YouTube URLs. 
 4.  It is good to have an audio service like  SoundCloud 
because this platform is mobile-compatible and 
shareable. 
 5.  Photo galleries are key, with Flickr being an excellent 
choice due to its high sharing ability and defense of intel-
lectual property. 
 6.  Social commenting allows for integrating social discus-
sions into Facebook and other systems.  
 7.  Use  selected contact information based on particular 
social media, which the company uses actively. 
 8.  While not displayed here, the  entire press release is 
embedded inside a marketing automation system . This 
allows the company to see who has shared the release. 
 The large PR ﬁ rm, Edelman, uses social media press 
releases, along with traditional releases. This new form of 
press release includes the important facts and is largely inter-
active, providing links to company-created multimedia and 
white papers. It is especially social media friendly because it 
allows for easy pass along with social media buttons. This 
press release is the brainchild of Shift Communication’s 
Todd Defren, who also created a social media newsroom 
template for company websites, similar to what is being used 
by Google and other companies.

 PAID SOCIAL MEDIA: ADVERTISING 
 As previously mentioned, social media sites sell space to 
advertisers who wish to reach the site’s audience. Paid media 
can engage target markets, moving them to owned media and 
resulting in social media conversation (earned media). Great 
content will not stay trapped in owned media but will spread 
(such as videos or white papers). Paid media often also car-
ries sales promotions, such as discounts. This cycle of 
owned, paid, and earned media can also result in increased 
e-commerce sales. 
 In this section, we discuss the purchasing of advertising 
space on these sites. The ﬁ ndings of a 2012 Nielsen study 
conducted by Digiday concluded that marketers will use 
more social media advertisements in 2013. According to the 
survey, 75 % of advertisers and 81 % of ad agencies invest in 
paid social media advertising. Furthermore, 64 % of those 
advertisers said they plan to spend more on social advertis-
ing in the future (Nielsen  2013 ). Marketers use social media 
advertising to achieve the following objectives:
•  Create positive brand images 
•  Build brand awareness 
•  Generate video views 
4 Marketing Communications in Social Media

•  Generate leads/build database 
•  Gain feedback about products 
•  Support product introductions 
•  Drive trafﬁ c to an online destination 
•  Increase size of community (friends, followers, fans) 
•  Engage existing customers in conversation 
•  Sell products (the ultimate goal) 
 Thus, paid social media are for building awareness, creat-
ing positive brand attitudes; collecting valuable information 
about customers; and motivating actions such as joining a 
community, clicking through to a site, and purchase. To drive 
sales, users require a compelling reason to click. For exam-
ple, the fast-food chain Chick-ﬁ l-A ran a successful Facebook 
free-sample sales promotion engagement ad campaign; click-
ing on the ad revealed a form to receive a mail-in coupon. 
 Advertising is the major current revenue source for social 
commerce media companies. Advertisers are willing to pay a 
great deal for placing ads and running promotions in social 
networks because of the large number of visitors in the 
 networks and the amount of time they spend there. Consider 
these statistics:
•  Online advertising in 2013 hit $42.8 billion, which is 
25 % of all advertising expenditures (both on- and ofﬂ ine; 
Interactive Advertising Bureau  2014a ). 
•  Some of the ad formats in 2013 that support social com-
merce include: Search marketing (43 %), display/banner 
advertising (19 %) and mobile ads 17 % of the $42.8 
 billion total, (Interactive Advertising Bureau  2014a ). 
•  Facebook has over one million advertisers who spent 
$2.59 billion on Facebook advertising in 2013. Mobile ad 
revenue was 53 % of that total (Edwards  2014 ). 
 Like other SC activities, advertising is placed both in pub-
lic as well as in private company-owned social networks. 
Before discussing a few examples of advertising in social 
media, it is important to understand how advertising is cre-
ated and purchased: The formats and pricing models.

4.5 Paid Social Media: Advertising

90
 Advertising Formats 
 Anything goes with paid media online: text—from a sen-
tence to pages of story—graphics, sound, video, hyperlinks, 
or an animated car driving through a page. A paid search ad, 
prompted by keywords, is the most important technique. 
Mobile advertising is the fastest growing category. Many of 
these also have interactive capability—involving mutual 
action between consumers and producers. This occurs when 
the advertiser provides a link, game, or direct purchase shop-
ping cart within the ad, and the consumer can click on the ad 
to activate a drop down menu or other interactive feature. 
For example, Virgin America created an interactive ad that 
allows users to vote for their favorite in-ﬂ ight feature: (a) 
Electrical plugs at every seat, (b) MP3s, movies and TV or 
(c) fresh food, mixed drinks. The bottom of the ad indicated 
the number of people voting and if the ad is used in a social 
network, how many of the voters are the user’s friends. 
 Advertisers use social media to build brand awareness, 
engage existing customers, increase size of community 
(friends, followers, fans) and drive trafﬁ c to an online desti-
nation. Advertisers also use social media to introduce new 
products, build databases, and gain feedback from users. 
Next, are some examples. 
 Display Ads 
 These use text and graphics, as well as the company’s logos 
and contact information/Web links. Display ads are popular 
ofﬂ ine in billboards, the Yellow Pages, and movies. Internet 
display ads come in many different sizes, the most popular of 
which are banners, buttons, rectangles, and skyscrapers (tall 
and narrow) ads. See the Interactive Advertising Bureau for 
deﬁ nitions of standard display advertising units and many 
other new creative “rising star” formats (go to ( iab.net/guide-
lines/508676/508767/ad_unit ). All major search advertising 
companies (e.g., Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft’s Bing) gain rev-
enue by selling their huge audience’s attention to advertisers 
via display ads. Display ads also appear as overlays on videos; 
however, these only account for a small portion of all online 
advertising. The reason for this may be that social media mar-
keting is more effective (consumers are tired of seeing display 
ads), according to a survey of 10,000 brand marketers, social 
media consultants, and inﬂ uencers (Denny  2013 ).  
 Classiﬁ ed Ads 
 These usually use text, but may also include photos. The ads 
are grouped according to classiﬁ cation (e.g., cars, rentals), 
and tend to be the least expensive format. 
 Classiﬁ ed ads can be found on dedicated sites (e.g.,  craig-
slist.org  and  superpages.com ), as well as online newspapers, 
exchanges, and Web portals. In many cases, posting regular-
size classiﬁ ed ads is free, but making them larger, in color, or 
with some other noticeable features is done for a fee.  
 Choose-Your-Own-Ad Format 
 Hulu “Ad Selector” is an online video format created in 
2010, which lets users choose their own ads. The AdSelector 
allows consumers to select what ads they like to view prior 
to streaming content (they are presented with two or three 
options). This model has been in use mostly for online vid-
eos with Hulu. Publishers like Yahoo! and CBS use the Ad 
Selector. For details, see Learmonth ( 2010 ). For an interac-
tive demonstration of how Ad Selector works, see  hulu.com/
watch/76466 . 
 Social Ads 
 A  social ad is “an online ad that incorporates user interac-
tions that the consumer has agreed to display and be shared. 
The resulting ad displays these interactions along with the 
user’s persona (picture and/or name) within the ad content” 
(Interactive Advertising Bureau  2009 ). A social ad has 
three criteria: Ad content customization based on proﬁ le 
data, targeting information, and social interaction function-
ality. Data to create these ads comes from the user’s proﬁ le 
data, social data (connections between individuals), and 
interaction data (data about the user’s online interaction 
with friends). For example, Fig.  4.5 displays an ad that was 
created from Judy’s Facebook proﬁ le, indicating she 
watched a cool new movie (movie title deleted in this 
example). The ad is then  presented to the Facebook friends 
that she selected to view it and thus, share her excitement 
Judy will watch this 
new movie, will you?

about this new movie (or product). A social ad also can 
include interactive features such as polling, votes, sharing, 
and other types of user engagement.
 In general, when companies incorporate social networks 
into ads, Facebook advertising is quite effective. One study 
of more than 800,000 Facebook users and ads of 14 different 
brands showed a big increase in ad recall, awareness, and 
purchase intent—this occurred when the home-page ads 
mentioned the friends of users who were already fans of the 
advertised brand (Neff  2010 ). In 2012, Facebook began to 
generate billions of dollars from advertising. For example, 
users’ “Likes” can appear in ads targeted to friends. For 45 
‘tips and tricks’ for mastering Facebook marketing, see 
Marrs ( 2014 ). 
 Video Advertising 
 Video advertising refers to the insertion of video ads into 
regular online content. The Internet Advertising Bureau 
(IAB) believes in the importance of video ads, and created a 
guide on the topic; see  slideshare.net/hardnoyz/iab-guide- 
to-video-advertising-online and the accompanying docu-
ment transcript. Video ads are common in Internet TV 
programs and YouTube videos. 
 Video ads are growing rapidly, mainly due to the popular-
ity of YouTube and similar sites. A 2013 IAB report shows a 
growth of digital video ads revenue from 731 million in 2012 
to 807 million in 2013 in the United States (Interactive 
Advertising Bureau  2014b ). Online video is growing nearly 
40 % annually while TV viewing continues to fall. For 
monthly statistics, see  marketingcharts.com . 
 Video ads appear all over the Web, both as unsolicited pop-
ups, or when you give permission to see a demo or  information 
about a product. Video ads have become very popular in the 
Web 2.0 environment and in social networking. 
 The major reason for the popularity of videos is that 
almost everyone who uses the Internet now watches online 
videos. Videos are also viewed on all mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphones, tablets) and they can be posted on social net-
works (e.g. Twitter). Social media and the accessibility to 
increased broadband mobile access are also reasons for the 
growth of online video usage. Another reason is the power of 
visualization and the popularity of social networking (e.g., 
see Walter and Gioglio  2014 ). 
 Behaviorally Targeted Ads (Also Called 
Contextual Ads and Remarketing) 
 Advertising networks track user click behavior, usually 
through cookie ﬁ les placed on the user hard drive and then 
present ads to the user based on their previous behavior. 
For example, when you search for a particular CD on 
Amazon, an ad for that CD might appear on Amazon.com or 
another site on a subsequent visit. This is accomplished via 
ad networks that maintain a large number of website clients 
and use the cookie data to present ads to appropriately tar-
geted users on one of their sites. The largest ad networks are 
search engines—e.g., the Google AdWords has a network 
that reaches 67 % of Internet users (Google’s overall market 
share). For example, the BMC Music Source, a music store 
in Connecticut, used AdWords, and by selecting appropriate 
search key words, increased sales signiﬁ cantly (see  google.
com/adwords/success-stories.html for more success sto-
ries). Google’s AdSense program also uses behavioral target-
ing to display appropriate ads on someone else’s website or 
mobile application. The website owner gets paid when the 
targeted ads appear on its site. Finally, Google+ enters this 
scene when users search for a retailer or restaurant and get an 
AdWord that also displays a friend’s face or comments from 
Google+. This happens because the Google+ friend previ-
ously endorsed the ad. 
 Sponsored Content 
 Sponsorships integrate editorial content and advertising 
based on either underwritten (someone else's content) or 
advertiser-created content. These can include content fea-
tures or functions in social media stand-alone micros or other 
websites or interactive functions, associating the sponsor’s 
brand with the content. The IAB has observed the following 
types of sponsorships: content creation, mobile/Web applica-
tions, branded interaction, contests/sweepstakes, games, 
podcasts, polls/surveys, and trivia. 
 For example, a food company might pay for space on a 
cooking blog or wiki to insert recipes using its products as 
ingredients. This looks like content from the site, but is 
actually paid space. Companies also can pay bloggers 
directly to endorse products by writing positive reviews. A 
problem with sponsored content, however, is that bloggers 
are not required to disclose that they are being paid (or 
receiving gifts) for their endorsements. However, if they do 
not tell and are found out, they can be exposed with a huge 
and negative amount of discussion online. In an example 
taken from the early days of blogging, a couple named 
Laura and Jim created a blog about their journey across the 
U.S. in an RV (“Walmarting Across America”). They stayed 
overnight in Walmart parking lots and wrote about their 
experiences on the road. Other bloggers believed that the 
blog was misleading, noting that that the Laura and Jim 
never said a bad word about Walmart, and on further dig-
ging, discovered that their trip was actually sponsored by 
PR ﬁ rm Edelman on behalf of their client, Walmart. This 
fake blog (“ﬂ og”) created a huge negative backlash for the

authors, Edelman, and Walmart, who did not follow their 
own rules for transparency (see  businessweek.com/sto-
ries/2006-10-17/wal-mart-vs-dot-the-blogosphere
businessweek-business-news- stock-market-and-
ﬁ nancial-advice ). 
 A sponsored content intermediary, PayPerPost ( payper-
post.com ) runs a marketplace where advertisers can ﬁ nd 
bloggers, video bloggers, online photographers, and pod-
casters who are willing to endorse advertisers’ products. A 
company with a product or a service to advertise registers 
with PayPerPost and describes the type of endorsement it 
wants and how much it is willing to pay. A sneaker company, 
for example, might post a request for people willing to write 
a 50-word blog entry about their shoes or upload a video of 
themselves playing basketball wearing the sneakers. The 
company also describes what it is willing to pay the bloggers 
for such posting. Bloggers create the blog post (or whatever 
content is requested) and inform PayPerPost, which checks 
to see that the content matches what the advertiser asked for, 
and PayPerPost arranges payment. Note that the PayPerPost 
Marketplace  requires full disclosure by all participants (per 
 payperpost.com/terms_and_conditions ). 
 Product Placement 
 Advertisers can deeply embed products or ads in TV shows 
or ﬁ lms. Game publishers are now using the same tactic—
product placement in online multiplayer games or videos. 
This is similar to movie product placement ofﬂ ine. For 
example, the online music video game Guitar Hero often has 
advertisements on the stage behind the musicians. Game 
players enjoy this kind of advertising because it makes the 
games seem more realistic, given that there are ads in live 
ofﬂ ine concerts too. 
 Text Link Ads 
 Link ads are ads that are simply a hyperlink placed in spe-
ciﬁ c text in a blog post or other social media content—
including content downloaded by mobile phone users. In a 
hypothetical example, a ﬂ ower shop might buy a speciﬁ ed 
number of links for the word “rose” on many blog sites, and 
these would have a hyperlink to the ﬂ ower shop’s website. 
The goal of these ads is to raise a site’s rankings in search 
engines. For example, a furniture store bought three key 
words in a large number of related websites and in over a 1 
year period, the store moved from a rank of 97 to 4 in a 
Google Search Engine results page for those three key words 
(see  textlinkbrokers.com/client-rankings.html for other 
client success stories). 
 More Social Media Advertising Examples 
 Paid messages can be placed in another company’s online 
content, using any of the social media platforms listed previ-
ously, either on the Web or delivered to mobile phones. 
Social networks provide huge advertising opportunities 
because of their rapid user growth. According to one source, 
social media advertising totaled $6.2 billion in 2013 and is 
still growing rapidly (13.9 % of all online advertising; PR 
Newswire 2014). The following are some good examples of 
social network ad campaigns. 
 Facebook Advertising 
 By advertising on Facebook, advertisers can reach over 1.28 
billion members (with 829 million active daily users), with 
over 63 % of users logging in on any given day, according to 
Latka ( 2014 ). However, most advertisers prefer narrower 
targeting to reach their well-deﬁ ned markets, and this can 
easily be done via member proﬁ le information (as seen in 
Fig.  4.2 , p. 79). When placing the ad, the marketer selects the 
desired target proﬁ le. For this ad in, Fig.  4.2 , the criteria 
were Facebook users with the following information in their 
proﬁ les:
•  Live in the United States, 
•  Live within 50 miles of Reno, NV, 
•  Are age 18 and older, and 
•  Like meditation, tai chi, Reiki, power now, sound healing, 
metaphysics, meditating, Buddhism, Deepak Chopra, 
spirituality or yoga (as mentioned in their proﬁ les). 
 This narrow targeting resulted in 4,980 Facebook users, 
who were presented the ad on their walls and would likely be 
interested and able to attend the Reno gong concert. The cost 
for the ad was based on the number of people clicking on it, 
at a rate of 88¢ per click. 
 Facebook advertising is important for global advertisers 
because Facebook is available in more than 70 different lan-
guages on the site, and over 81 % of active users live outside 
of the United States and Canada. Facebook ads can include 
interactive features, links to other brand content, and are 
very easy to create. Advertisers simply upload an image and 
type the text right into the Facebook template. Facebook 
offers excellent metrics to see how many people were pre-
sented the ad, and whether or not they took an action, like 
clicking on a link. Furthermore, advertisers can choose to 
pay either by using the CPM (cost per thousand views) or 
CPC (cost-per- click on the ad) pricing models by setting a 
maximum daily budget. 
 Here are some additional interesting ways to advertise on 
Facebook:

 For going global using Facebook, see Adobe ( 2012 ). 
 Twitter’s “Promoted Tweets,” “Trends,” 
and “Accounts” 
 Barking at Facebook’s heels, Twitter is a strong competitor 
for advertisers’ dollars. According to Learmonth ( 2011 ), 
Twitter launched its ﬁ rst ad product— promoted tweets —in 
2010 and netted $45 million in ad dollars. That was due in 
part to the enthusiasm among brands like Virgin America, 
Coke, Ford, and Verizon to give the untried format a whirl. 
 eMarketer estimates the promoted tweet ad revenue to be 
$540 million in 2014, with 90 % coming from U.S. compa-
nies (reported by  Indvik 2012 ). Promoted tweets are ads pur-
chased by advertisers that appear as content at the top of a 
Twitter search page or within a user’s timeline. They can be 
targeted to Twitter users by geographic location and by 
whose Twitter streams users follow. Users can interact with 
promoted Tweets just as they can with organic Tweets. 
 Promoted trends are ads placed on hot topics in Twitter that 
are presented near a user’s timeline.  Promoted accounts 
invites targeted Twitter users to visit brand accounts that may 
be of interest to them. These ads help companies attract more 
users. (See  business.twitter.com/ad-products for more 
about Twitter ads.)  
 LinkedIn Advertising 
 The LinkedIn social network is great for advertising to nar-
rowly targeted business professionals. Advertisers can use 
the LinkedIn Ads product to target by (1) job title and 
 function, (2) industry or company size, (3) company  seniority 
or age, or (4) LinkedIn Group membership. Advertisers have 
the choice of paying for the number of impressions or clicks 
(see more in the pricing model discussion below). According 
to Matt Johnson of uTest, “50 % of our paid inbound leads 
come from LinkedIn. LinkedIn is our most cost-effective 
online marketing channel” (see  linkedin.com/ads for more 
information). 
 Advertising in Seconds Life 
 Interestingly, it is possible to advertise in virtual worlds. For 
instance, in Seconds Life, companies can pay virtual clubs, 
stores, or malls to put up posters or kiosks featuring brand 
information and links, and can even provide “teleports” to 
the company’s virtual property. 
 Mobile Advertising 
 Mobile advertising is a rapidly developing area, with a global 
expenditure increase of 105 % in 2013, and is predicted to 
increase another 75 % in 2014 (Schmidt  2014 ). Mobile 
advertising refers to advertisements on smartphones and 
other wireless mobile devices, such as tablets (e.g., iPad). 
The competition for mobile ad revenue is intensifying, espe-
cially with the increased use of cell phones with Internet 
access. Recently, watching video clips has become popular 
on smartphones. Advertisers are starting to attach ads to 
these video clips. Finally, advertisers use microblogging, 
especially Twitter, to reach large audiences with short mes-
sages (SMS) ads via mobile devices. According to Patel 
( 2011 ), a Nielsen study of iPhone users compared Apple’s 
iAds involving Campbell Soup Company as an advertiser 
against similar TV ads. The study found that those exposed 
to one of Campbell’s iAd campaigns had higher brand recall 
than those who had seen similar TV ads: The 5-week study 
showed that consumers shown an iAd remembered the brand 
“Campbell’s” ﬁ ve times more often than TV ad respondents, 
and the ad messaging three times more often. For details 
about this study, see Patel ( 2011 ). 
 As seen in the table below, mobile ads were found to cre-
ate the greatest advertising opportunity versus Internet or 
traditional ads, as suggested in research from Meeker  (2014) . 
It is notable that advertisers spend more on media that are not 
consumed as often by their markets.

•  Boosted Posts. For a $5 fee, users can boost a 
Facebook post so more people will see it. A boosted 
post can reach friends of your friends or new audi-
ences. This is good for promoting special events, 
offers and company news. 
•  Facebook Offers. These involve posting special 
promotions or product discounts. Viewers on 
Facebook can click on the “get offer” button to 
claim the offer or share it with other friends. 
•  Facebook Exchange. This is a form of remarketing 
that allows advertisers to “reach people on Facebook 
who have expressed an interest through their online 
behavior (e.g., visiting your site) so you can reach 
them with a similar product or service” (per  face-
book.com/business/a/online-sales/facebook-
exchange ).

see  mashable.com/category/mobile-advertising . 
 Location-Based Ads 
 Delivering location-based ads to mobile devices is becom-
ing popular. Location-sensitive businesses can take advan-
tage of this feature to deliver location-based ads. A good 
example is a Google Map that can show nearby convenience 
stores, gas stations, hotels, and restaurants when a location 
is searched. Some of these are paid ads (see Chap.   5  for 
details).    
 Advertising Pricing Models 
 Social media price their advertising space using many dif-
ferent models. Cost per thousand impressions (CPM) and 
cost per click (CPC) are the two most commonly used 
models for all Internet advertising and are also used by 
social media properties. Cost per action (CPA) includes 
social actions, such as the number of chocolate gifts sent to 
friends (from an ad), number of posts to a proﬁ le, number 
of comments to a blog, number of users who play a game 
or watch a video trailer, or number of fans as a result of 
an advertisement. Cost per install (CPI) is the cost charged 
for a unique installation of a widget or other application 
included in a social media page. Finally, cost per engage-
ment (CPE) is the cost of each user-deﬁ ned engagement, 
such as submission of branded content generated by the 
user, contest entries, votes/polls, reviews or comments, 
ratings, engagement or replies to interactive ads, to, clicks 
or favorites, a Promoted Tweet or other social actions 
(clicking on “Like” button or a “thumb up/down” icon).

guidelines/508676/801817/sm_buyers_guide for deﬁ ni-
tions and more examples. 
 In one interesting example, JC Penney hired Gigya to cre-
ate a widget that allowed its teen market to add hats, mus-
taches, and other fun things to photos of their friends using a 
social network application. Called “Stuck on You,” the cam-
paign paid the social media property using a CPI model, with 
a goal of 2.9 million starts by users in 2008–2009. The result 
was over 43 clicks for every widget install (engagement), 
and an average of 22 friends was reached in addition to the 
original install (Interactive Advertising Bureau  2010 ). In 
Chap.   5 you will learn all about these performance metrics 
and other measures of success for social media marketing 
communication campaigns. 
 Finally, there is one burning issue asked by all marketers: 
How does one integrate these new media into traditional 
marketing communication plans?  
4.6 
 COORDINATING SOCIAL, INTERNET, 
AND TRADITIONAL MEDIA 
PROMOTION PLANS 
 The primary goal of marketers has always been to become 
monomaniacally customer driven and build long term rela-
tionships that bring revenue to the company. This all starts 
with customers and discovering their needs and wants—dis-
cussion and listening via social media is a great way to do 
that. Many online media do not allow for social interactions, 
such as some traditional websites and e-mail campaigns. 
Traditional marketing communication media only allow 
one- way communication, yet these are still important for 
building brand awareness (e.g., an ad in the SuperBowl that 
reaches 60 % of the U.S. population), creating desire and 
interest, and moving prospects and customers to purchase 
(e.g., a coupon or calendar event listing in the Sunday print 
newspaper). Yet, marketing is moving more to the concept of 
 inbound marketing : a strategy that has as its objective to 
bring customers to a company’s website, instead of “inter-
rupt” marketing (distracting them with one-way communica-
tion, such as advertising, while they are engaged in viewing 
content—such as watching a television program or reading a 
story on a website). Inbound marketing entices customers 
with relevant content and earns their attention. Although it 
may still be sponsored content, paid for by an advertiser, it is 
in a more relevant context that attracts viewers. 
 According to a Marketing Sherpa survey of 3,300 mar-
keters, roughly 25 % extensively integrated social media 
with both ofﬂ ine and online tactics (see  marketingsherpa.
com/article/chart/social-media-integration ). 
Research 
from a 2011 survey by the Pivot Conference and Brian Solis 
found that 70 % of marketers who use social media 
 campaigns noted that they mostly integrate social advertis-
ing at the campaign planning stage to drive engagement 
( eMarketer  2011 ). 
 These marketers face a mashup of new and traditional 
media that can carry the promotional tools of advertising, 
sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations and per-
sonal selling. The guiding force for selecting appropriate 
tools and media is the communication objectives in desired 
target markets. For example, if a company’s goal is to sell its 
new software package to accountants, it could do any of the 
following: (1) use PR by describing the software on its own 
website and with a social media press release, (2) use Twitter 
to talk about software needs in the industry and offer codes 
for free sample downloads (sales promotion), (3) include 
recommendations from current customers on a LinkedIn 
page, (4) upload a video demonstration with software tutori-
als, or (5) advertise in a traditional print accounting industry

magazine and on the industry’s website (including testimoni-
als from the LinkedIn pages). All this could direct prospects 
to a website where they can download a free sample and pur-
chase the product after a 30 day trial. This would be much 
more effective than giving away free iPads on Facebook, 
because that tactic does not align with the campaign goals or 
target market. 
 Below is another example of how to drive trafﬁ c to both 
digital sites and physical retailer stores, as described in the 
Starbucks’ opening case of Chap.   1 . 3dCart ( 3dcart.com ) 
lists the following:
•   Use a Facebook Page for your company and add a 
Facebook Store. Customers will become “fans” of your 
business to check on updates and meet others with similar 
interests. 
•  Tweet about the business and any promotions/new prod-
ucts, etc. 
•  Blog to your customers to keep them updated about new 
products, etc. 
•  Integrate videos (e.g. YouTube) on your website. 
•  Add social bookmarking to your product’s page for easy 
return. 
•  Embrace mobile apps. 
•   Add a Facebook “Like” button with its sponsored story to 
your product (e.g., Gatorade brand scored 1.2 million 
conversations in 6 months using their ‘Mission Control’ 
campaign).

details,

commerce-tools-to-increase-trafﬁ c . 
 There are many other tactical ways to integrate marketing 
communications media, and they primarily involve provid-
ing links to all the Web and social media sites in all promo-
tional media and integrating positive conversation into 
various appropriate media. 
 The main thing to remember is that the traditional and 
some Internet media carry corporate monologues, while 
social media contain dialogs with target markets. Both play a 
role, but the dialog is becoming much more important and is 
more true to the well-accepted company goal of customer- 
driven marketing. This is the subject of Chap.   5 . 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  List and deﬁ ne the six social media promotion steps. 
The ﬁ rst step in effective and efﬁ cient social media mar-
keting communication is to identify and gain a good 
understanding of the organization’s target market(s) and 
its social media use and behavior. Seconds, companies 
develop marketing communication goals for their social 
media campaigns, and third, they select the social media 
platforms, such as Facebook or YouTube videos, and 
tools (such as advertising or sales promotion). The fourth 
step is to execute and monitor the campaign, and ﬁ fth is 
to deﬁ ne/review performance metrics (such as number of 
clicks on an ad). Finally, the marketer reﬁ nes the other 
ﬁ ve steps based on how well the campaign is working. 
 2.  Identify the key social media communication objec-
tives. The key communication objectives include build-
ing awareness, interest, desire and action (AIDA). Other 
important objectives are building brand loyalty and 
 purchase frequency/quantity over the customers’ lifetime 
and engaging customers and prospects in social media 
content. 
 3.  Explain how to select social media tools and platforms 
to achieve campaign objectives. Selection among the 
communication tools of advertising, sales promotion, 
public relations, direct marketing, and personal selling 
depends on the communication objective in the target 
market. The most important criterion for platform selec-
tion is to ﬁ nd which social media are used most by the 
company’s target markets. Companies achieve this by 
getting user statistics from the social media company, sur-
veying customers, or experimenting to see if a site’s users 
want to engage in the company’s content. 
 4.  Compare and contrast the essentials of owned and 
paid media. Owned media includes content that is par-
tially controlled by the company, such as a Facebook 
page. It serves to build longer-term relationships with 
customers. Paid media is space the company buys in 
someone else’s medium, such as an ad on a YouTube 
video. It acts as catalyst that feeds owned and earned 
media. Companies must create the content for both types 
of media; however, they pay additional money for paid 
media when buying the space.  
 5.  Give examples of several owned social media channels 
and tactics. Exemplary channels include online public 
and private communities (e.g., a company’s Facebook 
page), blogs (e.g., a company executive writes a blog) 
and microblogs (e.g. Twitter), multimedia sharing sites 
(e.g., a company creates a video about its products and 
uploads it to YouTube), virtual worlds (e.g., the company 
creates a virtual webstore in Seconds Life), company-
hosted virtual events (e.g., an online Webinar), and mash-
ups (e.g., businesses list their name and location on 
Google Places). Other important owned media are online 
games, online gifting, branded apps and social media 
press releases. 
 6.  Explain the advertising formats for social media. 
Display ads use text and graphics, as well as the compa-
ny’s logos and contact information/Web links. Classiﬁ ed 
ads can be found on dedicated sites, such as Craigslist. 
Social ads incorporate user interactions that the consumer 
has agreed to display share, such as a proﬁ le picture and

name. Behaviorally targeted ads present ads to the user 
based on their previous behavior. Sponsored content inte-
grates editorial content and advertising based on either 
underwritten (someone else’s content) or advertiser- 
created content. Product placement embeds products or 
ads in online multiplayer games or videos (as well as tra-
ditional media). Text link ads include a hyperlink placed 
in speciﬁ c text in social media content.

 OPENING CASE: HÄAGEN-DAZS 
VIRAL VIDEO CREATES A BUZZ 
 Häagen-Dazs (a Nestlé-owned company), whose brand dates 
back to the early 1920s, was established in 1961 and opened 
its ﬁ rst store in 1976 in New York with chocolate, vanilla, 
and coffee ﬂ avors. It was later purchased by Pillsbury, which 
was subsequently bought by General Mills. In the U.S., the 
ice cream products are produced by the Nestlé subsidiary, 
Dreyer’s, although General Mills still owns the brand name. 
Häagen-Dazs is served in over 900 franchises and company 
owned shops in 50 countries. Häagen-Dazs maintains a web-
site, a Facebook page with over 1.2 million likes ( facebook.
com/HaagenDazsUS ) and several other Facebook pages for 
various countries (e.g., Malaysia, Singapore), as well as an 
interactive microsite and videos dedicated to the honey bee 
crisis. From the beginning, Häagen-Dazs ice cream sought to 
innovate and bring new frozen dessert experiences to its cus-
tomers, including distinctive ﬂ avors such as vanilla Swiss 
almond, butter pecan, and Dulce de leche, to name just a few. 
Häagen-Dazs was also the ﬁ rst to introduce the world to ice 
cream bars for a grown-up palate, with the introduction of 

100
the Häagen-Dazs brand ice cream bar line in 1986. Other 
super-premium innovations followed, such as frozen yogurt 
in 1991 and sorbet in 1993.  
 The Problem 
 In 2006, Häagen-Dazs (H-D) discovered that the world’s 
honey bee populations were quickly disappearing due to a 
phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD): when 
honey bees mysteriously desert their hives and die. This was 
a problem for the brand because bees pollinate the ﬂ owers of 
one-third of all the food we eat—including pears, strawber-
ries and raspberries—all important ingredients in the com-
pany’s ice creams, sorbets, frozen yogurts, and bars. 
Häagen-Dazs estimated that 30 of the 73 ﬂ avors contain 
ingredients pollinated by honeybees.  
 The Solution 
 Haagen-Dazs saw this as an important opportunity to initiate 
its ﬁ rst “cause marketing” campaign for the brand. For start-
ers, they partnered with leading research facilities to donate 
over $1 million to honey bee research. Their funds are used to 
help support the largest agricultural facility in the U.S., 
located at U.C. Davis in California. The H-D Honey Bee 
Haven was planted in 2009 next to the Honey Bee Research 
Facility at Davis ( beebiology.ucdavis.edu ). H-D then used 
traditional and social media to raise awareness and motivate 
support for the disappearing honey bee cause. The company 
created educational websites (e.g.,  beebiology.ucdavis.edu/
HAVEN/index.html ) with links to bee news, information 
and “how you can help.” There were television ads, docu-
mentaries, and a video produced for the Internet, entitled 
“Bee-Boy Dance Crew” (for the story behind the video and to 
watch the video, see Yoerg  2008 ). The video targeted a young 
18–24 year old market (“youth thirsty for honey”) with a hip-
hop interpretation of how a honey bee “dances” when alert-
ing hive mates to a newly found source of nectar. The video 
garnered two million views (on YouTube) within 2 weeks, 
while “visits to “Haagen-Dazs’ ‘Save the Bees Site’ spiked, 
reﬂ ecting heightened interest in the bee issue” (Yoerg  2008 ). 
The strategy: this market was more likely to send the video 
link to friends, thus raising awareness for the cause. The com-
pany also created a designated cause Web microsite, which 
allowed users to watch the video, explore the panoramic 
ﬁ elds by clicking the mouse, and create and send a virtual bee 
to friends. The site also engaged users by accepting donations 
online, asking for support for reinstatement of the Boy Scout 
Beekeeping Merit Badge, and providing downloadable 
instructions on how to plant a bee-friendly garden. 
 H-D hired an online marketing ﬁ rm, Feed Company, to 
promote the Bee-Boy video. It sent creative messages to nar-
rowly targeted online media, including inﬂ uential bloggers 
(such as  Hufﬁ ngton Post writers). The message varied 
depending on the media outlet. For example, “green” blogs 
received information on the environmental impact of the dis-
appearing bee population, and entertainment outlets received 
references to the pop culture value of the Bee-Boy video. As 
the buzz increased, Feed Company gained coverage in more 
mainstream online media sites and ofﬂ ine broadcast and 
print media. 
 Other Social Media Activities 
 Häagen-Dazs operates in a very competitive environment 
(e.g., Ben & Jerry’s) and therefore the company’s strategy 
aims at increasing brand awareness and loyalty. The com-
pany is extremely active in using social media tools and plat-
forms. Here are a few examples:
•  Engagement and word-of-mouth (WOM). Kolah ( 2013 ) 
reports on activities on the company’s Facebook page in 
the UK and creating WOM buzz around the brand and 
with brand advocates on Twitter. The objective is to 
increase customers’ loyalty. The company wanted to 
increase consumer engagement on its Facebook page and 
build awareness and bookings for a campaign they were 
running targeted at women for a “girls’ night.” 
•  The company is active in amplifying social presence via 
mobile campaigns on Facebook (see Kats  2012 ). 
•  For a social media campaign case study on how the com-
pany increases customer engagement, see  slideshare.net/
QubeMedia/qube-casestudy-hdboudoir . 
 Results 
 Within 2 weeks of the campaign’s July 15, 2008 start, the 
following results began to emerge:
•  The ‘Bee-Boy Dance Crew’ video received over two mil-
lion views, primarily on YouTube, but also on Yahoo, 
Vimeo, and Daily Motion. CNN wrote about the story, 
which resulted in 1.3 million video views; it was covered 
in over 150 blogs (Yoerg  2008 ). 
•  Many high visibility blogs covered the cause. For exam-
ple, the 6.9 million readers of the  Hufﬁ ngton Post and 1.6 
million TreeHugger viewers were exposed to the story. 
•  There was a high level of user engagement with this cam-
paign: over 3,500 YouTube comments, 5,850 ratings of 
the video (averaging 4.5 stars and considerable positive 
feedback), and 11,024 discussions by users in forums, 
blogs, and other social networking sites.

•  Since 2008, Häagen-Dazs donated $620,000 to two 
 universities and $1 million to University of California at 
Davis for honey bee research (Yoerg  2008 ). 
 In total, the campaign generated over two million video 
views, thousands of conversations, and many impressions. 
By August 2009, the University of Illinois scientists had dis-
covered the cause of CCD, and the HD honey bee site con-
tinued to report on the disappearing bee population and 
search for a solution (see the H-D site).

 EARNED MEDIA 
 Well-executed owned and paid social media can drive pros-
pects and customers through the steps from awareness to 
product purchase, repurchase, and into long-term customer 
loyalty. However, earned media have a multiplier effect (e.g., 
1 + 1 = 5), intensifying and spreading the communication 
messages far and wide in social media—as experienced by 
H-D in its “Save the Honey Bee” campaign. “Whatever your 
methods, ﬁ nd a way to incorporate a social element into 
every marketing campaign you run by ﬁ nding compelling 
reasons for people to share. That’ll make every dollar you 
spend on marketing look like two” (Dhalokia  2011 ; Marketo 
 2011 ). Recall from Chap.   4 that earned media occurs when 
“customer conversations become the channel” on blogs, 
product review sites, Facebook, news sites, many other 
places, and in comments on owned media pages everywhere 
they are allowed (see Fig.  5.1 ).
 Earned media is often initiated by the company through 
branded (owned) content distribution, such as entertaining 
YouTube videos about the product, social media press 
releases (public relations), or other activities intended to 
engage users, such as placing social hooks on company 
brand sites and microsites (e.g., Facebook register, subscribe 
or “like,” Digg, Pinterest, Delicious, RSS, and other but-
tons). Companies also put “follow us” links to these social 
sites on their Web pages and in e-mail messages sent to cus-
tomer or prospect databases. Earned media can have a direct 
cost associated with it, such as when the company sponsors 
a contest or creates content that spreads, but there is no ﬁ nan-
cial cost when it is simply user conversation. By deﬁ nition, 
others create earned media, and companies have little to no 
control over this user-generated content (UGC). This com-
munication can get ugly very quickly—and often does when 
people criticize brands online. Professional and citizen jour-
nalists share their own opinions and experiences all over the 
social media via computers and mobile phones, even at times 
when companies are not monitoring these posts. 
 Before discussing how owned and paid media generate 
earned media, it is important to learn the possible levels of 
social media engagement. 
5.2 
 SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT 
LEVELS 
 Social media engagement occurs among customers and 
between the company and Internet users who are actively 
discussing the brand (Chap.   3 ). This is compared to tradi-
tional media, which only allows passive exposure, such as 
when a consumer is watching television. Occasionally, how-
ever, traditional media will prompt engagement when (1) the 
consumer writes an e-mail or letter to the editor, (2) tele-
phones a broadcast station, or (3) posts a reaction on their 
own or the company’s Facebook or Twitter page. Traditional 
media can also prompt communication to companies about 
their brands when designed for this purpose, such as award-
ing a prize to the ﬁ rst 100 people that send a text message to 
a company. However, it is not as easy for consumers to 
engage when they receive the information via traditional 
media and must access their computer, tablet, or mobile 
device to respond. 
 There are many levels of online user engagement. It is 
important for a company to understand its social commerce 
objectives and what proportion of its customers and pros-
pects operate at each level, so that it can use social media for 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS CASE 
 Dreyer’s and its Häagen-Dazs brand connected with a 
cause that threatened the brand. The passion for the 
disappearing honey bee cause subsequently attached to 
the brand as well. The company astutely identiﬁ ed its 
target market (18–24 year olds) and through its agency, 
created social media to attract and engage the market. 
H-D placed the information and video on social media 
sites which the target would see, and that drove brand 
engagement and viral activity. This is an example of 
owned media that resulted in widespread positive 
earned media: the goal of every company. You will 
learn more about these techniques in this chapter. 
 This chapter discusses many important types of 
earned media: how a company can encourage positive 
user-generated content (UGC) and protect its reputa-
tion in an uncontrollable social media conversation, 
and concludes with the ways to monitor and measure 
all three types of media (owned, paid, and earned) for 
social commerce effectiveness. 
5.2 Social Media Engagement Levels

102
positive discussion online and collaboration with customers. 
Forrester’s Social Technographics™ framework includes 
seven levels of participation, and this company has data 
about the entire Internet population that companies can use 
for comparison with their consumer activity levels: “inac-
tives, spectators, joiners, collectors, critics, conversational-
ists and creators” (Band et al.  2010 ;  blogs.forrester.com/
gina_sverdlov/12-01-04- global_social_technographics_
update_2011_us_and_eu_mature_emerging_markets_
show_lots_of_activity  ). Evans and McKee ( 2010 ) also 
suggest a four-level engagement ladder that moves engage-
ment beyond simple owned and paid media consumption. 
Figure  5.2 displays an iteration of these ideas, displaying the 
levels of engagement from least to most.
 1.  The least engaged Internet users  consume online content 
only. They only read blogs, watch videos, look at photos, 
listen to podcasts, and read the reviews and opinions 
expressed by others occupying higher levels of engage-
ment on websites and forums.  
 2.  At the next level, users  connect with others by creating a 
proﬁ le on a social network, such as “friending” on 
Facebook or joining TripAdvisor or other sites that 
require registration to access the social media content. 
These consumers do not post anything, however. 
Connecting is a low-risk level of engagement that allows 
people to participate in small steps. Another way to con-
nect is through a social gathering, happening either on or 
ofﬂ ine. This is often facilitated by a site that allows 
groups to coordinate these meetings. For example, in 
2010, St. Supéry winery ( stsupery.com ) used  meetup.
com to create an online global celebration of a wine—
they called it #Cabernet Day (“on social media sites” (the 
“#” is a Twitter hash tag). In a 24-hour time period, over 
1,000 people online and 75 in real life met to celebrate 
and purchase and drink the wine. Many messages were 
also posted on social network sites and YouTube, and 
there were even check-ins at Foursquare (Bakas  2010 ). 
  3.  Consumers who  collect  information go through a process 
of ﬁ ltering content and tagging what they ﬁ nd valuable in 
social media sites. This could include Delicious for book-
mark sharing and Flickr or Facebook for photo tagging or

“liking” someone else’s content. Collectors might also 
subscribe to RSS feeds on blog sites so that they can 
actively read content of interest. Finally, collectors show 
their preferences by voting in polls online. For example, 
collector shoppers at Sears.com have the option of sharing 
prom dresses they like with their Facebook friends using a 
feature called “Prom Premier 2011.” Sears supplemented 
the option with an ad campaign placed on Facebook.  
 4.  Moving up the engagement ladder,  creators actually write 
or upload original multimedia content to websites, such 
as videos to YouTube, pin boards on Pinterest, or music 
and podcasts to iTunes. This involves creating content, 
which is a higher level than simply voting on someone 
else’s content. These consumers write product reviews/
ratings, create their own blogs/Web pages and comment 
on other people’s blogs, contribute to wiki sites (e.g., 
eHow, Wikipedia), and generally add much more to the 
social media content. 
 5.  Finally, the most engaged customers  collaborate with the 
company when they work with others in discussion to 
ﬁ nd ways to improve products. CNN offers iReporter, 
where users send in videos of breaking news, which can 
result in CNN sending a company reporter to the event for 
a story. Another example is Dell’s IdeaStorm site ( ideast-
orm.com ), where users post questions and product prob-
lems and others view and vote the posts as important 
concerns or not. Dell then responds on the status of each 
idea (“under review” or “implemented”). As we are writ-
ing this, one of the top ideas that Dell implemented was 
use biodegradable packaging material for shipping 
(posted by a collaborator and voted on by 202 “collec-
tors”). Finally, Twitter’s hash tag (#), marking keywords 
and topics in Tweets, was actually created by Twitter 
users. This type of collaboration helps companies and 
bloggers improve products.  
 According to the Pew Internet Project, as of January 
2014, 74 % of online adults and 89 % of 18–24 year olds 
used social media ( pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-
networking- fact-sheet ). According to its Q2 2014 ﬁ nancial 
report, as of June 30, 2014, Facebook had 1.32 billion 
monthly active users worldwide. For an infographic listing 
Facebook statistics from 2004 to 2014 (“10 years of 
Facebook”), see  cnn.com/2014/02/03/tech/social-media/
facebook-graphic . In the next sections, you will see how 
companies engage customers to create earned media product 
discussion and multimedia content uploading.  
5.3 
 ENGAGING CONSUMERS 
TO PRODUCE EARNED MEDIA 
 When a couple becomes engaged to be married, they are 
expressing their trust, commitment, and caring for each 
other—this is also true when a brand seeks this kind of love 
from its markets and wants them to talk about the products. 
Wikipedia deﬁ nes  customer engagement (CE) as “the 
engagement of customers with one another, with a company 
or a brand. The initiative for engagement can be either con-
sumer- or company-led, and the medium of engagement can 
be on or ofﬂ ine” (see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_
engagement ). The essentials of customer engagement are 
covered in Chap.   3 . For a free e-book on more effective 
social media engagement, see Brusselmans ( 2014 ). 
 Trust is a key component of word-of-mouth communica-
tion resulting from customer engagement. Edelman, the 
world’s largest public relations ﬁ rm, found that 65 % of 
respondents across 25 countries trust a “person like your-
self” for credible information about a company (Fig.  5.3 ). 
This is in contrast to the only 43 % who trust the company 
CEO (do a Google search for “Edelman trust barometer

2014,” and see the results in a slideshare presentation at 
 edelman.com/insights/intellectual-property/2014-
edelman-trust- barometer/about-trust/global-results for 
more information). “A person like yourself” is someone who 
shares similar interests or friends in a social network. For 
example, when planning trips or on the road, many travelers 
will visit the largest travel site, TripAdvisor, to check out the 
over 170 million reviews and opinions of hotels and sites in 
43 countries, which are written by travelers across the world. 
Thus, when people post opinions about products, over half of 
the readers are likely to believe what they say, which will 
inﬂ uence their purchase decisions. In general, the data show 
that people trust earned media more than owned or paid 
media. This indicates the huge advantage to earned media.
 We now turn to a discussion of the “who, what, how, and 
where” to engage customers in conversation about a com-
pany and its brands. 
 Who Should a Company Engage? 
 It is not effective, efﬁ cient, or likely possible to get the entire 
Internet universe talking about an organization and its prod-
ucts. As discussed in Chap.   4 , the company will identify its 
target markets and objectives before developing an engage-
ment campaign. For example, Hagen-Dazs selected the 
18–24 year old market, as you read in the opening case exam-
ple. Another tactic used by H-D and many other companies is 
to target inﬂ uential bloggers and members of social networks, 
such as Arianna Hufﬁ ngton’s  The Hufﬁ ngton Post , with its 
50,000 bloggers and over 78 million global unique visitors 
(Business Wire  2013 ). For ways that how bloggers can catch 
and keep their readers’ attention, see Ahmad ( 2013 ). 
 Companies identify social media inﬂ uencers in two ways. 
First, they can observe and participate in conversations in 
social media platforms where people discuss their industries. 
This will help them see who is active and has the most 
Facebook fans or friends, Flickr comments, Tumblr or Twitter 
subscribers, or simply the most comments on user posts. For 
example, the eMarketing Association Network group in 
LinkedIn has over 586,000 members, and by clicking on the 
“members” tab, members can see the list of “This Week’s Top 
Inﬂ uencers.” These contributors, along with the group creator 
owner (Robert Fleming, who is the CEO/founder of the 
eMarketing Association), are members who start a discussion 
and comment on other group members’ discussions. Under 
the “Pulse” tab on the member’s Home page, you can see the 
“top posts” for the day, week, of all time, and the most recent 
posts. On the “pulse” page, you can also search and ﬁ nd the 
“top inﬂ uencers” and “most searched inﬂ uencers.” ( LinkedIn 
Today ,  Inﬂ uencer Posts , and  Channels - Move your cursor 
over  Interests at the top of your homepage and select  Pulse .) 
 For a B2B company selling products to eMarketers, this is 
an ideal source for building a buzz with inﬂ uential social 
media participants. 
 The seconds way to ﬁ nd inﬂ uentials is to use a service 
such as Klout, Inc. ( klout.com ). Klout measures over 400 
variables from 8 different networks for each of over 620 
million social network participants and ranks them based on 
(1) number of people they reach, (2) how much inﬂ uence 
participants have on their followers (e.g., number of “likes” 
or “retweets”), and (3) how inﬂ uential the person’s network 
members are. The result is a Klout Score from 1 to 100, with 
the top scored people having the most social media inﬂ u-
ence. According to Klout, “We measure multiple pieces of 
data from several social networks, and also real world data 
from places like Bing and Wikipedia. Then we apply them 
to our Klout Score algorithm, and then show the resulting 
number on your proﬁ le. The higher your Klout Score, the 
tougher it becomes to increase” (per  klout.com/corp/
score ). Klout also lists the topics these inﬂ uencers write 
about and their social media style (e.g., broadcaster or spe-
cialist). Klout also has a “perks” program that offers free 
products and discounts from over 500 companies to high-
Klout score users/the inﬂ uentials with brands they are likely 
to care and write about, such as Starbucks, Audi, Virgin 
America, and Dove. People with scores over 55 even get 
free access to the American Airlines Admirals Club lounges 
in selected cities worldwide. The beneﬁ t to companies is 
that they can pay to gain access to high Klout score indi-
viduals/inﬂ uentials (see  klout.com ). In 2011, Canadian 
pop/R&B singer, songwriter and actor Justin Bieber was the 
only person with a perfect 100 Klout score, while President 
Barak Obama had a score of 99. In 2012, Klout changed its 
scoring algorithm (to the current 400 metrics from the pre-
vious 100 metrics); as of August 2014, Bieber’s score has 
fallen to 92, while President Obama’s is 99 (both of their 
Klout scores ﬂ uctuated within the years). To raise your 
Klout score, see the example provided by Kamboe ( 2014 ). 
For further discussion, see Chap.   10  .   
5.4 
 ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES 
 Most social media provide space and tools for earned media 
content. You have read about many of them in this book, 
such as sites that allow multimedia content uploads 
(YouTube, 
Flickr, 
Vine), 
comments, 
bookmarking 
(Delicious), tagging (Flickr, Facebook), reviews, recom-
mendations and more (recall Fig.  5.1 ). Both websites and 
mobile apps offer tools for these connections and conversa-
tions. In the following sections, we focus on just a few 
important or new techniques not fully described in other 
chapters. 
5 Customer Engagement and Metrics

105
 Viral Marketing 
 Viral marketing is a bad name for a great technique.  Viral 
marketing (viral advertising) “is any marketing technique 
that induces websites or users to pass on a marketing mes-
sage to other sites or users, creating a potentially exponential 
growth in the message’s visibility and effect” (see  whatis.
techtarget.com ). This marketing technique uses social net-
works to produce exponential increases in brand recognition 
or to achieve other marketing objectives (such as product 
sales) through self-replicating viral processes. This is analo-
gous to the spread of physical or computer viruses (see 
 onbile.com/info/mobile-viral-marketing ). It is the oppo-
site of the marketing sales funnel, which starts with many 
prospects and then narrows as prospects drop off to fewer 
customers, as shown in Fig.  5.4 . The viral funnel does the 
reverse because it increases the number exposed to brand 
messages as content circulates.
 Viral marketing can be delivered by ofﬂ ine word of mouth 
or enhanced by the network effects of the Internet. Viral mar-
keting can occur when users forward e-mail, send text mes-
sages, or share images and videos on Facebook, interactive 
Flash games, advergames, e-books, brandable software, and 
images. The founder of Hotmail, a free e-mail service that 
grew from 0 to 12 million subscribers in its 18 initial months, 
and to more than 50 million subscribers in about 4 years, 
used viral marketing. Each e-mail sent via Hotmail carried 
an invitation for free Hotmail service. 
 According to a 2010 survey conducted in Chinese 
 markets, word of mouth has become an important factor in 
consumers’ purchasing decisions. In 2010, 64 % of respon-
dents said that word of mouth inﬂ uenced their purchasing 
decisions, increasing from 56 % in 2008 (Atsmon et al. 
 2010 ). Well-executed viral strategies work because individu-
als trust their acquaintances and family to help them with 
their choices (Atsmon et al.  2010 ). 
 As with all engagement strategies, the ultimate goal of mar-
keters interested in creating successful viral marketing pro-
grams is to create content (1) that appeals to individuals with 
high social networking visibility and (2) that has a high prob-
ability of being presented and spread quickly by these indi-
viduals and their friends in their communications with others. 
 Viral marketing has long been a favorite strategy of online 
marketers pushing youth-oriented products. For example, 
marketers might distribute a small game program or a video 
embedded within a sponsor’s e-mail that is easy to forward. 
By releasing a few thousand copies of the game to select con-
sumers, vendors hope that it is spread quickly to reach hun-
dreds of thousands of others. Also known as  advocacy 
marketing , viral marketing, if properly used, can be effective, 
efﬁ cient and relatively inexpensive—as experienced by H-D 
in the opening case. eWOM platforms can also inﬂ uence 
consumer product judgment (see Lee and Youn  2009 ). For 
further details, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing 
and 
 wisegeek.net/what-are-the-different-types-of-viral-
marketing-campaigns.htm . For a scientiﬁ c take on viral 
marketing with examples, see  helpscout.net/blog/viral-
marketing . For ﬁ ve great viral marketing campaigns and 
how they worked, see  creativeguerrillamarketing.com/
viral-marketing/5-great-viral-marketing-campaigns- 
worked  . 
 Every company wants to create content that goes viral, 
but few accomplish this feat. The content has to be entertain-
ing or mysterious, match popular culture and gain user atten-
tion. In a sea of online content and information overload, 
sometimes even the best content does not go viral. 
 The term “viral marketing” has also been used pejora-
tively to refer to stealth marketing campaigns or the unscru-
pulous use of online astroturﬁ ng—the attempt to create an 
impression of widespread support for a policy, individual, or 
product, where little such support exists by misleading the 
public into believing that the position of the astroturfer is the 
commonly held view. Tactics include multiple online identi-
ties or a reviewer or commentator being paid by a company 
to post an opinion or mention a brand or product on Twitter 
or blogs (see  theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/
feb/08/what-is-astroturﬁ ng ). Another downside of a viral 
strategy is that several e-mail hoaxes have been spread this 
way. Viral marketing has also been criticized by consumers 
due to a concern over unsolicited e-mails, which many see as 
an invasion of privacy. For more details about viral market-
ing, see McColl ( 2010 ).

5.4 Engagement Techniques

 Examples of Viral Campaigns 
 Viral marketing is often very successful with entertaining 
videos (especially from YouTube) that are spread via e-mail, 
Facebook sharing, and by microbloggers (e.g., Twitter). 
Following are some successful viral campaigns:
•  Burger King’s “The Subservient Chicken” campaign, 
running from 2004, was an extremely successful example 
of viral marketing from a microsite with an interactive 
video  subservientchicken.com of a man dressed in a 
chicken costume. The chicken video had received over 
450 million views as of 2011. It is particularly relevant 
and appropriate for the brand because users could type a 
command, such as “dance,” and the chicken will dance in 
the video—supporting Burger King’s “Have it your way” 
advertising slogan. Then the chicken video disappeared 
and in April 2014, Burger King posted on its Twitter page: 
“We Miss You Subservient Chicken. #TBT pic.twitter.
com/msrZqeX0PH.” The company also posted ads in the 
style of “missing persons” bulletins (“Have you seen this 
chicken”?) in many newspapers, such as  The New York 
Times , while online the hashtag #FindTheChicken 
appeared. Burger King issued a press release in April 
2014 (the tenth anniversary), that they would reintroduce 
the Subservient Chicken alongside the Chicken Big King 
Sandwich (Burger King  2014 ). On the  subservi-
entchicken.com site in 2014, Burger King showed an 
empty couch with the missing chicken with the line: 
“Help. There’s a chicken on the loose and we are desper-
ately trying to ﬁ nd him” (Morrison  2014 ). On the “resur-
rected" site, Burger King also posted a video of the 
adventures the chicken had for the last 10 years, asking 
viewers to share the video using the hashtag 
“#ChickenRedemption,” Burger King is also encouraging 
people to use the hashtag “#FindTheChicken” to promote 
the campaign, which is for the new Chicken Big King 
sandwich 
( time.com/79309/burger-king-subservient- 
chicken-missing ; includes the picture of the “Have you 
seen this chicken?” poster). This clever campaign will 
boost the viral nature of this site once again. Based on 
Chithra ( 2012 ), Burger King ( 2014 ), Morrison  2014 , 
 time.com/79309/burger-king-subservient-chicken-
missing/ ; and  subservientchicken.com (both accessed 
August 2014).  
•  In December 2009, podcasters of The Mike O’Meara 
Show launched a viral marketing campaign on Facebook 
to encourage others to download the show. 
•  Between December 2009 and March 2010, a series of 
seven videos were posted to YouTube under the name 
“iamamiwhoami” which led to speculation that they were 
a marketing campaign for a band by that name. In March 
2010, an anonymous package was sent to an MTV jour-
nalist claiming to contain a code, which if cracked, would 
give the identity of the artist. The seventh video, entitled 
‘y,’ appears to feature the Swedish singer Jonna Lee. 
•  On July 14, 2010, Old Spice launched the fastest growing 
online viral video campaign ever, garnering 6.7 million 
views after 24 h, ballooning to over 23 million views after 
36 h. Old Spice’s agency created a bathroom set in 
Portland, OR and had its TV commercial star, Isaiah 
Mustafa, reply to 186 online comments and questions 
posted on websites like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Digg, 
YouTube, and others. The campaign ran for 3 days. 
 Viral Blogging 
 Viral blogging is when bloggers conduct viral marketing 
activities by leveraging the power of the blog community to 
spread content. Viral blogging can be very effective with the 
use of tools such as trends on Twitter. Many retailers entice 
WOM marketing by bloggers. For example, Paramount 
wanted to build awareness and box ofﬁ ce sales for a sneak 
preview of the modestly budgeted “Super 8” science ﬁ ction 
ﬁ lm, which opened on June 10, 2011. Paramount sent a single 
Tweet and purchased advertising on Twitter via two Promoted 
Trends—one a day before the premier and one on the day of 
the premier. The “Twitter exclusive” sneak previews gener-
ated $1 million in box ofﬁ ce sales, and the opening weekend 
for the ﬁ lm surpassed Paramount’s goals by 52 % (see  busi-
ness.twitter.com/success-stories/paramount-pictures ). 
 Stormhoek Vineyards ( stormhoek.com ) initiated suc-
cessful viral marketing on social networks. The company 
ﬁ rst offered a free bottle of wine to bloggers. Within 6 
months, about 100 of these bloggers voluntarily posted com-
ments about the winery on their own blogs. Most had posi-
tive comments, which were read by their readers and other 
bloggers. The Stormhoek example raises an interesting ques-
tion: Can bloggers be bought? The criticism is that bloggers 
have not been required to disclose that they are being paid 
(or receive gifts) for their endorsements. Companies can pay 
bloggers directly to endorse products, or do so via an inter-
mediary, such as PayPerPost (as discussed in Chap.   4 ). 
However, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission requires dis-
closure from all bloggers who receive gifts or cash for pro-
moting products. The FTC does not monitor bloggers so this 
practice of not revealing the pay or gifts continues with some 
bloggers. 
 Viral Videos and Video Ads 
 According to Techopedia, a  viral video is “any clip of ani-
mation or ﬁ lm that is spread rapidly through online sharing” 
(per  techopedia.com/deﬁ nition/26863/viral-video ). These 
videos become popular when they get circulated via e-mail,

107
texting, blogs, Facebook, discussion forums, and so forth. 
This way, people share videos that receive more attention, 
sometimes drawing millions of viewers in a short time. 
Popular sites that are used for sharing viral videos include 
YouTube ( youtube.com ) and Vimeo ( vimeo.com ). 
 Mobile Viral Marketing 
 Viral marketing is often deployed to mobile platforms. This 
is called  mobile viral marketing . A typical approach is to 
develop and distribute apps for mobile devices. A successful 
example involves the “Get Your Island On” Malibu Bowling 
Game, a campaign launched by Pernod Ricard rum in 2009 
to support the launch of a new ﬂ avor. Their 2009 multi- 
channel campaign included a free bowling game called “Get 
Your Island On,” available on iPhones and other smart-
phones. The game got over two million downloads in the 
ﬁ rst 6 months. The managing director of the Great Works ad 
agency, hired by Pernod Ricard, said that a phone app is a 
perfect way of branding, since the product is featured in the 
game (the bowling pins are replaced by Malibu rum bottles).

 Ratings, Reviews, Recommendations 
and Referrals 
 Prior to a purchase, consumers like to collect information, 
such as, what brand to buy, from which vendor, and at what 
price. Online customers do this via shopping aids (e.g., com-
parison shopping sites), consulting product review sites such 
as Epinions, and conducting research at company sites and 
other sources. Ratings and reviews posted on social networks 
facilitate social commerce. According to Gartner Inc., the 
majority of consumers rely on social networks to guide them 
in purchase decisions (per Gartner, Inc.  2010 ). In the social 
commerce environment, shoppers look to their friends, fans, 
followers, and experienced customers for their opinions and 
advice. With peer-to-peer engagement through social media 
and high consumer trust in friends, family, and acquain-
tances, retailers recognize that their customers’ voices can be 
an extremely strong marketing tool for building sales and 
improving products. Therefore, retailers want to hear what 
the customers have to say. A variety of SC models and tools 
is available for this purpose.
•  Customer ratings and reviews.  This is feedback from 
real customers, integrated either into an e-commerce 
product page, a social network page, a customer’s review 
site, or in customer news feeds (e.g., Amazon.com, 
iTunes, Buzzillions, Epinions). Customer ratings are 
often summarized by votes or polls.  
•  Expert ratings and reviews. The view from an 
 independent voice of authority, whether professional, or 
“prosumer” (professional consumer), can be integrated 
into an e-commerce product page, a social network page, 
a product review site, an online magazine, and/or in news 
feeds (e.g., Metacritic and CNET Reviews). 
•  Sponsored reviews. These are paid-for reviews written 
by either customer bloggers or by experts on social media 
platforms (e.g., SponsoredReviews, PayPerPost). Expert 
and sponsored reviews are often generated in video for-
mat (see  expotv.com ; sharing “Videopinions” about 
products and services). 
•  Conversational marketing. People communicate via 
e-mail, blogs, live chat, discussion groups, and tweets, in 
both original posts and in comments. Monitoring conver-
sations yields rich data for market research, product 
improvements (collaboration), and customer service.  
•  Customer testimonials. Customer stories and case stud-
ies are often published on a social media site that allows 
comments and discussion (e.g., Bazaarvoice site reviews). 
 Ratings and reviews have been the cornerstone of 
e- commerce since 1995 (e.g., at Amazon.com), and are a 
great way to boost trafﬁ c volume, conversions (from surﬁ ng 
a site to buying), and increase average order value. Reviews 
may result in word-of-mouth marketing through social inﬂ u-
ence, promoting purchase decisions with credible informa-
tion. Bazaarvoice ( bazaarvoice.com ) measured the impact 
of ratings and reviews as boosting conversion to purchase by 
up to 25 %. According to a 2012 study by review company 
Reevoo as reported by Chowney ( 2012 ), 30 % of customers 
who do not see any negative views become suspicious and 
buyers who seek out and read bad reviews convert 67 % 
more than the average consumer. Interestingly, negative 
reviews appear not to have a detrimental effect on sales; we 
do not live in a ﬁ ve-star world, and apparently, shoppers do 
not expect this. New developments in ratings and reviews 
are  review syndications (to social networks),  contrast reviews 
(showing positive and negative reviews),  tagged reviews 
(tagging reviews with keywords and hashtags),  video 
reviews, geotagged mobile reviews, and story-based  cus-
tomer testimonials . For more about the positive impact of 
negative reviews, see Abel ( 2014 ). 
 Social Recommendations and Referrals 
 Whereas ratings and reviews are usually visible to all, rec-
ommendations and referrals are personal endorsements that 
have higher value for customers and advocates. The in-store 
analogy for this strategy is when consumers ask a fellow 
shopper for advice. Often, social recommendations take the 
form of online versions of traditional referral-rewards pro-
grams (e.g., Sky TV’s “Introduce a Friend”), but can also use 
5.4 Engagement Techniques

108
syndication tools via Twitter and Facebook to share recom-
mendations with friends, fans, and followers. These are 
closely related to ratings and reviews, and are sometimes 
integrated with them. 
 Traditional online product review companies such as 
Amazon.com, Bazaarvoice, and PowerReviews have advised 
many consumers. Up-and-coming social shopping software 
such as ShopSocially ( shopsocially.com ), Wanelo ( wanelo.
com ), Blippy ( blippy.com ), Swipely ( swipely.com ), and 
Bee BargainsBeetailer ( beetailer.com ) now enables  conver-
sations about purchases. The product recommendations 
come from people consumers know and are arguably trust-
worthier than reviews by strangers (recall the trust statistics 
previously mentioned). It will be interesting to see if this 
kind of model for product reviews will eventually replace 
traditional company-generated website recommendations. 
 Many vendors provide infrastructures and services for 
soliciting recommendations. For example, ThisNext ( this-
next.com ) is a social commerce site where “experts, top 
bloggers, style mavens, and trendsetters of every kind”  rec-
ommend their favorite products for shoppers to discover (see 
 thisnext.com/company ). It blends two powerful elements of 
real-world shopping otherwise lost for online consumers: 
word-of-mouth recommendations from trusted sources and 
the ability to browse products in the way that naturally leads 
to discovery. ThisNext has also developed a suite of 
 distribution tools for bloggers, online communities, and 
e-commerce sites. Another special site,  productwiki.com , 
collects product reviews from people all over the world and 
any user can write a review. Users can review products, com-
ment on products, and make changes to ProductWiki. 
 Sometimes, social shopping portals that bundle ratings 
and reviews with recommendations also provide shopping 
tools: A prime example is provided in the Kaboodle shop-
ping community. Common recommendation methods 
follow:
•  Social bookmarking. Recommended products, deals, 
and tips are bookmarked and shared with friends, fans, 
and followers, using social bookmarking sites such as 
Delicious.com. Members also bookmark many other 
types of website content. 
•  Referral programs. These involve ﬁ nancial rewards for 
customers and partners who refer new customers (e.g., 
Groupon, Gilt). For example, Vente Privee’s referral pro-
gram “Add your referral ad with a referral link.” Some of 
these programs give social media sites the opportunity to 
make money when a user clicks from the site to the 
retailer and purchases a product. For example, the 
Amazon.com Associates program ( afﬁ liate-program.
amazon.com ) provides bloggers and others with linking 
tools for their sites; the social media owner gains revenue 
by customers making “Qualiﬁ ed Purchases” via clicking 
on the “Buy from Amazon.com” link. You can ﬁ nd exam-
ples of this on blogs where the authors have a sidebar of 
“books I like” or simply recommend books on a topic of 
discussion complete with a link to Amazon.com (e.g., 
Path To Bliss; go to  pathtobliss.com/books.html ). The 
ﬁ rst “matchmaking” referral service in the U.S. is 
ReferAround ( refaround.com ). 
•  Social recommendations. Personal shopping recommen-
dations are based on proﬁ le similarities to other custom-
ers (e.g., Amazon Recommendations). 
•  Other innovative methods. Companies such as Netﬂ ix 
and StyleFeeder automate personal recommendations 
based on algorithms, comparing similarities between cus-
tomer purchasing histories and proﬁ les and movie simi-
larities. Amazon’s collaborative ﬁ ltering software 
presents product recommendations by displaying addi-
tional titles purchased by other consumers who also pur-
chased the same book or CD. 
 Quick Reference (QR) Codes 
 QR codes  are barcodes that appear as many black mod-
ules arranged as a square grid on a white background (see 
Fig.  5.5 ). These barcodes were ﬁ rst developed for the auto-
mobile industry in 1994 to track inventory, according to 
Wikipedia; however, they are now an exciting extension 
of ofﬂ ine paid media that engages Internet users (see  en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code ). Consumers who have the 
mobile tag reader application on their mobile device can 
scan a QR code appearing in a print or outdoor advertise-
ment by taking a picture with their phones. This immedi-
ately transports the user to a Web or social media site for 
 Fig. 5.5   QR Code.  Source : created by Judy Strauss for free at  qrcode.

109
more information on the brand, contest, or other informa-
tion provided by the brand online. QR code scanning can 
present a user with an online movie trailer, wallpaper for 
download, text-based information on an event location 
and time, in a form of dynamic promotions. According to 
a study by comScore, in June 2011, 14 million users had 
scanned a QR code from their mobile phones (as reported in 
 internetretailing.net/2011/08/14m-americans-scanned-
qr-and-bar-codes-with- their-mobiles-in-june-2011 ) and 
 qrcodepress.com/qr-codes-are-being-scanned-on-an-
increasing- basis/8522600 ). Although many people think 
QR codes are dead (replaced by augmented reality apps and 
others), we mention them here because they are still a very 
popular form of user engagement in branded promotional 
content. At the time of this writing, marketers are beginning 
to place QR codes on physical objects, such as ads, and by 
scanning them, consumers will be transported to Facebook 
and record an immediate “like”—just as would happen 
when they click the “like” button on a website with a com-
puter mouse. Companies can generate QR codes for free at 
many websites and incorporate them in printed materials, 
such as ads and business cards (see for example the  the-
qrcode-generator.com ,  beqrious.com ,  unitag.io/qrcode , 
or  qrcode.kaywa.com ).
 There are many other techniques and examples for suc-
cessful customer engagement in a brand or organization’s 
messages. Next, we move to the gold at the top of the engage-
ment ladder: user collaboration.  
 Collaborative Content Creation by Consumers 
 As previously mentioned, the most engaged customers help 
the company improve products and promotions because they 
either care deeply about the brand or are enticed by a suc-
cessful engagement technique, such as posting product 
improvement suggestions. In the process of reading cus-
tomer postings, the company gains market research about the 
behaviors and preferences of its markets. Collaborative con-
tent creation is crowdsourcing at its best. 
 At the simplest level, when you visit an automobile com-
pany’s website and click around to change the color of the 
car, give it leather seats and other options, you are helping 
the company learn about consumer preferences as it captures 
your online click stream—and this will guide their future 
product design. 
 At a deeper engagement level, The LEGO Group, a toy 
maker, allows consumers to download software for creating 
virtual LEGO designs (“build your dream model”)—Lego 
Digital Designs (see  ldd.lego.com/en-us ; previously 
“Design By Me”). Consumers create cool castles, robots, 
and other virtual LEGO designs, and then upload their mas-
terpieces to the LEGO gallery online. This is a great way for 
LEGO to engage customers and to learn which new design 
kits might sell well in brick-and-mortar stores. 
 Wikis are a great example of collaborative content cre-
ation because users actually create the content of the site. 
For example, Demand Media Inc.’s eHow has over two mil-
lion articles and videos created by consumers and profes-
sionals covering 30 categories and every topic from house 
and garden tips to business ideas. All content is created by 
site users and screened by site editors for quality and value 
(see  ehow.com ). 
 Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble, and other online book-
sellers allow anyone to self-publish content by uploading a 
digital e-book and selling it for download by iPad, PC, 
Kindle, and other digital book readers. For example, 26 
year old Amanda Hocking could not ﬁ nd a publisher for 
her young-adult paranormal novels, so she began selling 
them at online bookstores for $0.99 to $2.99 per digital 
download of the book. In January 2011, she sold 450,000 
copies of the 9 titles (Memmott  2011 )! In January 2011, 
Hocking earned 30 % for every 99¢ book and 70 % of 
every $2.99 of the sales price for each book she sells. This 
self-publishing capitalizes on the consumer behavior trend 
toward more people reading e-books. It also cuts out the 
book publishing middlemen and allows the online book-
sellers to offer many products created by consumer authors. 
Incidentally, Amazon.com also allows users to upload 
DVD, CD, MP3, and video content created by users for 
sales on the site. 
 Many other social media sites beneﬁ t by allowing users to 
upload digital multimedia content. CNN’s iReport accepts 
videos, photos, and audio from citizen journalists who are on 
the scene of breaking news. The best content is shown on the 
site, and some receive iReport awards. iTunes and Amazon.
com allow musicians to upload digital music ﬁ les for sale on 
their sites. Musicians cannot upload music directly, but must 
go through a distributor, such as CD Baby (the largest indie 
online music store), who helps them obtain a bar code and 
ascertains that the intellectual property belongs to said musi-
cian. Obviously, YouTube, Flickr, and many other multime-
dia sites contain only user-created content. Their business 
models entice users to upload content, draw many eyeballs, 
and sell advertising. 
 Many brands invite consumers to create advertising 
(especially in videos) and upload it to a website for public 
viewing, voting, and sharing. This UGC is often better than 
the ads the company or agency would normally produce 
because the authors often understand the market better than 
the company. 
 Example 
 Beginning in 2010, the Frito-Lay “Crash the Super Bowl” 
contest offered consumers the chance to create winning 30-s 
television commercials for the Doritos brand and upload the 
5.4 Engagement Techniques

110
videos to the contest site ( crashthesuperbowl.com ). In 
2014, Frito Lay opened the contest up to contestants world-
wide, and received thousands of video ad submissions from 
over 30 countries. Site visitors vote on the best ad and select 
two grand prize winners (one voted by site viewers and the 
other selected by the company). The winners get their cre-
ation aired as a commercial during the Super Bowl champi-
onship football game in January. The winner does not receive 
additional money; however, if the spot is awarded one of the 
top three of the broadcast, according to the USA TODAY ad 
meter rankings, the grand prize winner receives between 
$400,000 and $1 million (for the top spot) and a chance to 
work with professionals to produce another ad. Other brands, 
such as FootLocker, teaming up with the shoe company 
Asics, also offer opportunities to win video contests (e.g. see 
 onlinevideocontests.com and  ﬁ lmthenext.com ). 
 How Do Companies Entice Engagement? 
 As Oscar Wilde famously noted, “The only thing worse than 
being talked about is not being talked about.” How do com-
panies engage the public, gaining trust and guiding people 
from passive content consumption, up the ladder to sparking 
positive brand conversations and viral activity? This involves 
creating content and promotions that encourage people to 
interact with the brand and then tag, bookmark or rate the 
content and share opinions with others via comments and 
recommendations in social media. Because they can reach 
millions of people when they share, it is like the old fash-
ioned word-of-mouth on steroids. 
 As with all effective promotions, three basic criteria must 
be met—delivering the right message to the right markets in 
the right environment, Kaplan and Haenlein ( 2010 ). 
Accomplishing this requires a deep understanding of the 
audience’s needs, behaviors, and motivations. In a 2011 
ExactTarget study about the “Meaning of Like,” a research 
company found reasons users don’t hit the “like” button on a 
Facebook brand page (eMarketer  2011a ):
•  54 % because they do not want to be bombarded with ads 
or messages, 
•  45 % because they do not want companies to have access 
to proﬁ le information, 
•  31 % do not want to push things into friends’ networks, 
•  29 % do not want companies to contact them through 
Facebook and 
•  23 % did not see the beneﬁ t of doing so. 
 In contrast, Facebook members who do “Like” a com-
pany or brand have certain expectations: gain access to 
exclusive content, events, or sales (58 %); receive discounts 
or promotions through Facebook (58 %); receive updates 
about the company in newsfeeds (47 %). The company can 
post updates, photos, or videos on newsfeed (39 %); the 
name of the company, brand or organization to show up on 
my proﬁ le (37 %); the company will contact me through 
other channels (24 %); and do not expect anything to happen 
(37 %) (eMarketer  2011a ). For the full report, see  exacttar-
get.com/resources/SFF8.pdf . 
 Thus, social media participants want to be informed, 
entertained, appreciated, and not bombarded with interrup-
tive brand messages, as seen in the following engagement 
principles and examples. 
 Provide High Quality, Timely, Unique, 
and Relevant Information 
 When companies like eMarketer, A.C. Nielsen, ComScore, 
or Forrester release statistics from their primary research, 
bloggers will write about it, giving their interpretations for 
readers to comment upon and share. For example, Internet 
marketing consultant Andy Beal started the Marketing 
Pilgrim blog in 2005. He began his day in the wee hours by 
reading his RSS streams from over 100 sites he followed. He 
then would write a blog post about the latest news announced 
by Google or another company, and give his expert analysis 
on what it means to Internet marketers. Beal built his con-
sulting business from his blog followers, sells advertising 
space on his blog, participates in many interviews with 
mainstream media, added a team of experts to write articles, 
and is often in the top ten media and marketing blogs, as 
rated by  Advertising Age (see  marketingpilgrim.com ). 
Robert Fleming, President/CEO of the eMarketing 
Association in the U.S., wrote a very provocative blog post 
on the association’s website. The article, “Social Media has 
Ruined Marketing,” was posted on LinkedIn, and this 
quickly received nearly 600 comments, creating a very lively 
discussion. 
 Create Entertaining Content 
 Consumers will watch and share video commercials and 
other company-created content that is entertaining, irrever-
ent, interesting or unusual. For example, Blendtec created a 
series of infomercials (called “Will It Blend”) showing the 
power of its new consumer market blenders. The videos 
showed the company CEO blending everything from a gar-
den rake to golf balls, glow sticks, and an iPad. The iPhone 5 
blending video alone received 8.4 million views within 12 
months, and the blended iPhone remnants from an iPhone 4 
blending received over $900 on eBay in 2007. As of March 
2013, the Blendtec video series had received over 294 mil-
lion views on YouTube, an undetermined amount on the 
5 Customer Engagement and Metrics

111
Willitblend.com microsite, and have had an “amazing 
impact” on company sales, according to the company CEO, 
Tom Dickson (see  digitalsparkmarketing.com/creative- 
marketing/marketing-strategy-creative-marketing/will-
it- blend-marketing-campaign and YouTube for more 
details). 
 Offer Competitions 
 Many people love to compete and win prizes. For example, 
the Microsoft Windows 7 launch included a “School Pride” 
sales promotion campaign, asking site visitors to vote on 
videos created by middle or high school students who hoped 
to win a computer lab makeover. Microsoft used a social 
graph that allowed voters to invite friends and followers to 
vote as well. Microsoft experienced a 75 % increase in trafﬁ c 
during the competition (Marketo  2011 ). Incidentally, 
Washington’s Whatcom Middle School won the competi-
tion, providing another opportunity for social media activity 
and publicity from Microsoft and its partner, NBC. 
 Appeal to Altruism 
 People like to share stories, videos, and other content about 
social causes, such as experienced by H-D for the Save the 
Honey Bees campaign. In another example, the American 
Red Cross ran an article on their website announcing a blood 
drive to assist residents after the storms that battered the East 
Coast of the U.S. in 2011. Instead of providing the usual 
paper sticker for the donor’s clothing (“I gave blood”), The 
Red Cross made a virtual status badge that people could 
share on their social networks, encouraging friends and fol-
lowers to also donate blood (see Marketo  2011 ). In 2010, if 
blood donors checked in via Foursquare, they could “shout” 
a 140 character post including the words “Red Cross” 
“blood” and “donate” to friends that they were currently giv-
ing blood and this would unlock a special donor badge that 
appeared on the user’s Foursquare proﬁ le and would be auto-
matically sent to a Twitter feed and the user’s Foursquare 
proﬁ le (Behlmann  2010 ) 
 Make an Exclusive Offer 
 The social psychology principle of “scarcity” often moti-
vates people to take action immediately (such as “only two 
left so buy now!”). Artists and movie produces often release 
songs or trailers for viewing by their fan bases, prior to 
release to the general public. American rapper, Pitbull, went 
further when promoting his CD,  Planet Pit , by telling fans 
that if they sent an early release online track link to friends, 
and three visited the website to listen, the original fan would 
get to unlock three additional bonus tracks from the CD 
(Marketo  2011 ). 
 Reward Inﬂ uentials and Fans 
 Following the famous Pareto principle (the “80-20” rule”), 
that 80 % of the business comes from 20 % of the customers; 
most of the buzz about a brand comes from a small number 
of fans. If Andy Beal or the  Hufﬁ ngton Post continuously 
write about a company, they should be rewarded. Rewards of 
appreciation can take the form of exclusive information, ﬁ rst 
chance at breaking news, or a free gift—such as the chance 
to review a new product that they get to keep, an exclusive 
offer or a special discount. Following the principles of cus-
tomer relationship management (Chap.   7 ), a brand will do 
well to occasionally appreciate its important fans. Foursquare 
allows this by awarding “mayor” status to the people who 
check in the most number of days during a 60-day time 
period at a particular location. Frito-Lay made the Guinness 
World Records title in April 2011 for the “most fans on 
Facebook,” with more than 1.5 million new “likes” on its 
Facebook page (“fans”). They rewarded fans by giving away 
24,000 bags of chips, via coupons, to the ﬁ rst fans who 
“liked” the page and registered on a special “giveaway tab” 
(see  fritolay.com/about-us/press-release-20110428.html ). 
It didn’t stop there: Frito-Lay had 2,356,753 likes as of 
August 2014.  
 Incentivize Group Behavior 
 Following the social psychology principle of reciprocity, 
customers can be motivated to participate in social media if 
offered an incentive up front (versus the simple “thank you” 
type reward just mentioned). For example, Oscar Mayer 
gave consumers an ofﬂ ine discount coupon to an initial prod-
uct trial of its Oscar Mayer Selects hot dogs. They added a 
deal sweetener: share a “Taste-a-Monial” review of the prod-
uct and receive a seconds coupon. The twist was that for 
every 5,000 people who shared Taste-a-Monials, the coupon 
value increased by 50¢ until the consumer could receive a 
full free pack of the hot dogs. Using the scarcity principle, 
the offer was limited to a short time period (Dhalokia  2011 ). 
 A key principle of enticing engagement is to make it easy 
for users. For instance, most social media and many websites 
provide one click buttons for “liking,” tagging, bookmarking 
(e.g., offering a Delicious button), subscribing via an RSS 
feed button (which can rapidly spread the content) and shar-
ing content on social networks. Many sites also allow users 
to register with one click, using their Facebook or other 
5.4 Engagement Techniques

112
social network proﬁ le. For example, BostInnovation (now 
BostsInno) provides information on happenings in the 
Boston area. The site implemented Gigya’s social login 
application so that users could register and sign in using an 
existing Facebook, Twitter, etc. account, and comment 
directly on BostonInnovation’s site. This resulted in a 58 % 
increase 
in 
commenting 
activity, 
according 
to 
BostonInnovation’s co-founder Kevin McCarthy ( app-
sthisway.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/gigya-social-roi- 
casestudies.pdf ). 
 Thus far, we have been painting a rosy picture of cus-
tomer engagement and all the good it can do for a brand or 
organization. As hard as marketers try to deliver a good 
product and respect consumer communication preferences, 
things can quickly go downhill in social media. For example, 
in 2006, General Motors emulated the Frito-Lay consumer 
generated ad contest, providing consumers with video, 
audio, and images to use in constructing commercials for the 
Chevy Tahoe. It worked well for GM, too; however, there 
was negative backlash—approximately 20 % of the entries 
had superimposed text right in the ads mentioning the Chevy 
Tahoe’s part in using up the world’s oil and causing global 
warming. For example, one YouTube video entry had the fol-
lowing text over images of the Chevy Tahoe driving in wil-
derness: “Like snow? Beautiful landscapes? Be sure to take 
it all in now because tomorrow this (expletive deleted) SUV 
will change the world. Global warming isn’t a pretty SUV 
ad. It’s a frightening reality.” (See  npr.org/templates/story/
story.php?storyId=5320442 .) These videos subsequently 
were posted as ad parodies on YouTube and received a lot of 
press. Regardless, GM felt the campaign was a huge success 
because 80 % of the ads were positive about the brand and 
many people watched them. The moral: in an online environ-
ment where everyone is a critic, expect the brand’s under-
belly to be exposed. This brings us to an important topic: 
How can a company manage its brand messages and reputa-
tion in the “Wild West” environment of social media? 
5.5 
 REPUTATION MANAGEMENT 
IN SOCIAL MEDIA 
 In February 2011, Egyptian citizens used social media to 
organize protests against President Hosni Mubarak, high 
unemployment, and rising prices. They used Facebook, 
Twitter, and YouTube until the government blocked all WiFi 
and cell networks. This didn’t stop the people, who then used 
dial up phone modems to connect and organize protests. 
Mubarak fell from power. If social media conversation can 
bring down the government of Egypt, what can it do to a 
company, brand or CEO? 
 Kitchen Aid, the appliance producer, found out very 
quickly in 2012 when the social media manager sent an 
inappropriate tweet from the company @KitchenAidUSA 
Twitter account that spoke negatively about then candi-
date Barack Obama, saying something to the effect that 
his grandmother died three days before he became presi-
dent the ﬁ rst time because she knew it wasn’t going to go 
well with him as President. That 140 character message 
created a fast and huge backlash against the company. 
Even though the tweet was meant to be sent from some-
one’s personal account, the company sent an apology 
tweet to the Twitter community and directly to Obama, 
taking full responsibility for its social media mismanage-
ment (Moore  2012 ). 
 Reputation is “the beliefs or opinions that are generally 
held about someone or something,” according the Oxford 
dictionary. Abraham Lincoln is attributed to saying that 
“Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. The 
shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.” 
Thus, an entity’s reputation is based on what other people 
think of it, not what it thinks of itself. With social media, 
there is plenty of opportunity for consumers to shape the 
reputation of a company, its brands and its employees. 
Brands and companies have lost a great deal of control over 
their images and reputations and must now monitor, engage, 
and participate in social media conversations or pay the con-
sequences. In a global study of 300 large company execu-
tives in 2013, Deloitte found a consensus that reputational 
risk was among corporate America’s greatest challenges. 
(See the survey results at  deloitte.com/view/en_IQ/iq/
press/press-releases/d78b76006de23410VgnVC-
M3000003456f70aRCRD.htm .) 
 Quality, transparency, and trust principally inﬂ uence 
company and brand reputations (according to a recent 
Edelman annual Trust survey). In order to be trusted, an 
entity must be reliable, high quality, authentic, transparent, 
and follow through on its promises. Marketers often describe 
a brand as a promise to deliver promoted beneﬁ ts, and if they 
do not follow through on that promise, they are open to 
attack in the social media. For example, if an automobile 
does not get the advertised gas mileage, a customer will lose 
some degree of trust in the company/brand and likely talk 
about this gas mileage disparity online on product review 
sites or in social networks or blogs. Transparency occurs 
when companies honestly and quickly reveal the truth before 
or during a reputation crisis. If they hide the truth and later 
are discovered, the negative social media conversation will 
escalate. Transparency includes honest conversation in 
social media and revealing product improvement processes, 
such as Dell does in its IdeaStorm microsite previously 
discussed. 
5 Customer Engagement and Metrics

 Consider the following statistics:
•  In 2013, only 58 % of the world trusted businesses to do 
“what is right” (according to the 2013 Edelman Trust 
Survey). 
•  25 % of searches for the world’s twenty largest brands 
return links to user-generated content (reported by 
Qualman  2009 ). Search engines rank as the ﬁ rst place 
people go for information about a company, according to 
the Edelman Trust Survey. 
•  34 % of bloggers post opinions about product and brands, 
and these are read by those people who follow and trust 
the blogs (reported by Qualman  2009 ). 
•   Only 14 % of people trust advertisements (Qualman 
 2009 ). This is likely because the intent of advertising is to 
persuade consumers by presenting only the positive about 
a product (in contrast, recall the high number of people 
who trust people like themselves).  
•  Who do consumers trust? According to the 2013 
Edelman Trust Survey, most trusted are academics or 
experts on company issues (68 %), then “a person like 
you” (60 %), followed by regular employees (49 %) and 
CEO’s (40 %). 
•  Trust needs repetition: In order to trust a company mes-
sage, 4–14 % will believe the positive information after 
hearing it one to two times, and only 35 % will believe it 
after hearing it three times (according to the 2013 Edelman 
Trust Survey). 
 Beyond social media participant responses to company 
actions, people often write negative posts in the middle of 
the night, surprising the companies who are the objects of 
these attacks. This happened to Nestle in March 2010, as dis-
cussed in the following example: 
 Example 
 Greenpeace UK, the activist not-for-proﬁ t organization 
working for a green and peaceful world, posted a video on 
both their site and YouTube to build awareness of a perceived 
problem of the diminishing rainforest and pushing orang-
utans towards extinction. Nestlé, the maker of Kit Kat candy 
bars, was purchasing palm oil extracted from forests in 
Indonesia, thus “trashing the Indonesian rainforests, threat-
ening the livelihoods of local people and pushing orangutans 
towards extinction,” according to the video’s description 
( greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-
change/kitkat ). The video on the Greenpeace site, titled: 
“Need a Break? So Does the Rainforest” and on YouTube, 
titled: “Have a Break? Greenpeace Campaign against KitKat 
and 
Nestle” 
( youtube.com/watch?v=VaJjPRwExO8 ) 
shows an ofﬁ ce worker taking a break by eating a Kit Kat 
bar. When he bites into it, blood gushes from the 
chocolate bar. 
 The whole series of videos received 1.5 million views by 
March 2010; however, the damage really escalated on 
Nestlé’s Facebook page. Immediately after the initial March 
17, 2010 video post, viewers began complaining about the 
palm oil harvesting with comments on the company’s 
Facebook page. Some of the protesters created a graphic imi-
tation of the Kit Kat candy bar, replacing the brand name 
with the word “Killer” in the same font or stamping the pack-
age with bloody orangutan footprints. They made this image 
their proﬁ le picture on Facebook so every post on the Nestlé 
page included this image. 
 Nestlé responded by saying: “we welcome your comments, 
but please don’t post using an altered version of any of our 
logos as your proﬁ le pic—they will be deleted.” This inappro-
priate response created a blog storm and many more posts, and 
shifted the conversation away from the core issue of forest 
destruction and animal extinction to Nestlé's ineptitude in 
social media. Nestlé debated with commenters, defending its 
decision to censor proﬁ le pictures and then started deleting 
comments as well. It got very nasty. Eventually, the Nestle 
executive running the Facebook page posted this comment: 
“This (deleting logos) was one in a series of mistakes for 
which I would like to apologize. And for being rude. We’ve 
stopped deleting posts and I’ve stopped being rude.” 
 What is really amazing is the speed at which this 
happened:
•  March 17: Greenpeace posted the video on YouTube. The 
video was viewed 750,000 times in 1 week. Nestle 
attempted to have the video removed.  
•  March 18: 190 Facebook complaints and thousands of 
Tweets in response. 
•  March 19 at 2:26 AM: Nestlé responds on Facebook with 
the plan to delete the “Killer” bar logos and comments.  
•  March 19 at 1:29 PM: Nestlé apologizes on Facebook and 
stops deleting the posts.  
 Several companies analyzed the social media conversa-
tions after this incident. One found that social media conver-
sations including both terms “Nestlé” and “Facebook” 
jumped by 40 % on March 19, 2010, and that 16 % of this 
conversation was negative, 66 % neutral, and 16 % positive 
(as measured by the former site,  blog.biz360.com ). For an 
analysis of Nestlé’s social media crisis, see the slideshow at

use social media to publicize their complaints. Notable is the

 Which Reputations Matter? 
 As previously mentioned, brand and company reputations 
are very important. Twenty-one percent of company market 
value on the New York Stock Exchange’s S&P is based on 
corporate reputation (according to a study conducted by 
intangible asset specialist Reputation Dividend, and reported 
by the Holmes Report on May 25, 2014;  holmesreport.
com/expertknowledge-info/14999/More-Than-20-
Percent-Of- SP-500-Value-Attributable-To-Reputation.
aspx ). It is very difﬁ cult for a company to recover from rep-
utation damage, and according to the experiences of many 
companies, it can take several years to repair reputation 
damage. 
 In an interesting example, Brazilian creative agency, 
Moma Propaganda, was stripped of two awards and prohib-
ited from entering the Cannes Lions International Festival of 
Creativity for a year. The agency entered two fake ads for 
Kia Motors Brazil—“fake” meaning that they created the ads 
for the competition—but the ads were neither approved by 
Kia nor run in any traditional or online media. Cannes dis-
covered this when it came across the ﬁ restorm of social 
media conversation, which criticized the campaign for over-
tones of lust and pedophilia. This incident created reputation- 
damaging publicity for both the agency and Kia Motors 
Brazil, until the latter said they had neither seen nor approved 
the ads (Wentz and Penteado  2011 ). 
 The reputation of a company’s CEO is linked closely to 
the reputation of the company. Many PR ﬁ rms suggest that 
problems occur when there is negative company or CEO 
news. Often, the reputations of other company executives 
also affect the company. For example, the reputations of job 
recruiters in a company can make a big difference when try-
ing to attract good employees (Shih  2011 ). Successful 
recruiters build their reputations on LinkedIn and this helps 
them build good relationships with previous job candidates 
and new hires. 
 Recently, there has been a great deal of talk and informa-
tion about using social media for personal branding. This 
especially applies to consultants, salespeople, and other pro-
fessionals, as well as to college students who are about to 
enter the job market (see  business.unr.edu/faculty/jstrauss/
personal.htm for a series of exercises to develop your per-
sonal brand). 
 Build, Maintain, Monitor, Repair, and Learn 
 The reputation management process includes four steps: 
build, maintain, monitor, and repair. Many of the techniques 
for implementing these steps are discussed elsewhere in the 
book so we just touch upon them here. There are many pro-
motional techniques for  building a strong reputation, but it all 
starts with the company’s actions. As previously  mentioned, 
most social media reputation crises happen because of some-
thing the company does or does not do. Given positive 
actions, the company can use owned or paid media and join 
the conversation in earned social media to communicate its 
beneﬁ ts to consumers and other stakeholders. This book 
gives many examples of how companies do this, such as 
engaging customers and prospects who participate in social 
media, where they hang out online and using search engine 
optimization tactics (discussed later in this chapter). 
 Maintaining positive reputations requires constant 
Internet and ofﬂ ine media monitoring and then sometimes 
participating when things go awry. We say “sometimes” 
because companies decide whether or not to respond based 
on three factors: (1) how valuable is the poster to the com-
pany, (2) how much potential does the comment contain for 
creating reputation damage, and (3) how widely can the dis-
cussion travel in social media (Flynn  2012 )? For example, if 
the comment came from a high value customer or inﬂ uential 
journalist, the company will respond immediately, some-
times by direct e-mail to the person who posted the com-
ment. Conversely, if the poster is a low value customer or 
competitor and it does not seem like a big enough conversa-
tion to spread far, the company might ignore the comment. 
Interestingly, one survey of marketers found that in response 
to customer complaints or questions, 29 % seldom or never 
respond to them on Twitter and 17 % said the same for 
Facebook posts (eMarketer  2011b ). These may be low-value 
complaints, but this same study found that 22 % of compa-
nies do not even know if their customers use social media to 
comment on company products, so we suspect that many 
reputations are declining unnoticed by marketers. 
 The Nestlé example shows the need to  monitor social 
media conversation 24/7 and assign appropriate personnel to 
Facebook and other social media for beneﬁ cial user interac-
tions. Xbox was found to be the fastest brand to respond to 
customer queries on Twitter, with an average response time 
of 2 minutes and 42 second(s), whereas another study found 
the fastest U.S. retailer responses took over 4 h (Hanger 
 2011 ). It is also critically important to understand and ﬁ x the 
underlying problem, if possible, prior to responding to blog-
gers and other social media detractors. Without substance, 
responses to a crisis can be seen as empty promises to social 
media participants. 
5 Customer Engagement and Metrics

115
 When a company creates a Facebook business page, by 
default, it allows other Facebook members—potentially 
including disgruntled customers or unscrupulous competi-
tors—to post notes on the page, or comment on what the 
company has posted. However, if the page owner turns off 
the feature that allows others to write on the Wall, people 
may wonder what the company fears or is hiding. Turning 
off the feature also precludes great customer fan conversa-
tions and engagement that could promote the products and 
services better than the company could do (because people 
trust others like them online). Companies can delete posts, 
but that may only encourage the poster to scream louder 
about being censored, as happened in the Nestlé case. Most 
social media marketing experts advise deleting only the most 
offensive posts, while trying to address the rest as construc-
tively as possible. In fact, this is how a company can learn 
things that will improve its products and processes. 
 For example, Coca-Cola has 88 million fans on its 
Facebook page worldwide, with 80 % living outside the U.S. 
(2011 data). The company uses geotags so that fans see rel-
evant posts in their own language, based on the poster’s IP 
(Internet Protocol) address (for example, someone posting 
from .de would see only German language posts). Coke 
posted something it thought would appeal to fans—“Student 
Day:” “Today’s the Day of the Student! If you’re part of this 
group [of students], show us by having some fun or posting 
a comment here. And congratulations” (Creamer  2011 ). 
Unfortunately, there was a glitch in the geotagging on 
Facebook and for 10 minutes U.S. fans saw this post in 
Portuguese instead of English. This created a ﬁ restorm of 
xenophobic comments from U.S. fans, such as “Speak 
English or @#* die!” (Expletive deleted). Apparently, U.S. 
fans think that Coke is an American brand and should stay 
that way. Many of the comments were in blatant disregard of 
Coke’s Facebook rules, and Coca-Cola removed the 
Portuguese post and all the offensive comments from its 
American viewers. 
 Repairing reputations can take an average of 3.2 years, as 
previously mentioned. This involves ﬁ xing the fundamental 
problems causing the crisis, communicating the solutions to 
important stakeholders, and enticing social media partici-
pants to spread the conversation. One site to watch is 
RipOffReport.com, because it allows users to post company/
product complaints, scams, reviews or frauds. The post often 
appears in a Google search for the company or brand. As 
with most negative posts, the way to bury it into later Google 
search results pages is to be sure the company has many pos-
itive posts and pages that include recent content. 
 Most good companies  learn from criticism in social 
media and act upon what they hear. Negative comments add 
authenticity in balancing a company’s one-sided owned and 
paid media, and when handled well, can boost reputations 
and sales. Product reviews, complaints, and positive sugges-
tions help companies improve products, processes, and Web 
content. The best way to encourage this type of posting is by 
hosting a conversation on the company’s own social media 
properties so it becomes easier to identify, learn, and then 
respond that changes have been made (if warranted). This 
kind of dialog often prevents complaints from going viral as 
well. For example, My Starbucks Idea ( mystarbucksidea.
force.com ) has several hundred thousand users and accepts 
ideas for product, experience, and involvement categories. 
 Mystarbucksidea.force.com lists recent ideas as they are 
sent via Twitter, Facebook, or posted on the site, and then 
reports on “ideas in action.” Users can click on each idea to 
see its status and add comments. This is a brilliant way to 
learn from customers without doing expensive market 
research, and it yields a lot more actionable data as well (see 
Chap.   1 opening case for more information). For more infor-
mation on using reputation management, see  seofriendly.
com/tag/reputation-management . 
 One important way to avoid unwarranted reputation cri-
ses involves building a reputation management system in 
company owned social media.  
 Reputations Management Systems 
 Reputation management systems use various predeﬁ ned 
criteria for processing complex data to report reputation. 
This is a technology solution that helps companies initiate 
and monitor reputations. One tactic is to design the system 
properly so that there will be more opportunities for positive 
comments. A properly designed site will attract the proper 
visitors and facilitate proper trust and interactions. Thus, 
instead of looking at negatives, reputation systems should 
build trust, promote quality, facilitate member matching, and 
sustain loyalty. 
 Example 
 Most social media platforms have a member proﬁ le feature, 
which allows others to see more about who is posting on the 
medium, and also to view information about some of the 
member’s activities. Furthermore, many social networks 
require a reply to an automated outgoing e-mail when a user 
signs up to access that site, so they know the user actually 
resides at that e-mail address and is not simply a spammer. 
eBay and other social commerce sites have feedback systems 
so that buyers can rate sellers for all future buyers to see; buy-
ers have the same system. Similarly, Slashdot ( slashdot.org ) 
uses a “karma” rating system, and others also have systems 
where users can rate the reviews and even the ratings of other 
users. These reputation management systems help build 
authenticity and trust in contributors to the conversation. 
 Facebook grew and outdid MySpace partially because of 
its reputation management techniques. It initially engaged 
5.5 Reputation Management in Social Media

116
users and built trust through e-mail authentication, privacy 
settings, building the site around relationships in the ofﬂ ine 
world (Shih  2011 ). Facebook started as a site for Harvard 
University and other Ivy League schools, adding to its 
credibility. 
 In another reputation management system example, 
Rosetta Stone is a maker of software for language transla-
tion. It is mostly a B2B organization. To get the most out of 
social media, Rosetta Stone uses a strategy and software to 
control its customer interaction on Facebook. The strategy 
involves both human intervention as well as an investment in 
software to help monitor its social networking presence. 
Speciﬁ cally, the company software helps to monitor Wall 
posts and respond to them appropriately. Rosetta Stone uses 
Parature, Inc. software to scan fan Wall posts, add them to a 
database, and ﬂ ag those that need a response from the com-
pany. This solution is handy because it all occurs on a special 
Facebook support tab and separates fans chatting among 
themselves from discussions involving company customer 
service representatives (Carr  2010 ). For details, see  face-
book.com/RosettaStone . 
5.6 
 SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION 
 Search engine optimization ( SEO ) is the process of improv-
ing the visibility of a company or a brand on the results page 
displayed by a search engine. Here, we will discuss only a 
few principles, which relate to social media and positive 
earned media. The purpose of search engine optimization “is 
to increase a website’s trafﬁ c counts, and eventually conver-
sions, by getting higher search engine placement for the key-
words in the search query” (per Bruce Clay; see  bruceclay.
com/seo/search-engine-optimization.htm ), who provides a 
free tutorial on SEO). 
 Search engines rank sites on search engine results pages 
(SERP) using complicated algorithms partially based on 
user-inputted key words because the search engines want to 
present results that are relevant to users. Ideally, the results 
should be among the top ﬁ ve listings on the ﬁ rst page. 
Companies often hire search optimizers or try to optimize by 
themselves. SEO can increase the number of visitors to a 
website, and therefore companies are willing to pay for this 
service. To learn how to do this, see Harris ( 2013 ). SEO is 
performed in all types of online searches, including video 
search, social network search, and image search. Google is 
well known for using over 200 factors in their algorithm to 
determine rankings (e.g., social signals, user interaction sig-
nals, trust); however, a few important principles regarding 
SEO and social commerce are discussed below (see Google’s 
Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide for more detail at 
 static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/
us/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-
guide.pdf ). For an infographic and examples of Google’s 
search engine ranking factors (2013), see  searchenginejour-
nal.com/infographic-googles-200-ranking-factors/64316 . 
We focus on Google in this section because it had a 68.7 % 
share of the search market in June 2014 (according to com-
Score’s monthly qSearch), while none of the remaining 
search engines achieved more than a 19 % share (see  com-
score.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-
Releases- July-2014-US-Search-Engine-Rankings ). 
The 
principles are:
 1.  Spread fresh content all over the Web. The more sites 
and social media pages a company or brand maintains, 
the more links will appear on search engine results pages. 
This is important because when negative content appears 
in social media, it will brieﬂ y appear within the search 
results but a lot of solid, current Web content, such as 
images, podcasts, videos, press releases, and articles, 
will quickly drive the negative content to later pages in 
the search results. For example, when searching for “Will 
it Blend,” the branded microsite appears ﬁ rst on the 
results page. This is followed by three YouTube videos, 
the Blendtec company YouTube channel, a Wikipedia 
entry, the company’s Facebook page, the company’s 
blog, and then two social media columns about the com-
pany’s blenders and fascinating campaign—one a humor-
ous and positive parody of the viral videos (“will the 
blender blend itself?”). See Fig.  5.6  for the top ﬁ ve 
results. Of course, a company will only create content for 
sites frequented by its target audience and social media 
inﬂ uentials.
 2.  Relevance and popularity. Google judges relevance by 
incoming links to a Web page and the popularity of the 
site based on clicks from a SERP or number of tweets or 
“likes” or comments on a company’s Facebook page. For 
example, if it is a musician’s site and lots of credible 
similar sites link to it (such as a radio station blog), 
Google assumes it is highly relevant and popular, mov-
ing it closer to the top of the SERP. Companies seek 
these inbound links—e.g., one blogger we interviewed 
for a previous book asked to be linked from our univer-
sity pages because “.edu” domains have more Google 
credibility than do “.com” sites. Social media marketers 
put many cross- links to various sites, such as linking 
from the microsite to the Facebook page and cross-link-
ing to pages within the site. Google also deﬁ nes “rele-
vance” as individual- speciﬁ c using social graphs, so if 
you search for “the best restaurant” in your town the top 
result might well be one that your Facebook friends rated 
highly on Yelp.com, whereas someone else’s SERP will 
reﬂ ect what their friends commented upon in other social 
media sites.

 3.  Optimize content. A search engine’s automated robots 
search websites to see which words are the most impor-
tant, partially by looking at topic headings, page titles 
(words that appear on the browser tabs), URL names, 
meta tags (placed in the HTML code for each page), and 
other things in large fonts. This means that social media 
marketers must understand their audiences’ desired ben-
eﬁ ts and search habits so they can select key words to 
populate the sites used by target markets for searching. 
For example, the “Student LoanDown” blog about stu-
dent loans and Wells Fargo bank ﬁ nancing uses 29 key 
words in its meta tag but only 3 of them rank in Google’s 
ﬁ rst SERP but don’t rank in Google’s ﬁ rst page for 26 of 
them—these are the ones used in the name of the blog as 
well (search for  blogs.wellsfargo.com/studentloan-
down ). This site needs to revise its key words to focus on 
a smaller number to be used throughout the content.  
 4.  SEO tactics constantly change. Google is famous for 
adjusting its search algorithm (around 500–600 times per 
year; “major” algorithm changes about once a month), 
both to improve results and to control site owners from 
spamming the system (such as putting key words at the 
bottom of the page in white text all over a white back-
ground so search engines are able to read it but users do 
not; promoting the same piece of content repeatedly; 
place unneeded words in title tags). Bloggers who partake 
in spamming can have their blog disappear—
“blacklisted”—from Google search. This means that 
social media marketers must constantly watch develop-
ments and change tactics accordingly. We recommend 
visiting 
 searchengineland.com/library/channel/seo , 
 searchenginewatch.com/seo , and  moz.com (formerly 
SEOmoz), for the latest SEO developments and capabili-
ties. Google provides three free SEO tools: Google 
Webmasters, Google AdWords Keyword Planner, and 
Google PageSpeed (see Dawson  2014 ). 
 In one example of what not to do, Nevada’s former gov-
ernor, Jim Gibbons, posted images from appearances, a blog, 
 Fig. 5.6   SERP for “Will it Blend”.  Source : Reproduced with permission from © Blendtec and permission standards on  google.com

and his authored white papers on the ofﬁ cial State of Nevada 
website ( nv.gov ). When the citizens became critical of his 
decisions, a search for “Jim Gibbons” showed the  nv.gov 
page ﬁ rst on the search results page and then nine links to 
criticism on other sites. Some of these links to the negative 
content lasted for several years on the ﬁ rst page of the SERP 
and could have been bounced to later pages, if the governor 
had spread fresh content, such as, posting images on Flickr, 
making a unique URL for his blog, creating Facebook and 
Twitter accounts, and inserting content in Wikipedia and 
elsewhere that would appear in the ﬁ rst ten links on the 
SERP for his name. This action would move the criticism on 
other sites lower in the SERP in favor of fresh content posted 
by the governor on many different sites. 
 Note that, although password protected sites such as 
Facebook and Twitter are crawled by search engines for pub-
lic display in the SERP, users have to log onto these sites in 
order to follow the link. If a company wants its content to 
appear on Google and be easily viewed, it will create a pub-
lic page that is available to people who are not required to be 
logged onto the site. Moreover, Facebook provides its own 
powerful search engine for users who are logged in, and 
there are many specialized search engines for social media 
sites, such as Topsy and Bing Social. For 40 advanced and 
alternative top search engines, see to  blog.kissmetrics.com/
alternative-search-engines . Companies work to be sure 
their content is listed by these specialty companies, who 
 usually allow submissions if the search robots have not yet 
found the sites. 
 As with any social strategy, companies working on an 
SEO program ﬁ rst work to understand the Web behaviors 
and social sites used by their target market and inﬂ uentials in 
terms of publishing and sharing content. They then set SEO 
goals and monitor the results. 
 In the next section, you will learn about how companies 
listen and measure in social media. 
5.7 
 MONITOR, MEASURE, AND REFINE: 
SM METRICS 
 A  performance metric is a measure of the organization’s 
performance on activities designed to achieve speciﬁ c objec-
tives (also called “Web Analytics” for the online environ-
ment). As shown in Fig.   4.1 (in Chap.   4 ), a company speciﬁ es 
which metrics will be used to measure marketing communi-
cation success, then uses these measures as feedback to (1) 
see if the campaign objectives were met, and (2) continually 
reﬁ ne the strategies and tactics to enhance performance. For 
example, Starbucks wanted to engage customers and learn 
ways to better meet their needs through product innovation. 
It created the My Starbucks Idea microsite and can count the 
number of suggestions, measure the sentiment (as positive/
negative), and identify the number of product changes to see 
if its engagement and learning goals were achieved. We will 
discuss strategy, tactics, and measurement more thoroughly 
in Chap.   10 ; however, this section includes popular metrics 
for measuring the success of communication efforts through 
owned, paid, and earned media. 
 There are hundreds of possible performance metrics, so 
it is important to select some that can easily be measured on 
a continuous basis and directly applied to the organization’s 
social commerce communication objectives. Both Albert 
Einstein and sociologist William Bruce Cameron have been 
credited for variations of quote: “Not everything that can be 
counted counts, and not everything that counts can be 
counted.” Marketers are drowning in metrics and many 
choose easy metrics, such as number of clicks on a link to a 
Web page or “likes” on Facebook. It is critical for them to 
be effective and efﬁ cient in metric selection and measure-
ment so that the results of their efforts will help improve 
marketing communications toward meeting the company’s 
goals. 
 Figure  5.7 displays ﬁ ve general measurement areas, from 
awareness through innovation, along with sample metrics 
used in each area. For the purposes of measurement, see 
Patterson ( 2014 ). For ten online marketing metrics organiza-
tions need to be measuring, see DeMers ( 2014 ). The pyramid 
shape represents the fact that the number of consumers act-
ing at each level decreases at higher levels: e.g., (1) the most 
people will become aware of a Blendtec blender from the 
viral video, (2) fewer will post comments about it (brand 
health), (3) fewer still will engage more deeply with the 
brand by forwarding or using social bookmarking to tag the 
video (engagement), then (4) even fewer will visit the 
Blendtec site to read about their blenders and purchase one 
(action), and (5) the smallest number are loyal customers 
who post collaborative type comments that Blendtec can use 
to improve the product (innovation).
 We next provide some examples of metrics at each pyra-
mid level. Note that companies also use many of these met-
rics to monitor their competition. 
 Awareness/Exposure Metrics 
 The most accurate way to measure an increase in brand 
awareness is to conduct survey research using a representa-
tive sample from the company’s target market. However, this 
is very expensive and difﬁ cult to accomplish due to declin-
ing response rates on surveys, so organizations use many 
other proxy metrics to gain some measure of progress toward 
this awareness level goal. These metrics assume that if users 
access an organization’s Facebook page or other social media 
content, they will become aware of the product features 
discussed in an ad or on the pages:
5 Customer Engagement and Metrics

119
•  Unique visitors measures the number of visitors—with-
out repetition—who access a site, application, video, or 
other social media content within a speciﬁ c period of 
time. Unique visitors are measured by user registration, 
cookie ﬁ les, or by a third party measurement service such 
as Nielsen or comScore. Unique visitors additionally are 
categorized as either new or repeat visitors. Search 
engines also visit these sites, so companies must ﬁ lter out 
visits from automated “bots.” The number of views of 
each video on YouTube is posted under the video. 
•  Page views refer to single pages that are viewed on a 
social media site. For example, one unique visitor can 
view many different blog entries on one blog site. 
Obviously, the more pages users view, the longer they are 
on the site learning about the brand.  
•  Impressions refer to the number of times an ad loads on a 
user’s screen. This metric forms the bases of the CPM 
(cost per thousand impressions/views) pricing model.  
•  Number of searches measure the number of times users 
search for the brand, company, or associated key words 
selected by the organization while typing the key words in 
a search engine. 
•  Search engine ranking evaluates where the organization’s 
social media content appears in the search engine results 
pages for desired key words. For instance, if a user types 
in the name of the company, brands, or executives, ideally 
the links will appear in the ﬁ rst ten links/page one of the 
results page. 
•  Number of followers, registrations, or subscribers to 
the blog, social network page, video channel, or other 
content. These are also used to measure earned media 
engagement. 
 Brand Health Metrics 
 In this category, companies want to measure the inﬂ uence 
their communications have on consumers. Brand health 
refers to the amount of conversation and what proportion of 
the sentiment is positive or negative. It also measures the 
brand importance to consumers and whether or not this 
translates into purchases. Measures in this area include the 
following:
•  Share of voice (SOV) is the proportion of conversations 
about one brand versus its competitors. In the ofﬂ ine 
world, SOV measures the weight of advertising space in 
traditional media, but in social media, it usually is only 
measured by conversation. In a quantitative example, if 
your brand “appeared in the media 20 times in 2013 and 
there were 150 instances of total coverage among your 
company and its competitors, your quantitative share of 
voice would be 13.3 % (20/150 = 0.1333 × 100 = 13.3)” 
(Cramer  2014 ). Qualitative measures include the level of 
importance for the site that mentions a brand (e.g., CNN 
would score higher than an lesser-known local media sta-
tion). For more details, including a formula for calculat-
ing SOV, examples and charts, see  socialmediaexaminer.
com/metrics-to-track-your-social-media-efforts . 
•  Sentiment refers to the proportion of conversation about 
a brand that is positive, negative, or neutral, whereas 
SOV is simply about the number of conversations. On 
August 16, 2014, we typed “Nike” into the social media 
search box at  socialmention.com  and got the following 
results (number of mentions): positive (86), neutral 
(253) and negative (4). The site calculated brand 
strength at 55 % due to a 22:1 positive to negative con-

versation (sentiment). This site aggregates user gener-
ated content “across the universe.” It monitors over 100 
social media properties and SOV (see  socialmention.
com/about ). For six ways to measure social media see 
Bendror ( 2013 ).  
•  Brand inﬂ uence can include a number of other metrics, 
including number of inbound links to a social media prop-
erty, number of Twitter links that are retweeted, number 
of comments on posts, and number of times content is 
shared or linked (Jones  2011 ). 
 Engagement Metrics 
 There are many ways to engage social media users, as dis-
cussed in this chapter and Chap.   3  . Engagement metrics are 
endless, and the ones companies select depend on the spe-
ciﬁ c content, promotion, or other communication objec-
tives and tactics. Following are some of the most common 
measures relating to the engagement levels previously 
discussed:
•  Content viewership refers to the number of users who 
consume content, such as reading a blog (page views), 
watching videos or listening to podcasts, and download-
ing white papers. 
•  Tagging, bookmarking or “likes” for content that can be 
counted. 
•  Membership/follower metrics count the number of RSS 
subscribers, members in a community, such as a LinkedIn 
or Meetup.com group, or number of followers on Twitter. 
•  Number of shares measures how many times viral content 
is shared with others. 
•  Content creation counts the number of users who upload 
ads for a UGC contest, such as the Frito-Lay Super Bowl 
promotion. Companies can also measure the number of 
people who rate or review products, write comments on 
blogs or videos or retweet interesting or humorous tweets, 
and other content related items measured in previous 
categories. 
•  Virtual worlds: number of users visiting the company 
property, how long they stay, and whether or not they 
interact with the various features. 
•  Online games: number playing, length of time spent in 
the game, purchase of virtual properties and clicks on 
game links. 
 Action Metrics 
 Although engagement metrics demonstrate actions taken by 
users, this category takes it to a higher level of action:
•  Click through to an organization’s site. The proportion of 
all people who are exposed to a communication message 
and those who click to visit the site measures this.  
•  Contact form completion or  registration . This allows the 
company to add the person to their database of names, 
e-mail addresses, and more. 
•  Branded mobile apps: number of downloads, updates and 
number of actions that that are built into the app (such as 
“checking in” with a location-based app or earned media 
“shares”). 
•  QR codes: number of scans and other actions, such as 
sales, taken at the designated location. 
•  Event attendance: this can be online or ofﬂ ine, 
based on a social media promotion for a Webinar or other 
event. 
•  Purchase is the ultimate goal for social commerce. 
Companies measure conversion rates (proportion of all 
site visitors who purchase), number of purchases, average 
order value, and many other metrics that evaluate com-
munication effectiveness toward this goal. Note that, 
many other factors lead to purchase, such as product qual-
ity, price, and availability; however, social media com-
munication (especially discount promotions) can play an 
important role in motivating purchase.  
 Innovation Metrics 
 In this category, companies want to know if their social 
media communications are driving customers to comment 
and review in ways that help the company improve its prod-
ucts and services. Many of these metrics are also included in 
other categories, but we single innovation out because it is a 
very high level of brand engagement and builds customer 
loyalty. A few measures include:
•  Number of ideas shared in a company’s social media site 
(such as Dell’s IdeaStorm). 
•  Trend spotting helps companies know what is hot in their 
target markets. Google Trends displays “hot” search key 
words and allows users to search trends. Trendsmap 
tracks and displays real time Twitter trends worldwide, 
and many blogs and other sites provide word cloud dis-
plays of the most popular words in posts. Many other 
companies report social media trends. 
 Measurement Tools 
 Many companies offer excellent tools for measuring the previ-
ously mentioned and many other metrics. You can search 
Google images for “social media dashboards” and see many 
tools. Companies select from free Google analytics, other paid 
tools or use more sophisticated analytic dashboards that are 
continuously populated with metrics of choice. These tools 
help companies monitor progress toward objectives and tacti-
cal effectiveness, and help them catch negative conversations 
about their products as they occur, which is just as important. 
5 Customer Engagement and Metrics

121
 Perhaps the simplest free tool is Google Alerts. Anyone 
can use this tool by entering the topic for monitoring and 
which sources (video, blogs, news, or discussions) and 
Google will send e-mails based on the selected criteria at the 
requested frequency (real time, daily, weekly). Companies 
monitor their names, brand names, executive names, and tag 
lines or slogans in advertising campaigns. Google also pro-
vides free website or blog analytics to measure the aware-
ness metrics, such as page views and action level 
click-throughs. When companies advertise on Facebook, 
they get metrics about number of impressions and clicks, and 
more. Many social media sites provide various measures so 
that organizations can track their users. 
 Beyond that are complex dashboards, such as those pro-
vided for a fee by  sdl.com (formerly Alterian),  sysomos.
com , Radian6 ( salesforcemarketingcloud.com ),  trackur.
com , and many more. To view many dashboards, simply 
type “social media dashboard” into a Google image search. 
Figure  5.8 displays a social media dashboard created by 
Radian6 (now owned by Salesforce.com) for monitoring 
social media. The pie chart and graph below display conver-
sation sizes in various segments over time. The top right box 
shows tweets about the conference, listed in chronological 
order, and the bottom right dashboard is a word cloud, dem-
onstrating the most mentioned terms in the largest font size. 
Conference planners will be watching the social media con-
versation on this dashboard as it develops.
 For more information on social media metrics, see 
Altimeter’s 2011 white paper (written by Susan Etlinger):  A 
Framework for Social Analytics (available at  webtrends.
com/files/report/Report-AFrameworkForSocial
Analytics- Altimeter.pdf , and viewed as a SlideShare pre-
sentation at  slideshare.net/setlinger/altimeter-social-ana-
lytics081011ﬁ nal ). Incidentally, as of mid-August, 2014, the 
SlideShare presentation has received 131,460 views (over 
91,000 on SlideShare), over 10,000 downloads, and 18 com-
ments: a metrics company monitoring itself. 
 The role that metrics play in social media strategy is cov-
ered in Chap.   10 , especially in Sect.   10.5 . 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  Describe the ﬁ ve levels of user engagement (5 Cs). 
The least engaged Internet users  consume online content 
by reading blogs and other text, watching videos and

5.7 Summary

looking at photos, and listening to podcasts. At the next 
level, users  connect  with others by creating social net-
work proﬁ les, joining sites of interest, and attending 
online events. Consumers who  collect  information ﬁ lter 
content (e.g., via RSS feeds) and tagging content on 
blogs or Twitter, “liking” (e.g., on Facebook), or book-
marking what they ﬁ nd valuable on social media sites. 
 Creators actually write or upload original multimedia 
content to websites, such as posting videos on YouTube 
or music and podcasts on iTunes. The most engaged cus-
tomers  collaborate with the company when they work 
with others and discuss ways to improve products (e.g., 
Dell’s IdeaStorm site).  
 2.  Describe several important techniques for engaging 
users in social media. Companies attempt to use viral 
marketing through viral videos and viral blogging. They 
also provide space for consumer created ratings, 
reviews, testimonials and conversations via chat, e-mail, 
tweets, blogs, and more. Social recommendations and 
referrals happen via social bookmarking, referral pro-
grams, and other innovative methods. Companies also 
seek expert ratings and reviews and sponsored (paid-
for) reviews from bloggers and others. Finally, quick 
reference (QR) codes provide ofﬂ ine to online engage-
ment. They entice engagement by providing quality 
information, creating entertaining content, offering 
competitions, appealing to altruistic values, making 
exclusive offers, rewarding inﬂ uentials and fans, and 
incentivizing group behavior.  
 3.  Express the role of trust in social commerce. Consumers 
trust other consumer opinions online 65 % of the time and 
only 43 % trust the company CEO, according to Edelman. 
Social media takes traditional word-of-mouth communi-
cation to a much higher level because people trust prod-
uct reviews and recommendations from others like 
themselves much more than they trust company adver-
tisements and other communications. Additionally, a 
company’s reputation is built on trust and when that falls, 
so do sales. 
 4.  Provide examples of collaborative content creation by 
consumers. Collaborative content creation uses crowd-
sourcing to gain market research about the behaviors and 
preferences of its markets for improving products and 
marketing communication. Examples: LEGO virtual 
design uploads, wikis, self-publishing content with online 
booksellers and UGC for advertising creation (e.g., Frito- 
Lay “Crash the Super Bowl” contest). 
 5.  Describe how a company can build, maintain, moni-
tor, and repair its reputation in social media. Quality, 
transparency and trust principally inﬂ uence company, 
brand, executive, recruiter, salesperson, and other 
employee reputations. A company must be true to its 
brand promises and be authentic in social media. The 
reputation management process involves building via its 
actions and online content, maintaining its reputation by 
monitoring and sometimes participating in online and 
ofﬂ ine conversations and repairing the reputation when 
things go wrong. Finally, the best companies learn from 
criticism expressed in social media and use this informa-
tion to improve operations and marketing. Reputation 
management systems can help social media keep users 
honest, positive, and authentic. Finally, companies spread 
positive content all over the Web and use SEO to increase 
visibility on the ﬁ rst page of a keyword SERP. 
 6.  SEO. This is the process of improving the visibility of a 
company or a brand on the results page displayed by a 
search engine. Search engines rank sites on search 
engine results pages (SERP) using complicated algo-
rithms partially based on user-inputted key words 
because the search engines want to present results that 
are relevant to users. To improve a site’s SEO, managers 
(1) spread fresh content all over the Web, (2) be sure 
their sites are relevant and popular with target markets, 
(3) optimize content on Web pages and in social media, 
and (4) monitor Google for changes in the algorithm 
(this is the way Google decides which sites are highest 
on results pages).  
 7.  Deﬁ ne performance metrics used to monitor, measure, 
and reﬁ ne social commerce goals and tactics. There are 
hundreds of possible performance metrics; therefore, it is 
important to select some that are easily measured on a con-
tinuous basis, and that apply directly to the organization's 
social commerce communication objectives and reﬁ ne 
tactics. They fall into these basic categories: Awareness/
exposure metrics (unique visitors, page views, impres-
sions, number of searches, search engine ranking and 
number of followers/registrations/subscribers to a social 
media site). Brand Health metrics include share of voice 
(SOV), sentiment, brand inﬂ uence, and more. Engagement 
metrics include content viewership tagging, bookmark-
ing, membership/follower, number of shares, and content 
creation. Action metrics include click throughs, contact 
form completion/registration, event attendance, and pur-
chase. Finally, innovation metrics include number of ideas 
shared and trend spotting measures.

ten links in the SERP and see how his/her reputation is 
online. Make recommendations for improving it, using 
SEO and other techniques discussed in this chapter. 
 3.  Create an account at  delicious.com . Tag an article you 
like online and then follow the links to others who have 
also tagged it, seeing what else they have tagged. Write a 
report about your ﬁ ndings. 
 4.  Enter  usocial.com and  softcity.com . Identify all the 
methods/tools they offer to increase social engagement/
marketing communication. Write a report. 
 5.  Imagine you are planning a vacation to Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil. Visit  tripadvisor.com and search for hotels on 
Copacabana beach. Examine the reviews of ﬁ ve hotels 
that seem right for you. Do you trust all of these review-
ers? Why or why not? Based on the reviews, which hotel 
would you select, and why?  
 6.  Check out your personal reputation online by searching

 OPENING CASE: GROUPON—WILL 
THE COMPANY PROSPER? 
 The name Groupon is a combination of  group and  coupon . 
Groupon was founded in November 2008 and it was consid-
ered the fastest-growing company ever in Web history (in 
terms of revenue and valuation). Initially, Groupon offered 
both  group buying and  deal of the day (one highly discounted 
deal per day) models in selected metro areas in the United 
States 
( businessinsider.com/companies-revolutionizing-
retail-2014-3 ). As of December 2014, Groupon does busi-
ness in over 500 markets worldwide, in 48 countries. 
According to Groupon’s Q3 2014 ﬁ nancial report, the num-
ber of customers that have purchased a Groupon deal within 
the last 12 months grew by 24 % year-over-year, to 52.7 mil-
lion as of September 2014, with about 23.5 million in North 
America, 14.9 million in EMEA, and 14.3 million in the rest 
of the world. Mobile app downloads have increased in Q3 
2014, which has been facilitated by recent initiatives taken 
on their mobile platform. As of Q3 2014, worldwide transac-
tions on mobile devices comprised over half of Groupon’s 

128
business and over 100 million people have downloaded 
Groupon’s mobile app. Experts predict that mobile will fuel 
growth for the company in the future (see  forbes.com/sites/
greatspeculations/2014/11/05/groupons-solid-third-
quarter-results-drive-stock-price- higher  ). For Groupon 
statistics and facts, see  statista.com/topics/824/groupon. 
 The Opportunity 
 Groupon is a start-up that offers special highly discounted 
deals, mostly via e-mail. The idea is that when subscribers 
hear about a big discount, they will forward the news to 
friends who may also place an order (the ‘social’ element). 
Initially, in order to receive the deal, there had to be a mini-
mum number of buyers (“tipping point”), thus creating a 
group buy. However, this model has been changed, as will be 
described next. 
 The Solution 
 To exploit the chance that people are likely to spread news 
about bargains to their friends on social networks, Groupon 
developed a unique business model. 
 The Business Model and the Strategy 
 According to Groupon ( groupon.com ), the company, as an 
intermediary, offers special sales, called “Groupons,” in each 
city that the company serves. 
 The sales are offered usually by well-known merchants. 
The advertised deal lasts for a limited time (usually between 
24 and 72 h) and becomes available to all registered mem-
bers. According to Groupon’s customer service department, 
in the past, Groupon’s policy was to guarantee participating 
merchants a certain number of sales. In other words, the cus-
tomer would only get the discount if enough people (hence, 
the “group” element) purchased that particular Groupon. If 
Groupon did not meet that promised quota, there was no 
need for the seller to honor the deal, nor was any commission 
paid to Groupon, and the customer was not charged. 
 Groupon charges advertising and promotion fees, which is 
usually a percentage of the revenue generated by the sellers. 
The retailers can use the system to promote their business, 
gain new customers, and run sales during their slow seasons 
(e.g., such as liquidation during the late summer). The initial 
process, a combination of  group buys  and  daily deals , is illus-
trated in Fig.  6.1 . Today, Groupon is basically a ﬂ ash (daily or 
longer) discount deal business and an operator of a market-
place. The reason merchants are willing to offer a 50–90 %

discount to volume shoppers is that the merchants’ marketing 
and overhead costs are lower, while their market share 
increases due to the attraction of new customers.
  Groupon’s business strategy is to work with quality mer-
chants who are willing to provide substantial discounts. 
Groupon uses both traditional e-mail and social networking 
(e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.) to promote the deals. 
Deals are e-mailed directly to members when available, but 
those interested in other products or services can go to 
Groupon Goods ( groupon.com/goods ) to search for some-
thing speciﬁ c. Groupon also offers a goods “clearance” sec-
tion; the offers change daily. In addition to their daily deals, 
Groupon also offers coupons and promotions each month 
(e.g., Cyber Monday Mania). Groupon offers a “refer a friend” 
program, where shoppers can earn $10 for every friend they 
refer who buys their ﬁ rst deal (see  groupon.com/referral ). 
Note that Groupon changes its business model from time to 
time. In addition, it provides services to the merchants that 
simplify the process illustrated in Fig.  6.1 . For example, in 
May 2014, Groupon launched ‘Gnome’—a tablet solution that 
helps merchants manage their business and connect with cus-
tomers (for details, see  investor.groupon.com/releasedetail.
cfm?releaseid=848707 ). In October 2014, the company 
launched “Snap” by Groupon, a free mobile app that pays cus-
tomers cash to buy featured grocery items (see  investor.grou-
pon.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=874306 ).  
 Beneﬁ ts and Expansion 
 The major beneﬁ ts to customers are: 
 The major beneﬁ ts to merchants are: 
 Limitations of the Model 
 Some of Groupon’s deals can become too large for vendors 
to ﬁ ll. In one example, according to Crum ( 2011 ), a restau-
rant in Tokyo sold 500 Groupons for a traditional New Year’s 
dinner, but the business was unable to process the orders in a 
timely fashion due to the overwhelming demand. Customers 
complained about late deliveries and about orders arriving 
“in terrible condition.” A similar problem occurred in India 
when a high demand for onions caused the Groupon website 
to crash (see AOL On News  2013 ). 
 In response to such a problem, Groupon ofﬁ cials have 
created formulas to help participating merchants determine 
how to meet consumer demands, and how many Groupons to 
offer (capping the orders to a reasonable number). 
 Another limitation is that some businesses may not make 
money on the deal and may possibly even suffer a loss (e.g., 
see Phibbs  2011 ). Finally, although Groupon and similar 
companies can generate large revenues, they may have large 
expenses as a result, and actually lose money by offering 
more deals. Thus, many question the proﬁ tability of the 
model, especially in light of the strong competition. 
 Groupon is attempting to become more than just a “deal 
of the day” business. As part of their branching out, in 
November 2013, Groupon built a new website and opened an 
e-commerce deal “marketplace” (online retail site), called 
Groupon Goods ( groupon.com/goods ), which also offers 
discounts on various products and services (e.g., beauty, 
automotive, pet grooming). These deals also have a time 
limit (ranging from 3 to 7 days) and limited quantities. In Q2 
2013, less than 40 % of Groupon’s North America revenue 
came from the company’s daily deal e-mails, suggesting the 
marketplace store (with over 60 % of revenue) is becoming 
successful 
(see 
 usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/11/01/
groupon- new-website-marketplace/3319943 ). 
However, 
as of 2014, the company is still in transition. 
 The Deal Marketplace is Groupon’s shift in strategy from 
providing one-off “daily deals” to offering longer-running, 
recurring campaigns. With the launch of the marketplace, 
local businesses now can offer discounts on their goods and 
services for an extended period of time. 
 In 2011, Groupon partnered with  expedia.com to launch 
Groupon 
Getaways 
( groupon.com/getaways ), 
which 
focuses on discounted travel (hotels, tours, etc.). In February 
2014, Groupon created “Deal Builder,” a program that allows 
merchants to build their own Groupon deal. The program is 
a part of GrouponWorks. 
 In September 2012, Groupon acquired a company called 
Savored ( savored.com ), a leading provider of reservations at 
the best restaurants in the US. Participating restaurants in select 
cities give diners discounts when they have empty tables. 
Unlike the usual daily deal where you buy a voucher, with 
Groupon Reserve, you make a reservation online and show up; 
•  Steep discounts (50–90 %). 
•  Discovery of new/specialized services and products.  
•  No need to search for deals; Groupon organizes them 
for you.  
•  Can sell larger quantities and liquidate merchan-
dise, quickly. 
•  Save on advertising and marketing expenses (e.g., 
by using viral advertising).  
•  Get repeat customers (if they like the deal and the 
service, customers will return). 
•  Lower customer acquisition cost. 
•  Knowledge of, and collaboration with, related ven-
dors in a close geographical area.

the restaurant will already have your reservation in their books. 
Customers can make a reservation after they purchase the deal 
via the Groupon site or via the Groupon mobile app. Groupon 
Reserve is available for select high end restaurants.  
 The Competition 
 There are many companies that are attempting to clone 
Groupon. Hundreds of Groupon clones exist (between 400 
and 600 worldwide, as of 2011, depending on the source), 
and that number is growing. In addition, software develop-
ment companies offer Groupon-clone platforms (groupon- 
clone scripts), such as Oorjit and Agryia. For example, at one 
time, there were over 1,000 similar companies in China 
alone, but many did not succeed. (For more about the top ten 
daily deal sites in China in 2013, see   thenextweb.com/
asia/2013/02/18/chinas-daily-deal-market-consolidates- as-
top-10-sites-claim-90-revenue-share-report  .) Nevertheless, 
as of December 2014, Groupon had many competitors, 
including  livingsocial.com , sponsored by Amazon.com. 
Other notable competitors are  giltcity.com , Gilt Groupe 
( gilt.com ), 
 local.amazon.com , 
and 
 tiprr.com . 
For 
Groupon’s top ﬁ ve competitors, see  brandongaille.com/
the-top-5-groupon-competitors . 
Indirect 
competition 
comes from Yipit ( yipit.com ), an e-mail-based “daily deal 
aggregator” that gathers deals (in your city) from daily deal 
sites such as Groupon. Tell Yipit what you want, and they 
will alert you when there are deals that match. 
 Possible future competitors include Yahoo!, Yelp, local 
restaurants offer big discounts, and other service providers 
that advertise special deals digitally and in newspapers. 
Finally, some major retailers and manufacturers (e.g., 
Walmart, Home Depot) offer daily deals independently. 
 In November 2014, Twitter joined the list of Groupon 
competitors by introducing an online coupon system called 
Twitter Offers. The new tool is allows merchants to use the 
platform to advertise their goods and offer discounts to their 
customers. For more details, see  valuewalk.com/2014/11/
groupon-competitors- grows-twitter . For more details 
about Twitter Offers, see also  blog.twitter.com/2014/
introducing-twitter-offers . 
 In 2011, online retail giant Amazon.com jumped on the 
daily deals “bandwagon” with the launch of Amazon Local, 
a local daily deals website that offers savings on products 
and services (for a limited time in limited quantities). To 
learn more about Amazon Local, go to  local.amazon.com . 
Amazon itself offers deals on its main Web page. Amazon 
also has “Gold Box Deals,” which are viewed by clicking on 
the “Today’s Deals” link at the top of most Amazon.com 
pages or directly at  amazon.com/gp/goldbox . 
 Factors in the Competition 
 It is challenging to compete with Groupon, given its large 
size and resources. Groupon still controls more than 50 % of 
all daily deal markets in the U.S. Therefore, competitors use 
strategies such as concentrating on a niche market, which 
targets consumers in smaller demographics, such as one 
product, or one industry (e.g., tickets for travel [ jetsetter.
com ; for the military and veteran community at  troopswap.
com ]; free software [ giveawayoftheday.com ]; food [ ddfo-
odoutlet.com ]; and fashion [ polyvore.com ]). In addition, 
some sites concentrate on a small territory (e.g., a particular 
[city) where they have a competitive advantage (e.g., see 
Hot Deals Hawaii [ hotdealshawaii.com ]). Similarly, deals 
for certain social or professional communities are getting 
popular, deal sites geared toward mothers and families 
( plumdistrict.com , deal sites geared towards men ( man-
deals.com ), religion- based deals ( jdeal.com ), and dog 
lovers ( doggyloot.com ), may be very successful. For more 
about niche daily deal sites, see   business.time.com/
2012/02/09/a-deal-just-for-you-niche-sites-with- deals-
for-moms-dudes-jews-dog-lovers-the-military- more   . 
 Several sites have either folded (e.g., Facebook Deals) or 
were acquired by other companies. For example, BuyWithMe 
was purchased by Gilt Groupe, Buy.com was purchased by 
Japanese company Rakuten.com Shopping ( rakuten.com ), 
and private travel site  jetsetter.com was acquired by 
TripAdvisor in 2013. As of December 2014, Groupon has 
acquired 34 sites, including the hotel booking app Blink 
( blinkbooking.com ), which is now known as “Blink by 
Groupon.” In January 2014, Groupon announced that it had 
has acquired ‘Ticket Monster,’ a Korean e-commerce com-
pany (a subsidiary of LivingSocial Korea) and online retail 
daily deal site Ideel ( ideel.com ). 
 The Results 
 In 2010, Groupon rejected a $6 billion buyout offer from 
Google. Instead, the company went public on November 
4, 2011, raising $700 million. Share prices soared 31 % 
the ﬁ rst day, bringing Groupon’s valuation to about $16 
billion. Since then, the share price has declined due to 
concerns about proﬁ tability. Groupon lost money until the 
ﬁ rst quarter of 2013, and in May 2014, share prices were 
down 40 %. The share price slowly began recovering in 
late 2014.

6.1 
 DEFINITIONS, DRIVERS, CONCEPTS, 
AND BENEFITS OF SOCIAL 
SHOPPING 
 Social shopping has grown very rapidly and may become a 
major portion of B2C sales in the future. According to Regus 
( 2011 ), in 2010 about 53 % of companies located in countries 
with heavy Internet use were using social networks to acquire 
goods and increase sales. Today, the number is higher (see 
Stelzner  2014 ), especially due to the new features such as 
“Buy” buttons, introduced by Facebook and Twitter. For how 
to create a Facebook store, watch the video “How to Create a 
Facebook Store Even If You Are a Beginner” (3:23 minutes) 
at  youtube.com/watch?v=UWRNVzXXYIM . 
 This increase in sales is also due to the new innovative 
online social shopping opportunities and models. Let us see 
how social shopping is done. First, you need a webstore (or 
use someone else’s webstore). For example, companies that 
provide the technology to set up a Facebook store include 
Ecwid, which provides a free Facebook e-commerce app (see 
 ecwid.com/facebook-commerce ), and PinnacleCart ( pin-
naclecart.com/sell-on-facebook ). Then you start selling. 
 Deﬁ nitions 
 Shopping can be viewed as a social activity.  Social shopping 
(also known as S ales 2.0 ) is online shopping with social 
media tools and platforms and sharing shopping experiences 
with friends. It is a growing activity in social commerce. 
Social commerce blends e-commerce and social media. 
Thus, social commerce takes the key features of social media 
(e.g., discussion groups, blogs, reviews, etc.) and uses them 
before, during, and after online shopping. According to 
Popilskis ( 2014 ), social shopping is facilitated by companies 
having the capability to sell products using social media plat-
forms (e.g., by creating a storefront on their Facebook page), 
without requiring the customers to leave the social network 
to complete the transaction. Note that social shopping is only 
one activity of social commerce. For the differences between 
social shopping and social commerce, see  personalweb.
about.com/od/socialcommerce/a/Social-Shopping- 
Deﬁ nition.htm . 
 The Drivers of Social Shopping 
 An overview of selling on social networks is provided by 
Shih ( 2011 ) and by Singh and Diamond ( 2012 ), who cite the 
following drivers of social shopping: 
 For more on social shopping, see   webtrends.about.com/
od/web20/a/social-shopping.htm  and  dbpedia.org/page/
Social_commerce . For an infographic, see Kimball ( 2013 ). 
Note: A considerable amount of information on social shop-
ping is available by searching Google for ‘social media mar-
keting’ (also see Halligan and Shah ( 2014 ). 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 Groupon’s initial business model included  group buy-
ing , which is a social activity. Later, it changed this 
model, concentrating instead on daily deals. In the 
daily deals model, we can see how WOM is spreading 
via social networks, such as notifying friends about 
Groupon’s deals (e.g., sharing on Facebook and 
Twitter). Group buying is a powerful social shopping 
model, but it is difﬁ cult to implement. This chapter 
presents group buying and deal of the day social shop-
ping models as well as several others. This chapter also 
covers social-oriented shopping aids and provides a 
glimpse into the future of social shopping. 
•  The large number of people visiting social networks 
attracts advertisers. 
•  Changing customers’ shopping habits (see info-
graphic at  visual.ly/social-media-changing-way-
your-customers-show-online ). 
•  The increasing number of recommendations/sug-
gestions made by friends, and the ease and speed of 
accessing them. 
•  The pressure from top management to increase 
effectiveness and efforts to improve overall efﬁ -
ciency of marketing in general. 
•  The need to compete (e.g., by differentiation) and to 
satisfy the social customers. 
•  The emergence of social customers with knowledge 
and competence in using the Internet (e.g., in ﬁ nd-
ing reviews and comparing prices). 
•  The need to collaborate with business partners. 
•  The huge discounts provided by some of the newer 
business models (e.g., ﬂ ash sales), causing custom-
ers to buy more goods/services.  
•  The socially-oriented shopping models (e.g., group 
buying, communities).  
•  The ease of shopping while you are using social 
networks (e, g., the Facebook ‘Buy’ button). 
•  The ease of communicating with friends in real 
time using Twitter and mobile devices. 
6.1 Deﬁ nitions, Drivers, Concepts, and Beneﬁ ts of Social Shopping

132
 Concepts and Content of Social Shopping 
 Social shopping is done through social networks (e.g., 
Polyvore, Wanelo), in vendors’ socially oriented webstores 
(e.g., Greenberg et al.  2011 ), in special intermediaries’ 
stores (such as Groupon.com), and more. The buyers are 
 social customers  who trust and/or enjoy social shopping. As 
will be seen later in this chapter, there is a wide range of 
social shopping models that utilize many of the Web 2.0 
tools as well as social communities. Finally, an increasing 
number of B2C marketers offer stores on Facebook and 
other 
social 
networks 
(see 
e.g., 
 heidicohen.com/
b2c-versus-b2b-the-most-important-social-media- 
platform- research  ). 
 The nature of shopping is changing, especially for brand 
name clothing and related items. For example, popular 
brands including the Gap are sold by e-tailers such as 
Shopbop and InStyle. In addition, fashion communities 
such as Stylehive and Polyvore help promote the latest fash-
ion collections. Social shoppers are logging on to sites such 
as Net-a- Porter to buy designer clothes online. Shoppers 
can log on to sites such as ThisNext, to create proﬁ les and 
blog about their favorite brands. For practical issues and 
guides to social shopping, see   digitalintelligencetoday.
com/social-shopping-101-a-practitioners-prime  . 
 Where Is Social Shopping Done? 
 Most of social shopping today is done in public networks 
and communities, ranging from Polyvore to Kaboodle. 
Shoppers can also engage in social shopping through private 
social 
clubs 
and 
socially-oriented 
vendors’ 
stores. 
Furthermore, social shoppers can buy from individual sellers 
and directly from manufacturers. For 35 companies that are 
changing the way we shop and eat, see 35 slides by Lutz and 
Peterson ( 2014 ). 
 There are two basic ways to engage in social shopping:
 1.  Add social software, apps, and features (e.g., polling) to 
existing e-commerce sites. 
 2.  Add e-commerce functionalities (e.g., e-catalogs, pay-
ment gateways, shopping carts) to social media and social 
network sites. 
 Major retailers such as Target and Best Buy are increas-
ingly looking to tap Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter to drive 
sales (see Lee  2013 ).

 For ﬁ nding the right social media platform to drive most 
sales, see Shopify.com’s infographic provided by Macdonald 
( 2014 ). 
 Why Shoppers Go Social 
 Many shoppers like to hear from other shoppers prior to pur-
chasing. Therefore, they ask for recommendations from 
friends, or use the communal shopping method. 
 Communal shopping (also known as  collaborative shop-
ping ) is a method of shopping where consumers enlist friends 
and other people they trust to advise them on what products to 
shop for. This results in more conﬁ dence in the decisions they 
make—whether or not to buy (a phenomenon known as the 
“bandwagon effect”). For details, watch Bloomberg TV’s 
video titled “New Frontiers in the Communal Shopping 
Experience” (2:58 minutes) at  bloomberg.com/video/eden-s- 
communal-shopping-experience- ExvmRAIhTE2AZ
apKKd5aVA.html .  
 People’s Roles in Social Commerce 
 In 2010, Gartner Inc. conducted a study on social commerce 
(see  gartner.com/newsroom/id/1409213 ), identifying the 
following roles people play in social media and 
e-commerce: 
 The major inﬂ uencers are friends, other consumers, sales-
people, connectors, and mavens (experts). For further details, 
see Dubey ( 2010 ). In addition to roles, personality traits such 
as ‘feeling’ and ‘thinking’ may inﬂ uence shopping. 
•  Connectors. These are the people with contacts 
that introduce people to each other. Connectors try 
to inﬂ uence people to buy. Consultants and con-
nected people play this role.  
•  Salespeople. Like their ofﬂ ine counterparts, sales-
people’s major effort is to inﬂ uence shoppers to buy. 
They are well connected so they can impress buyers. 
•  Seekers. These consumers seek advice and infor-
mation about shopping and services from experts, 
friends, and mavens. 
•  Mavens. Mavens are recognized, but unofﬁ cial, 
experts in certain domains who can provide positive 
or negative recommendations to people who are 
seeking advice. 
•  Self-sufﬁ cients. These people ﬁ nd information on 
their own; they do not need or even pay attention to 
recommendations, and are not inﬂ uenced by the 
opinions of others.  
•  Unclassiﬁ eds.  Most people do not belong to any one 
of the above categories; some fulﬁ ll different roles and 
others exhibit characteristics of different categories.  
6 Social Shopping: Concepts, Beneﬁ ts, and Models

133
 The Beneﬁ ts of Social Shopping 
 Social shopping inﬂ uences both buyers and sellers. 
 Beneﬁ ts to Buyers 
 Social shopping can provide beneﬁ ts to buyers such as: 
 Kasteler ( 2009 ) elaborates on these and other beneﬁ ts and 
provides a list of several dozen start-up shopping sites. For 
an overview and infographic, see   guerillaconnection.com/
wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Guerilla-Social-Media- 
Trends.pdf  . 
 Therefore, before you go shopping online, it is wise to 
consult social shopping sources. In addition, visit socially- 
oriented sites where you can ask questions and get feedback 
from your friends.  
 Beneﬁ ts to Sellers 
 The seller can: 
 Note that social shopping sites may generate additional 
revenue from advertising, commission on actual sales, shar-
ing customer information with retailers, and using afﬁ liate 
marketing.

 COMPONENTS AND MODELS 
OF SOCIAL SHOPPING 
 Social commerce features a unique set of components. It 
also employs distinctive business models. All these are 
described next. 
 What Components to Expect in a Social 
Shopping Site 
 Depending on the social shopping model, the product offer-
ing, related information, and the supportive information sys-
tems, one may ﬁ nd a diversity of components on a social 
shopping site. The following are the major components that 
help customers make purchasing decisions: 
•  Get super deals (50–90 % discounts) via group buy-
ing, daily specials, and more. Join Groupon for 
daily deals. 
•  Socialize while shopping and receive social support 
and rewards. 
•  Discover products/services you never knew existed 
(e.g., see  thisnext.com ). 
•  Interact directly with vendor (brand) representa-
tives easily and quickly (e.g., feature available at 
 stylehive.com ). 
•  Increase conﬁ dence and trust in online shopping by 
interacting with friends. 
•  Shop anytime from any place. 
•  Exchange shopping tips with friends, fans, and 
 others. Therefore, you can learn from other shop-
pers’ experiences. 
•  Build and share wish and gift lists. 
•  Shop together with people like you. 
•  Get simpliﬁ ed comparisons, even in real time. 
•  Communicate in real time while shopping with friends 
and others using Twitter and other social media tools. 
•  Improve overall sales unit productivity (e.g., see 
Smith and Ballve  2013 ). 
•  Increase revenue growth per customer. 
•  Gain feedback from new customers. 
•  Visual Sharing. Photos, videos, and other images 
enable shoppers to visually share their product 
experiences. 
•  Online discussions. Ratings, reviews, interactions, 
recommendations, blogging, and comments facili-
tate discussions regarding features and beneﬁ ts of 
products. 
•  How to use products. These demonstrate, via vid-
eos, blogs, and step-by-step instructions, how to use 
products. 
•  Guides. Guides are created by user-generated con-
tent (UGC). The users can be experienced consum-
ers, experts, or employees. The guides are supported 
by case studies, testimonials, and videos.  
•  Learn from customers. 
•  Increase customer loyalty and trust. 
•  Quickly 
liquidate 
overstocked 
or 
obsolete 
merchandise. 
6.2 Components and Models of Social Shopping

134
 The Major Social Shopping Models 
 Several social shopping models and strategies have appeared 
in recent years, many created by start-ups such as Groupon. 
Some are extensions of EC generic models; others are unique 
to social shopping. These models can be stand alone, com-
bined, or used within social networks. We have grouped 
them into the following categories, followed by the location 
where they are further discussed in this book. The grouping 
is based on Yin ( 2010 ), Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ), and the 
authors’ experiences: 
 Note: Both Pinterest and Twitter provide activities that 
use several of these models, directly and indirectly. For 
Twitter, see  business.twitter.com . Note also that public 
social shopping sites may generate revenue from advertising, 
commissions on actual sales, shared customer information 
among retailers, and afﬁ liate marketing. 
 The major models are illustrated in Fig.  6.2 .

sentation on transforming retail into social commerce at

commerce- retail-ceo-brieﬁ ng-strategy-boutique-thaesis . 
See also Shih ( 2011 ). 
 Traditional E-Commerce Sites 
with Social Media Additions 
 In addition to pure social shopping sites, there are many tra-
ditional e-commerce sites that add social media capabilities. 
An example from Germany is presented next. 
 Example: Nestlé Interactive Social Commerce Site 
 The global food and beverage manufacturer launched an 
interactive online social commerce platform in Germany in 
September 2011 to engage with consumers while providing 
greater access to its products ( nestle.com/media/newsand-
features/nestle-marks-largest-ever-investment- 
germany ). 
The 
 Nestlé 
Marketplace 
(“Marktplatz”; 
 nestle-marktplatz.de ) website, according to  fdbusiness.
com/2011/09/nestle-pilots-social-commerce-with-new-
interactive-site , is the ﬁ rst social commerce platform of its 
kind in Germany, from a food and beverage manufacturer of 
Nestlé’s size and range. Consumers can purchase products 
online (including foreign Nestlé products that are not avail-
able in most of Nestlé’s physical stores or the physical stores 
of retailers who sell Nestle’s products) and also review, rate, 
recommend, and ask questions about each product. The site 
supports two-way communication. According to  fdbusiness.
com/2011/09/nestle-pilots-social-commerce-with-new-
interactive-site , people can leave ratings and comments 
about the products. Shoppers can submit suggestions for new 
products on the site. With more than 2,000 products and 75 
different brands available online (February 2014), Nestlé 
Germany receives an estimated 6,247 unique visitors and 
31,235 page views per day (per  whoismachine.com/review/
nestle-marktplatz.de ; November 2014 data). 
 The company wants to enable its customers to engage and 
help Nestlé Marketplace to prosper. 
 Visitors to the Nestlé Marketplace can search for products 
using a variety of detailed criteria, including taste, packaging, 
color, speciﬁ c occasions, or diet preferences. Nutritional infor-
mation can also be found for each product.  Nestle- marktplatz.

stars’) use social media platforms to stay ahead of the com-
petition. For an interesting e-book about the social sales 
revolution, see Salesforce ( 2011 ). 
6.3 
 GROUP BUYING AND DEAL 
PURCHASING 
 The group buying model describes a group of people who 
come together to get a  quantity discount . The B2C model was 
unpopular in traditional e-commerce and seldom used in many 
countries. An exception is a modiﬁ ed group buying method 
that succeeded in China. The problem with the original e-com-
merce model was the difﬁ culty in organizing the online 
groups, even with an intermediary. Furthermore, even if a 
group was organized, negotiating discounts was often difﬁ -
cult, unless a very large volume was involved. However, in the 
new model, in order to rally shoppers, sites like Groupon, 
LivingSocial, and GiltCity (which acquired BuyWithMe), 
offer large discounts or special offers that are available for a 
limited time (usually 24–72 h). The social commerce compa-
nies act as intermediaries to carefully negotiate the discounts 
and other terms with vendors. According to Harbison ( 2010 ), 
social media and group buying is a “match made in heaven,” 
since everybody is a winner. For a discussion, see Dugan 
( 2010 ). Unfortunately, the model is still not so popular in the 
U.S. and many other countries. 
 Note: This situation may be changing; see Mander ( 2014 ) 
and discussion later in this chapter. 
 Customers post daily deals with comments on Facebook 
and Twitter and other social media sites. This is a good way 
to ﬁ nd deals without joining any speciﬁ c daily deals sites. 
 Group Buying in China 
 The Chinese created group buying for many products, espe-
cially expensive ones (e.g., cars, computers, artwork) even 
before sites like Groupon existed. Group buying in China 
(“tuangou” in Chinese) differs from that of other countries due 
to the Chinese culture. Group buying companies have been 
active all over China. For example, the giant e- commerce com-
pany, Baidu, entered into this business in August 2013 by pur-
chasing a 59 % stake in Nuomi (Renren’s group- buying site), 
and in 2014, agreed to purchase the remaining stock (see 
Campos  2014 ). However, according to the research group China 
e-Business Research Center, in 2012, half of the group buying 
sites have shut down (see  pcworld.com/article/260892/
nearly_half_of_chinas_group_buying_sites_now_closed_
amid_heated_competition.html ). According to a report by 
news portal   Xkb.com.cn  , in 2010, at the peak of the group-
buying craze, 5,058 such websites were in the market, but in 
August 2013, there were only 943. A main reason for this is lack 
of funding. For more information on the status of group buying 
websites in China, see  bambooinnovator.com/2013/08/13/
group-buying-websites-in-china-face-funding-crisis . 
 In Q1 2013, the largest in market shares was Juhuasuan 
( ju.taobao.com ; per 2013 research report by Dataotuan, as 
reported by Techinasia; see  techinasia.com/china-daily- 
deals-q1-2013-data ); however, as of January 2014, the top 
daily deals startup is now Meituan, earning almost $500 mil-
lion in sales annually, roughly double to what it was earning 
in 2013, and their competitor, Lashou, is valued at $1.1 billion 
(see Campos  2014 ). Group buying soared in China between 
2010 and 2013. About 83 million people in China used group 
buying sites in January 2013, up from just 64 million at the 
end of 2011, according to the China Internet Network 
Information Center. In 2014, all major Chinese Internet com-
panies have launched, or planned to launch, group buying 
and ﬂ ash deal sites. These include Baidu, Sina, Tencent, and 
Alibaba. For details, see Madden ( 2010 ) and watch the 
video titled “Group Buying in China” (2:10 minutes) at 
 cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2011/01/26/yoon.
china.coupon.gen.cnn.html . Note that, in 2014, China’s 
cosmetics deal site Jumei was the ﬁ rst Chinese daily deals 
site to seek an IPO in the U.S. (see  techinasia.com/
china-daily-deals-site-jumei-files-for-400-million- 
dollars-us-ipo ). 
 How Group Buying Is Done in China 
 According to  adage.com/article/global-news/advertising-
china- group-buying-discounts-groupon/147641 , “years ago, 
Chinese Internet users started getting together online to orga-
nize as a group to buy the same car from the same dealer in 
order to get a [quantity negotiated] discount, and this team-
buying concept quickly spread to other categories like com-
puters. [To accomplish this], a group leader would coordinate 
the group’s requirements and bargain with prospective deal-
ers to close the sale.” Sometimes the leader brings the entire 
buying group to the face-to-face negotiation (read Eunice 
Yoon’s report and watch the video “Group Buying in China” 
at  slinkingtowardretirement.com/?p=23479 ). In fact, in 
6.3 Group Buying and Deal Purchasing

136
2008, according to the  Adage report, “a group of Ford Focus 
buyers got into a shoving match at a Ford dealership when 
the employees reportedly reneged on the agreed price, and 
the prospective buyers uploaded footage of the melee to 
video sites” (watch the video at  vimeo.com/8619105 ). 
 Group Buying and Flash Sales on Facebook 
 Several years ago, it was common to combine group buys 
with ﬂ ash sales (also known as daily deals). However, this 
combination was not too successful and the two models are 
now used mostly independently of each other. For group 
buying and daily deals software, see  groupbuyingsite.com . 
 Example 
 Lot18 ( lot18.com ) offers access to ﬁ ne wines at up to 60 % 
off. Their team of curators works directly with producers 
around the world to bring high-quality, hard-to-ﬁ nd prod-
ucts directly to members. They showcase new wines daily, 
made available in limited quantities for a limited time, or 
until members have purchased all available quantities. 
Several new products appear on the site each day. Lot18 
uses Facebook to advertise ﬂ ash deals. Advertising ﬂ ash 
sales on Facebook provides an ideal environment for recruit-
ing friends into group-buy deals (members who invite 
friends to register are rewarded with a Lot18 credit for 
future purchases after the friend’s ﬁ rst order ships). Each 
member receives a personalized referral link, which he or 
she can share with friends via e-mail or by posting the link 
on their Facebook or Twitter pages.  
 Customers post daily deals with comments on Facebook 
and Twitter and other social media sites. This is a good way 
to ﬁ nd deals without joining any speciﬁ c daily deal sites. 
 The Future of Group Buying 
 There are two opinions regarding the future of group buying. 
Mander ( 2014 ) and Lee ( 2014 ) report an increase in group 
buying and ﬂ ash sales, in Southeast Asia, China, and the 
U.S. On the other hand, Jingli ( 2014 ) reports the opposite 
about China. One possible explanation is that the companies 
in these emerging areas are merging into other companies 
and do not report results for these models anymore.  
 Deal Purchases (Flash Sales, Daily Deals) 
 Gilt Group ( gilt.com ) pioneered the online ﬂ ash sale in the 
US in 2007. (See  business.time.com/2012/10/25/high-
and- low and Dugan  2010 .) There are several deﬁ nitions of 
ﬂ ash sales. For examples, see  digitalmarketing-glossary.
com/What-is-Flash-sales-site-deﬁ nition  
and 
 senior-
planet.org/online-flash-sales-how-to-get-good-deals . 
Flash sales are very common ofﬂ ine. These are short term 
deals that are designed to attract people who are already in a 
physical store. In addition, “doorbuster” sales between cer-
tain hours on a certain day (e.g., Black Friday) also are com-
mon ofﬂ ine. There are several variations of ﬂ ash sales when 
done online. 
 The “deal of the day” may be offered only in one city or 
state, while some are offered nationally. For example, Living 
Social ( livingsocial.com ) asks people to sign up for a deal at 
a restaurant, spa, or an event in a particular city. You can 
click on “today’s deals” or browse “all deals.” The deals are 
e-mailed to anyone that signs up with LivingSocial, or you 
can browse their site for something in particular. If you like 
it, you click on the “Buy it” icon to purchase the deal. After 
you buy the deal, you get a unique link to share the deal 
information with your friends (LivingSocial also has a friend 
referral program). 
 A common strategy of ﬂ ash sale sites is to focus on a par-
ticular industry. For example, Gilt.com focuses on designer 
apparel, jewelry, bags, and upscale home furnishings. iDine 
( idine.com ) is a loyalty program that rewards customers 
with beneﬁ ts when they dine out at discounted prices in par-
ticipating restaurants. 
 Woot! (an Amazon company) offers community informa-
tion related to its deals. For example, there is a “discussion 
about today’s deal,” a Woot! blog, top past deals, deal news, 
and what percentage of community members bought this 
product and what quantities of the products were sold. 
Testimonials by members are also available. Woot! is known 
as a community for “gadget geeks.” Thus, Woot! is not only 
a brand, but also a culture. See  woot.com . Other interesting 
ﬂ ash sale companies are  jetsetter.com ; acquired by 
TripAdvisor in 2013) and  ruelala.com . Companies like 
Groupon, LivingSocial, and Woot! run promotions for deals 
in major metropolitan areas. Discounts of 50 % are common, 
and sometimes they reach 80 %.  
6.4 
 SHOPPING TOGETHER: 
COMMUNITIES AND CLUBS 
 Shopping together is an enjoyable activity among many peo-
ple while in physical stores. Today, due to social software 
and social media innovations, it is also possible to shop 
together online. As you may recall, social shopping is a mix 
of online shopping and social networking. Social shopping is 
done in two places: community platforms and online clubs, 
as is described next. 
6 Social Shopping: Concepts, Beneﬁ ts, and Models

137
 Online communities (and shopping clubs, to be discussed 
later) are places where people gather to spend time talking 
about books, investments, wine, and so on, with like-minded 
people, for different purposes, including shopping. 
 Online Social Shopping Communities 
 According to  socialecart.com/social-shopping , “ shop-
ping communities bring like-minded people together to 
discuss, share, and shop” (emphasis added). For customer 
behavior in social communities, see Liu et al. ( 2013 ). The 
community platforms and forums connect people with 
each other, with businesses, and with other communities. 
Many such sites allow users to create custom shopping 
lists and share them with friends. To date, fashion com-
munities (e.g., Polyvore, StyleFeeder; a Time company, 
and ShopStyle) are the most popular ones. For some 
examples of fashion communities and online social 
 networks, 
see 
  itsjustpeople.com/2012/03/30/the-top-
fashion-communities-and-online-social-networks- ﬁ nd-
out-who-they-are-here  . 
However, 
other 
shopping 
communities are organized around food, pets, toys, and so 
forth. For example,  listia.com is an online community for 
buying and selling used or new items, along with fashion, 
in online auctions using virtual currency.  Djdoodleville.
com  is an online shopping community specializing in arts 
and crafts. 
 For a summary of social shopping communities, see   digital-
innovationtoday.com/speed-summary-ijec-social-
commerce-special-edition-social- shopping-communities  . 
 Common Features in Communities and Forums 
 Communities and forums share the following major features 
(per Marsden  2009 ; Fisher  2010 ; [slideshow with transcript], 
and the authors’ experiences): 
 Examples of Shopping Communities 
 There are many sites that can be classiﬁ ed as pure shopping 
communities. A prime example is Polyvore, which is pre-
sented in Case 6.1. 
 Case 6.1 
 SC Application 
 Polyvore: A Trendsetter in Social Shopping 
 According to Polyvore ( polyvore.com ), the company is a 
community site for online fashion and style where users are 
empowered to discover and develop their style and possibly 
set fashion trends. Users do this by creating “sets,” which are 
shared across the Web. The company collaborates with 
prominent brands such as Calvin Klein, Lancôme ( lancome- 
usa.com ), Coach, and retailers such as Net-a-Porter to drive 
product engagement; the user-generated fashion products on 
its site are then judged by community members and by celeb-
rities such as Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. Today, the company 
also uses mobile technologies. For example, it has an app for 
iPad with many capabilities (see  blog.polyvore.com/2014/02/
new-ipad-and-iphone-updates-clip-to.html ). 
 Note: Some celebrities, such as Lady Gaga, post their 
own products for sale on the site. 
 The story of the now-proﬁ table Polyvore is described in 
detail by Jacobs ( 2010 ) and Chaney ( 2011 ); see also the info-
graphic provided by Grant ( 2013 ). Users create “sets” of 
their wardrobe designs using a special editor provided free 
on the site. These “sets” can then be posted and shared on 
Polyvore’s site, Facebook, and Twitter. Merchants (e.g., 
•  User forums. Forums are discussion places in 
social networks where people can meet to discuss 
issues or to work together to solve problems raised 
by participants in discussion groups.  
•  User galleries. Galleries are usually hosted by vendors 
to display images and videos for discussion by viewers 
such as customers and business partners (e.g., 
Burberry’s Art of the Trench;  artofthetrench.burb-
erry.com ). In January 2013, Twitter added video to its 
user galleries and is now calling them “media galler-
ies” (see   marketingland.com/twitter-adds-videos-to-
user-media-galleries- 32095   ).  
•  Idea boards. These are usually located inside 
enterprise networks (e.g.,  mystarbucksidea.force.
com ; “free crowdsourcing of product ideas,” Dell’s 
 ideastorm.com ). This is a crowdsourcing mecha-
nism for idea generation and idea evaluation.  
•  Q&A forums. Online groups where users (e.g., 
customers) can ask and answer questions about 
various topics (e.g., a company’s products) and be 
helped by product experts and savvy customers 
(e.g., 
Bazaarvoice’s 
“Ask 
& 
Answer” 
or 
PowerReviews’ “Social Answers”). Questions and 
answers can be organized in Q&A format. 
•  Brand communities. Communities that are orga-
nized around a brand (e.g., Sony’s MP3) to discuss 
a product or brand.  
•  Comprehensive (multipurpose communities). 
Kaboodle is probably the most well-known com-
prehensive community, while Polyvore is the lead-
ing community for fashion (and related products).

designers) can use the site for free by (a) creating a proﬁ le, 
(b) uploading existing products, and (c) creating sets. 
 Once merchants create a proﬁ le and upload products, 
Polyvore encourages them to engage with other commu-
nity members by reviewing and evaluating the sets. 
Polyvore believes that the merchants’ activity will be 
reciprocated. To facilitate actual shopping, the sets link to 
the creators’ sites. 
 Polyvore can be viewed as a  crowdsourcing fashion busi-
ness model that reﬂ ects the creativity and opinion of many; 
plus, it can be viewed as expressing current fashion trends 
(see Wang  2011 ). They now do the same with interior design, 
where you can submit your creative room sets ( polyvore.
c o m / p o l y v o r e _ i n t e r i o r _ d e s i g n _ c o / g r o u p .
show?id=29235) . According to Wang ( 2011 ), the site pro-
vides a new business model for both shopping and product 
and style discovery, as well as a venue for designers to hone 
their skills by introducing new fashion items. 
 In October 2014, Polyvore had over 20 million unique visi-
tors importing 2.2 million items to the site each month, creating 
about three million fashion sets per month via Polyvore’s web-
site and its mobile app. Over 100 million items have been added 
to the network since its debut. Mobile activity is increasing, with 
50 % of sets being created on a smartphone or tablet (per  tech-
crunch.com/2014/10/07/polyvore-gets-personalized-with-
new-iphone-app-featuring- just-for-you-style-suggestions/ ). 
Polyvore also released a “new and improved” iPhone app in 
July 2014. Users spend hours browsing, following favorite taste 
streams, asking questions and sharing ideas, which is proﬁ table 
for businesses (see   corp.wishpond.com/blog/2013/02/05/
understanding-polyvore-for-business  ). Polyvore is consid-
ered by many to be the best place to discover or evaluate fashion 
trends, which are facilitated by contests managed by the com-
pany. For more information, see   venturebeat.com/2012/12/20/
polyvore-gets-a-cro .  
 Polyvore can be used together with Pinterest to increase 
trafﬁ c to the site (see Mally  2012 ).

 Kaboodle: A Unique Social Shopping 
Community 
 Kaboodle ( kaboodle.com ) is a large, comprehensive 
 social shopping community and network, according to 
 kaboodle.com/zm/about . According to  crunchbase.com/
product/kaboodle , “Kaboodle is a free service that lets 
users collect information from the Web and store it on a 
Kaboodle list that can be shared with others.” The site’s 
primary goal “is to simplify shopping by making it easier 
for people to ﬁ nd items they’re interested in and by allow-
ing users to share recommendations with one another 
using Kaboodle  lists and  groups . Kaboodle lists, however, 
can also serve a variety of purposes besides just shopping. 
[For example], they can be used for planning vacations [or 
parties], sharing research for work or school, sharing your 
favorite bands with friends, and basically anything else 
you might want to collect and share information about” 
(emphasis added). 
 To learn more about how Kaboodle works, take the 
Kaboodle Tour at  kaboodle.com/zd/help/getStarted.html . 
 Some of Kaboodle’s Capabilities 
 The “Add to Kaboodle” button simpliﬁ es the online shop-
ping experience because, once installed, the user can simply 
click on it whenever a product is selected from any website. 
Then, a snapshot of the selected item, its price, and other 
product information is automatically uploaded with a link 
about where to place it on the user’s Kaboodle lists. The user 
then can ﬁ nd any speciﬁ c item in the future. Users can also 
discover deals, ﬁ nd new products, express their unique 
styles, connect with others, share their discoveries, blog, cre-
ate shopping lists, and more. 
 Kaboodle allows the creation of “Top Picks” from the 
Kaboodle lists based on what members like (e.g., the “top 10 
weird and interesting products”).

 Private Online Shopping Clubs 
and Retail by Invitation 
 French e-commerce company Vente-Privee ( us.venteprivee.
com ) pioneered the ﬁ rst private online shopping club spe-
cializing in “members only” online ﬂ ash sales. The club con-
centrates on designer products at discounted prices (up to 
80 %). Vente-Privee also sells exclusive designer brands 
such as fashion accessories, homewares, sports products, 
consumer electronics, and wine. In general, private shopping 
clubs run ﬂ ash sale events featuring luxury brands at huge 
discounts. Luxury brands use the clubs to liquidate out of 
style items, overstock, or special samples. Consumers like 
the clubs due to the steep discounts. 
 The key to this business model’s success is that, in con-
trast with the Groupon model,  not everyone is allowed to 
shop. The  members-only model serves a myriad of purposes. 
Partially, it is a marketing device that makes members feel 
like VIPs, but it also helps the clubs manage healthy growth. 
 Examples of Private Clubs 
 Some private (or “members only”) clubs are: Beyond the 
Rack (U.S. and Canada), Gilt Groupe, Rue La La, Amazon 
BuyVIP ( buyvip.com ; Europe only), Ideel, and BestSecret. 
For members only clubs around the world, see  members-
only- shopping.com . Note that, to minimize conﬂ ict with 
department stores, some luxury brands now offer selected 
items at lower prices in stores such as Target Inc. 
 Shopping Together Sites 
 Dozens of sites facilitate shopping together activities. For 
example, Select2gether ( select2gether.com ) is a “virtual room 
where you can meet and greet your friends, colleagues, cus-
tomers and prospects. Select2gether allows you to organize 
and share all the beautiful things you ﬁ nd on the Web. You can 
browse Meet Rooms created by other people to discover new 
things and get inspiration from people who share your inter-
ests. You can show your stuff to others and get advice and 
other views from friends and advisors.” For details and expla-
nations, see  select2gether.com/about/help . Select2gether uti-
lizes the WeLiket tool, which lets users “grab” images from 
any website to add to the Meet Room. The free WeLiket tool 
is unique to Select2gether. For more about the WeLiket tool, 
see  select2gether.com/pages/toolbar . 
 Coshopping 
 Coshopping is an IBM software package (feature of the IBM 
WebSphere Commerce pack) that enables online shoppers to 
invite friends to a coshopping session. Shoppers and their 
friends can explore a store, view products, exchange mes-
sages, and chat about products. Coshopping provides real- 
time synchronization of two shoppers’ Web browsers to 
create a single collaborative shopping session controlled by 
one of the shoppers (with individual’s privacy protected). 
 Coshopping can also facilitate a customer care center’s 
live chat solution by allowing a customer service representa-
tive to guide the customer through product browsing and 
selection on the site. To learn about the features and capabili-
ties of Coshopping, see  ibm.com/support/knowledgecen-
ter/SSZLC2_7.0.0/com.ibm.commerce.coshopping.doc/
concepts/csmcoshopping.htm . For other examples of social

6.5 
 SOCIAL SHOPPING AIDS: 
FROM RECOMMENDATIONS, 
REVIEWS, AND RATINGS 
TO MARKETPLACES 
 In addition to the typical e-commerce shopping aids such as 
comparison engines and recommendations a la Amazon.com 
style, there are special aids for social commerce. 
 Recommendations in Social Commerce 
 Prior to making a purchase, customers tend to collect infor-
mation that will help them make a decision, such as what 
brand to buy, from which vendor, and at what price. Online 
customers do this by consulting shopping aids (e.g., price 
comparison sites) such as  nextag.com , product review sites 
such as  epinions.com , and researching other sources. 
Examining and participating in social networking forums is 
another way to compare prices and read product and service 
reviews. According to Gartner Inc. (reported by Dubey 
 2010 ), the majority of online customers already rely on 
social networks to guide them in purchasing decisions. A 
variety of SC models and tools is available for this purpose 
(e.g., see Dugan  2010 ). We present two major categories 
here. For an infographic on what engages millennials and 
inﬂ uences their purchasing decisions, see  quicksprout.
com/2014/11/14/how-to-inﬂ uence-purchasing-decisions . 
 Ratings and Reviews 
 Ratings and reviews by friends, even by people that you do 
not know (e.g., experts or independent third-party evalua-
tors), are usually available for social shoppers. In addition, 
any user has an opportunity to contribute reviews and 
 participate in relevant discussions. The information about the 
6.5 Social Shopping Aids: From Recommendations, Reviews, and Ratings to Marketplaces

140
tools for conducting rating and reviews, which are presented 
here, is based on Fisher ( 2010 ), Rowan and Cheshire ( 2011 ), 
Shih ( 2011 ),  bazaarvoice.com/solutions/conversations , 
and the authors’ experiences. The major types of tools and 
methods are: 
 Example 
 Maui Jim ( mauijim.com ) is a company that designs high 
quality polarized sunglasses. According to  Business Wire 
( 2010 ), the company is using Bazaarvoice Ratings & 
Reviews to enable customers to rate and review the compa-
ny’s entire line of sunglasses and accessories. The company 
is relying on word-of-mouth marketing to advertise its prod-
ucts and help shoppers. Customers are invited to share their 
opinions on the style, ﬁ t, and quality of speciﬁ c sunglass 
models. Maui Jim also sends customers opt-in e-mails ask-
ing them to review products. The company lists the reviews 
with the product listings, and also integrates them in the site 
search functionality so customers can see its star rating in the 
search results. 
 Social Recommendations and Referrals 
 Recommendation engines allow shoppers to receive advice 
from other shoppers and to give advice to others. 
 Social shopping may combine recommendations in a 
social network platform with actual sales. Social recommen-
dations and referrals are closely related to ratings and reviews 
and are sometimes integrated with them. 
 Traditional online product review companies such as 
Amazon.com and Bazaarvoice have helped traditional con-
sumers, but today’s customers like to receive advice from, 
and give advice to, friends and other shoppers. Sites such as 
 cnet.com , Wired Reviews ( wired.com/category/reviews ), 
 buzzillions.com ,  epinions.com ,  consumerreports.org , and 
 theﬁ nd.com can be used for this purpose. Amazon.com also 
provides reviews on the products they sell. 
 Example 
 ThisNext ( thisnext.com ) is a social commerce site where 
community members  recommend their favorite products, so 
others can discover desirable or unique items and decide 
what to buy. ThisNext uses WOM, social experiences, and 
personalization to facilitate shopping. To assist with discov-
ery and help ﬁ nalize shopping decisions, the community 
includes experts, bloggers, style mavens, and trendsetters. 
ThisNext has also developed a set of shopping tools for blog-
gers, designers, and shoppers. For a further description, see 
 thisnext.com/company . 
 It makes sense to combine recommendations with mar-
keting communications and shopping. Recommendation and 
review sites allow shoppers to receive and provide advice to 
speciﬁ c friends, in contrast with traditional online product 
reviews that include advice provided by unknown shoppers. 
Furthermore, these sites sell ad space, provide coupons, and 
some offer automatic cash-back rewards for shopping with 
local merchants. 
 A new trend is to encourage conversations around pur-
chases with a shopper’s “real life” friends. The sites that 
include reviews from people one knows are logically more 
trustworthy than sites that include only the reviews made by 
strangers. 
•  Customer ratings and reviews. Customer ratings 
are popular. They can be found on product (or ser-
vice) review sites (e.g.,  buzzillions.com ) or inde-
pendent review sites (e.g.,  tripadvisor.com ), and/or 
in customer news feeds (e.g., Amazon.com, 
Epinions). Customer ratings can be summarized by 
votes or polls.  
•  Customer testimonials. Customer experiences are 
typically published on vendors’ sites, and on third 
party sites such as TripAdvisor. Most sites encour-
age discussion (e.g.,  bazaarvoice.com/solutions/
conversations ). 
•  Expert ratings and reviews. Ratings or reviews 
can also be generated by domain experts and appear 
in different online publications.  
•  Sponsored reviews. These are written by paid 
bloggers or domain experts. Advertisers and blog-
gers ﬁ nd each other by searching through websites 
such as  sponsoredreviews.com , which connects 
bloggers with marketers and advertisers. 
•  Conversational marketing. People communicate 
via e-mail, blog, live chat, discussion groups, and 
tweets. Monitoring conversations may yield rich 
data for market research and customer service (e.g., 
Dell’s use of their “Social Media Command 
Center”). See Chap.   10 and  exacttarget.com/sites/
exacttarget/ﬁ les/10-Examples-of-Social-Media- 
Command-Centers.pdf for details. 
•  Video product review. Reviews can be generated 
by using videos through communities such as Expo 
( expotv.com ), 
where 
consumers 
can 
leave 
“Videopinions” about products and services. 
YouTube users can create reviews that are uploaded, 
viewed, commented on, and shared.  
•  Blogger reviews. This is a questionable method 
since some bloggers are paid and may use a biased 
approach. However, many bloggers have a reputa-
tion of being unbiased. For a list of 50 product 
review blogs, see Sala ( 2012 ). 
6 Social Shopping: Concepts, Beneﬁ ts, and Models

141
 Sometimes, social recommendations are embedded in 
social shopping portals that offer shopping tools as well as 
bundling recommendations with ratings and reviews. A 
prime example is Kaboodle (described earlier as a shopping 
community). 
 Common recommendation methods are: 
 For more on product reviews, see  buzzilions.com and 
 bazaarvoice.com/product-reviews . 
 Illustrative Examples of Recommendation Sites 
 Recommendations, reviews, ratings, and other engagement 
activities can be done in the communities described in 
Sect.  6.4 . For a list of rating and review websites, see  epower.
com/rating-review.php . However, the  major objectives of 
communities like Kaboodle are different because they  con-
centrate on recommendations, reviews, and ratings as impor-
tant shopping aids. 
 Crowdstorm 
 According to Chaney ( 2011 ), “ crowdstorm.com ” is a  shop-
ping recommendation website with two goals: (a) [being] a 
hub for product reviews, and (b) [being] a source where 
shoppers can ﬁ nd the best online prices for consumer goods 
such as electronics, sporting equipment, clothing, and jew-
elry. The site is fueled by user-submitted product listings and 
product reviews. However, it also has expert reviews, buyer 
guides, and question-and-answer sessions. The site promotes 
an open policy by allowing users to post their reviews to 
blogs, other reviews sites and online stores” (emphasis 
added). The site is doing extensive  price comparisons . The 
site claims to have over 300,000 visitors a month; however, it 
does not sell anything—it just aids shoppers. Crowdstorm is 
also a social shopping experience provider, where shoppers 
can ask others for recommendations about products they are 
looking to buy and to ﬁ nd the best online prices for many 
consumer goods. By adding a social shopping aspect to their 
website, Crowdstorm is aiming to be much more than simply 
a price comparison site. 
 Buzzillions 
 Buzzillions.com is a user-generated product review site. It 
gets reviews from its partner company, PowerReviews 
(acquired by Bazaarvoice), which provides customer review 
software to e-commerce sites. It also incorporates product 
reviews from companies that use other third-party providers, 
or have an in-house review system. The site provides several 
useful tools for tagging and researching the reviews. It also 
provides rankings. 
 Buzzillions’ business model is based on selling trafﬁ c 
information, or product leads, from Buzzillions right back to 
the merchant network that uses PowerReviews. In other 
words, Buzzillions’ users read reviews imported from many 
other sites, and they can then click on products of interest, 
giving them the opportunity to read more about these prod-
ucts and possibly purchase them from the seller’s site. 
 The company is unique because:
 1.  The rankings are based on feedback from customers. The 
company provides the tools to narrow down the search, 
but the consumers have to read the reviews to see if the 
product is right for them.  
 2.  Positive or negative, all reviews are encouraged on 
Buzzillions. Unless a review is profane or violates the 
company’s terms, it will be shown on the site.  
  3.  Buzzillions does not sell products, although the company 
has retail partners listed on the site for direct contact by 
consumers.  
 Example: How Intuit Corp—Helps Consumers 
with Recommendations 
 Intuit’s TurboTax program is very popular, with about 20 mil-
lion users. The company uses a social media recommendation 
system, called the TurboTax Live Community ( ttlc.intuit.
com ). The Live Community has several million questions and 
answers in their database; it is presented in a Q&A format 
where you can ask questions and get answers from experts 
and the community. TurboTax also offers “Customer Ratings 
and Products Review.” The reviews and ratings are available 
•  Social bookmarking.  Recommended products, 
services, etc. are bookmarked so members of social 
networks can easily ﬁ nd them. 
•  Personal social recommendations. These are 
based on ﬁ nding people with similar proﬁ les. By 
using these customers’ actual purchases, conclu-
sions can be reached about general and targeted rec-
ommendations (e.g., see Apple’s Near Me 
 [getnearme.com] ; applications that are popular 
based on a user’s current location, Amazon 
Recommendations, and  snoox.com “your friends’ 
recommendations, on everything”).  
•  Referral programs. Afﬁ liate programs (e.g., 
 afﬁ liate- program.amazon.com , 
 apple.com/
itunes/afﬁ liates ) pay people for referring new cus-
tomers. For more about referral programs, see 
 s l i d e s h a r e . n e t / g e t A m b a s s a d o r /
building-an-effective-referral-program . 
•  Matching algorithms. Consulting companies and 
vendors (e.g., Netﬂ ix) provide recommendations 
based on similarity algorithms (as described in 
Chap.   3 ). 
6.5 Social Shopping Aids: From Recommendations, Reviews, and Ratings to Marketplaces

142
so yours can “read unﬁ ltered reviews from [their] custom-
ers….” Searches can be segmented into tax-related categories 
like ‘bought a house’ or ‘lost my job.’ Intuit also made the 
search function on its site more prominent and easier to use. 
From the Customer Ratings and Product Reviews page ( tur-
botax.intuit.com/reviews ), consumers can also click on any 
rating or review and post it on their Facebook or Twitter page. 
While on the Customer Ratings and Product Reviews page, 
users can easily share their reviews on Facebook and Twitter 
with one click. The Live Community ( ttlc.intuit.com ) con-
sumers doing their taxes can ask a question and get an answer 
from another customer or a TurboTax support expert.  
 Concerns About Social Reviews 
and Recommendations 
 Some people are concerned about the accuracy of the reported 
reviews and recommendations. In 2012, Gartner, Inc. predicted 
that by 2014, 10–15 % of social media reviews would be fake 
and paid for by companies ( gartner.com/newsroom/
id/2161315 ). In fact, consumers are skeptical about social 
media marketing (see  blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/03/amid-
fake-reviews-consumers-skeptical- of-social-media-
marketing ). For example, see the ‘Alleged Manipulation by 
Yelp’ section on Wikipedia at  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp . 
There is also a concern that businesses are paying people 
money to post favorable reviews and that in cases of a small 
number of reviewers, a bias (positive or negative) may be 
shown. Some government agencies are getting involved in dis-
mantling the system of fake reviews. For example, in September 
2013, the Attorney General of New York City assessed mone-
tary penalties against 19 companies who created false reviews 
for products and services (see  nbcnews.com/tech/internet/
ny-attorney-general-cracks-down-fake-online-reviews- 
f4B11235875  ).  
 Other Shopping Aids and Services 
 In addition to recommendations and marketplaces, there are 
several sites that provide social shopping aids, as illustrated 
in the following examples. 
 Yelp: The Shoppers’ Best Helper 
 Yelp ( yelp.com ) is a company that operates an online urban 
(local) guide that helps people ﬁ nd services ranging from 
mechanics to restaurants in a speciﬁ c city based on reviews 
and recommendations of local users. In this way, it connects 
people with great local businesses. Community members, 
known as “Yelpers,” write reviews of the businesses and then 
rate them. Yelpers also ﬁ nd events and special offers and can 
“talk” with each other by posting and replying to conversa-
tions on different topics ( yelp.com/talk ). 
 The site is also a place for businesses to advertise their 
products and services (there is no fee to create a business 
page; however, there is a fee for business owners to post a 
“Yelp Deal”). Yelp is also accessible via mobile devices. The 
site offers several social networking features such as discus-
sion forums, posting photos, and using Facebook to ﬁ nd 
friends who have Yelp accounts. Yelp has a company blog 
( ofﬁ cialblog.yelp.com ), along with a community blog for 
Yelpers and Elite members worldwide ( communityblog.
yelp.com ). Yelpers who frequently become actively involved 
and engage on the site can apply to become an “Elite Squad” 
member (see  yelp.com/elite ). 
 Since its inception in 2004, Yelp operates in major metro 
cities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and 
other countries worldwide. For 2014 statistics, see Smith 
et al. ( 2014 ). As of Q3 2014, Yelp had a monthly average of 
139 million unique visitors (as measured by Google 
Analytics) and Yelpers had written over 67 million rich, local 
reviews by the end of Q3 2014. Approximately 73 million 
unique visitors visited Yelp via their mobile device on a 
monthly average basis during Q3 2014. For more informa-
tion, see the infographic on Yelp’s “Factsheet” at  yelp- press.
com/phoenix.zhtml?c=250809&p=irol-press . 
 How Yelp Works 
 Users look for a business in a speciﬁ c city. Yelp’s search 
engine ﬁ nds available businesses and presents ratings and 
reviews as well as accessibility and directions. Yelp connects 
with Google Maps to show the location of the businesses and 
further aids in discovering related businesses. (Google was 
negotiating to buy Yelp in November 2010, but the deal fell 
through in January 2011.) 
 Adding social features to user reviews creates a reputation 
system, whereby site visitors can see both the positive and 
the negative reviews. 
 For more about reputation management, see Chap.   5  and 
 outspokenmedia.com/guides/orm-guide . Yelp became a 
major commercial success and was listed on the stock market 
in March 2012. Its stock price keeps increasing (with pauses). 
 Most of Yelp’s revenue comes from advertising (in 2012, 
80 % came from local advertising). For Yelp’s business model 
and an infographic, see  streetﬁ ghtmag.com/2013/05/06/
how-does-yelp-make-money-and-where-is-it-going-next . 
For further information, see yelp.com/faq. 
 Note that some shopping aids can be used for both 
online and ofﬂ ine shopping. One such aid is the touch-
screen PC available at kiosks in physical stores (e.g., 
Kohl’s) where you can examine catalogs and place your 
order while in the store.  
6 Social Shopping: Concepts, Beneﬁ ts, and Models

 Collaborative Reviews 
 Sites such as  productwiki.com are structured like a wiki; 
thus, every user can contribute. The goal is to create a 
comprehensive resource collection. The companies believe 
that a need exists for unbiased, accurate, and community-
based resources for product information. These sites use 
 collaborative reviews , a collection of pros and cons about 
a product submitted by and voted on by the consumers. 
The result is a comprehensive review that takes the opin-
ions of many people into account, and highlights the most 
important aspects of a product. A collaborative review is 
made up of two things—statements and votes. Community 
members submit and vote on speciﬁ c statements that are 
separated by pros and cons, making it easy to see what is 
good and bad about each product. For further information 
on collaborative reviews, see  productwiki.com/home/
article/collaborative-reviews.html . 
 In March 2013, ProductWiki merged with Bootic ( bootic.
com ), which is known as a “wiki of products” (see   bootic.
com/_aboutus  ). The idea is for ProductWiki to offer a mar-
ketplace in addition to product reviews. Bootic is the ﬁ rst 
marketplace that allows shoppers to express themselves by 
editing, adding content, and enhancing the overall product 
description. As a result of this partnership, ProductWiki, like 
Bootic, will offer a marketplace in addition to product 
reviews. According to its website, vendors love Bootic’s 
marketplace because “Bootic’s e-commerce platform offers 
a free suite of easy-to-use Web-based tools and technology 
to help our vendors create their own individualized online 
shops. Unlike other marketplaces, we don’t charge fees. On 
Bootic, storefronts can quickly get up and running without 
incurring any set-up costs, listing or on-going transaction 
fees. Bootic empowers small businesses to enhance their 
online brand while optimizing a new revenue stream.”  
 Filtering Consumer Reviews 
 As described earlier, TurboTax, a division of Intuit, also 
launched a ratings and reviews page ( reviews.turbotax.
intuit.com ).This page allows consumers to describe their 
particular tax situations, and then ﬁ lter reviews on TurboTax 
products, to see only those written by “people like them” 
(similar tax and income situations); then, they can quickly 
ﬁ nd which TurboTax product best suits their needs. 
 Dealing with Complaints 
 As will be seen in Chap.   7  , customers have learned how to 
use social media to air their complaints. For a UK survey that 
shows that customers are more likely to complain via social 
media, see  xlgroup.com/press/new-survey-ﬁ nds- customers-
increasingly-likely-to-use-social-media-to- complain  . See

 Social Marketplaces and Direct Sales 
to Customers 
 The term  social marketplace refers to a marketplace that 
uses social media tools for enabling shoppers to perform 
activities, such as the buying and selling of products, services, 
and resources. As with any other marketplace, a social mar-
ketplace brings sellers and buyers together to connect and 
transact. The social marketplace is an intermediary that pro-
vides the infrastructure and procedures for transactions, 
including display, product discovery, interactions, compari-
sons, security, and payments (see  afﬁ no.com/innovation- 
features/innovation-features/introduction-to-
social-marketplace ). 
 Ideally, a social marketplace (like Polyvore) should 
enable the members to market their own creations. 
 Examples of Social Marketplaces 
•  Craigslist. Craigslist ( craigslist.org ) is considered a 
social network marketplace because it provides online 
classiﬁ ed ads in addition to supporting social activities 
(meetings, dating, events).  
•  Fotolia. Fotolia ( us.fotolia.com ) is a social marketplace 
for affordable royalty free photos, images, and video 
clips. By December 2014, there were more than 34 mil-
lion images available on the site. Fotolia serves a com-
munity of artists, designers, and other creative people 
who express themselves through images, forums, and 
blogs. Buyers can legally buy images (pay as you go, or a 
daily/monthly subscription). For details, see  us.fotolia.
com/Info/AboutUs . 
•  Flipsy. According to  applegazette.com/feature/sell-
your- apple-device-using-ﬂ ipsy-and-get-as-much-cash- 
as-possible , “Flipsy [ ﬂ ipsy.com ] is essentially a price 
comparison site, albeit with a slight twist. Instead of you 
looking for what others are selling, you are looking for 
information on the ﬁ gures that others are willing to pay 
for the item you are selling…. Using Flipsy is simple 
enough. You just have to specify the item you are selling, 
and the site will return offers from various buyback web-
sites.” As of 2014, Flipsy does not charge commissions or 
fees. Since Flipsy does not buy products, payment pro-
cessing for items purchased is handled by a third party, 
such as PayPal. 
6.5 Social Shopping Aids: From Recommendations, Reviews, and Ratings to Marketplaces

•  Storenvy. Storenvy ( storenvy.com ) is a global market-
place for emerging brands and inspired goods. Businesses 
can launch a custom store to sell unique goods. At no cost 
to sellers, a simple way is made available (no program-
ming experience is needed) to create personalized web-
stores. Sellers have the ability to make their sites as 
socially friendly as they wish, giving customers the 
chance to follow or interact with sellers as well as with 
other customers. 
•  ShopSocially. ShopSocially ( shopsocially.com ) is a 
cloud-based social commerce platform, which sells a 
suite of social apps to retailers to embed on their site. The 
software package enables the retailers’ customers to share 
shopping experiences via WOM (e.g., recommending 
products to friends). It offers retailers hundreds of apps 
such as ‘share-a-purchase’ and ‘shopping community.’ 
ShopSocially combines the concepts of online shopping 
and social networks, creating a new business model for 
the retailers that use their products. For example, users 
can solicit shopping information from friends via 
Facebook, Twitter, and e-mail. Users can ask shopping 
questions and get answers. ShopSocially helps companies 
to turn visitors in sites to fans. For details and beneﬁ ts to 
retailers, see  shopsocially.com . 
 Example 
 Firearms manufacturer Beretta Inc. is using ShopSocially’s 
social commerce platform and Facebook to increase cus-
tomer engagement and sales conversation rate. In addition, it 
captures customers’ delight after a new purchase, and con-
verting it into valuable WOM recommendations that are 
being shared virally on social networks. As a result, the com-
pany has added over 10,000 fans on Facebook, experienced a 
15 % increase in sales conversion rate, and gained brand rec-
ognition and retention. For details, see  prweb.com/
releases/2013/12/prweb11440494.htm 
 Some Unique Marketplaces 
 Chaney et al. ( 2013 ) lists the following marketplaces: 
 Addoway.com ; a site that integrates with Facebook’s Social 
Graph, and enables users to recommend merchants that your 
friends have purchased from.  Pikaba.com ; works like a 
reverse auction—you post what you want to buy and mer-
chants will compete to offer the best price.  Buyosphere.
com ; fashion marketplace focused on unique designs; a com-
munity where you can ask stylists, bloggers, designers, and 
others where to ﬁ nd something that is right for you. 
 Ofﬁ cearrow.com ; a B2B marketplace designed to connect 
buyers and sellers, along with providing unbiased ratings and 
reviews by community members. 
 Example: How Musicians Sell Online 
via Social Networks 
 Many musicians and other artists used to invest money to 
make their own CDs, T-shirts, and other items before they 
sold them. Now there is a free social commerce solution. 
Audiolife Inc. (acquired by Alliance Entertainment, which 
was acquired by video distribution company Super D in 
2013) provides artists with webstores (one per artist), 
where artists (sellers) can directly interact with potential 
buyers. This arrangement also allows artists to sell custom 
made merchandise. 
 To entice fans to order products, artists post their own 
Audiolife selection on any large social network site (e.g., 
Facebook). Each order, even for one item, is then forwarded 
to the artist for production. Audiolife arranges payment and 
shipping to the buyers. By August 2014, Audiolife powered 
close to 100,000 webstores worldwide, serving 300,000 art-
ists, including those who are already established. For details, 
see  audiolife.com/about.html and Billingsley ( 2010 ).

 INNOVATIVE SHOPPING MODELS 
AND SITES AND VIRTUAL GOODS 
 There are hundreds of start-ups in social commerce. Even 
Facebook is introducing SC services like “Page post link 
ads” and the “Buy” button. Twitter began testing a “Buy” 
button in fall 2014, and will make it available to the general 
public in 2015. Here we provide some representative 
examples. 
 Examples of Innovative Social Shopping Ideas 
and Sites 
 Social shopping includes many new and innovative business 
models. Some were described earlier in the chapter. We 
include several more models here.
•  Getting help from shoppers via TurnTo Networks. The 
TurnTo 
Networks 
( turntonetworks.com ) 
platform 
involves partnering with certain websites to have them 
carry a TurnTo link. TurnTo is a Social Q&A platform for 
e-commerce sites that enables shoppers to ask questions 
about products and get answers from other customers. The 
shoppers’ questions are sent out to a select number of cus-
tomers who have  actually bought the merchandise . Their 
answers are then e-mailed back to the shoppers and dis-
played on the merchant’s product pages for others to read. 
According to its website, TurnTo’s products are designed 
from the ground up to meet the needs of online retailers. 
 In October 2013, TurnTo announced a partnership 
with  needle.com , a guided shopping platform specializ-

ing in live chat and customer engagement strategies. 
Needle recruits knowledgeable shoppers who are famil-
iar with certain brands and puts them to work chatting 
with customers and answering questions, making recom-
mendations, or guiding them toward ﬁ nding the right 
products. These “Needlers” are independent contractors 
and are compensated with cash as well as points to 
redeem for products. 
 For how the site works, see  turntonetworks.com/
social-commerce- webinar-coffeeforless.com-solves- 
customer- engagement-challenge-with-social-qa . Note 
that Lenovo and Shoes.com use TurnTo for their Q&As. 
For an infographic of the social Q&A model, see  turn-
tonetworks.com/social-qa-infographic/ . 
•  Find what your friends are buying . Finding what your 
friends are buying was offered, for example, by  clubfur-
niture.com , a North Carolina company that sells online 
home furnishings at factory prices directly to customers. 
Note: This service was popular between 2009 and 2011 
with several companies, but was discontinued mainly due 
to privacy concerns. 
•  Wanelo. This popular social shopping network com-
bines bookmarking and product sharing. Members can 
follow others to ﬁ nd trendy items. For details, see 
Leahey ( 2013 ). According to  bits.blogs.nytimes.
com/2013/01/24/a-look-at-wanelo-a-social-
c o m m e rc e - s i t e -  fo r- yo u n g e r- s h o p p e r s / ? _
php=true&_type=blogs&_r=2 , the company’s name 
is an abbreviation for ‘Want, Need, Love,’ and is popu-
lar with young shoppers. Wanelo ( wanelo.com ) is an 
online community-based e-commerce site that brings 
together products from a vast array of stores into one 
pinboard- style platform. You can browse, save, and buy 
items, post new products from around the Web, and fol-
low members, stores, or product collections. Catering to 
both brands and shoppers, members create collec-
tions—similar to Pinterest boards—from items onsite 
or external links. It also has an app on iTunes and 
Google Play and a Facebook Fan page. For more infor-
mation 
about 
Wanelo, 
see 
 pcmag.com/
article2/0,2817,2424709,00.asp  
and

com/2013/11/05/wanelo-social-shopping  . 
For 
the 
company’s business model, see  businessweek.com/
articles/2014-04-24/wanelo-deena-varshavskayas-
site-takes- over-social-shopping . Wanelo is unique 
since if you see something you like, you can purchase it 
with one click.  
 Additional Examples of Social Shopping 
 There are many other examples. Here are few: 
 Example 1: Helping Sellers and Bloggers 
Sell Products 
 Etsy is a socially-oriented marketplace which helps bloggers 
and sellers (mostly artists) monetize their businesses by 
making it easy for them to sell products directly to consum-
ers. Note: A company called OpenSky used to do this; how-
ever, they changed their business model. For some new social 
commerce business models, see Colao ( 2013 ). 
 Example 2: Event Shopping 
 Thee are many sites that help buyers, with the assistance of 
their friends, shop for a special event (e.g., a wedding). Many 
variations of this model exist. For example, in 2010, Wendy’s 
gave away $50 gift cards for boneless wings to 100 consum-
ers who organized viewing parties of that year’s NCAA 
Basketball Championships over Facebook.  
    Socially-Oriented Person to Person (P2P): Selling, 
Buying, Renting, or Bartering 
 When individuals conduct business online, they may do so 
with some social elements. For example, some consider 
Craigslist to be a socially oriented virtual community. Here 
are some more examples: 
 P2P Lending 
 P2P money lending is growing rapidly, enabling one person 
to lend money to another. This is done without a bank but 
with the assistance of a matching company such as Prosper 
or Lending Club. There are several other types of P2P lend-
ing. Another start-up created a community of people that 
rent out goods to people, usually for the short term. In P2P 
landing, people get to know each other (a social aspect).  
 P2P Sharing (Also Known As Collaborative 
Consumption) 
 SnapGoods facilitates P2P sharing. Some other sites, like 
SwapBabyGoods.com, Swapmamas.com (a social commu-
nity for moms who want to get to know each other and swap 
goods they no longer use for things they need) and 
Neighborhood Fruit (that helps people share fruit that are 
growing in their yards or ﬁ nd fruit trees on public lands), 
have a niche market. The sharing and renting trend is boom-
ing, especially during the economic recession, and there is a 
“green” aspect as well—saving resources. There is also the 
social aspect of sharing, allowing people to make meaningful 
connections with others (see Walsh  2010 for details). 
 Several variations of this model exist. Some people share 
cars, others invite travelers to stay free in their homes, or 
exchange homes for short periods (e.g., HomeExchange.
com;  homeexchange.com ) and much more. Lending Tree 
6.6 Innovative Shopping Models and Sites and Virtual Goods

146
( lendingtree.com ) is another company that allows prospec-
tive borrowers to get quick offers from multiple lenders. 
 In May 2013, Google took a stake in P2P investment site 
Lending Club ( lendingclub.com ; see Hempel  2013 ). 
 Start Ups: Examples 
 In 2014, Facebook started a program to help startup compa-
nies go online using Facebook and its services. Here are a 
few examples. 
 Example 1: “Wine Condom” Bottle Stopper 
 This small start-up (mother-and-son) invented a quality cover for 
wine bottles. They placed the idea on Kickstarter and raised 
$9,285 from a community of 311 backers (see  kickstarter.com/
projects/1269355871/wine-condoms ). This is an example of 
 crowdfunding (see Kavilanz  2014 ). Once the duo raised the 
money, they used Facebook as a platform to ﬁ nd customers and 
distributors. They established contacts with wineries worldwide 
and connected with cruise ship companies. They use Facebook 
for advertising campaigns. The wine condoms are sold to both 
businesses and individuals and are available for $10 a package at 
 winecondoms.com .  
 Example 2: Divas Snow Gear 
 In order to attract more women to the snowmobile sport, 
Wendy Gavinski invented attractive and ﬂ attering clothing 
for women. Her problem was that industry magazines and 
online forums were geared towards men. Gavinski designed 
one outﬁ t as an experiment, and found a manufacturer to 
work with her, creating her ﬁ rst sample. Because Gavinski 
could not ﬁ nd women snowboarders through traditional 
advertising, she decided to use Facebook ads to advertise her 
products. She started in 2010 with a Facebook page. Using 
Facebook, she directed customers to visit retailers and their 
events. According to Gavinski, Facebook became their pri-
mary means of marketing since it is the only channel that 
allows her company to speciﬁ cally target women. With over 
47,000 ‘Likes’ and the use of other social media channels, 
the business became proﬁ table in 2014, adding more prod-
ucts and gained market share in the U.S., Canada, Europe, 
and Russia. For details, see Gavinski ( 2014 ),  facebook.com/
divassnowgear1 , and  divassnowgear.com 
 Shopping Without Leaving Facebook 
and Other Social Networks 
 There are several avenues for turning Facebook fan pages 
into retail outlets, so fans do not have to leave Facebook to 
shop. However, payment and security are two issues yet to 
be resolved. In 2011, several large brands (e.g., Gap, 
Nordstrom, GameStop) closed their shops on Facebook. 
Companies closed their Facebook stores for a number of rea-
sons, citing that people prefer to shop directly from the 
stores’ website, or on Amazon.com. Some stores wanted to 
focus on advertising using broader media. According to 
Ashley Sheetz, VP of marketing and strategy at GameStop, 
the company did not get enough revenue from using the 
Facebook webstore. She told Bloomberg that Facebook is “a 
way we communicate with customers on deals, not a place to 
sell.” However, this situation is changing. In summer 2014, 
Facebook introduced the “Buy” button to simplify shopping 
without having the customer leave Facebook. In addition, 
security and payments improved. A large number of tools 
and apps facilitate e- commerce activities on Facebook. For 
example, Soldsie ( soldsie.com ) can help you sell directly to 
your Facebook fans on Facebook through comments on your 
page 
(see 
 new.soldsie.com/how-it-works ). 
For

ShopSocially infographic that reveals strategies for proﬁ t-
able social commerce with Facebook, see  blog.shopsocially.
com/2014/05/15/facebook- drives-social-commerce/#.
VBEksPldWSo . Small businesses are also opening 
Facebook stores where customers can buy directly from the 
“shop” link on their Facebook page. Examples are 
NutriBullet ( facebook.com/thenutribullet ) and Sweet 
Blossom Gifts ( facebook.com/SweetBlossomGifts ), who 
are using Storefront Social to create their stores. (NutriBullet 
offers a “Buy” now button; Sweet Blossom Gifts offers a 
“Purchase” button.) Some musicians, including Lady Gaga, 
Muse, and Greenday have opened Facebook webstores. For 
an overview, see Porterﬁ eld et al. ( 2013 ). For how to add a 
store to a company’s Facebook page, see  ecwid.com/face-
book-commerce  and watch the video titled “Setting up a 
Store on Facebook to Sell Products” (7:24 minutes) at  you-
tube.com/watch?v=Q9IrJef7zDA . 
 Note: Many companies direct Facebook users from their 
pages to the companies’ own websites. Screen Print Designs 
only does business from their Facebook page (see  facebook.
com/screenprintdesigns ). 
 Shopping for Virtual Goods 
in a Virtual Economy 
 An increasing number of shoppers purchase all kinds of vir-
tual products and services online.  Virtual goods are com-
puter images of real or imaginary goods. These include, but 
are not limited to, properties and merchandise on Seconds 
Life (such as virtual mobile phones to equip your avatar), 
and a large number of items sold in multiplayer games on 
social networks (e.g., FarmVille on Facebook). According to 
eMarketer ( 2011 ), revenues from virtual goods in social 
6 Social Shopping: Concepts, Beneﬁ ts, and Models

147
gaming in the U.S. grew almost 60 % from $653 million in 
2011 to $792 million in 2012. 
 According to Wikipedia, “Virtual goods are non-physical 
objects and money purchased for use in online communities 
or online games … . Virtual money (or in-game currency) is 
used to purchase virtual goods within a variety of online 
communities, which include   social networking  websites,   vir-
tual worlds  , and   online gaming  sites” (see  en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Virtual_goods ). 
 The Virtual Economy 
 A  virtual economy is an emerging economy existing in 
several virtual worlds, where people exchange virtual 
goods frequently related to an Internet game or a virtual 
business. People go there primarily for entertainment. 
However, some people trade their virtual goods or proper-
ties. A virtual property can be any resource that is con-
trolled by virtual objects, avatars, or user accounts. 
According to Lehdonvirta and Ernkvist ( 2011 ), the term 
“virtual economy” was coined by Edward Castronova, 
and refers “to artiﬁ cial economies inside online games, 
especially when the artiﬁ cially scarce goods and curren-
cies of those economies [are] traded for real money.” For 
the characteristics of these properties, see  en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Virtual_economy . For how payments are made 
for virtual goods, see Takahashi ( 2011 ), and for an over-
view of Facebook Payments, see  developers.facebook.
com/docs/payments . For how one online game developer 
accepts payments for virtual goods in Bitcoins, see 
 coindesk.com/online-game-developer-bigpoint-now-
accepts-bitcoins- virtual-goods . 
In 
March 
2013, 
Facebook released ﬁ gures showing that there is a signiﬁ -
cant increase in the number of people paying to play 
social games, rising 24 % in 2012. Over 250 million desk-
top game users were playing games on Facebook, jump-
ing from 235 million in October 2012. Further research 
showed that in 2012, a total of $2 billion was paid to 
developers (see Womack  2013 ).  
 Why People Buy Virtual Goods 
 There are several reasons why people buy virtual goods. For 
example, many people in China buy virtual properties 
because they cannot afford to buy properties in the real world 
( online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703
804579380683402958724 ). According to Savitz ( 2011 ; in 
collaboration with Ben Perry), there are four major reasons 
for such purchases made in any country: 
 In fact, several real world retailers are promoting their vir-
tual goods in online games.  
 Real-Time Online Shopping 
 In real-time online shopping, shoppers can log onto a site 
and then either connect with Facebook or with another 
social network instantly from a smartphone or computer, 
or invite their friends and family via Twitter or e-mail. 
Friends shop online together  at the same time , exchanging 
ideas and comparing experiences (e.g., see Dugan  2010 ). 
For example, cosmetics company MAC has a feature 
called “Shop Together” that lets customers consult with 
their friends and family online for shopping help. The 
technology allows customers to shop with friends just like 
they are in a MAC store, only online. You can invite 
friends to chat with you at any time via Facebook, Twitter, 
IM, and e-mail. You can shop and chat at the same time, 
see what your friends are browsing, and recommend prod-
ucts to each other, all in real time. For more information, 
  1.  Generating special experiences.  Studies found 
(e.g., see Markman  2010 ) that some people can 
maximize their happiness by spending money on the 
experience they get in a virtual world rather than 
when spending money on physical goods. Happiness 
from a dinner or a movie does not last for a long 
time, but it makes us happy in the moment. The 
same is true with virtual goods, since they are expe-
riential in nature, but these can be very imaginative 
and beautiful, providing much more happiness.  
 2.  Generating emotions. Purchasing virtual goods 
often ﬁ lls emotional needs. In the virtual world, you 
can be whatever or whoever you always wanted to 
be, so people are willing to exchange real money 
for real emotions they ﬁ nd in the virtual goods. 
 3.  Small purchases make people happier. Making 
small and frequent purchases of virtual goods (for a 
small amount of money) makes many people hap-
pier than making infrequent purchases of larger 
physical goods. 
 4.  Virtual goods are low cost and low hassle. Virtual 
goods are among the cheapest form of entertain-
ment. There is no need to store virtual goods, main-
tain them, or be criticized about why you purchased 
them. In short—there is no hassle as long as one 
stays within one’s budget.

see  maccosmetics.com/cms/customer_service/shopto-
gether.tmpl . 
 Examples of real-time shopping platforms are: BevyUp 
(see  bevyup.com/about_us.html ) and Samesurf (see ( same-
surf.com/about.html ), which empowers multiple users to 
share their browsing experiences in real time. 
 Auctions in Social Shopping 
 There are several e-auction sites for social shoppers. The 
most well known is eBay ( ebay.com ). Other auction sites are: 
 Listia 
 According to Wikipedia, “Listia [ listia.com ] is a free online 
marketplace for trading goods between individuals, by using 
a virtual currency instead of real money. The marketplace 
uses an auction system where users bid on each other’s items 
until the auction ends and the highest bidder wins…. Users 
earn credits during sign-up and then continue to earn more as 
they place items in the marketplace. Purchasing credits is 
also an option, and is Listia’s main business model” ( en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Listia ). 
 Like some other auction sites, Listia experiences both 
complaints and responses to those complaints about fake 
bidding and cheating by the sellers, or even by the auction 
company (e.g., see  ripoffreport.com/auction-liquidators/
listia-inc/listia-inc-listia-com-the-auti-fbabc.htm ). For more 
on Listia, see Chaney ( 2011 ). 
 Tophatter 
 Tophatter ( tophatter.com ) is an entertaining virtual auction 
site that conducts live online auctions every day (sellers 
begin auctions every hour) where buyers and sellers can 
interact, chat, and transact in many categories. Tophatter 
sends their members a daily e-mail notifying them when a 
new auction is starting. For more information on Tophatter, 
see   techcrunch.com/2013/11/08/tophatter-android  and 
their Facebook page at  facebook.com/tophatter . 
 B2B Social Networking 
 B2B social marketers must deal with a number of issues. For 
a comprehensive guide to B2B, see Gillin and Schwartzman 
( 2011 ). In addition, you can listen to Schwartzman’s 2010 
podcast on the topic, available at  ontherecordpodcast.com/
pr/otro/B2B-social-networking.aspx . 
 Example: SAP 
 SAP ( sap.com ) is a large B2B software company with sev-
eral million members in its SAP Community Network 
(SCN). SCN is one of the most successful B2B and B2C 
enterprise networks for employees, business partners, fac-
ulty, students and experts. 
 As of September 2013, SCN ( 2014 ) had over 2,500,000 
registered members from 230 countries and territories, 
over 113,000 contributors, over 30,000 new members per 
month, 1.1 million newsletter subscribers, 2.1 million 
unique visitors per month, 110 million page views and con-
tributed content by 400,000 members. The network has 
over 500 SCN topic spaces, and over 15,000 discussion 
threads per month.  
 Zwilling ( 2011 ) presents nine location-based service 
(LBS) opportunities for B2B.  
 Virtual Visual Shopping 
 Many consumers are driven to impulse buying when they see 
interesting or new products in physical stores. Theoretically, 
online shoppers in 3-D environments might also make such 
purchases. 
 One aspect of 3D is its ability to put items into a more 
physical view than 2D does. A 3-D view of a house interior 
could help someone shopping for furniture visualize 
whether a large dining table would ﬁ t in the intended 
space. Consumers can experiment with the location of the 
virtual table and see how it will ﬁ t into their home before 
they buy it. 3-D platforms could take the guesswork out of 
buying many types of products online, ranging from furniture 
to clothes. 
 Example 
 Can you imagine looking at a computer screen where you 
can see yourself wearing a piece of clothing you have 
selected, exactly as you can in a physical clothing store’s 
ﬁ tting room? Now wave your hand and the color of the outﬁ t 
changes; wave your hand again and a dress will be shorter or 
longer. Another wave of your hand and another dress is on 
your virtual body. A dream? Not really, it is already here! To 
learn about this virtual “try-on” system, see Facecake 
Marketing Technology’s “Swivel” ( facecake.com/swivel ) 
and watch their video. For an illustration, watch the video 
titled “Tobi Virtual Dressing Room” (1:14 minutes) at  dai-
lymotion.com/video/xcg18d_tobi-virtual-dressing-

6 Social Shopping: Concepts, Beneﬁ ts, and Models

 Social Shopping in the Near Future 
 Imagine this scenario: A retailer will ask you to log in 
through Facebook on your mobile device as soon as you step 
into a physical store. (Many of Facebook’s partners have cus-
tom Facebook applications (Partner Apps) that users can 
download (see  facebook.com/mobile ). 
 In this way, users can receive  customized recommenda-
tions on their mobile phones. What about the risks? 
Privacy is a concern to many, but less important to millen-
nials who frequently share their experiences with others. 
In addition, sometimes people do not need to reveal their 
full identity on an in-store screen. Watch a related video 
titled “The Future of Shopping” (48 s) at  youtube.com/
watch?v=R_TAP0OY1Bk . 
 For example, according to Admin ( 2011 ), “when you walk 
into a dressing room [in a department store], the mirror 
reﬂ ects your image, but you also see images of the apparel 
item [you like] and [certain] celebrities wearing it on an inter-
active display [in the dressing room]. A webcam also projects 
an image of the consumer wearing the item on the website for 
everyone to see. This creates an interaction between the con-
sumers inside the store and their social network [friends] out-
side the store. The technology behind this system uses RFID 
[Radio Frequency Identiﬁ cation].” RFID technology has 
already been tried by the Prada store in New York City for 
showing customers which shoes and purses would go with the 
clothes they are trying on in the dressing room. You can watch 
a video titled “Future Store (Smart Dressing Room)” 
(2:53 minutes) of how a “smart” dressing room works at  you-
tube.com/watch?v=0VII- xdg5Ak&feature=related . Note 
that, due to privacy concerns, Prada (and other stores) discon-
tinued their RFID systems. 
 The concept of virtual shopping is expanding. A new 
Internet of Things technology enables the “smart ﬁ tting 
room.” The “Connected Fitting Room,” by Microsoft, 
Accenture, and Avanade, uses smart technology (RFID) to 
track what the customer tries on. With a push of a button, the 
customer can call for something else and the clerk will 
receive notiﬁ cation on his or her mobile device. As of June 
2014, the Connected Fitting Room is operating as a pilot 
program in the U.S. and the UK (see  fastcodesign.
com/3031689/microsofts-smart-fitting-room-is-like-a-
robo-shop- clerk  ). To read more about virtual shopping in 
the future, see  hufﬁ ngtonpost.com/2014/05/24/shopping-
in-the-future_n_5386395.html . 
 Instagram Marketing 
 According to Offerpop ( 2014 ), Instagram is revolutionizing 
the visual Web. With more than 300 million active monthly 
users and over 70 million photos shared each day (per  insta-
gram.com/press ), the commercial opportunities are unlim-
ited. For a marketing guide, see Offerpop ( 2014 ). 
 Facebook’s Plans 
 Facebook is expanding its social commerce advertising 
model to include social shopping. Most notable is the ‘Buy’ 
button, which Facebook introduced in 2014. This feature is 
designed to let shoppers purchase items directly from ads 
and posts they see on Facebook’s news feed and in mobile 
apps, without leaving Facebook (see Axelrad  2014 ). In 
September 2014, the “Buy” button was still in the testing 
phase. For beneﬁ ts of the ‘Buy’ button on Facebook and 
Twitter, see Bennett ( 2014 ). 
 Activities on Twitter 
 According to  archive.ﬁ nancialexpress.com/news/coming-
soon- to-twitter-facebook-click-to-buy-now/1271913 , “If 
you see a retailer’s tweet promoting a particular product and 
want to get the deal, you might soon be able to click a button 
or send a reply to simply add the discount to a stored credit 
card—without leaving Twitter’s site or ﬁ ring up another app. 
For the last couple of years, Twitter and American Express 
have offered AmEx cardholders the ability to load various 
discounts onto their cards through tweets. 
 The next logical step would be to allow users to click to 
buy a product, an idea that Twitter is also exploring, poten-
tially with the payment processing company Stripe.” 
 In May 2014, Twitter also began testing a “Buy” button 
for its users to make instant purchases (see  nytimes.
com/2014/09/09/technology/twitter-begins-testing-buy-
button- for-posts.html ). For more on using Twitter for 
e-business, see Krogue ( 2013 ). 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  Describe social shopping. Social shopping refers to 
online shopping that is supported by social media and 
involves friends and online social communities. It 
includes recommendations, group purchasing, clubs, and 
more. It also includes shopping on social networks, such 
as Facebook and Kaboodle, and using Web 2.0 tools to 
aid online shopping. The major drivers are the large num-
ber of people who are engaged in social networks, reli-
ance on the recommendations of friends, the possibility

of large discounts to buyers, the potential increase of sale 
volume for sellers, the socially-oriented shopping mod-
els, and the rise of the social customer. It looks as though 
the future of online commerce is socially oriented.  
 2.  Framework and models of social shopping. Social 
shopping is done in social networks (public and private), 
social communities, and social marketplaces, as well as 
in virtual worlds. The shopping mechanisms are similar 
to those of e-commerce (Turban et al.  2015 ) and 
e- marketing (Strauss and Frost  2014 ). What makes social 
shopping unique is the social media aspects and the inno-
vative business models. The major models are daily 
deals, group buying (which may be combined with daily 
deals); providing reviews, recommendations, ratings, 
and conversation; shopping clubs and communities; 
location-based shopping; peer-to-peer trading; Facebook 
commerce (F-commerce); and shopping while you tweet. 
Groupon, Gilt, Kaboodle, and hundreds of other start-
ups are active participants. Competition is getting stron-
ger, and success is visible mostly on Facebook and 
Twitter (both sites are just starting to implement the 
“Buy” button), and Pinterest (which recently partnered 
with Shopify).   
 3.  Group buying and deal purchases. Social media is 
enabling the revitalization of group buying, which can be 
combined with the “deal of the day” offer. Buyers are 
encouraged to tell their friends and recruit them to buy the 
daily deal(s). If successful, the original buyer will get an 
even larger discount, and so will the group when it is large 
enough (“cheaper-by-the-dozen”). This model is mostly 
successful in China; unfortunately, it has not been yet in 
the US. The ‘daily deals’ model, which has many varia-
tions and is the backbone of Groupon, is much more pop-
ular. Vendors have a chance to boost revenue while buyers 
enjoy the discounts. The biggest winner is the intermedi-
ary. This is why stiff competition is developing among 
intermediaries such as Groupon. There is intense compe-
tition in this area, both from vendors who are selling 
direct, and from local newspapers, TV, and specialized 
companies such as iDine ( idine.com ), a loyalty program 
that rewards consumers with beneﬁ ts and discounts when 
they dine out at participating restaurants.  
 4.  Shopping communities and clubs.  Shopping together in 
the physical world is a popular activity. Usually, it is done 
with family members and friends. Online, shopping 
together can be done in different ways. The most popular 
method involves communities, managed by an indepen-
dent company, which provide many services and opportu-
nities. Fashion-oriented communities such as Polyvore 
are very popular. The communities provide opportunities 
for designers to create designs and see how much the 
communities like them. 
 Social clubs limit membership, but they operate in a 
similar manner to open communities. Communities and 
clubs may be structured as marketplaces, or operate as 
referral services, generating income per click by potential 
buyers who click on the sellers’ logo. They may also 
receive a commission from actual purchases. 
 5.  Social recommendations and marketplaces. Social 
buyers like  social recommendations made by friends, 
family members, and other shoppers. Social shoppers 
may also like reading negative comments (see reputa-
tion management in Chap.   5 ). Recommendations can be 
combined with reviews, rankings, price comparisons, 
and so forth. There are several different ways that rec-
ommendations can be made (some in communities, oth-
ers on special sites). Recommendations are also made 
by bloggers and may even be posted on sellers’ sites 
(e.g., travel sites, Amazon.com, etc.). In certain cases, 
recommendations are more trustworthy if made by 
experts or independent evaluators. Family members and 
friends are usually the most inﬂ uencing parties. 
Recommendation sites use several incentives to attract 
buyers. This revenue model is frequently sponsored by 
advertisers (pay for clicks on the sellers’ banners) and 
from commission on actual shopping resulting from the 
click throughs. Several models exist. 
 Social marketplaces bring sellers and buyers together 
and provide the services necessary for conducting trans-
actions. Marketplaces may exist in social communities 
and on other networking sites. Some marketplaces help 
sellers 
create 
innovative 
products 
and 
services. 
Marketplaces are sometimes conﬁ ned to a certain com-
modity, industry, or profession. They use different sup-
port mechanisms as well, including negotiations and 
auctions. Like communities, marketplaces encourage 
interaction and building relationships. They also provide 
shopping aids such as search engines, payment mecha-
nisms, and order fulﬁ llment. 
 6.  Innovative shopping models. There are many innovative 
social shopping models. Notable ones are social auctions, 
trading for virtual goods, virtual visual shopping, shop-
ping together in real time, crowdsourcing shopping (get-
ting advice from the crowd), selling via blogs, and direct 
selling by artists. 
 7.  Shopping for virtual goods.  As social networking 
games have mushroomed in popularity, people are 
spending more money on buying virtual goods. The 
most popular transactions are game-related, such as 
buying virtual farming tools in FarmVille (a Facebook 
game) and properties in virtual worlds (e.g., Seconds 
Life). People of all ages may like virtual goods because 
of their ability to provide unique experiences, and for 
their low price (you can buy an island or a factory for

only a few dollars). Furthermore, satisfaction can be 
great and privacy is usually guaranteed. People can 
make their dreams come true, quickly and inexpensively. 
This has created a billion- dollar industry. Legality, taxa-
tion, and payments for virtual goods trading are still 
evolving issues.

Internet Exercises

  TEAM ASSIGNMENTS AND PROJECTS 
 1.  Assignment for the Opening Case 
 Read the opening case and answer the following 
questions:
  (a)  It is difﬁ cult for merchants to do business with 
Groupon. A large percentage of merchants’ applica-
tions to do business with Groupon is dismissed by the 
company. Why do you think Groupon is so strict and 
how will this policy affect the competition? 
 (b)  Some claim that Groupon is an e-mail list that charges 
advertisers a marketing fee to send out their coupons. 
Comment. Note that Groupon makes money by 
charging a marketing fee for advertising and promot-
ing vendors’ offers. In most cases, that fee is a per-
centage of the revenue generated by selling via 
Groupon. (Start with:  grouponworks.com/articles/
groupon/overview/business-model/how-groupon-
makes-money .) 
  (c)  Write a short essay on Groupon’s chance of survival 
in the intensely competitive environment. Examine 
its revenue model and expansion plans. Check stock 
market analysts’ reports about the company. 
 (d)  Groupon is changing its business model again, mov-
ing from coupons to discount sales. Study this busi-
ness model. Write a report. 
  (e)  Learn more about Groupon’s order fulﬁ llment (e.g., 
ability to handle volume, control of deliveries, and 
dealing with marketing and competitors). Write a 
report. 
  (f)  Research Groupon’s global efforts. Write a report. 
   (g)  Groupon also deals in B2B. Search the Internet and 
ﬁ nd out how this is being done and how successful it is. 
 (h)  Read Phibbs’ ( 2011 ) book (Kindle edition) and 
debate the following issues: Are deep discounts good 
or bad for sellers? What are some of the disadvan-
tages to merchants? What are the advantages? 
 2.  The class will investigate group buying in China and 
India. What is the prospect for group buying in Asia? 
(Start with   businesstoday.intoday.in/story/websites-
specialising- in-group-buying-deals-future/1/198416.
html  ). Why are group buying sites in India succeeding? 
 3.  Shopping communities for fashion are exploding on the 
Internet. Make a list of ten major sites (e.g., Polyvore, 
ShopStyle, Pintere s t, My It Things, etc.). Investigate their 
activities and list their competitive advantage. Why is this 
industry a prime setting for social communities? How are 
they related to Facebook and Twitter? What are their busi-
ness and revenue models? Write a summary report. 
 4.  Each group will research one publicly traded social com-
merce company (e.g., Groupon, Pandora, TripAdvisor, 
Bazaarvoice, Yelp). Check competition, stock perfor-
mance, revenue sources, and so forth. Also check the 
major Chinese companies listed on the US stock 
exchanges (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, etc.). Use informa-
tion from   ﬁ nance.yahoo.com  ,  google.com/ﬁ nance , 
 bloomberg.com , and so forth. Write a summary report. 
 5.  The issue of the viability of Groupon and similar sites is 
highly debatable (e.g., Buehler  2012 ; Srinivasan  2011 ). 
Follow Groupon’s ﬁ nancial performance, conduct a 
 literature search, and debate the issue. Read  fool.com/
investing/general/2014/09/08/why-groupon-inc-stock-
has-plunged-40-in-2014.aspx . Write a summary report. 
 6.  Shopping clubs are gaining popularity. Review the list 
provided at  stream-recorder.com/forum/list-american- 
private-shopping-clubs-sample-sale-t12846.html . Visit 
these and similar sites. Also visit  ﬁ vefourclothing.com . 
Classify the clubs, and list their major features.  
 7.  Ratings and reviews are popular aids in social 
shopping. Compare  yelp.com ,  angieslist.com ,  trip
advisor.com , and two other sites of your choice. 
Concentrate on their capabilities. In addition, ﬁ nd the rev-
enue sources of each site. 
  8.  Learn “How to Create a Facebook Business Page 2014

 OPENING CASE: HOW SONY USES SOCIAL 
MEDIA FOR IMPROVING CRM 
 Sony, the giant consumer electronics producer, has been 
struggling during the last few years. Now, by using social 
media improvement is in sight.  
 The Problem 
 Sony Corporation ( sony.com ) faces ﬁ erce competition from 
Samsung, Sharp Electronics, LG Electronics, and other 
large, global companies. This competition has intensiﬁ ed 
during the economic slowdown in recent years. As a result, 
total revenues for Sony declined every year from 2008 until 
2012. The company suffered heavy losses in 2009 and 2012, 
causing its share price to drop from $35/share in 2010 and 
2011 to $9.57 in late 2012. In 2013 the stock rose mostly due 
to the recovery in Tokyo’s stock exchange. Consumer elec-
tronic products are fairly mature, so the differences in quality 
and prices are not substantial. Therefore, the competitors in 
the ﬁ eld are promoting their customer service as a strategic 
differentiator. Sony is trying to do this with the help of their 
social media communities and initiatives.  

156
 The Solution: Social Media Projects 
 Sony Corporation embarked on social CRM as a vehicle for 
improving customer service in April 2013. According to Jack 
( 2013 ), Sony combined a customer support and direct mar-
keting program, mostly using social channels. The various 
initiatives are managed by Sony’s Customer Experience 
Management Team. The team organized  Sony’s Community 
Site ( community.sony.com ), which is a central hub for cus-
tomer information and support. It includes  idea boards, dis-
cussion 
groups, 
blogs, 
Twitter 
feeds , 
and 
other 
content-generating channels. The site is used also for mar-
keting campaigns. 
 The following are representative activities, many of 
which are done at Sony Europe (see Taylor  2013 ).
•  Active social communities; some are for speciﬁ c prod-
ucts, others are general for the entire Sony brand. The 
company’s staff members and consumers are involved in 
these communities. Members of these communities are 
helping each other and providing feedback. Customer ser-
vice employees are “listening” to the feedback and using 
the information to improve service.  
•  YouTube videos provide training for customers on the use 
of Sony’s products. 
•  Using Lithium Social Web software (a SAP company), rel-
evant sites are monitored for reviews and comments 
(positive and negative). This allows Sony to improve oper-
ations, resolve problems, and capitalize on opportunities.  
•  There is a special “Customer Relations” tab located on 
Sony’s Community site, the company’s central social net-
work, for easy communication.  
•  The company created a ‘Facebook Support Community’ 
( facebook.com/sony ), Twitter ‘Sony Support USA’ ( twit-
ter.com/sonysupportusa ), Tumblr ‘Sony Support USA’ 
(  sonysupportusa.tumblr.com  ), and a YouTube Sony 
Support Channel ‘Sony Listens’ ( youtube.com/user/
SonyListens ). 
•  In the communities, the company’s staff demonstrates 
how problems are resolved quickly and efﬁ ciently. For 
example, there is an “Experts” tab for “How To” videos 
and technical support, and so forth. See  community.sony.
com/t5/Meet-Our-Experts/bg-p/experts . 
•  Sony is using all its social media channels, including 
LinkedIn, to proactively engage users and provide cus-
tomer service in a timely fashion.  
•  Sony Electronic integrates Pinterest ( pinterest.com/sony-
prousa ) to send information about its products to commu-
nity members (see details in Eckerle  2013 and 
 ohsopinteresting.com/lessons-from-sony-on-pinterest ). 
 According to Holland ( 2011 ), Sony mines social media 
conversations and conducts sentiment analysis (Chap.   10  ) to 
improve customer service and product improvements and 
design. Note that Sony is using social media campaigns to 
engage customers (e.g., 2011 ‘CatchTheTablet’ campaign; 
see  atomicpr.com/results/sony-catch-the-tablet ). Finally, 
according to Revoo (2011), software from Reevoo helps 
Sony automatically translate reviews from one language to 
another. 
 The Results 
 Signiﬁ cant results were realized in 2014 after the deployment 
of most SC initiatives. However, some improvements have 
materialized earlier. For example, according to Jack ( 2013 ), 
the improved communication resulted in a 22 % increase in 
‘clicks’ (over 100 % in some cases). Other results are:
•  Customers’ trust in Sony increased (Jack  2013 ). 
•  Page views, conversation volume, and engagement activ-
ities (e.g., posting) increased by 100 % (Jack  2013 ). 
•  Customer service was combined with marketing promo-
tions, which resulted in new sources of revenue for Sony. 
•  In March 2014, PlayStation had about 2.5 million follow-
ers on Twitter and 35 million fans Facebook.

7.1 
 DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS 
OF CRM, E-CRM, AND SOCIAL CRM 
 It is well known that customers are the revenue engine of 
most organizations. Without customers, there would be no 
business. Therefore, customers must receive outstanding  service. 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 The Sony case illustrates that a company can use social 
media to not only advertise and sell, but also to provide 
outstanding customer service. Operating in a highly 
competitive market, customer service can be an impor-
tant strategic differentiator. Sony has supplemented 
their traditional customer service with social networks, 
blogs, Twitter, and a Facebook fan page. They have 
concentrated on improving communication and inter-
actions with customers. The customer service provided 
via social media tools and platforms is more interac-
tive, timely, and direct. Furthermore, the system fos-
ters a truly conversation-based communication. This 
kind of service is important to customers, and contrib-
utes to the company’s success. In this chapter, we con-
centrate on social CRM. 
7 Social Customer Service and CRM

157
In today’s world, highly valued customers receive even more 
attention. 
 The customer care ﬁ eld is undergoing a signiﬁ cant trans-
formation, both in the way that customer service profession-
als conduct business and in the way that customers interact 
with companies that use the Social Web. The implementation 
of social media has altered both the expectations of custom-
ers and the way corporations provide customer service (as 
the growth of e-mail did many years ago). 
 At ﬁ rst, one may think that there is not much connection 
between customer service and social commerce. In fact, the 
opposite is probably true. For an overview, Lacy et al. ( 2013 ). 
 How Social Networks Empower Customers 
 It is said that one angry tweet can torpedo a brand, but one 
sweet tweet can correct a problem (Bernoff and Schadler 
 2010 ). According to Sysomos Inc. ( 2011 ) and  parature.com/
lp/report-2014-state-multichannel-cs-survey-comm.html , 
more than 65 % of all customers have ended relationships 
with vendors due to what they perceived to be poor customer 
service. Let us examine how one angry customer used 
Facebook in an attempt to change one company’s policy. 
 Example: How Facebook’s Chorus Ended 
the Instrument Luggage Ban at Qantas Airways 
of Australia 
 Qantas Airways had a policy that required large musical instru-
ments to be stored in the cargo hold, which would sometimes 
cause damage to the instruments. In fall 2010, after suffering 
$1,200 in damages to her saxophone, Jamie Oehlers of Australia 
organized a Facebook campaign to persuade the airline to 
reverse the policy. When one person complains, the company’s 
standard response is to send the customer a letter of apology, 
but usually the policy does not change. However, more than 
8,700 people (including members of the country’s symphony 
orchestras) joined forces on Facebook by posting similar inci-
dents and pictures of damaged instruments and saying they 
would boycott Qantas if the airline did not change their policy. 
Qantas announced that they listened to their customers, and in 
December 2010, amended the policy, allowing any instrument 
in a hard-shelled case on board, provided it falls within the 
airline’s length and weight restrictions (based on a news item 
from Staff Writers  2010 ). Alternatively, one may purchase a 
seat for a large instrument and carry it as a bulky item. (For 
information about Qantas’s new policy, see  qantas.com.au/
travel/airlines/carry-on-baggage/global/en ).  
 This story is not unique; similar stories frequently appear 
in the media. A well-known case from 2008 is ‘United Breaks 
Guitars,’ the saga of a musician named Dave Carroll who 
ﬂ ew United Airlines with his guitar, only to have it broken. 
Carroll and his bandmates were sitting at the rear of the air-
craft waiting to deplane, when the United baggage handlers 
threw Carroll’s $3,500 guitar, with little care, causing it to 
break. After nine months of a series of e-mails and telephone 
calls, the airline’s representative told Carroll that United 
refused to take responsibility. Carroll offered them a settle-
ment of $1,200 in ﬂ ight vouchers, to cover his salvage costs 
repairing his guitar, which was rejected. Carroll, however, 
realized that as a musician and songwriter, he was not with-
out options. He told the United representative that he would 
be writing three songs about his experience with United 
Airlines. He would then make videos for these songs and 
offer them for free download on YouTube and his own web-
site. Carroll’s goal was to get one million hits on YouTube, 
but the ﬁ rst song, titled “United Breaks Guitars,” became a 
viral sensation and surpassed 150,000 views the ﬁ rst day and 
over three million views in just 10 days. In August 2009, 
Carroll and his band released “United Breaks Guitars: Song 
2” that has surpassed over 1,700,000 views as of January 
2014, and in 2010, he released the ﬁ nal chapter, “United 
Breaks Guitars Song 3: ‘United We Stand,’” which has gar-
nered over 672,000 views as of January 2014. The original 
“United Breaks Guitars” song has been watched by over 
13,700,000 people as of January 2014 (see  youtube.com/
watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo ). 
 Since the whole debacle and the release of the songs and 
videos, Carroll has published a book about his experience 
and has become a public speaker. (Watch the video from 
Dave Carroll’s presentation given at the Brite 2010 confer-
ence titled “Dave Carroll: Lessons from ‘United Breaks 
Guitars’” (20:14 minutes) at  youtube.com/watch?v=_
Hd8XI42i2M to learn more about how United changed its 
ways, and the lessons for customer service in an age of social 
media.) 
Also 
see 
  mashable.com/2012/02/02/united-
breaks- guitars-gripevine  . In addition, in February 2012, 
Carroll helped launch a customer service platform called 
  Gripevine  ( gripevine.com ); a forum for disgruntled custom-
ers to post their complaints and bad experiences they have 
had with companies. Gripevine’s automated response tech-
nology notiﬁ es the company and invites them to the site to 
review the gripe, giving both parties an opportunity to work 
towards a positive resolution. 
 In another example, a customer named Heather Armstrong 
complained that Maytag (appliances) customer service was 
unhelpful about her new broken washing machine. Frustrated 
with her experience, Armstrong told the unhelpful customer 
service representative that she has over 10,000 followers on 
Twitter. They did pay attention to her only after she tweeted 
about her nightmare experience with the company. Within a 
day, she received a telephone call from their parent compa-
ny’s corporate ofﬁ ce, and the next day her washer was work-
ing. In the past, customer complaints usually received little 
or no attention, even when customers threatened to publish 
7.1 Deﬁ nitions and Concepts of CRM, E-CRM, and Social CRM

158
their complaint on the Internet. Armstrong said that “Twitter 
has become a tool to ‘empower’ customers like her—once a 
company ﬁ gures out she has a listening audience (in this 
case, her 10,000 Twitter followers), it’ll need to listen and 
act” (see Olson  2009 ). 
 These examples show how, at the most basic level of cus-
tomer service, social media acts as a “social telephone” (see 
Sysomos Inc.  2011 ). 
 Today, when a customer says, “I will organize a cam-
paign against your company on Facebook or Twitter,” you 
can be sure that someone at the company will pay attention. 
An empowered customer is a major driver of social CRM 
(Bernoff and Schadler  2010 ). Chapter   5 reveals how com-
panies handle their reputations when under attack in the 
social media.  
 Deﬁ ning CRM and E-CRM 
 Three basic concepts are important for an understanding of 
this chapter: CRM, e-CRM, and social CRM (SCRM). 
 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
 Customer relationship management (CRM) is an approach 
that focuses on acquiring customers and building long-term 
and sustainable relationships that add value to the customers 
as well as the organizations. There are several other deﬁ ni-
tions of CRM. For example, according to Greenberg ( 2009 ), 
“CRM is a philosophy and a business strategy, supported by 
a technology platform, business rules, processes and social 
characteristics, designed to engage the customer in a collab-
orative conversation in order to provide mutually beneﬁ cial 
value in a trusted and transparent business environment.” 
Petersen ( 2012 ) provides 16 deﬁ nitions of CRM, by 21 
experts, some in words and some in pictures. 
 Note: CRM is only one way to deal with customer rela-
tionship and care. Traditional marketing activities, such as 
providing promotions, have been used for a long time in 
business. However, CRM adds functionalities that were not 
available before. 
 Characteristics of Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) 
 According to Greenberg ( 2009 ), “CRM is an integrated busi-
ness model and a set of operating practices coordinated and 
aligned to maximize revenue from targeted customers. CRM 
is based on the assumption that customers are the core of a 
business, and that a company’s success depends on effec-
tively managing its relationships with them.” The term  rela-
tionship is unclear. Does it require an emotional attachment 
or bond between the parties in the relationship? Do the par-
ties have to be interdependent on one another? To some 
degree, the answers are yes. In this chapter, a relationship 
exists if there are a series of interactive episodes between 
two or more parties over time.

studyguide.com/features-of-crm.htm . 
 Deﬁ ning e-CRM 
 Today, most CRM programs, applications, and services 
depend heavily on IT more than they did prior to the advent 
of the Web in 1993. The IT-supported programs constitute 
part of what is known as  electronic CRM (e-CRM). 
 Electronic customer relationship management (e-CRM) ; 
also known as  CRM 1.0 ) is the electronically delivered set 
of tools that helps manage CRM. E-CRM is related to all 
forms of managing relationships with customers when using 
information technologies. It arises from the consolidation of 
traditional CRM with the e-business applications, and it cov-
ers the broad range of information technologies used to sup-
port a company’s CRM strategy. For the difference between 
CRM and e-CRM, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECRM and 
Beal ( undated ). 
 However, since nearly all CRM practices use some IT, the 
terms  CRM and  e-CRM are used interchangeably by many. 
Numerous CRM software packages are available. For a 
review of 40 top CRM software packages including cloud- 
based see  crmsoftwareview.org/2014reviews . For the top 
ten vendors of 2014, see  crm-software-review.toptenre-
views.com . For more in e-CRM, see Online Tutorial T1. 
 A growing component in e-CRM is social CRM. 
 What Is Social CRM? 
 Social CRM is one component of developing a social 
 business. It is practiced very differently by various 
organizations. 
 Deﬁ nition 
 According to Roebuck ( 2011 ),  social customer relation-
ship management ( SCRM) also known as  CRM 2.0 , is 
CRM supported by social media (e.g., Web 2.0 tools, 
social  network sites, as demonstrated in the opening case), 
which are designed to engage customers in conversations, 
sharing, and other interactions in order to provide beneﬁ ts 
to all  participants and increase trust. SCRM is based on 
7 Social Customer Service and CRM

159
social media, in support of companies’ stated goals and 
objectives of optimizing the customer’s experience, and 
building trust and loyalty, see Huba ( 2013 ). Success 
requires considering people, business processes, and tech-
nology associated with the interactions between customers 
and enterprises. 
 SCRM is an extension of CRM, not a replacement (see 
 the56group.typepad.com/pgreenblog/2009/07/time-to- 
put-a-stake-in-the-ground-on-social-crm.html ). It adds 
two dimensions: social media and people. It is designed to 
engage customers in conversations using social media tools. 
An important goal of SCRM is to add beneﬁ ts to the sellers 
(e.g., increased trust, loyalty, and sales from their customers) 
and to the customers (e.g., better, quicker service; more 
engagement; product improvements). SCRM is the segment 
of business strategy that addresses the issue of how compa-
nies adapt to the  social customers and their expectations 
regarding the companies with which they conduct business. 
SCRM evolved from CRM (and e-CRM) in a process that is 
described in Sect.  7.3 , and in Chess Media Group ( 2010 ; in 
collaboration with Lieberman). For a detailed presentation of 
this process and an overview of social CRM, download the 
free “Guide to Understanding Social CRM” at  chessmedia-
group.com/research/white-papers . For comprehensive 
coverage of social CRM, see Roebuck ( 2011 ), Lacy et al. 
( 2013 ), and Fagan ( 2014 ). 
 The Elements of Social CRM 
 The major elements and characteristics of SCRM are shown 
in Fig.  7.1 . As the ﬁ gure illustrates, the characteristics are the 
foundations of a social customer who is driven by social net-
working. As described in Chap.   1 , the social customer’s 
needs are different from those of the customer who does not 
use social media. Social customers, for example, want to 
communicate with vendors by using the Internet (e.g., see 
Metz  2011 ). This communication is provided by social 
media, which is the major element of social CRM. The social 
environment is also a major element of social CRM, since it 
is the source of interactions with the social customer (see 
Sect.  7.4 ).
 The Beneﬁ ts of Social CRM 
 This new breed of customers (the social customer) places 
new demands on organizations. However, social media tools 
can meet these demands nicely, usually at a low cost (except 
for staff time). Social media provides for engagement and 
collaboration that eventually results in a competitive advan-
tage to the organization if implemented properly. 
 Social CRM offers the following potential beneﬁ ts to cus-
tomers (“c”) and enterprise (“e”) in the list below.

 (Note: Several of these are illustrated in Case  7.1 iRobot,

marked with an (“I”.) 
 Petersen ( 2011 ) illustrates the beneﬁ ts of social CRM in 
16 case studies. Minkara and Pinder Jr. (2014) describe the 
strategic advantage provided by CRM. 
 An article by Tiffany Brown (at  tiffanyabrown.word-

elements of the SCRM process.

 The Projected Growth of Social CRM 
 The beneﬁ ts of SCRM and the projected growth of social 
media in general have led researchers to believe that SCRM 
will grow exponentially during the next few years. According 
to Valentine ( 2011 ), SCRM IT expenditures grow at an 
annual rate of 30 %. Gartner Inc. projected that social CRM 
software, which accounted for merely 5 % of the total CRM 
software in 2010, will account for 30 % of the total CRM IT 
spending in 2015. 
 Enterprises practice SCRM in a variety of ways, includ-
ing hosting and supporting social communities, monitoring 
conversations in a social network, and facilitating informa-
tion sharing in social networks. 
 A major condition required for this growth to occur is the 
need to provide clearer and measurable beneﬁ ts for both cus-
tomer service and sales. In addition, companies and software 
vendors need to provide close integration with traditional 
CRM processes.

 A CRM MODEL FOR CUSTOMER 
INTERACTIONS 
 Before we describe the social SCRM ﬁ eld, let us look at the 
ways that customers interact with CRM applications and 
with enterprises. 
 The Patricia Seybold Group Model 
for Customer Interactions 
 The Patricia Seybold Group ( customers.com ) focuses on 
CRM, e-CRM, and social CRM from the customer’s point of 
view, where a customer is viewed as being interested in a 
simpliﬁ ed, straightforward, honest, consistent interaction 
and relationship with a company. Toward this end, SCRM 
focuses on applications used to make it easy for a customer 
to communicate, engage, and collaborate with a company. 
The Patricia Seybold Group distinguishes between  customer- 
facing ,  customer-touching ,  customer-centric intelligence, 
and  online networking applications. 
•  Drives quick resolution of customers’ problems (c) 
•  Provides for effective and efﬁ cient business—cus-
tomer collaboration (c), (e) 
•  Improves the reputation of companies (e), (I) 
•  Provides better understanding of customer needs 
and wants (e) 
•  Provides focused, intuitive, and easy-to-use CRM 
applications (e) 
•  Provides better marketing, better targeting, and 
improved products/services due to customers’ cre-
ation of content, and WOM (e) 
•  Provides customer input for market research at a 
quicker rate and at a low cost for improving prod-
ucts and customer service (e) 
•  Provides customers with more information about 
products/services quickly (c), (I) 
•  Increases trust and loyalty (e) 
•  Provides a more complete view of the customer 
than what traditional CRM can provide (e)  
•  Decreases overall customer care costs (e.g., through 
self-helping communities) (e) 
•  Enables salespeople to ﬁ nd sales leads quickly and 
easily (e) 
•  Develops new revenue opportunities and turn new 
customers into repeat customers (c) 
•  Increases CRM staff productivity by teaching them 
to use analytics and collaboration 2.0 techniques (e) 
•  Improves employee performance by beneﬁ ting from 
knowledge sharing gained in social networks (e)  
•  Improves customer satisfaction by providing them 
with opportunities for engagement using social 
media platforms (c), (I) 
•  Converts leads to opportunities with more effective 
campaigns (e)

 The above four categories of applications are used to

chapter and Roebuck ( 2011 ).

com/articles/the-ﬁ ve-waves-of-crm .  
 Customer-Facing Applications 
 Customer-facing applications make extensive use of social 
media. For deﬁ nitions and examples, see  amduus.com/
cms/?q = node/66 and  searchcrm.techtarget.com/ deﬁ nition/
customer-facing . 
 A primary application of customer-facing CRM is in 
 multichannel call centers , otherwise known as  customer 
interaction centers . (See the free e-book titled  25 Social 
Media Statistics for the Call Center at  fonolo.com/
ebook-25-social-media-statistics-for-the-call-center .) 
 Customer Interaction Centers 
 A  customer interaction center (CIC) is a comprehensive 
customer service entity in which enterprises take care of 
 customer service issues communicated through various con-
tact channels; see  searchcrm.techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/
contact- center  . These include social media channels such as 
blogs and forums in social networks. A  multichannel CIC 
works like this: (1) A customer makes contact via one or 
more channels. (2) The system monitors the contacts and 
integrates than within a database, then determines an appro-
priate service response. (3) The system directs the customer 
to self-service, an avatar, or to a live agent. (4) The service is 
provided to the customer (e.g., the customer’s problem is 
resolved or the question is answered). For images and info-
graphics, search Google Images for: customer interaction 
center. 
 An example of a well-managed integrated call center is 
iRobot’s customer support group. The center, which pro-
vides a myriad of cross-channel customer touch points, is 
detailed in Case  7.1 . As the case shows, social media pro-
vides several channels of customer support. For more exam-
ples of CICs and call centers, see  callcenterops.com . 
 Case 7.1 
 SC Application 
 iRobot Uses Social Media for Multichannel CRM 
 iRobot ( irobot.com ), which was founded in 1990 by three 
roboticists at MIT with the vision of making practical robots 
a reality, designs and builds some of the world’s most impor-
tant robots. According to their website, in 2013, iRobot gen-
erated $487 million in revenue and employed more than 500 
of the robot industry’s top professionals, including mechani-
cal, electrical and software engineers and related support 
staff. (See  iRobot.com/us/Company/About.aspx .) iRobot 
makes robots for the government, defense and security, mili-
tary and civil defense forces worldwide, commercial appli-
cations, industries, and home use. The public is mostly 
familiar with the Roomba vacuuming robot (see Dignan 
 2013 ). Due to the technical nature of its products, the com-
pany’s customers may require specialized support and ser-
vice. On their customer care website, the company provides 
self-diagnosis, support videos, live chat, product FAQs, and 
more (e.g., see  homesupport.irobot.com ). However, 
there are home market customers who may need more 
 1.  Customer-facing applications. These include all 
the areas where customers interact with the com-
pany: social media channels; call centers, including 
help desks; sales force automation; and ﬁ eld service 
automation. Such CRM applications automate 
information ﬂ ow and support employees in sales or 
service while they interact with customers. Web 2.0 
tools are used here to facilitate interactions. 
 2.  Customer-touching applications. In this category, 
customers interact directly with the applications, 
rather than through a company representative. 
Notable examples are self-service activities, such 
as using FAQs and involvement in content creation. 
Several applications in social networks belong to 
this category. For example, crowdsourcing can be 
used to create FAQs. 
 3.  Customer-centric 
intelligence 
applications. 
These are applications that analyze the results of 
operations and performance and use the results of 
this analysis to improve CRM activities and proce-
dures. Web analytics, sentiment analysis, and social 
analytics (Chap.   10 ) are the prime tools in this case. 
 4.  Online networking applications. Online net-
working refers to methods that provide the oppor-
tunity to build  personal relationships with a wide 
range of people. Social CRM support includes chat 
rooms, blogs, wikis, discussion forums, and social 
network sites.

technical assistance since many people are new at using robots. 
The company’s objective is to expand the sale of home mar-
ket products. Therefore, they must provide extensive assis-
tance to inexperienced customers. The company supports a 
community and provides discussion boards, community 
search capability, and live chat. 
 Social CRM: Serve the Customers While Learning 
from Them  
 iRobot utilizes a CRM system with the help of Oracle 
RightNow Inc. (see  oracle.com/us/products/applications/
rightnow/overview/index.html ). The system enables cus-
tomers to contact iRobot’s service group via several different 
communication channels, including e-mail, live chat, social 
networks, and Web self-service. This way, iRobot can 
respond to any online customer communication in a timely 
manner, regardless of the channel used. All this needs to be 
done at a low cost; therefore, it is necessary to automate the 
services as much as possible. 
 Speciﬁ c Social Media Activities 
 iRobot customers can post service and support requests or 
complaints on  homesupport.irobot.com  or they can contact 
the help desk. The company monitors these messages and tries 
to provide immediate responses. iRobot tries to ﬁ nd the identity 
of the customers that have problems by monitoring relevant 
conversations in the various social channels (e.g., in forums on 
social networks conversations). Once identiﬁ ed, iRobot com-
municates with the customers privately to resolve the issues. 
 The social media-oriented activities are integrated with 
documents and videos in a knowledge base managed by 
RightNow. The company uses RightNow’s monitoring tools 
to identify the customers who post the comments. Some cus-
tomers may provide their real names. Anonymous customers 
are encouraged to contact iRobot directly. For how the company 
listens to social media, see  informationweek.com/software/
social/roomba-robots-listen-to-social-media/d/d-id/1100404? 
 Responding to issues quickly is important because, as dis-
cussed earlier, customers can attract a considerable amount 
of attention using Facebook or Twitter (the company runs 
promotions, such as giveaways and games on Twitter), to 
publicize their complaints. In addition to problem resolution, 
the company gets valuable feedback from the customers so it 
can improve its products and services. 
 By 2013, iRobot achieved a 97 % Web service rating, 
realized a 30 % reduction in customer phone calls, and pro-
vided improved customer service at a 20 % reduced cost. 
 iRobot has a presence on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, 
YouTube, and Tumblr. The company uses these sites to dissemi-
nate information and collect customer feedback and complaints.

 THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL CRM 
 Now that you have a basic understanding of CRM, e-CRM, 
and SCRM, we can look at the evolution of SCRM as well as 
some differences between SCRM and e-CRM. SCRM can be 
viewed as an extension of e-CRM. Most e-CRM software 
companies, such as Salesforce Inc. ( salesforce.com ), offer 
social media features in their products. However, there are 
some 
signiﬁ cant 
differences 
between 
e-CRM 
and 
SCRM. These differences can be seen at  slideshare.net/
JatinKalra/e-crm-112520123741 and Cipriani ( 2008 ). 
 Cipriani’s Multidimensional Presentation 
 Fabio Cipriani ( 2008 ) outlines the difference between CRM 
and SCRM (referred to as CRM 1.0 and CRM 2.0) along sev-
eral dimensions. Figures  7.2 ,  7.3 ,  7.4 ,  7.5 , and  7.6 show ﬁ ve of 
these dimensions: landscape, customer touch points, business 
processing modeling, technology, and organizational mindset.
 The Landscape 
 The landscape describes the difference between CRM 1.0 
and CRM 2.0 in the structure, focus, relationship with the 
community, and value creation, as illustrated in Fig.  7.2 . 
 Notice that in CRM 2.0, the community is larger than in 
CRM, and it includes interconnections among the customers 
that were not present online in the early days of CRM.  
 Touch Points 
 The term  touch point refers to any point of interaction a cus-
tomer has with a brand or seller. Some points are company 
initiated (e.g., advertising or e-mail discussions) and others 
are out of the company’s control, such as word-of-mouth. 
CRM 2.0 adds additional touch points, as shown in Fig.  7.3 
(all the Web 1.0 tools + Web 2.0 tools). We can add crowd-
sourcing to this list. 
 Example: Get Satisfaction for CRM 
 Get Satisfaction ( getsatisfaction.com ) is a platform where 
customers can interact with one another and voice their opinions 
and complaints. Using a forum, they can quickly get resolu-

tions to their problems. Each community is organized around 
four topics:
 1.  Ask a question . Customers can answer one another’s 
questions. 
 2.  Share an idea . Aggregated feedback is provided from 
customers (by topic, product, vendor).  
 3.  Report a problem . Search to see if anyone posted a simi-
lar problem. Post yours.  
 4.  Give praise . Customers can praise a product or vendor. 
 Get Satisfaction provides management of the customers’ 
conversations to interested vendors at no charge. For an 
example of a Get Satisfaction Support Community, see  get-
satisfaction.com/safarichallenge . 
 Evolution of Business Processes in CRM 
 Traditional CRM was a part of a linear process that started 
with marketing that led to sales and then was followed by cus-
tomer service (if needed). In CRM 2.0, the process starts with 
listening to customers’ needs, based on social media conversa-
tions, rather than only on traditional market research through 
quantitative surveys or small scale qualitative research. The 
objective is to generate value for both the customer and the 
company. This difference is illustrated in Fig.  7.4 .  
 The Evolution of Technology 
 Traditional e-CRM focused on automating and supporting 
the internal business processes that relate to customer ser-
vice. In CRM 2.0, an attempt is made to provide this same 
process support, but it is based on community creation and 
on improved interactions among customers and between 
vendors and customers, as illustrated in Fig.  7.5 . 
 Organizational Mindset 
 In CRM 1.0, there is a dialog between one customer service 
employee and one customer, or between a sales support team

standpoint (customer life cycle for the company)

and one customer. Most interactions are routine, with limited 
innovations. In CRM 2.0, as shown in Fig.  7.6 , interactions 
occur among all employees (as in the Sony opening case) 
and several customers who also interact with each other (as 
in the iRobot case). This environment facilitates innovation 
and increases customer satisfaction. 
 Conclusions 
 Incorporating the previous ﬁ ve areas requires empowering 
the employees, which means that a new set of employee 
skills is needed. For a long time, marketers have said that 
everything starts with the needs of consumers. With social 
CRM and all the social media product discussions, marketers 
must now learn how to incorporate this philosophy in their 
strategies.

 Understanding the Social CRM Evolution 
 A similar description to Cipriani’s of the evolution of SCRM 
from the traditional CRM is provided by Morgan ( 2010 ) and 
Chess Media Group ( 2010 ; in collaboration with Lieberman). 
These authors explain why the revolution happened by citing 
the following drivers:
•  93 % of Americans want brands to have a presence on 
social network sites. 
•  60 % of Americans regularly interact with companies on 
social network sites. 
•  92 % of Americans prefer to buy from a reputable 
company. 
•  88 % of Americans use recommendations from friends 
and family to decide which brands to buy. 
•  43 % of Americans say that companies should use social 
networks to solve customers’ problems. 
 For a comprehensive discussion and suggestions, see 
Boardman ( 2013 ).

regarding the changes introduced by social CRM, in a slide-
show, that can be viewed at  slideshare.net/Salesforce/

7.4 
 HOW TO SERVE THE SOCIAL 
CUSTOMER 
 Once customers are empowered, the question becomes: How 
does a company serve the social customer? 
 Companies seek an answer to this question, not only 
because they are worried about the negative comments posted 
by social network members, but also because they see an 
opportunity to involve the customers proactively in product 
development and problem solving. This can be done in sev-
eral ways. By listening to social media discussions, compa-
nies may be able to ﬁ nd the causes of problems and improve 
customer service (Parature  2014 ). Furthermore, companies 
can increase customer loyalty and get more respect from 
them, and make their own customer service employees hap-
pier. Customer service and CRM are often practiced in orga-
nizations by several departments, and these departments need 
to integrate the social CRM activities with the traditional 
CRM. See Parature ( 2014 ), Bernoff and Schadler ( 2010 ), and 
Fagan ( 2014 ). Let us ﬁ rst look at the social customer. 
 The Social Customer 
 The Qantas Airways story (Sect.  7.1 ) shows us that custom-
ers and companies’ attitudes toward them are changing. In 
the past, customers were frequently poorly treated. Many are 
treated better now, because they have  more power due to 
social media tools and platforms. 
 Such empowered customers are referred to as  social 
customers . These customers are usually members of 
social networks. They share opinions about products, ser-
vices, and vendors; do social shopping; and understand their 
rights, and they know how to use the wisdom and power of 
the crowds and communities to their beneﬁ t. The highlights 
of the social customers are shown in Fig.  7.7 .
 As the ﬁ gure illustrates, the social customer has new 
behavior patterns. Social customers are choosing how they 
interact with companies and companies’ brands, which poses 
challenges to enterprises in regards to handling increased data 
volume, dynamic channels, and elevated expectations. The 
customers’ new behavior patterns require a new strategy for 
both marketing communication and customer service (see 
Chap.   5 for more on new marketing communication strate-
gies). The social customer is not just a purchaser but also an 
active inﬂ uencer. Note that individuals are inﬂ uenced not 
only by their own friends, but also by friends of their friends. 
Merchants must understand the difference between these con-
sumers (and their numbers are increasing exponentially) and 
conventional customers, and therefore provide them with 
more effective customer service. For an extensive discussion 
of today’s social customer, see Metz ( 2011 ) and Shih ( 2011 ). 
Procedures, guidelines, and software are publically available 
for social CRM (e.g., see Smith et al.  2011 ). For an overview 
of the social customer, you can download a free e-book from 
SAP titled  The Social Contract: Customers, Companies, 
Communities, Conversations in the Age of the Collaborative 
Relationship , available at   thesocialcustomer.com/sites/the-
socialcustomer.com/ﬁ les/TheSocialContract.pdf . Also, see

 Implementation of Social Customer 
Service and CRM 
 There are several models and methods for implementing 
social customer service. First, let us look at what Safeway is 
doing in this area. 
 Example: How Safeway Provides Social Customer 
Service 
 Safeway ( safeway.com ), a large grocery chain, has a virtual 
customer club. Members can get in-store discounts as well as 
e-mails with coupons and a list of sale items. An online 
newsletter with health news and recipes, shopping tips, and 
so forth is also available to members. To extend this service, 
Safeway invites their customers to become Safeway Fans on 
Facebook ( facebook.com/Safeway ) and follow the com-
pany on Twitter ( twitter.com/Safeway . This allows custom-
ers/members to know about exclusive promotions, 
campaigns, and links to recipes. In addition, members can 
connect and share information with other Safeway shoppers. 
These are also forums for customers and shareholders to post 
comments and complaints about products and stores. 
 In their ‘Just for U’ program, shoppers can get digital cou-
pons and personalized deals based on their shopping history 
(see 
 safeway.com/ShopStores/Offers-Landing-IMG.

 1.  Chordiant Software (now part of Pegasystems) 
 The Problem: Chordiant, an enterprise software com-
pany, needed a better way to ﬁ nd and coordinate the needs 
of people who are involved in their products’ information 
requirements process.

 The Solution: They created an online community where 
employees, developers, customers, and other partners can 
collaborate about information needs for product develop-
ment. The feedback was very positive, resulting in 15 suc-
cessful collaborative software product releases. 
 2.  Linksys 
 The Problem: Linksys, a Cisco division, needed to 
reduce costs while maintaining high levels of customer 
support. 
 The Solution: The company partnered with Lithium (a 
social CRM consultant) to create an online support com-
munity. The deployment of the community increased self-
service activities engagement and sharing, which reduced 
the need for costly phone and other support. Linksys 
reported savings of millions of dollars.  
 3.  Enterasys Networks 
 The Problem: Enterasys Networks “has hundreds of 
employees stationed around the globe.” It required a 
social networking tool that would eliminate geographical 
boundaries and allow its employees to communicate in 
real time. 
 The Solution: Enterasys decided to deploy Salesforce.
com’s Chatter application, which includes Web 2.0 tools. 
“The company experienced improved service perfor-
mance thanks to real-time collaboration on service issues. 
Additionally, the sales team was able to work more 
closely together and completed a record number of sales 
in the ﬁ rst quarter immediately after implementing 
Chatter” (per  salesforce.com/chatter/overview ). 
 4.  H&R Block 
 The Problem: H&R Block wanted to ﬁ nd out what issues 
their customers were discussing online in order to antici-
pate problems before they arose. 
 The Solution: The company decided to use Radian6’s 
social monitoring technology to achieve H&R Block’s 
goal. The trend analysis tool from Radian6 allowed the 
company to drill down into community online conversa-
tions and see which topics were creating the most buzz. 
This gave better insight, enabling H&R Block to be more 
proactive in their customer service. (For more about 
Salesforce’s Radian6, see  salesforcemarketingcloud.
com/products/social-media-listening ). 
 5.  Pepperdine University 
 The Problem: Pepperdine University was looking for a 
better way to encourage collaboration among its students, 
staff, and faculty. 
 The Solution: The university used Yammer’s software 
(see Chap.   8 ) “to create a Twitter-like environment where 
users can interact, communicate in real time, and do so 
with more transparency. The university saw a signiﬁ cant 
increase in community participation” and collaboration. 
See the video of Pepperdine’s Director of E-Learning 
 discussing the university’s social network – Yammer 
(2:21 minutes) at  vimeo.com/68710684 . 
 Improving the Websites 
 Social customers like to see user-friendly websites. Indeed, 
many companies are changing their websites by adding tools 
for engaging visitors, such as social media hooks (e.g., “Like 
us,” “Bookmark this page”) and incorporating better search 
functionality. 
 Example 
  Bloomingdales, the luxury department store that also sells 
online at Bloomingdales.com, restructured its website. The 
new site is dynamic, engaging, and easy to browse and search 
in multiple ways (by product, size, color, material, price, and 
gender). This enables the company to conduct sophisticated 
marketing campaigns and then analyze their results.  
 For more examples on using social CRM for marketing, 
see Stelzner ( 2014 ) and Solis ( 2012 ). 
 Some Social CRM Tools 
 In the realm of social CRM, a company’s customer database 
can be inundated with information, data, photos, and status 
updates, which are fed from social network sites and from 
listening to customers’ conversations. Therefore, companies 
may need some special tools for information processing and 
analysis. 
 Here are some representative SCRM tools:
•  Batchbook ( batchbook.com ) is an inexpensive e-CRM 
tool for small and medium enterprises.  
•  Rapportive ( rapportive.com ) is a free plug-in, but it 
works only with Gmail. It will show you details of con-
tacts (such as people’s LinkedIn proﬁ le, as well as their 
Twitter stream, Skype handle, or Facebook proﬁ le) right 
inside your inbox.  
•  Desk ( desk.com ; previously Assistly) is a Salesforce cus-
tomer service application that helps rapidly growing com-
panies deliver effective and efﬁ cient customer service. 
For their capabilities, see  desk.com . 
•  Piksel ( piksel.com ; previously Kit Social Platform) helps 
companies maximize reach and return. 
 For more information about SCRM software, see Jive 
Software ( jivesoftware.com ). 
7 Social Customer Service and CRM

169
 Automated Response to E-Mail 
(Autoresponder) 
 E-mail is a popular traditional online customer service tool. 
Inexpensive and fast, e-mail disseminates information and 
sends correspondence on many topics, including responses 
to customer inquiries. E-mail is available within many social 
networks between members (e.g., on Facebook) and in IMs 
(e.g., using Skype). 
 However, the growth of e-mail messages has resulted in a 
ﬂ ood of customer e-mails. Some companies receive tens of 
thousands of e-mails a week, or even in a day. Answering 
these e-mails manually would be expensive and time- 
consuming. However, customers want quick answers, usu-
ally within 24 h (a policy of many organizations). Therefore, 
many vendors offer automated e-mail reply systems known 
as  autoresponders , which provide answers to commonly 
asked questions. Autoresponders, also called  infobots and 
 e-mail on demand  (see description in Webopedia.com), are 
text ﬁ les that are sent automatically via e-mail, on demand. 
They can relay standard information for support of customer 
service and marketing communication (see  egain.com and 
 aweber.com ). Many automated responses often do not pro-
vide actual answers, but only acknowledge that a query has 
been received (e.g., “I am out of the ofﬁ ce and will return on 
Monday”). Customer queries are classiﬁ ed in a decision- 
support repository until a live agent responds. Advance auto 
responders use FAQs to select proper answers. Even more 
advanced are systems that use natural language processors to 
ﬁ nd more accurately what bothers the customers. 
 Improving the Call Center 
 Customers who are unsatisﬁ ed with a call center’s service 
may post negative comments online about the companies. 
Therefore, companies know how important it is to have 
effective call centers. 
 Several innovations have been introduced by vendors. 
For example, Fonolo ( fonolo.com ) introduced virtual dial-
ing, virtual queuing, pre-call questions, and smartphone-
ready features. 
 Automated Live Chat 
 Similar to the advanced autoresponders some companies use 
an automated ‘Live Chat.’ There are several types of conversa-
tion under this title, some of which are in real time with ava-
tars. The avatars allow you to choose a question from an FAQ 
menu; the program then provides you with the FAQ answer. 
Others allow you to use natural language processing, such as 
the eGain system, to converse with an “intelligent” avatar. 
 Example 
  The eGain system looks for certain phrases or key words, 
such as  complaint or  information on a product , and then taps 
into a knowledge base to generate a canned, matching 
response. For messages that require attention from a live 
agent, the query is assigned an ID number and passed along 
to a customer service representative for a reply. Figure  7.8 
shows this process. Note that, the answers and their relation-
ships to problems (questions) are stored in a knowledge data-
base which is updated each time a live agent provides a new 
solution. Such systems are known as  e-mail response man-
agement (ERM) systems.
 Using Microblogging 
 As the Sony case demonstrated, company microblogging 
(mostly on Twitter) is becoming very popular in SCRM. Some 
companies design a special customer care program around 
Twitter. One example is Yahoo! ( twitter.com/YahooCare ), 
which is used as a new channel for engaging customers for 
facilitating problem resolution (“How can we help you today?”) 
and disseminating updates. Their Twitter page also has photos 
and videos to help customers with troubleshooting.  
 Product Review Sites 
 Many customers post product reviews on general sites, such 
as eBay Commerce Network’s Epinions ( epinions.com ; 
“Unbiased Reviews by Real People”), or on industry (or 
company-speciﬁ c) sites. Companies use Web monitoring 
software, such as Google Alerts, to receive automatic notiﬁ -
cations when people post about their products. For example, 
travel site  tripadvisor.com  has a review forum for guests to 
review a hotel, vacation, restaurant, or attraction they visited 
(see  tripadvisor.com/UserReview ). An owner or represen-
tative (e.g., hotel manager) is also able to post a response to 
reviews about their property. They sometimes apologize for 
a guest’s poor experience, and explain what they are doing to 
remedy the situation. Other times, they thank guests who 
post positive comments. 
 For a discussion of the evolution process and the integra-
tion of social CRM with e-marketing, see Henschen ( 2012 ) 
and Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ). 
 Monitoring and Analyzing Social Media Reviews 
 According to their website, Sysomos Inc. ( sysomos.com ) is a 
company with a comprehensive and “powerful product suite 
that provides customers with the tools to measure, monitor, 
understand, and engage with the social media landscape. 
7.4 How to Serve the Social Customer

170
Sysomos provides instant access to all social media conversa-
tions from blogs, social networks, and micro- blogging ser-
vices to forums, video sites, and media sources.” Sysomos 
was the ﬁ rst professional tool to manage Facebook fan pages 
(“Facebook Page Central”). For more information about what 
they do, see  sysomos.com/products  and  sysomos.com/
resources/facebook-page-central . See Chap.   10 for presen-
tation on this topic.  
7.5 
 SOCIAL CRM IN THE ENTERPRISE 
 The concept of CRM can be extended from consumer mar-
kets (B2C) to the B2B and enterprise environment. 
Companies sell to other companies (B2B), and these rela-
tionships with business partners are very important. In 
B2B, companies work with distribution channels and other 
partners or suppliers, this CRM is referred to as  partner 
relationship 
management , 
or 
 supplier 
relationship 
management . 
 Major contacts in B2B are made by corporate salespeo-
ple, either individually or in teams. Field service employees 
also make contact with customers. They can serve both indi-
vidual customers (B2C) and corporations (B2B). Both 
groups can beneﬁ t from social media, as will be illustrated 
later in this section and in the annual conference “Dreamforce” 
(see  salesforce.com/dreamforce ). 
 Social CRM in the Enterprise and B2B 
Environments 
 Facebook, Twitter, and social media tools have changed the 
way people communicate and collaborate. Today, social media 
is changing the way salespeople and other B2B personnel col-
laborate, work, learn, and interact with business customers. 
For an overview of the challenges salespeople face, the impact 
of social commerce within the enterprise, and the CRM fea-
tures that are assisting salespeople, see Fagan ( 2014 ). 
 For a comprehensive case study, see Egeland ( 2009 ). 
 Social CRM offers the following beneﬁ ts in B2B. 
•  Enables quick discovery of sales leads while help-
ing convert leads to actual sales (e.g., by using mar-
keting communication that is more effective). 
•  Enables winning sales deals by sending the right 
messages to businesses. 
•  Provides easy and quick access to data and informa-
tion acquisition and analysis.  
•  Provides for outstanding business collaboration. 
•  Increases trust among business partners. 
•  Improves the procurement process. 
•  Provides focused, intuitive, and user-friendly busi-
ness customer care applications.

 Salespeople Beneﬁ t from Social Media 
 Salespeople are beginning to use social media applications 
that facilitate collaboration. These applications assist them to 
increase their effectiveness and efﬁ ciency in performing 
their jobs. For a comprehensive overview of how this is 
done, see Oracle ( 2008 ). This Oracle white paper “examines 
the challenges salespeople face, the growing (use of) Web 
2.0 in the enterprise, and the drivers for a new breed of social 
applications that complement traditional CRM systems to 
help sales users identify qualiﬁ ed prospects and close addi-
tional sales more quickly.” 
 Challenges Facing Salespeople Today 
 According to Parature ( 2014 ), and Fagan ( 2014 ), the follow-
ing are the major challenges facing salespeople today: 
 The Contribution of Social CRM 
 According to Parature ( 2014 ), Oracle ( 2008 ), and Fagan 
( 2014 ), SCRM can provide capabilities to salespeople that 
deal with the following challenges: 
 Social media tools facilitate sales force automation. 
 Sales Force Automation Salesforce Inc.’s Chatter 
 Salespeople constitute a major source of contact with cus-
tomers (both individuals and businesses). The more com-
puter support they have available, the better, quicker, and 
more accurate service they can provide to customers.  Sales 
force automation (SFA) applications support the selling 
•  Selling has become harder due to the economic 
slowdown and stiff global competition.  
•  There is no effective way to leverage traditional 
collaboration with other traditional customer sup-
port technologies. 
•  Most traditional applications that support salespeo-
ple are not intuitive; therefore, they require too 
much time and energy from the salespeople who 
need to use them. 
•  There are gaps between what salespeople need and 
what the traditional CRM applications deliver. 
•  Business collaboration at its best . This is done by 
leveraging the collective intelligence of social net-
work members, increasing the interactions, and 
facilitating innovations. With better collaboration, 
organizations can empower salespeople with the 
best in their business network, which will facilitate 
the collective intelligence and the productivity of 
the involved community. 
•  Focused, intuitive and easy to use applications 
(per Oracle  2008 ). Social enterprise applications 
model sales activities capture data as sales repre-
sentatives conduct their daily tasks, rather than 
requiring them to enter data afterwards. 
•  Contextual data available any place, any time . 
Sales representatives per Oracle ( 2008 ) “can 
now have data they need when and where they 
need them. For example, mashups allow busi-
ness users to assemble innovative, composite 
applications from many available sources—
spanning Internet and enterprise content—to 
pull information from RSS feeds, blogs, or other 
services, and embed them into an application” or 
a corporate portal.  
•  Find better qualiﬁ ed leads, quickly and easily . 
According to Oracle ( 2008 ) “by analyzing purchas-
ing patterns of existing customers and mining infor-
mation across the enterprise and public social 
networks,” tools such as Prospector identify what 
products and services sell best. 
•  Improve understanding and trust between sales-
people and their business customers . 
•  Convert leads to opportunities with more effec-
tive campaigns . Individual sales representatives 
can be empowered (per Oracle  2008 ), “to create and 
manage their own professional e-mail marketing 
campaigns, as well as leverage successful campaign 
templates of peers that have been shared and rated 
by the broader community.” 
•  Find the right message to close the sale . According 
to Oracle ( 2008 ), “by harnessing the collective 
intelligence of the community, sales representatives 
can obtain a competitive edge by leveraging sales 
materials that have been highly rated” (by other 
salespeople and by customers) in order to close 
business deals. 
•  Enable salespeople to resolve problems and chal-
lenges with their business customers . 
7.5 Social CRM in the Enterprise

172
efforts of a company’s sales force, helping salespeople 
 manage leads, prospects, and customers through the sales 
pipeline. An example of such an application is a wireless 
device that allows quick communication from outside the 
company with the corporate intranet. Social media supports 
new applications. 
 A major vendor in this area is Salesforce.com, Inc. 
( salesforce.com ). The company focuses on helping their 
business customers build social proﬁ les of their employ-
ees and customers. Salesforce Chatter, according to the 
company, “is the leading enterprise social network that 
allows teams to sync up and take action, and powers com-
munities to connect like never before.” Also, according to 
Salesforce Inc., its latest technological improvements 
have made Chatter “a true  social business tool , with many 
methods available to chat, share, approve, and otherwise 
enable the collaborative process.” To learn more about the 
features of Chatter, see  salesforce.com/chatter/over-
view . Another addition to Chatter is the ability to include 
videos to the chats, like in many instant messaging net-
works (e.g., Yahoo Messenger or Skype) do today. The 
company’s partners also add capabilities (for example, 
from Reachable Inc.). 
 Reachable Inc. (reachable.com) 
 Reachable Inc. uses a social graph to show the relationships 
among individuals. (They call it an Enterprise Business 
Graph; see  reachable.com/general/reachable-and-the- 
enterprise-business-graph ). The tool can be used to dis-
cover all connections and relationships in the enterprise. It 
can be used for predictive analysis. 
  Field Service Automation 
 Field service employees, such as sales representatives, are 
frequently on the road, interacting directly with customers 
at the customers’ places of business. Examples of ﬁ eld ser-
vice employees who work at customers’ sites include repair 
technicians who work together with a company’s mainte-
nance staff. Providing services employees with mobile 
devices can enhance customer service. Field service auto-
mation applications support the customer service efforts of 
ﬁ eld service reps and service managers. These applications 
manage  customer service requests, service orders, service 
contracts, service schedules, and service calls. They pro-
vide planning, scheduling, dispatching, and reporting fea-
tures to ﬁ eld service representatives. Examples are 
industrial wireless devices, such as those provided by 
Motorola. 
 Social media tools can facilitate SFA and ﬁ eld 
service automation as described earlier in the Sony and iRo-
bot cases. 
 Other Applications 
 Enterprises need to have good working relationships with 
their employees, suppliers, and other business partners. They 
can facilitate these relationships by using private social net-
works, blogs and wikis, and by deploying RSS and other Web 
2.0 tools. Enterprises are also using social media for training, 
marketing, recruiting, and more. All major vendors provide 
enterprise applications. For example, Oracle provides Oracle 
CRM Sales Prospector on Demand, Oracle CRM Sales 
Campaigns on Demand, and Oracle CRM Sales Library on 
Demand. For details, see  oracle.com/us/products/applica-
tions/social-crm/index.html . Similar applications are pro-
vided by Salesforce, Microsoft, and several other vendors.  
7.6 
 SPECIAL APPLICATIONS AND ISSUES 
IN SOCIAL CRM 
 There are many special applications and issues in SCRM. Let 
us look at the following scenario. 
 Example: A Lesson in Customer Service 
 As described in Chap.   6 , Groupon featured a discount deal to 
a restaurant delivery service in Tokyo for the 2010 New Year 
celebration. The promotion was wildly successful as more 
than 500 “Groupons” were sold. Unfortunately, the restau-
rant was not prepared for that level of demand and was 
unable to accommodate all the orders in time. Deliveries 
were late, and many of them were in “terrible condition.” 
 Andrew Mason, the CEO of Groupon at the time, accepted 
the responsibility. He acknowledged that he had contracted 
with an organization that was not prepared to deal with the 
volume of the Groupon promotion. Groupon refunded the 
money to the customers who bought the coupons and gave 
away vouchers for future business. Groupon also created a 
video that featured a public apology regarding the incident. 
The video was sincere and informative, explaining exactly 
what happened, holding nothing back.  
 This incident demonstrates one of the issues that social 
commerce companies may face, and it shows the importance 
of transparent communication in social media. In this sec-
tion, we will present several special applications and describe 
some major deployment issues. 
 Social Networking Helps Customer Service 
in Small Companies 
 Most of the social media examples provided so far in this 
book have dealt with large companies. What about the small 
ones? Do they use social media the same way? Obviously, 
7 Social Customer Service and CRM

173
there are some applications the SMEs (small and medium 
enterprises) cannot afford. However, there are many afford-
able applications, as illustrated next. 
 Example 
 Teusner Wines ( teusner.com.au ) is a small boutique winery 
(ﬁ ve employees in 2014) in Australia. Using Twitter for a 
few years, the company’s one-person marketing department: 
 All this was done by a tiny company at a minimal ﬁ nan-
cial cost; however, it did take quite a bit of staff time. The 
company now (2015) is using Instagram, Facebook, and its 
website for actively marketing its wines online.  
 For additional examples of small companies and the use 
of 
social 
media, 
see 
 socialmediatoday.com/social- 
customer  , Chap.   11  , and an infographic at  socialmediato-
day.com/1603731/small-business-guide-social-media-
mastery . 
 Customer-Touching Applications 
 As described earlier,  customer-touching applications are those 
where customers use interactive computer programs rather 
than interacting face-to-face with a live representative. The fol-
lowing are several popular customer-touching applications. 
 Personalized Web Pages and Blogs 
 Many companies provide customers with tools to create their 
own individual Web pages (e.g.,  my.yahoo.com and  sites.
google.com and blogs (e.g.,  wordpress.com and  blog.com ). 
Social networks do the same. Companies can deliver 
 customized information efﬁ ciently (such as product informa-
tion and warranty information) when the customer logs on to 
a vendor’s Facebook page, or to the customer’s personalized 
page on the vendor’s site. Not only can a customer retrieve 
information from the vendor’s site, but the customer can also 
interact with the vendor. Much of the interaction is facili-
tated by social media tools.  
 Web Self-Service 
 The Web environment provides an opportunity for customers 
to serve themselves. Known as  Web self-service , this strategy 
provides tools for users to perform activities previously done 
by corporate customer service personnel. Well-known exam-
ples of Web self-service are the tracking systems provided by 
FedEx, USPS, and UPS. 
 Self-service applications can be used by customers and 
employees, suppliers, and any other business partners. An 
example is the self-service provided by Canon’s customer 
support unit (see Consona  2008 –2009 for details). In 
general, Web 2.0 also supports self-service by allowing cus-
tomers to get help from other customers (e.g., see Libert and 
Spector  2010 ). 
 Self-Conﬁ guration, Customization, and Co-design 
 One of the best ways to provide SCRM to customers is to 
provide them with the ability to customize products and ser-
vices. This is especially important for complex products with 
many possible conﬁ guration options. Therefore, many build-
to- order vendors, such as Dell and Blue Nile (diamond jew-
elry), provide customers with tools to self-conﬁ gure products 
or services (e.g., “build your own ring”). In addition, social 
communities, such as Polyvore (see Chap.   6 ), facilitate self- 
conﬁ guration. Usually, the conﬁ gured order is transferred 
directly to production so that production decisions can be 
based on real time customer demand, expediting the manu-
facturing process. Customers may seek advice from other 
customers regarding what to include in a conﬁ guration (e.g., 
see Libert and Spector  2010 ). 
 Another aspect is co-design, involving customers in cus-
tomer service design, as well as in products (e.g., the LEGO 
Gallery;  lego.com/gallery ). This can be facilitated by crowd-
sourcing, as we will illustrate in Chap.   8 . 
 Customer-Centric Applications 
 The fourth Patricia Seybold Group’s category,  customer- 
centric applications , is synonymous with  CRM analytics . 
 CRM analytics refers to the application of business analytic 
techniques and business intelligence such as data mining and 
online analytic processing to CRM applications. In SCRM 
we use social analytics (see Chap.   10 ). 
•  Initiates online conversations about wine with 
inﬂ uential people in the wine business. 
•  Sends tweets to people the company ﬁ nd talking 
about Teusner Wines, praising them for trying the 
wines. 
•  Starts 
to 
build 
trust 
with 
customers 
via 
conversations. 
•  Invites people to tour the winery and taste the wines 
(resulting in an excellent response). 
•  Advises potential customers in the United States 
and Canada where they can purchase the Australian 
wine. 
•  Collects real-time feedback from customers. 
•  Encourages 
customer-to-customer 
online 
conversations. 
•  Posts customer reviews on Twitter. 
•  Shares all information with Twitter followers. 
7.6 Special Applications and Issues in Social CRM

174
 Analytics Tools 
 The main tools used in SCRM analytics are measuring, 
reporting, and data mining. Managers collect data from 
social media and other websites and mine them to ﬁ nd mar-
keting opportunities, improve CRM, and solve customers’ 
problems. According to the Web Analytics Association’s 
deﬁ nition, “Web analytics is the overall term for ‘measure-
ment, collection, analysis and reporting of I  nternet data  for 
purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage’” (see 
 digitalanalyticsassociation.org/Files/PDF_standards/
WebAnalyticsDeﬁ nitions.pdf ). For details on CRM analyt-
ics, 
see 
 searchcrm.techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/CRM- 
analytics . For coverage of social commerce analytics, see 
Chap.   10 . 
 CRM analytics can lead to not only better and more pro-
ductive customer relations in terms of sales and service, but 
also to improvement in the planning and analysis of market-
ing promotions, as well as other improved marketing 
strategies. 
7.7 
 STRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION 
ISSUES OF SOCIAL CRM 
 The success or failure of SCRM initiatives depends upon the 
strategy and the implementation processes. Unfortunately, 
there is no one recipe for either strategy or implementation 
since both depend on many variables (see Lacy et al.  2013 , 
Jamieson  2014 , and Chaps.   10 and   11  ). In this section, we 
will cover some key issues related to both topics. 
 Social CRM Strategy 
 The topic of social commerce strategy in general will be 
described in Chap.   10 . Here, we list some basic issues related 
to SCRM:
•  Strategy for handling negative criticism ,  a part of reputa-
tion management . This topic was described in Chap.   5 . 
Companies need policies on what is considered negative 
criticism and how to react to it.  
•  Strategy for integrating social media into the traditional 
CRM . 
•  Strategy for dealing with resistance to change by 
employees . 
•  Employing reactive or proactive strategies . 
•  Reactive customer service can be performed, for example, 
by setting up Twitter listening posts using Tweet Deck 
( tweetdeck.com ) or Followerwonk ( follerwonk.com ) to 
search for conversations with key words relevant to one’s 
company. A company can then give their employees who 
are listening to social conversations, guidelines needed 
for solving problems, so that the employees can directly 
take care of any issue. 
•  Proactive customer service engages customers before 
there is a problem, and interacts with customers to 
improve products and customer service.  
•  Controlling 
customer 
interactions 
on 
Facebook. 
Companies need to develop a strategy for controlling cus-
tomer interactions, both for B2C and B2B.  
 Example: Bonobos (bonobos.com) 
 According to Bonobos, a small New York- based online 
men’s clothing company that aims to provide excellent cus-
tomer experience, used two social media-driven projects:
 1.  Bonobos formed 1,000-member alpha and beta testing 
groups solely through Twitter. Before they launch new 
designs for pants or dress shirts, they use the testing 
groups to review the products. By using the groups, the 
company has gained valuable information regarding the 
customers’ preferences. Then, Bonobos transfers that 
information to their designers.  
 2.  Bonobos also ran blog contests. 
 Example: Social Commerce Strategy at Threadless 
 Threadless ( threadless.com ) is a global e-commerce com-
pany that produces T-shirts and other merchandise designed 
by and for its 2.5 million community members. The com-
pany is using crowdsourcing (Chap.   8 ) to get the most out of 
social media. Threadless uses strategy and software to man-
age its customer interaction on Facebook ( facebook.com/
threadless ). Speciﬁ cally, the company’s software helps to 
monitor wall posts and respond to them appropriately. See 
Swan ( 2014 ) for details. 
 For more on strategy regarding social CRM, see Chap.   10  . 
Note that, since SCRM is an integral part of e-CRM, the strat-
egies for the two are interrelated. For a discussion, see  en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management . 
 For implementation issues using Salesforce.com products 
and services, see Taber ( 2014 ). 
 Mobile SCRM 
 As seen throughout the book, social commerce is facilitated 
by mobile technologies. This is especially true with social 
CRM where interactions, sharing, and collaboration can be 
greatly facilitated by mobile devices. For examples, discus-
sion, strategy, and implementation, see Lacy et al. ( 2013 ).

 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC topics as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  Deﬁ ne CRM, e-CRM, and SCRM . CRM is a customer 
service that focuses on building a long-term and sustain-
able customer relationship. When CRM is supported and 
delivered electronically, it is called e-CRM. Most CRM 
programs today are supported electronically and facilitate 
the ﬂ ow of information and interactions between custom-
ers and vendors, and enable customers’ engagement 
online. CRM is a business strategy and its implementa-
tion involves business rules. It is also a technology plat-
form with social characteristics. When the technology 
platform involves social media (e.g., Web 2.0 tools and 
social network sites), CRM is referred to as social CRM 
(SCRM). SCRM provides many beneﬁ ts for both custom-
ers and vendors, which includes an improved relationship 
between the empowered customers and the vendors, as 
well as providing better service to customers.  
 2.  A model for customer interactions . In this model, the 
Patricia Seybold Group divides the CRM interactions into 
four 
major 
groups: 
customer-facing 
applications, 
customer- touching applications, customer-centric intelli-
gence applications, and other online networking applica-
tions. In each of these, social media can introduce some 
improvements to the interaction process. For example, in 
customer-facing applications, one can support customer-
enterprise interactions by monitoring  customers’ conver-
sations on social media platforms and by tweeting to 
facilitate communication. 
 3.  The evolution of social CRM . SCRM evolved from 
CRM and e-CRM. The evolution can be described along 
the following ﬁ ve dimensions: The landscape (e.g., 
structure and focus); the touch points (e.g., the use of 
social media tools); the business processes (e.g., how to 
listen to customers); the technology (e.g., socially-ori-
ented tools); and the organizational mindset (e.g., pat-
terns of interactions). This evolution is driven by the 
explosive use of social network sites, by the rise of the 
social customer, and by the importance buyers place on 
social recommendations.   
 4.  Serving the social customer. Customers are empow-
ered by social networks; therefore, they can get  attention 
quickly for problem resolution. For example, organizing 
a Facebook complaint blitz against a company is not dif-
ﬁ cult. Customers also can make suggestions for 
improvements and vote on them. Social media allows 
customers to help themselves and each other, simultane-
ously reducing merchants’ expenses. Customers can 
become more loyal because they work more closely 
with vendors. Social networking activities may provide 
innovative ideas for improved and more efﬁ cient cus-
tomer service (e.g., Twitter can be very helpful). 
Companies can listen to customers in social network 
forums, provide easy-to- navigate websites, provide 
tools for user-generated content and quick problem res-
olution, and much more.  
 5.  Social CRM in the enterprise. Social CRM is also used 
in the enterprise mainly by salespeople and ﬁ eld service 
employees. Most applications center on improved com-
munication and collaboration. It helps to increase sales 
leads. Major vendors, such as Salesforce.com, provide 
social media features in their standard CRM tools. The 
use of social media can also facilitate relationships with 
employees and business partners. 
 6.  Special SCRM applications and issues. Many special 
applications exist. Vendors such as Oracle and Salesforce.
com provide applications that harness social media tech-
nologies. These are deployed in all segments of the CRM 
ﬁ eld (see Sect.  7.2 ). Representative applications include 
reputation management, SME enablers, Web page per-
sonalization, Web self-service and self-conﬁ gurations, 
and the use of CRM analytical tools.  
 7.  Strategy and implementation. For large-scale SCRM 
initiatives, strategy and implementation plans are 
needed. Several issues need to be included; they range 
from a strategy to handling negative customer com-
ments to dealing with employee resistance to change. 
These issues are fairly generic and are described in 
Chaps.   10  and   11  .

 OPENING CASE: HOW A PRIVATE 
ENTERPRISE NETWORK TRANSFORMED 
CEMEX INTO A SOCIAL BUSINESS 
 CEMEX ( cemex.com ) is a global building materials com-
pany based in Mexico, known primarily for its cement and 
ready-mix concrete. They do business in over 50 countries, 
throughout the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, 
and Asia, and maintain trade relationships in approximately 
108 nations.  
 The Problem 
 The global economic slowdown of 2008–2014, and especially 
the drastic reduction in construction activities, drove CEMEX 
to try a host of traditional activities for cost reduction and 
increased productivity. However, this was not enough. In addi-
tion, top management was looking for ways to facilitate inno-
vation. Given the company’s global nature, top management 
realized that they needed to improve the company’s internal 
and external collaboration to foster innovation.  

182
 The Solution 
 Recently, many companies have implemented Enterprise 2.0 
platforms that include social media tools as well as mecha-
nisms of social network services. CEMEX decided to follow 
this trend. The company wanted to fully utilize the institu-
tional knowledge possessed by its thousands of employees 
worldwide and make it available to others whenever needed. 
 CEMEX created an internal private social collaboration 
platform called Shift ( cemex.com/whatisshift ), which facil-
itates innovation, efﬁ ciency, and collaboration by letting 
employees share information and jointly conduct problem 
solving. Shift integrates some of the best capabilities of 
social networks with knowledge management (KM) and col-
laboration techniques (using IBM Global Business Services). 
Shift includes many internal communities; each is composed 
of people with similar interests.  
 The Results 
 The main result was the major change in the way that people 
worked together. The workforce became more cooperative; 
employees helped each other, shared more information and 
knowledge, were more empowered, and were able to be 
more mobile. Using in-house networking led to better inter-
nal collaboration. 
 Projects started to move more quickly, with faster time to 
market; therefore, business processes improved. In short, the 
company successfully leveraged the collective talents and 
skills of its employees. One internal community, the 
“Construction for the 21st Century,” was challenged to suggest 
the strategic topics that CEMEX should focus on to remain a 
leader in the construction industry. The 400 community mem-
bers of this 21st Century group responded by proposing inno-
vative ideas, tactics, and strategies addressing the challenge. 
Overall, Shift drew 5,000 users by the end of its ﬁ rst month. By 
2013, Shift had 25,000 users and over 500 groups. By 2014, the 
stock price of the company increased by over 300 %.

 SOCIAL BUSINESS AND SOCIAL 
ENTERPRISE 
 A major forthcoming trend in social commerce is its move to 
the enterprise level. This trend is related to the concept of 
social business. Let us deﬁ ne both terms. 
 Deﬁ nitions: Social Business and Social 
Enterprise 
 The social enterprise concept has several names, deﬁ nitions, 
and explanations. This concept is sometimes confused with 
the related concept of social business. Generally, one can 
distinguish between the two concepts that are often used 
interchangeably. Let us explain. 
 Social Business 
 A  social business is a commercial for-proﬁ t or non-proﬁ t 
organization that is designed to achieve some social goal(s) 
such as improving human well-being, rather than just make a 
proﬁ t. SocialFirms UK ( socialﬁ rmsuk.co.uk ) provides sev-
eral other deﬁ nitions of what they call  social enterprise . 
They cite the following UK government deﬁ nition: “A social 
enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives 
whose surpluses are reinvested for that purpose in the busi-
ness or in the community, rather than being driven by the need 
to deliver proﬁ t to shareholders and owners” (see details at 
 socialﬁ rmsuk.co.uk/faq/faq-what-social-enterprise-and- 
what-types-are-there ). About.com (“What is Social Media?”) 
distinguishes between two types of social business: one type 
that describes companies that “aspire to social purposes more 
than to proﬁ t-making,” and a seconds type that describes 
companies that “use social media to advance their business 
objectives.” (See  webtrends.about.com/od/web20/a/social-
media.htm .) 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 The CEMEX case illustrates a successful private in- 
house social network whose major objectives were to 
foster collaboration among its thousands of employees 
worldwide and facilitate idea generation via internal 
crowdsourcing. Using Web 2.0 tools, collaboration 
became effective and efﬁ cient. A major result was idea 
generation and the evaluation and implementation of 
these ideas that facilitated innovation in the company. 
This is an example of social collaboration ( Sect. 8.7 ). 
This chapter presents the major activities that social net-
works support within enterprises and the structure and 
beneﬁ ts of public business networks. This chapter also 
presents the issues of the job market, recruiting and 
training networking in social innovation and knowledge 
management, crowdsourcing, and social collaboration. 
8 The Social Enterprise: From Recruiting to Problem Solving and Collaboration

183
 The seconds type is the basis for the  social enterprise . 
In summary, we view a  social business as one that is 
built mainly around social objective(s), while a  social 
 enterprise uses social networking to facilitate commercial 
objectives. 
 A major organization dedicated to social business 
(which refers to itself as a “social enterprise”), is the 
 Social Enterprise Alliance ( se-alliance.org/what-is-social-
enterprise ). 
 Social Employees 
 The successful social business needs to empower its employ-
ees (e.g., using IBM Connections). For how IBM, AT&T, 
and other large corporations do this, see Burgess and Burgess 
( 2013 ). 
 The Social Enterprise (Enterprise 2.0) 
 The  social enterprise refers to the use of social media tools 
and platforms and conducting social networking activities in 
organizations, while its major objectives are either commer-
cial or non-proﬁ t activities (e.g., the government). For an 
overview, see Ridley-Duff and Bull ( 2011 ). 
 The concept of the social enterprise has become a buzz-
word in recent years. Let us see what it is. 
 Social enterprise applications are spreading rapidly in the 
industry. They appear under different names, mostly as a 
social enterprise and Enterprise 2.0. According to Carr 
( 2012 ), McKinsey (a management consultant company), 
predicts that the global revenue from social enterprise activi-
ties will reach $1 trillion in several years (two thirds of all 
social commerce value at that time). 
 Enterprise applications are conducted inside enterprises, 
on companies’ private social networks, or on portals. They 
also are conducted on public social networks, both business- 
oriented (e.g., LinkedIn), and general networks, mostly 
Facebook and Twitter. Major applications are recruitment, 
collaboration, and problem solving. According to Kern 
( 2012 ), enterprise social capabilities will facilitate a new 
type of collaboration, encourage business upgrades, and 
enable more vendor applications. 
 According to a 2009 IDC survey (reported by  BusinessWire 
 2010 ), 57 % of U.S. workers in 2009 used social media for 
business purposes at least once per week. Today, that ﬁ gure 
is higher. Corporations are rushing to get involved in several 
innovative ways, as will be described later in this chapter. 
Business networks are a core component in the social 
enterprise. 
 For additional deﬁ nitions, characteristics, and discussion 
on social enterprise, see  centreforsocialenterprise.com/
what.html . 
 More Complex Deﬁ nitions 
 In addition to the above deﬁ nitions, there are some 
deﬁ nitions that are more complex, as illustrated next. 
 The Social Business Forum’s Deﬁ nition 
 The Social Business Forum deﬁ nes  social business as “an 
organization that has put in place the strategies, technologies 
and processes to systematically engage all the individuals of 
its ecosystem (employees, customers, partners, suppliers) to 
maximize the co-created value” ( 2012.socialbusinessfo-
rum.com/what-is-social-business ). The Forum also dis-
cusses the implications of this deﬁ nition and its relevance, 
across and outside organizations. Note that an efﬁ cient cre-
ation of value using technology is emphasized.  
 IBM and IDC’s Deﬁ nition 
 IDC coined the term  social business to refer to “those orga-
nizations that apply emerging technologies like Web 2.0 
accompanied by organizational, cultural, and process 
changes to improve business performance in an increasingly 
connected global economic environment” (see  IBM 2010 
and IDC  2010 ). The IBM effort concentrates on improved 
collaboration. The basic idea is that social customers require 
organizations to signiﬁ cantly change the way they operate, 
so they can become social businesses. The new structure 
enables organizations to exploit the opportunities created by 
the social media environment. IBM is helping organizations 
become social businesses. (For an example of how they do 
this, see IBM’s A Smarter Planet at  ibm.com/ smarterplanet/
us/en/?ca=v_smarterplanet ). IBM also has an extensive 
“social business video library.” 
 Three interesting videos are recommended to better 
understand social business:
 1.  “Social PhD: Sandy Carter, IBM: How Do You Become a 
Social Business?” (1:04 minutes) at   youtube.com/
watch?v=OZy0dNQbotg  
 2.  “How Do You Become a Social Business?” (3:28 min-
utes) at   youtube.com/watch?v=3Hov0l7SvAo  
 3.  “Social Business @ IBM” – An Interview with Luis Suarez, 
Social Computing Evangelist (8:50 minutes) at  youtube.
com/watch?v=enudW2gHek0&feature=related .  
 Notice that our deﬁ nition of social enterprise is based on 
the use of social media tools and platforms. A related topic is 
 business networks . 
 Business Networks 
 A  business network refers to a group of people with a 
 professional business relationship; for example, the relation-
ships between sellers and buyers, buyers and suppliers, and 
8.1 Social Business and Social Enterprise

184
professionals and their colleagues, such as the 21 st Century 
Community at CEMEX. In this chapter, we use the term  buyers 
to refer to agents buying something for a business (e.g., a pur-
chasing agent). Such a network of people can form  business 
social networks , which are business-oriented networks that 
are built on social relationships and can exist ofﬂ ine or online. 
For example, public places, such as airports or golf courses, 
provide opportunities to make new face-to-face business con-
tacts if an individual has good social skills. Similarly, the 
Internet is also proving to be a good place to network and con-
nect. In this book, we address online networks. The most well-
known network is LinkedIn (  linkedin.com  ). For a discussion 
about business social networks, see Bughin and Chui ( 2013 ). 
 Example: Toyo Engineering 
 Toyo Engineering is a global Japanese corporation. Toyo is 
working on large number of plant engineering projects in 
more than 50 countries offering a wide range of diversiﬁ ed 
technical services for the energy, oil reﬁ nement, chemical, 
pharmaceutical, and food industries. To improve collabora-
tion between global subsidiaries, external business partners, 
and staff in remote locations, and to enhance communication 
between project management teams, and engineering, pro-
curement, construction, and other business process units, the 
company is using social computing solutions from Oracle. 
Oracle Web Center provides: personalization, search and 
discovery, enterprise mashups, analytics, and management. 
For details, see  oracle.com/us/products/middleware/wc-
content-customers-in-action-2016601.pdf . 
 Types of Business Social Networks 
 There are three major types of business social networks: (a) 
 public networks such as LinkedIn, which are owned and oper-
ated by independent companies, and are open to anyone for 
business networking. The networks connect, for example, sell-
ers and buyers or employers and potential employees; (b) 
 enterprise private networks , which operate inside companies, 
like CEMEX’s Shift, in the opening case. These usually 
restrict membership to employees and sometimes to business 
partners. An example is USAA, which set up an internal social 
networking site using Microsoft’s Sharepoint, for employees 
to get to know one another and send internal messages; and (c) 
 company-owned and hosted enterprise networks that are con-
trolled by a company but are open to the public, usually for 
brand-related networking (e.g., Starbucks, Dell).  
 The Beneﬁ ts and Limitations of Enterprise 
Social Networking 
 Social networking appeals to business users for several rea-
sons. For example, social networking makes it easy to: (a) 
ﬁ nd people and information about companies, (b) understand 
the relationships and communication patterns that make a 
company tick, and (c) create a common culture across large 
organizations. 
 The major reasons an organization becomes a social 
enterprise are that it has the abilities to: 
 For details of these and other beneﬁ ts, see Carr ( 2012 ), 
Bughin and Chui ( 2013 ), and Sect.  8.2 . 
 Enterprises that use social media extensively can reap 
the beneﬁ ts found in the previous list and be transformed 
into social businesses. For details, see  ibm.com/social- 
business/us/en . 
 Obstacles and Limitations 
 Some limitations, such as security of information and infor-
mation pollution, slow down the growth of social enterpris-
ing. For details, see Forrester Consulting ( 2010 ) and 
 slideshare.net/norwiz/what-is-enterprise-20 . 
 How Web 2.0 Tools Are Used by Enterprises 
 Web 2.0 tools are used in different ways by various corpora-
tions. Typical uses are: increasing speed of access to knowl-
edge; reducing communication costs; increasing speed of 
•  Improve collaboration inside the enterprise and 
with business partners 
•  Facilitate knowledge management (increase access 
to specialized knowledge) 
•  Build better customer and employee relationships 
•  Facilitate recruiting and employee retention 
•  Increase business and marketing opportunities (e.g., 
meet new potential business partners and/or 
customers) 
•   Reduce operations, communication, and travel costs 
•  Increase sales and revenue (e.g., more sales leads) 
•  Improve customer satisfaction 
•  Reduce marketing and advertising costs 
•  Improve the performance of employees and 
organizations 
•  Foster internal and external relationships 
•  Collect feedback from employees 
•  Build an effective workforce 
•  Improve decision-making capabilities, including 
forecasting 
•  “Spy” on competitors (intelligence gathering) 
•  Find experts and advice (internally and externally) 
•  Improve customer service and CRM 
•  Accelerate innovation and competitive advantage

access to internal exports; decreasing travel costs; increasing 
employee satisfaction; reducing operational costs; reducing 
time-to-market for products/services; and increasing the 
number of successful innovations for new products or 
services. 
 For statistics showing which departments in the enterprise 
use the technology and what speciﬁ c social media tools are 
used, see   idc-community.com/groups/it_agenda/social- 
business/whatarecompaniesdoingwithsocialinitatives-
resultsfromthe2013socialbus  . Some of the uses outside the 
enterprise include recruitment, advice in problem solving, 
joint design, collaboration on supply chain issues, and mar-
keting communication.

8.2 
 BUSINESS-ORIENTED PUBLIC 
SOCIAL NETWORKING 
 Social networking activities are conducted in both public 
and/or private social networking sites. For example, LinkedIn 
is a business-oriented public network, whereas Facebook is 
primarily a public social network used for socially-oriented 
activities. Facebook, however, allows its members to con-
duct business-oriented activities. “My Starbucks Idea” 
(  mystarbucksidea.force.com  ) is an example of a company-
hosted social network that is open to the public. In contrast, 
CEMEX’s internal social network, Shift (see opening case), is 
open only to the company’s employees and is considered pri-
vate. In this section, we will concentrate on public social 
networks. 
 The following are some examples of business-oriented 
public social networks: 
 Case 8.1 
 SC Application 
 Linkedin: The Premier Public Business-Oriented Social 
Network 
 Let us look at LinkedIn ( linkedin.com ), the world’s largest 
professional network. LinkedIn is a global business- oriented 
social networking site (offered in over 20 languages), used 
mainly for professional networking. By November 2014, it 
had over 332 million registered members in over 200 coun-
tries and territories. By 2014, there were 2.1 million different 
groups, each with a special interest. LinkedIn can be used to 
ﬁ nd jobs, people, potential clients, service providers, subject 
experts, and other business opportunities. The company 
became proﬁ table in 2006; in Q3 2014, revenue was $568 
million, an increase of 45 % compared to $393 million in 
the Q3 2013. According to their full year 2014 guidance, 
revenue is expected to range between $2.175 billion and 
$2.180 billion (per  investors.linkedin.com/releasedetail.
cfm?ReleaseID=879471 ). The company ﬁ led for an initial 
public offering in January 2011 and is one of the best per-
forming on the stock market. A major objective of LinkedIn 
is to allow registered users to maintain a list of professional 
contacts (see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn ), i.e., people 
with whom they have a professional relationship. The people 
in each person’s network are called  connections . Users can 
•  Google +.  Google + (“one Google account for every-
thing”), which began operating in 2011, designated 
itself as a business-oriented social network. In its 
ﬁ rst year of operation, it had over 400 million mem-
bers. In February 2014, it had over 1.15 billion users 
and 359 million active users (per  socialmediaslant.
com/google-plus-traffic-stats-February- 2014  ). 
For an overview, see  martinshervington.com/
what-is-google-plus and Brogan ( 2012 ).  
•  Ryze. Similar to LinkedIn, Ryze ( ryze.com ), 
according to its website and About.com, is a busi-
ness social networking site with a focus on the 
entrepreneur. Individuals can use Ryze to help build 
up a personal network and ﬁ nd new jobs, while 
companies can use Ryze to create a business com-
munity. Ryze is especially liked by young profes-
sionals, entrepreneurs, and business owners who 
want to create a networking community for their 
employees (per  webtrends.about.com/od/proﬁ les/
fr/what-is-ryze.htm ). 
•  Yammer. Yammer ( yammer.com ) is a collabora-
tive social software vendor that operates as an 
enterprise social network. It mainly provides capa-
bilities for collaboration. It is used in over 500,000 
leading businesses worldwide, and is considered a 
socially-oriented communication and collaboration 
helper. (Microsoft acquired Yammer in 2012, and it 
is now part of the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Division.) For 
details, see Sect.  8.3 . 
•  LinkedIn. Known as the premier business-oriented 
network,  linkedin.com is the most popular network 
for business, as illustrated in Case  8.1 . (See the info-
graphic at  blog.hootsuite.com/social-network- for-
work .) LinkedIn is known primarily as a tool for 
recruiting and ﬁ nding jobs (Sect.  8.4 and Martin 
2013). LinkedIn shows content and provides cus-
tomer service in a multitude of languages, including 
English, Spanish, French, and Tagalog, among others, 
with a plan for adding other languages in the future.  
8.2 Business-Oriented Public Social Networking

186
invite anyone, whether he or she is a LinkedIn user or not, to 
become a connection. When people join LinkedIn, they cre-
ate a proﬁ le that summarizes their professional accomplish-
ments. This proﬁ le makes it easier to be found by recruiters, 
former colleagues, and others. People can also meet new 
people and ﬁ nd opportunities for collaboration and market-
ing (see  linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140830075111-
7859692-social-network-101- how-linkedin-works ). 
 LinkedIn is based on the concept of “degrees of connec-
tions.” A  contact network consists of a user’s direct connec-
tions (called ﬁ rst degree connections), people connected to 
their ﬁ rst-degree connections (called seconds degree connec-
tions), and people connected to the seconds-degree connec-
tions (called third degree connections). Degree “icons” 
appear next to a contact’s name. For more about degrees, see 
“Six Degrees of Separation – LinkedIn Style” at  thedigitalfa.
com/d-brucejohnston/six-degrees-of-separation-linkedin- 
style . The contact network makes it possible for a profes-
sional to gain an introduction, through a mutual, trusted 
contact, to someone he or she wishes to know. LinkedIn’s 
ofﬁ cials are also members and have hundreds of connections 
each (see Elad  2014 and  linkedin.com ). 
 The “gated-access approach,” where contact with any 
professional requires either a preexisting relationship or the 
intervention of a mutual contact, is intended to build trust 
among the service’s users. 
 The searchable LinkedIn groups feature allows users to 
establish new business relationships by joining alumni, 
industry, professional, or other relevant groups. 
 LinkedIn is especially useful in helping job seekers and 
employers ﬁ nd one another. According to Ahmad ( 2014 ), 
94 % of all U.S. recruiters use LinkedIn to browse for poten-
tial candidates. Job seekers can list their résumés, search for 
open positions, check companies’ proﬁ les, and even review 
the proﬁ les of the hiring managers. Applicants can also make 
connections with existing contacts who can introduce them 
to a speciﬁ c hiring manager. Based on the members’ privacy 
settings, it is even possible for them to see who has looked at 
their proﬁ les. For details, see  linkedin.com/company/linke-
din/careers and  linkedin.com/directory/jobs . 
 Companies can use the site to post available jobs and ﬁ nd 
and recruit employees, especially those who may not actively 
be searching for a new position. 
 Smart Ways to Use Linkedin 
 LinkedIn is known mostly as a platform for recruit-
ment, job searches, and making connections. However, the 
network offers many opportunities for marketing, advertis-
ing, sales, and more. Members can ask others to write 
employment or personal references for them. For a list of 
opportunities, see  linkedintelligence.com/smart-ways-to-
use-linkedin . 
 LinkedIn Answers, a feature for members to ask questions 
and let other members provide answers, was discontinued in 
2013; however, there are similar options available (see  help.
linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35227 ). 
 In mid-2008, LinkedIn launched LinkedIn DirectAds 
(renamed “Ads” in 2011). Ads, which is their version of 
Google’s AdWords, is a self-service, text-based advertising 
product that allows advertisers to reach a targeted profes-
sional audience of their choosing (see their FAQ’s at   help.
linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1015  ). For a com-
parison between DirectAds and AdWords, see  shoutex.com/
linkedin-directads-google-adwords-ppc-1 and  shoutex.
com/linkedin-directads-vs-google-adwords-2 . According 
to a study conducted by HubSpot, LinkedIn has a ‘visitor-to- 
lead’ conversion ratio that is 3 times higher than Facebook 
and 
Twitter 
(see 
 blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/
bid/30030/LinkedIn-277-More-Effective-for-Lead-
Generation-Than-Facebook-Twitter-New-Data.aspx ). 
 In 2008, LinkedIn joined forces with the ﬁ nancial news 
channel CNBC. The deal integrates LinkedIn’s networking 
functionality into CNBC.com, allowing LinkedIn users to 
share and discuss ﬁ nancial and other news with their profes-
sional 
contacts. 
Community-generated 
content 
from 
LinkedIn, such as survey and poll results, are broadcasted on 
CNBC, and CNBC provides LinkedIn with programming, 
articles, blogs, ﬁ nancial data, and video content. Because of 
this connection, CNBC is able to draw insights from 
LinkedIn’s global user base to generate new types of busi-
ness content for CNBC to broadcast. In 2014, LinkedIn 
acquired Bright.com, which connects prospective employees 
with employers by using a computer algorithm (the “Bright 
Score”) to ﬁ nd the best ﬁ t between a job seeker and a particu-
lar job (see  linkedin.com/company/bright.com ). 
 LinkedIn can also be used for several other marketing 
strategies such as creating special groups to promote interest 
in events, purchase paid media space, and following your 
competitors’ online activities (e.g., see Schaffer  2011 and 
 linkedin.com/about-us ). Note that about 66 % of LinkedIn 
users are located outside the United States. For example, 
many users are in Brazil, India, the United Kingdom, and 
France. Over 1 million teachers use LinkedIn for educational 
purposes. 
 As previously mentioned, LinkedIn is a public company. 
It was an instant success, as the share price almost tripled the 
ﬁ rst day of trading. In contrast, shares of Monster, a major 
online recruiting company, plunged more than 60 % during 
2011, mainly due to investors’ fear that LinkedIn would take 
business away from Monster. 
 LinkedIn is constantly adding capabilities to its site. For 
example, in 2014 the company launched features that help 
increase local relevance. 
 Mobile Applications 
 A mobile version of LinkedIn, launched in February 
2008, offers access to most features on the site by using 
mobile devices. The mobile service is supported in a multitude

of languages, including Chinese, English, French, German, 
Japanese, and Spanish (for mobile devices and supported 
languages, see   help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/999  ). 
A recent application is the ability to apply for jobs from 
smartphones and tablets. 
 Some Resources for Linkedin 
 The following are some useful resources for using 
LinkedIn:  blog.linkedin.com, mylinkedinpowerforum.com , 
and  linkedin.com/search .

 Questions 
 1.  Enter  linkedin.com and explore the site. Why do you 
think the site is so successful? 
 2.  What features are related to recruiting and ﬁ nding a job? 
 3.  Conduct an investigation to ﬁ nd the company’s revenue 
sources. Prepare a list. 
 4.  Several companies have attempted to clone LinkedIn 
with little success. Why do you think LinkedIn is 
dominating? 
 5.  Join the group called “eMarketing Association Network” 
on LinkedIn (free; it is a private group so you must request 
to join) and observe their activities regarding social media 
and e-commerce for one week. Write a report. 
 Several other international networks that are similar to 
LinkedIn are Wealink ( wealink.com ) in China, Rediff Pages 
( pages.rediff.com ) in India, International High Potential 
Network (iHipo) ( ihipo.com ) in Sweden, and Moikrug (My 
Circle;  moikrug.ru ) in Russia. 
 There are many public business-oriented networks that 
focus on speciﬁ c industries or types of professional special-
ties, some which are discussed next. 
 Networks for Entrepreneurs 
 Some business-oriented public networks are focused on 
entrepreneurial activities. A few examples are listed next.

 ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS 
 An increasing number of companies have created their own 
in-house, enterprise social networks. Some of these networks 
can be private, developed for use only by their employees, 
former employees, and business partners. Others are open to 
•  Biznik (biznik.com ) . Biznik is a community of 
entrepreneurs and small business owners dedicated to 
helping each other by sharing ideas and knowledge. 
According to  biznik.com/articles/collaboration- 
beats-the-competition , “collaboration beats the 
competition.” Their policy is that members must use 
their real names on the site and Biznik supplements 
its interactions with face-to-face-meetings.  
•  EFactor ( efactor.com ). This is the world’s largest 
network of entrepreneurs (over 1 million members 
in 222 countries across 240 industries; 2014 data) it 
provides members with knowledge, tools, market-
ing, and expertise to succeed and make real, trust-
worthy, and lasting connections. Members connect 
with like-minded people and with investors.  
•  Startup Nation ( startupnation.com ). Participants 
in this community of startup owners and experts are 
helping others to start and operate new businesses. 
This is also a forum to grow a business, fund a busi-
ness, and make connections. Sharing knowledge 
and ideas is the main objective.  
•  Network of Entrepreneurial Women ( nentw.com ). 
This is a grassroots organization for entrepreneurially- 
minded women. Members can attend events, net-
work, and ﬁ nd programs to help them start and 
grow small businesses. 
•  Inspiration Station (inspiration.entrepreneur.
com). Inspiration Station, a place for entrepreneurs 
to share inspiring ideas, is one of the best portals for 
small businesses and start-ups. It has a lot of useful 
information for business owners. It is also a great 
community for users to take advantage of, and con-
nect with fellow business owners from around the 
globe. Inspiration Station is available on Facebook 
( facebook.com/inspirationstation ), Twitter ( twitter.
com/whatsinspiring ), and Instagram ( instagram.
com/whatsinspiring ).

the public, although these are mostly used by their custom-
ers. Private networks are considered to be secured (“behind 
the ﬁ rewall”), and are often referred to as  corporate social 
networks. Such networks come in several formats, depend-
ing on their purpose, the industry, the country, and so forth. 
For the evolution of the networked enterprise, see Bughin 
and Chui ( 2010 ). 
 According to Boyd ( 2008 ), Scrupski and MacDonald 
developed a graphical view of Enterprise 2.0, that can be 
viewed as an overlapping space where Enterprise 2.0 inter-
sects with social media, social collaboration, and digital 
marketing. 
 Taxonomy of Social Enterprise Applications 
 The following terms are frequently used in enterprise net-
working. Most will be discussed in this chapter. 
 Characteristics of Enterprise Social Networks 
 Enterprise social networks, like any social network, enable 
employees to create proﬁ les and interact with one another. 
By encouraging interactions among members, a company 
can foster collaboration and teamwork, and increase 
employee satisfaction. The potential beneﬁ ts of Enterprise 
2.0 are described by Tuten ( 2010 ) and by Hinchcliffe at 
 zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe . 
 For additional information, see the  International Journal 
of Social and Humanistic Computing . 
    An Example of a Private Enterprise Network 
 In the opening case in Chap.   1 , we introduced Starbucks’ 
hosted enterprise network. We also described Sony’s and 
iRobot’s hosted enterprise social networks in Chap.   7 . Many 
other companies also have enterprise networks of all kinds. 
Here is an example of another private network: 
 Example 
 The Greater IBM Connection ( ibm.com/ibm/greateribm ) is 
a global business and professional community (“alumni 
site”) for current and former IBM employees that offers 
many resources, including a job posting site. Join The 
Greater IBM Connection community on a variety of social 
networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). You also can 
share The Greater IBM Connection with your networks by 
posting a link to the   community  and using the hashtags 
 #greateribm or  #ibmalumni in your posts. To ﬁ nd Greater 
IBMers that share your interests, go to the ‘  Members  ’ tab of 
the   LinkedIn group  and type a keyword that matches your 
interest (for example, ‘social media’). When you ﬁ nd Greater 
IBMers you would like to connect with, select the ‘Connect’ 
button to invite them to connect with you. (See  ibm.com/
ibm/greateribm/community_channels.shtml .) 
The 
Greater IBM Connection also has a blog and a private group 
on LinkedIn. 
 How Enterprise Social Networking Helps 
Employees and Organizations 
 Enterprise social networking can help employees in one or 
more of the following ways: 
 1.  Networking and community building. Conducting 
networking and community building, involving 
employees, executives, business partners, and 
customers. 
 2.  Crowdsourcing. Gathering ideas, insights, and 
feedback from crowds (e.g., employees, customers, 
and business partners; see Sect.  8.2 ). Salesforce 
Success Community ( success.salesforce.com ) and 
My Starbucks Idea (  mystarbucksidea.force.com  ) 
are examples. 
 3.  Social collaboration. Collaborative work and 
problem solving using wikis, blogs, instant messag-
ing, collaborative ofﬁ ce documents, and other spe-
cial purpose Web-based collaboration platforms 
such as Laboranova ( laboranova.com ). 
 4.  Social publishing. This is the creation of user- 
generated content in the enterprise, which is acces-
sible to all (e.g.,  slideshare.net ;  youtube.com ). 
 5.  Social views and feedback. Getting feedback and 
opinions from the enterprise’s internal and external 
communities on speciﬁ c issues. 
 1.  Quick access to knowledge, know-how, and 
“know-who.” As people list their skills, expertise, 
and experience, enterprise social networks can help 
simplify the job of locating people with speciﬁ ed 
knowledge and skills.  
 2.  Expansion of social connections and broadening 
of afﬁ liations. Enterprise social networks help 
managers and professionals get to know people bet-
ter by interacting with them in online communities, 
and by keeping up with their personal information. 
Such interaction and information about others can 
decrease the social distance in a company.

189
 Beneﬁ ts to Organizations 
 The beneﬁ ts to organizations, as well as to employees, were 
presented in Sect.  8.1 . In addition, the beneﬁ ts to employees 
can develop into beneﬁ ts to organizations in the long run. 
 Support Services for Enterprise Social 
Networks 
 Businesses can use a variety of services and vendors to sup-
port their social networking. Two examples follow. 
 Example 1: Socialcast 
 Socialcast ( socialcast.com ), a VMware company, is an 
online vendor providing internal social network platforms 
for businesses. Enterprises can use Socialcast to facilitate 
employees with collaboration and communication with 
coworkers. In 2014, the company had more than 30,000 cus-
tomers in 190 countries. The platform connects people to 
knowledge, ideas, and resources. For details, see  socialcast.
com/about . 
 Example 2: Socialtext 
 Socialtext ( socialtext.com ) is an enterprise social software 
vendor, providing an integrated suite of Web-based applica-
tions, including social media tools and platforms. The com-
pany also provides Web  security services. Businesses can 
beneﬁ t by keeping employees connected to the enterprise 
strategy and operations. For details, see  socialtext.com/
about . 
 Yammer: A Social Collaboration Platform 
 Yammer, Inc. ( yammer.com ) is a Microsoft company. 
According to its website, Yammer is “an Enterprise Social 
Network that brings together people, conversations, content, 
and business data in a single location. With Yammer, you can

 How Companies Interface with Social 
Networking 
 Enterprises can interface with public and/or private social 
networks in several ways. The major interfaces, which are 
shown in Fig.  8.1 , are described next.
 3.  Self-branding. People can become creative in 
building their proﬁ les the way they want to be 
known. It helps them promote their personal brand 
within the corporation.  
 4.  Referrals, testimonials, and benchmarking. 
Enterprise social networks can help employees pre-
pare and display referrals and testimonials about 
their work and also benchmark them with their 
colleagues.

2.0 at IBM, see Chess Media Group ( 2012 ). 
8.4 
 ONLINE JOB MARKETS 
AND TRAINING IN SOCIAL 
NETWORKS 
 A major area of activity in social networks, private and pub-
lic, relates to human resource management. 
 Social Recruiting 
 Finding qualiﬁ ed employees in certain ﬁ elds may be a 
 difﬁ cult task. To accomplish this task, companies pay con-
siderable fees to executive recruiters or third-party online 
companies such as  monster.com ,  careerbuilder.com , and 
 jobthread.com . 
 If job seekers are online and active in their search and in 
posting their résumés, there is a good chance that they will 
be seen by recruiters. In addition, many so-called passive job 
seekers are employed and are not actively looking for a new 
job. Therefore, it is important that both active and passive 
job seekers maintain a proﬁ le online that reﬂ ects them in a 
positive light, especially on LinkedIn and Facebook. 
 Both recruiters and job seekers are moving to a new 
recruiting platform—the online social networks—mostly 
LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter (e.g., using TwitJobSearch; 
 twitjobsearch.com , a job search engine allowing employers 
to post job ads on Twitter). Enterprise recruiters are scanning 
online social networks, blogs, and other resources to identify 
and ﬁ nd information about potential employees. 
 Fig. 8.1   The major interfaces with social 
networking 
•  Use existing public social networks, such as  face-
book.com  or virtual worlds, such as  secondlife.
com , to create pages and microcommunities; adver-
tise products or services; and post requests for 
advice, job openings, and so forth.  
•  Create an in-house private social network and then 
use it for communication and collaboration among 
employees and retirees or with outsiders (e.g., cus-
tomers, suppliers, designers). Employees can create 
virtual rooms in their company’s social networks 
where they can deploy applications to share infor-
mation or collaborate. 
•  Conduct business activities in a business-oriented 
or professional social network (e.g.,  linkedin or 
 sermo.com ; for physicians only). 
•  Create services for social networks, such as soft-
ware development, security, consulting services, 
and more (e.g., Oracle, IBM, Microsoft). 
•  Use Web 2.0 software tools, mostly blogs, wikis, 
workspaces, microblogging (Twitter), and team 
rooms, and create innovative applications for both 
internal and external users. 
•  Create and/or participate in a social marketplace 
such as Fotolia ( us.fotolia.com ). 
 
8 The Social Enterprise: From Recruiting to Problem Solving and Collaboration

191
 Clearly, the electronic job market has beneﬁ ts, but it can 
also create high turnover costs for employers by facilitating 
employees’ movements to look for better jobs. In addition, 
ﬁ nding candidates online is more complicated than most peo-
ple think, mostly due to the large number of résumés available 
in social media sites. To facilitate recruitment, top recruiters 
are seeking the beneﬁ ts of Web tools, like interviewing candi-
dates by video from remote locations. They also use social 
media tools and many social networking sites to help people 
get hired faster. Some recruiters send Facebook “friend” invi-
tations to candidates whom they have  interviewed. However, 
this can be a controversial practice due to ethical implications 
(see  archive-org.com/page/3465138/2014-01-04/http://www.
naceweb.org/s06122013/social-media-privacy-law.aspx ). 
 Facebook has many features that help people ﬁ nd jobs 
(see  jobcast.net for jobseekers and employers to connect; 
Social Jobs Partnership [ facebook.com/socialjobs ], a col-
laboration between Facebook and the U.S. Department of 
Labor); and Sundberg ( 2010 ). 
 LinkedIn provides a similar service. For an overview and 
examples, see Sundberg ( 2011 ). LinkedIn’s search engine 
can help employers quickly ﬁ nd appropriate candidates. For 
ﬁ nding employees (jobs) in other countries, one can use 
LinkedIn or Xing ( xing.com ). An interesting global recruit-
ing community is EURES ( ec.europa.eu/eures ), which spe-
cializes in online recruiting in Europe. 
 Lately, there has been an increased use of mobile recruit-
ing tools in general, and on Twitter in particular (see Martin 
 2013 ), as aids for people who are searching for jobs. The 
following are possible activities:
  (a)  Search for posted positions 
 (b)  Follow job search experts 
  (c)  Follow and read about people in your ﬁ eld 
 (d)  Engage, communicate with people, and ask for help 
  (e)  Connect with people at your target companies 
 For more tips on how to do this, see Scott ( 2013 ). For an 
infographic showing how using social media can help you 
land a new job, see  mashable.com/2013/01/23/social-media-
your-next-job-infographic . 
 Recruiting and Job Searching Using Social Networks 
 Most public social networks, especially those that are 
business- oriented, facilitate recruiting and job ﬁ nding. For 
example, recruiting is a major activity on LinkedIn, and was 
the driver for the site’s development (see Case  8.1 , page 
181). To be competitive, companies must look at the global 
market for talent. Luckily, searchers can use global social 
networking sites to ﬁ nd it. Large companies are using their 
in- house social networks to ﬁ nd in-house talent for vacant 
positions. Furthermore, some claim that social media has 
signiﬁ cantly changed the hiring process (e.g., see Huff 
 2014 ). For how to use social media to impress recruiters see 
Salpeter ( 2014 ). 
 According to a Jobvite survey on social recruiting (2013), 
94 % of companies use, or plan to use, social media to 
recruit and hire new employees, while 78 % have hired a 
candidate through social media. Of these, 94 % use 
LinkedIn, 65 % use Facebook, and 55 % use Twitter. Among 
these, the success rate for hiring is very high on LinkedIn 
(92 %), moderate on Facebook (24 %), and low on Twitter 
(14 %). See  web.jobvite.com/rs/jobvite/images/Jobvite_
SocialRecruiting2013.pdf . 
 As described earlier, LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace, and 
Craigslist provide job listings, in competition with online 
recruiters such as Monster. Many other social networks offer 
job listings as well. For how to land a job using Facebook, 
see Morrison ( 2011 ). For a comprehensive case study on 
how to use social media to recruit, see Brouat ( 2011 ). 
 In one example, Salesforce.com ( salesforce.com ), a 
CRM software company, has partnered with Facebook to 
allow Salesforce.com customers to build Facebook applica-
tions using the Force.com toolkit. 
 Note that, while over 90 % of recruiters use social net-
works for seeking and researching qualiﬁ ed candidates, 
nearly 69 % have rejected candidates due to the content 
posted on their social network sites, according to a 2011 
Reppler study (reported by Bennett  2011 ). It is important for 
employees to keep their social media personal information 
secure (or as private as possible). Another issue for candi-
dates is that many times employers have discovered through 
social networks that their employees are looking for work 
elsewhere. For recruiting via gamiﬁ cation, see Greenberg 
( 2014 ). For a thorough guide to job searching with social 
media, see Waldman ( 2013 ). 
  Virtual Job Fairs and Recruiting Events 
 Virtual job fairs offer strategies for quickly ﬁ nding quali-
ﬁ ed candidates at a reduced cost. These are done using spe-
cial vendor sites (e.g.,  on24.com ,  expos2.com , and 
 brazencareerist.com ), virtual world sites, social networks, 
or the employers’ websites. For an overview, see Martin 
( 2010 ). 
 The following are a few examples:
•  IBM needed qualiﬁ ed employees for leadership positions 
in Africa. To quickly attract qualiﬁ ed employees, it used 
ON24 to conduct a job fair. For the complete story, see 
 on24.com/case-studies/ibm-job-fair . 
•  P&G of Western Europe conducts annual virtual recruit-
ing conferences using INXPO platform. The event is suc-
cessful and it is used as a model for other European 
companies. For a complete description, see  inxpo.com/
assets/pdfs/CS_P&G.pdf . 
8.4 Online Job Markets and Training in Social Networks

192
•  The state of Michigan periodically conducts virtual career 
fairs where job seekers and recruiters meet online. The 
latest ones were held in November 2014. For details, see 
 michiganvirtualcareerfair.com . 
 Virtual job fairs occur frequently in virtual worlds, and 
may be associated with virtual trade shows, which are 
described in Chap.   9 . 
 Training Employees 
 Several companies use enterprise social networking, and vir-
tual worlds in particular, for training purposes. For example, 
IBM has run management and customer interaction training 
sessions in Seconds Life. Bernoff and Schadler ( 2010 ) pro-
vide an example of video training at Black & Decker using 
user-generated videos posted on YouTube. These videos help 
reduce training time. 
 For using social networks to enhance employee learning, 
see Brotherton ( 2011 ) and  unitek.com/training/blog/
unitek-education-citrix-training-hands-on-training-in-a- 
virtual-world . 
 Training for Social Media Use 
 Some businesses are creating training programs to show their 
employees how the use of social media can be a valuable 
business tool. Training is done by using traditional training 
methods and social training tools. In one example, Telstra 
( telstra.com.au ), Australia’s leading telecommunications 
and information services company, made social media train-
ing mandatory for all its 40,000 plus employees. For details, 
see  mashable.com/2009/12/16/Telstra-social-media . For 
how to conduct social media training, see Schwartzman 
( 2011 ). For an example of what can be done with social media 
to conduct effective training, see   trainingmag.com/
how-train-employees-using-social-media .  
8.5 
 MANAGERIAL PROBLEM SOLVING, 
INNOVATION, AND KNOWLEDGE 
MANAGEMENT 
 Managers consistently engage in decision making and prob-
lem solving; however, some of the problems are difﬁ cult to 
solve and require specialized knowledge. Thus, a major 
activity in an organization is discovering and preserving the 
knowledge of experts for future problem solving. In addi-
tion, idea generation is the ﬁ rst major task in a problem- 
solving process, and it is an essential activity in facilitating 
innovation. Social media can facilitate all these activities. 
For an example of  Innovation 2.0 , see Spigit ( 2011 ). 
 Idea Generation and Problem Solving 
 Bernoff and Li ( 2008 ) suggest deployment of social 
 networking for aiding research and development, gaining 
insight from conversations, and using the input to encourage 
innovations. 
 IBM’s Innovation Projects and Communities 
 As a technology leader, IBM has created several innovation 
centers around the world. It also has several social commerce- 
oriented projects and communities such as:
•  IBM Jams. The IBM “Jam” is an Internet-based platform 
for conducting conversations through brainstorming. 
Each year, the “Jam” focuses on a different topic. (See 
 collaborationjam.com .) In 2011, for example, it was 
centered around social business (see  ftp.software.ibm.
com/ftp/info/social/IBM_Social_Business_Jam_
Report.pdf . In 2013, it was called ‘Client Experience 
Jam.’ 
•  IBM Connections . IBM Connections is a social platform 
for businesses that, according to IBM, “lets you access 
everyone in your professional network, including your 
colleagues, customers, and partners.” 
 Problem-Solving Activities 
 An increasing number of companies use social networking 
and crowdsourcing (Sect.  8.6 ) to facilitate problem solving. 
For an overview, see Liang and Turban ( 2011 /2012). 
 Here are several examples of problem-solving profes-
sional sites:
•  HP launched an in-house private social network for their 
own IT professionals around the world. This network is 
called “HP Enterprise Business Community” (see  h30499.
www3.hp.com ). 
 The site offers almost all the features that currently 
are being offered by public social networks (e.g., 
Facebook), but is also equipped with HP system manage-
ment tools. The site offers IT workers a Web platform for 
troubleshooting and discussing recurrent IT problems. 
The collected information is entered into a repository of 
information for future use.  
•  Some pharmaceutical companies are collaborating with 
 sermo.com , a social-networking site, exclusively for 
licensed physicians. The network provides for interaction 
and discussion between pharmaceutical professionals and 
the physicians who use Sermo. Sermo generates revenue 
by facilitating market research and sharing its content 
with pharmaceutical companies and clinical research 
organizations, among others. 
8 The Social Enterprise: From Recruiting to Problem Solving and Collaboration

193
 Other examples of problem solving social-oriented activi-
ties include ﬁ nding experts and mapping communities of 
expertise. 
 Consider the following examples of social networking for 
 knowledge management and  expert location : 
 Companies also create  retiree corporate social networks 
to keep retirees connected with each other and with the orga-
nization where they used to work. Retirees possess a vast 
source of knowledge that can be tapped for productivity 
increases and problem solving (e.g., Alumni Connect from 
SelectMinds; an Oracle Company). With 64 million ‘baby 
boomers’ retiring within the next 8 years, preserving their 
knowledge is critical. 
 Knowledge Management and Social Networks 
 Knowledge management (KM) is a process of capturing 
(or creating) knowledge, storing it, constantly updating it, 
disseminating it, and using it whenever necessary. This way, 
knowledge is shared for useful purposes, ranging from prob-
lem solving to increased productivity. Most activities in 
knowledge management can be facilitated by social media 
tools and platforms. 
 Knowledge Creation and Sharing 
 Online communities are a major forum for knowledge cre-
ation. For example, social collaboration tools or crowdsourc-
ing can facilitate knowledge creation. This area has several 
variations. One variety is limited within a single company, 
such as Knowledge Network at Caterpillar Inc. Another is a 
public social network whose members are interested in a 
knowledge management common topic such as knowledge 
acquisition. Yet another type is a combination of the two. 
The major purposes of such communities are:
•  Knowledge creation. The creation of knowledge for a 
speciﬁ c problem or area. Individuals are asked to contrib-
ute to a solution or offer valuable advice. For example, 
IBM, GE, and other companies have communities of 
employees and business partners who contribute to idea 
generation and problem solving.  
•  Knowledge sharing. Members tell other members where 
to ﬁ nd knowledge of interest to the community (Currier 
 2010 ). Knowledge sharing is supported by tools such as 
IBM Connections (see IBM Software Group 2011). 
 Web 2.0 applications help aggregate corporate knowledge 
and simplify the building of repositories of best practices, as 
demonstrated by the following example. 
 Example: IBM’s Social Business 
 IBM has long used communities for idea generation and 
problem solving. One of its best-known communities is the 
Innovation Jam, an online brainstorming session which 
focuses on a different topic each year (e.g., in 2013, it was 
called the Client Experience Jam;  collaborationjam.com/
IBMJam ). This community of over 150,000 employees and 
members of business partners tries to help IBM move the 
latest technologies to the market. IBM has been hosting 
online brainstorming sessions since 2001. For example, in 
July 2006, IBM invited employees, partners, and customers 
to contribute ideas about a certain new product. Within 72 h, 
more than 50,000 ideas were posted. These ideas were then 
winnowed down by using sophisticated analytical software. 
Several ideas generated in this process were implemented, 
resulting in substantial savings. Sample topics of Innovation 
Jams include new technologies for water ﬁ ltration, 3-D 
Internet, and branchless banking. For more on IBM’s 
Innovation Jams—the process, example of topics, and 
results, as well as the use of virtual worlds—see Bjelland and 
Wood ( 2008 ) and  collaborationjam.com . 
 Virtual meetings where IBM employees can participate in 
virtual Innovation Jam meetings.  
 Learning Communities 
 Social networks and Web 2.0 tools can be used in learning 
and training as a subset of knowledge sharing. Lenox and 
Coleman ( 2010 ) provide a comprehensive guide explaining 
how to do this in large libraries. The guide can also be used 
in other organizations that consider such training. Strong 
( 2013 ) provides a guide to content brainstorming for 2013. 
•  InnoCentive ( innocentive.com ) is a global leader 
in crowdsourcing innovation problems with over 
355,000 registered problem solvers from nearly 200 
countries, who compete to provide ideas and solu-
tions to important business, social policy, etc. chal-
lenges (for cash rewards -- $5,000 to $1+ million 
based on the complexity of the problem and nature 
of the challenge; Data current as of January 2015.)  
•  Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company 
( northwesternmutual.com ) created an internal 
enterprise social network (called Mutualnet) and an 
internal blog (called (Mutualblog). They also have 
an internal Yammer account, which is used by over 
1,000 employees to have dialog and make 
connections. 
•  Caterpillar ( caterpillar.com ) created a knowledge 
network system for its employees and dealers, and the 
company markets the software to other companies.  
8.5 Managerial Problem Solving, Innovation, and Knowledge Management

 Online Advice and Consulting 
 Offering advice and consulting services is an important use 
of knowledge online. The online advice and consulting ﬁ eld 
is growing rapidly as tens of thousands of experts of all kinds 
provide (for a fee or free) their expertise over the Internet. 
The following are some examples:
•  Social networks.  Several social networks allow users to 
post questions and get answers. For example, people use 
the LinkedIn Help Center to ask questions.  
•  Medical advice. Companies such as WebMD ( webmd.
com ) and others (e.g., LivePerson ( liveperson.com/
health-medicine ) provide health advice and some con-
sultations with top medical experts, either for free or for a 
per-minute fee. Consumers can ask speciﬁ c questions on 
these sites and get answers from specialists. For example, 
DoctorSpring ( doctorspring.com ) offers online consul-
tations with health care professionals (fee schedule deter-
mined by category), and allows two free follow-up 
questions. Health advising sites offer specialized advice 
and tips for travelers, for pet owners, and others. Of spe-
cial interest is PatientsLikeMe ( patientslikeme.com ), a 
community where patients discuss their health problems 
and solutions, with advice and suggestions provided by 
other members. 
•  Gurus. Several sites provide diversiﬁ ed expert services, 
some for free. One example is  answers.com (formerly 
GuruNet), which is free, and provides businesses with an 
efﬁ cient platform to connect and perform transactions 
with freelance professionals, locally, nationally, and glob-
ally. The community has more than 130 million members 
on the Web and over 225 million registered users (August 
2014). 
•  Expertise is also available at Elance ( elance.com ) . 
Companies can use this site to ﬁ nd, hire, manage, and pay 
contractors online. On Elance, companies can gain instant 
access to tens of thousands of rated and tested profession-
als who offer technical, marketing, and business expertise. 
Of special interest is Scientiﬁ cAmerican.com, which has 
an “Ask The Experts” section (see  scientiﬁ camerican.com/
section/ask-the-experts ), and offers articles by experts on 
scientiﬁ c and technological topics. Some other sites that offer 
information from experts are Yahoo! Answers ( answers.
yahoo.com ), Catholic Answers ( forums.catholic.com ), 
HealthAnswers ( healthanswers.com ), and North Shore 
Animal League ( animalleague.org/expert-advice ). Some 
provide answers for free; others charge fees for premium 
services. 
 One word of caution about online advice: It is not wise to 
risk your health, your money, or your legal status on free or 
even for-fee online advice. Always seek more than one opin-
ion, and carefully check the reputation and the credentials of 
any advice provider. 
 Questions and Answers on Social Networks 
 In a Q&A “answer” function, individuals and companies’ 
employees can post questions. For example, in LinkedIn, 
you can ask the community a question by using the posting 
module on the ‘Help Forum’ or by using the posting mod-
ule on your homepage to ask your network a question. 
Additionally, you can use the ‘share box’ on your home 
page to ask questions from your connections, everyone on 
LinkedIn, or even on Twitter. Many other professional net-
works and their internal groups provide advice and sup-
porting material for help in decision making. These 
services can be either paid or for free. For example, 
according to the medical social network Sermo ( sermo.
com ; “Social Media Meets Healthcare”), a large online 
community exclusive to physicians, uses iConsult, an 
application that “allows physicians to author and discuss 
urgent and interesting patient cases from any Web- or 
mobile-enabled device, and based on market tests, be 
almost assured feedback from multiple colleagues. Typical 
questions and responses include requested/suggested diag-
noses and treatments with the best insights often resulting 
from collaboration among the doctors” (see  sermo.com/
who-we-are/press-releases-view/3 ).

 CROWDSOURCING: COLLECTIVE 
INTELLIGENCE FOR PROBLEM 
SOLVING AND CONTENT 
CREATION 
 The essentials of crowdsourcing were described in Chap.   2 . 
Listed there, as a major capability, was the facilitation of 
problem solving. 
 Crowdsourcing as a Distributed Problem 
Solving Enabler 
 Crowdsourcing describes a set of tools, concepts, and meth-
odologies that deal with the process of outsourcing work, 
including problem solving and idea generation to a  commu-
nity of potential solvers known as the ‘crowd.’ 
 More than just brainstorming or ideation, crowdsourcing 
uses proven techniques to focus on the crowd’s innovation, 
creativity, and problem-solving capacity, on topics of vital 
interest to the host organization. An overview of crowdsourc-
ing is provided in Jeff Howe’s video titled “Crowdsourcing” 
(3:20 minutes) at  youtube.com/watch?v=F0- UtNg3ots  . See 
also  crowdsourcing.org and Brabham ( 2013 ). Also watch 
Brabham’s video titled “Crowdsourcing as a Model for 
Problem 
Solving”

  Crowdsourcing Categories 
 Howe ( 2008 ) has classiﬁ ed applications of crowdsourcing 
into the following four categories: 
 Chaordix Corp. ( chaordix.com ) classiﬁ es crowdsourcing 
into the following three models:
 1.  Secretive. Individuals submit ideas, and the winner is 
selected by the company. Ideas are not visible to all 
participants. 
 2.  Collaborative. Individuals submit ideas, the crowd eval-
uates the ideas, and the crowd picks the winners. Ideas are 
visible to all participants.  
 3.  Panel selects.  Individuals submit ideas, the crowd 
evolves ideas, a panel selects ﬁ nalists, and the crowd 
votes for the winner. 
 A  crowdsortium is a community of industry practitioners 
whose mission is to advance the crowdsourcing industry 
through best practices and education (see  crowdsortium.
org ). They view crowdsourcing as an ecosystem. 
 Crowdsourcing also has the potential to be a problem- 
solving mechanism for governments and nonproﬁ t use via 
community participation. Urban and transit planning are 
prime areas for crowdsourcing. One project used crowd-
sourcing to encourage public participation in the planning 
process for the Salt Lake City transit system (from 2008 to 
2009). Another notable application of crowdsourcing to gov-
ernment problem solving is the Peer to Patent Community 
Patent Review project for the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Ofﬁ ce, see  peertopatent.org . (This project opens the patent 
examination process to public participation.) 
 Progressive companies and organizations now recognize 
the value of tapping into the wisdom of the crowd to capture 
the best answers and the most innovative ideas. For a com-
prehensive coverage, see Chin et al. ( 2014 ). 
 Example 
 In 2012, the Brazilian furniture company Galatea 
 (galateacasa.com.br ) tapped the crowd to help design furni-
ture and decide which products to sell. Visitors to their 
e-commerce site voted on proposed models. For details, see 
 crowdsourcing.org/document/in-brazil-furniture-store-taps-
the-crowds-to-help- decide-product-range/12412 . 
 The Process of Crowdsourcing 
 The process of crowdsourcing, which was described brieﬂ y 
in Chap.   2 , differs from application to application, depend-
ing on the models of the speciﬁ c problem(s) to be solved and 
the method used. However, the following steps exist in most 
enterprise applications, even though the details of the execu-
tion differ. The major steps are based on the generic process 
described in Chap.   2 . They are: 
 The MIT Guide for Collective Intelligence 
 Malone et al. ( 2010 ) conducted a detailed analysis about the 
use of what they call  collective intelligence (CI) , which is 
an application of crowdsourcing for problem solving, idea 
generation, and innovations. The researchers attempted to 
answer the question: How can you get the crowds to do what 
your business needs done? 
 1.  Collective intelligence (or wisdom). Here, people 
are solving problems and providing new insights 
and ideas leading to product, process, or service 
innovations.   
 2.  Crowd creation. Here, people are creating various 
types of content and sharing it with others (paid or 
for free). The content may be used for problem 
solving, advertising, or knowledge accumulation. 
This can be done by splitting large tasks into small 
segments (e.g., contributing content to create 
Wikipedia entries). 
 3.  Crowd voting. Here, people are giving their opin-
ions and ratings on ideas, products, or services, as 
well as evaluating and ﬁ ltering information pre-
sented to them. An example would be voting on 
 American Idol . 
  4.  Crowd support and funding. Here, people are con-
tributing and supporting endeavors for social causes, 
which might include volunteering their effort and 
time, offering donations, and micro-ﬁ nancing.  
 1.  Identify the task (problem) you want to investigate 
or accomplish. 
 2.  Select the target crowd. 
 3.  Broadcast the task to the crowd. (Frequently to an 
unidentiﬁ ed crowd in an open call, as Starbucks and 
Dell do.) 
 4.  Engage the crowd in accomplishing the task (e.g., 
idea generation). 
 5.  Collect the user-generated content. (This may 
include a submission of solutions, voting, new 
ideas, etc.). 
 6.  Evaluate the quality of submitted material by the 
management that initiated the request, by experts, 
or by the crowd. 
 7.  Accept or reject a solution. 
 8.  Compensate the crowd.

 Successfully Deployed Crowdsourcing 
Systems: Some Representative Examples 
 The following are some representative examples of 
 implemented crowdsourcing systems. 
 Tools for Crowdsourcing 
 To launch crowdsourcing initiatives, businesses and devel-
opers can make use of crowdsourcing tools and platforms, 
such as NineSigma, InnoCentive, YourEncore, yet2, 
UserVoice, Get Satisfaction, and IdeaScale. 
 For related tools for idea generation, see  capterra.com/
idea-management-software and  collaborationproject.org . 
For tools for crowdfunding, see  2013 CF Crowdfunding 
Industry report. For additional tools for crowdsourcing, see 
 crowdsourcing.org . 
 Crowdfunding and Kickstarter 
 Raising funds from the crowd for different purposes is gain-
ing popularity with several startups operating in this area. A 
notable company is Kickstarter. For how they help small 
businesses, see the 2013 video titled “Small Business: 
Kickstarter Success” (6:50 minutes) at  youtube.com/
watch?v=xudOhEYIwyU . 
 Examples of Crowdsourcing 
 An increasing number of startups are using crowdfunding to 
initiate their businesses. In Chap.   6 we provided a few exam-
ples. Here are three more examples:
•  Filmmaker Zach Braff used Kickstarter to raise money 
for his 2013 ﬁ lm (watch the video “Zach Braff Uses 
Kickstarter to Get Money for Next Film” (0:51 minutes) 
at  youtube.com/watch?v=CIyJtcxjWhw . 
•  Zach Danger Brown collected over $52,000 on 
Kickstarter in July 2014 for his ‘potato salad’ idea. 
For details, see Root ( 2014 ) and a video about how the 
collection went global at  abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/
zach-danger-browns-potato-salad - kickstarter-global-
24464503 . 
•  The digital music phenomenon, Kawehi, is raising money 
via Kickstarter to promote her music projects in Hawaii. 
For details, see Russo ( 2014 ). 
 Hypios: A Marketplace for Crowdsourcing 
 According to its website, Hypios ( hypios.com ) is an open 
call market for crowdsourcing with over 950,000 experts 
across the world. As a problem-solving individual or research 
organization, Hypios combines intelligent crowdsourcing, 
competency discovery technology, and human outreach to 
deliver an optimal open problem-solving service. “Seekers” 
post R&D problems to the network and select a deadline and 
a price offered for the successful “Solver.” The company’s 
partners help formulate the problem, set a reward prize and a 
deadline. The problem is then posted on the Hypios solving 
platform and on Facebook ( facebook.com/hypios ). Using 
its powerful semantic analysis software, Hypios creates a 
conceptual graph of the problem to extract and suggest rele-
vant keywords. These keywords are then used to search the 
Web using a competency discovery engine that identiﬁ es 
potential experts. For more information, see  hypios.com/
product- services/how-hypios-works-0 . 
•  Dell’s IdeaStorm ( ideastorm.com ) enables cus-
tomers to vote on Dell’s product features they prefer, 
including new ones. Dell is using a technically-ori-
ented crowd, such as the Linux community.  
•  Procter & Gamble’s  researchers post their prob-
lems at  innocentive.com and at  ninesigma.com , 
offering cash rewards to problem solvers. P&G 
uses other crowdsourcing service providers such as 
 yourencore.com . 
•  Amazon Mechanical Turk ( mturk.com ) is a mar-
ketplace for distributing large scale work that 
requires human intelligence. It is limited to large 
tasks that can be divided (known as HITs—human 
intelligence tasks) and is posted by companies that 
need assistance. Then, Amazon arranges workers 
(the “Mechanical Turk Workers”), each of whom is 
allocated a small subtask, and is paid when the 
work is completed. For details, see  mturk.com . 
•  Facebook (facebook.com ) used crowdsourcing to 
translate its site into more than 65 different languages. 
The completion of the English to French translated by 
over 4,000 volunteers only took one day; however, 
Facebook had to hire a team of professional transla-
tors to oversee the whole crowdsourcing process to 
ensure that the resulting translations were accurate.  
•  Goldcorp ( goldcorp.com ), a Canadian mining 
company, was unable to ﬁ nd sufﬁ cient gold. In 
2000, the company initiated an open call to the pub-
lic, providing geological data and $575,000 in 
prizes to participants with the best methods. Using 
the submitted ideas, the company discovered $3 bil-
lion worth of gold.  
•  Frito-Lay ( fritolay.com ) used crowdsourcing for 
designing a successful 2010 Super Bowl advertis-
ing campaign (Frito-Lay  2010 ). 
•  Wikipedia ( wikipedia.org ) is considered by many 
to be the “granddaddy” of crowdsourcing, and is 
certainly the world’s largest crowdsourcing project.

 SOCIAL COLLABORATION 
(COLLABORATION 2.0) 
 One of the major applications of Web 2.0 and social media in 
the enterprise is in the area of collaboration. Some even 
equate Web 2.0 with enterprise collaboration (e.g., McAfee 
 2009 ). Social collaboration is used for many purposes, an 
important one being product design. 
 Supporting Social Collaboration 
 Collaboration in business can be deﬁ ned as “ people working 
with other people toward a common outcome.” For a com-
prehensive overview of collaboration supported by social 
media, see Carr ( 2013 ). For many images of social collabo-
ration, search Google Images for ‘social collaboration.’ 
 Social collaboration refers to people’s collaboration 
within and between communities enabled by social media 
tools and platforms. The processes help people interact and 
share information to achieve a common goal. It is also 
known as  Collaboration 2.0 . Collaboration 2.0 is recog-
nized as a major element in social business that can provide 
considerable beneﬁ ts (e.g., see examples in IBM Software 
Group 2011). For implementation of social collaboration, 
see Carr ( 2013 ). 
 Social Collaboration (Collaboration 2.0) 
 Collaboration drives business value up by enabling people to 
work together more efﬁ ciently. Wikis and other social soft-
ware tools can be used effectively by all types and sizes of 
enterprises for a wide range of tasks and activities. 
Collaboration helps with solving business problems and 
uncovering new opportunities, especially with the help of 
social media tools (see details in Morgan  2012 ). Collaboration 
in social networking is done both internally, among employ-
ees from different units working in virtual teams, and exter-
nally, when working with suppliers, customers, and other 
business partners. For example, ccollaboration occurs in 
forums and other types of groups, and by using wikis and 
blogs. For details on collaboration in social networks, see 
Coleman and Levine ( 2008 ). For the use of Collaboration 
2.0 in the enterprise, see Dortch ( 2012 ) and Turban et al. 
( 2015 ). Social collaboration has several dimensions, as illus-
trated in Fig.  8.2 .

8.7 Social Collaboration (Collaboration 2.0)

198
 Some believe that in the future, people will use mostly 
Web 2.0 tools, rather than e-mail, for collaboration. For a 
discussion, see The Future Organization at  thefutureorgani-
zation.com . 
 A large number of Web 2.0 tools are used to support social 
collaboration. The support is given to idea sharing, commu-
nication, working together on the same documents, and 
more. The Web 2.0 tools range from wikis to virtual worlds. 
For comprehensive coverage, see Coleman and Levine 
( 2008 ). Dunay ( 2014 ) provides a synopsis of a webinar he 
moderated on how to use enterprise social networks for 
internal collaboration. 
 The development of tools, philosophies, and procedures 
of social media support for collaboration allows employees 
and managers to engage much more fully in the collabora-
tion process. Furthermore, social collaboration has improved 
organizational culture. 
 Social collaboration is supported mainly by: 
 Most of the collaboration software vendors are adding 
Web 2.0 tools to their collaboration suites (e.g., Binﬁ re.com). 
 Using Blogs and Wikis Inside the Enterprise 
 In Chap.   2  , we provided some examples of blogs and wikis used 
within enterprises. The use of these tools is expanding rapidly. 
Ccompanies use blogs and wikis for the following activities: 
 As you can see, most of the applications in the previous 
list relate to collaboration. For additional information, you 
can read various blogs at  zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe . 
 Using Twitter to Support Collaboration 
 Twitter is already used extensively in the enterprise to sup-
port collaboration. For example, Wagner ( 2009 ) describes 
using Twitter to facilitate the work of focus groups and other 
collaborative teams. Twitter is used extensively for interac-
tion with customers and prospects as well as conducting 
market research. 
 The Role of Mobile Commerce in Social Collaboration 
 As described in Chap.   6  , mobile commerce is growing very 
rapidly. Most enterprise social applications can be used on 
wireless devices. This is particularly true for communication 
and collaboration. 
 Suites of Social Collaboration Tools 
 Several companies offer suites of social collaboration tools, 
either as stand-alone products or as added tools in existing 
collaboration suites. 
 What 
is 
enterprise 
collaboration? According 
to 
TechTarget, “Enterprise collaboration is a system of com-
munication among corporate employees that may encompass 
the use of a collaboration platform, enterprise social net-
working tools, a corporate intranet, and the public Internet” 
(per  searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/
enterprise-collaboration-EC ). For why a company needs 
social collaboration, see  web.esna.com/blog/social-collaboration-
at-c-level . 
 Example 1: IBM Connections 
 IBM Connections is a leading social network software plat-
form that provides collaboration tools for creating forums, 
wikis, and blogs, and new capabilities like advanced social 
analytics, which enable users to expand their network of 
connections and engagement. For details, see  ibm.com/soft-
ware/products/en/conn . 
 You can download many free reports at  collabora-
tionjam.com . IBM also provides the tools needed to support 
innovation. 
 Example 2: Cisco WebEx Social Meeting Center 
 WebEx Meetings offers mobile apps for iPad, iPhone, 
Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and other devices. 
For more information, see  webex.com/products/web-con-
ferencing/mobile.html . 
 For 10 social networks that aim at improved enterprise 
social collaboration, see Reisinger ( 2015 ). 
 What is a collaboration platform? According to 
TechTarget, “a collaboration platform is a category of busi-
ness software that adds broad social networking capabilities 
•  Wikis, blogs, and microblogging (e.g., Twitter) 
•  Virtual worlds (see Heiphetz and Woodill  2010 ) 
•  Collaborative communities (forums and discussion 
groups) 
•  Early vintage Web 2.0 technologies 
•  Crowdsourcing 
•  Other tools (e.g., Yammer) 
•  Project collaboration and communication 
•  Process and procedure documentation 
•  FAQs 
•  E-learning and e-training 
•  Forums for new ideas 
•  Corporate-speciﬁ c dynamic glossary and terminology  
•  Collaboration with customers

to work processes” (per  searchcontentmanagement. 
techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/collaboration-platform ). 
 Example 3: Laboranova 
  Under the European Union’s Sixth Framework Programme, 
 laboranova.com  assists professionals who take part in the man-
agement and development of innovations. Laboranova’s tools 
and methodologies assist in the areas of team building, knowl-
edge management, and the evaluation of innovations. It consists 
of a suite of Web 2.0 tools adopted for social innovation and 
collaboration. The tools include InnoTube ( laboranova.com/
pages/tools/innotube.php?lang=DE ), which operates like a 
private YouTube for business; and Melodie ( laboranova.com/
pages/tools/melodie.php?lang=DE ), which creates visual 
maps of concepts or ideas submitted by its users, so that other 
users can comment or elaborate on the initial ideas.

 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  The social enterprise. Conducting social networking 
activities in the enterprise can result in substantial bene-
ﬁ ts. Two types of business social networks exist: public 
and private. The private network is company owned; it 
may have restricted access, or it may be open to the pub-
lic. The public network (e.g., LinkedIn) is used mainly for 
recruiting, connections, collaboration, and marketing 
communication. The private, in-house social enterprise 
uses Collaboration 2.0, social CRM, social marketing 
media, and more. You can even “spy” on your competi-
tors (see  entrepreneur.com/article/229350 ). All this 
translates to improved relationships with employees, cus-
tomers, and business partners. Signiﬁ cant cost reduction, 
productivity increase, and competitive advantage can be 
achieved as well. 
 2.  Business-oriented public social networks. Following 
the successful examples of LinkedIn and Xing, many 
business-oriented public networks were created. Notable 
networks are Yammer, Viadeo, and Google+. Applications 
vary from recruiting to market research and advertising. 
Most notable is F-commerce. One major activity in pub-
lic networks is external collaboration. Several entrepre-
neurship networks also exist.  
 3.  Major enterprise social commerce activities. Currently, 
collaboration and communication, as well as community 
building, are the major activities. In addition, problem 
solving via idea generation and ﬁ nding expertise are 
becoming more and more important. Related to this is 
knowledge creation and management. Companies recruit, 
train, and conduct other HRM activities in enterprise net-
works. In addition, some companies allow P2P activities. 
Several companies also use the enterprise social network 
for interactions with customers, suppliers, and other busi-
ness partners. 
 4.  The online job market and its beneﬁ ts. The online job 
market is growing rapidly, with thousands of jobs matched 
with job seekers each day. The major beneﬁ ts of online 
job markets for employers are the ability to reach a large 
number of job seekers at a low cost, provide detailed 
information online, accept applications online, and even 
conduct skill tests. In addition, résumés can be checked 
and matched with positions more quickly by using intel-
ligent software agents. Many job offers are posted on the 
Internet, helping job seekers to obtain employment. Job 
seekers can also post their résumés for recruiters to dis-
cover. Recruiting via social networks, especially via 
LinkedIn and Facebook, is growing very rapidly. 
 5.  Managerial problem solving and knowledge manage-
ment. Knowledge has been recognized as an important 
organizational asset. However, it needs to be properly 
captured, stored, managed, and shared. Knowledge is 
critical for many e-commerce and social commerce tasks, 
and can be shared in different ways; expert knowledge 
can be provided to non-experts (paid or for free) via a 
knowledge portal or as a personal service (e.g., via 
e-mail). 
 6.  Online advisory systems. Online advisory systems of all 
kinds are becoming popular. Some are free, but most 
charge money. Users must be careful about the quality of 
the advice. Social networks and portals provide a variety 
of services. In addition, these systems are in active use 
with many organizations. 
  7.  Crowdsourcing and collective intelligence. Crowdsourcing 
is used mostly for idea generation, voting, and problem 
identiﬁ cation. Content creation and division of a big job 
to small segments (such as translating the Facebook web-
site to many different languages by volunteers) are also 
supported by crowdsourcing.  
 8.  Social collaboration. Many see social collaboration 
(Collaboration 2.0) as the major activity that social media 
supports. Activities supported range from joint design to 
problem solving.

cast.com/customers and discuss:
  (a)  What beneﬁ ts the companies that embraced 
Socialcast have realized. 
 (b)  Lessons learned from these cases. 
  6.  Review the features of Socialtext ( socialtext.com ). 
Discuss how you would make use of this platform in a 
small enterprise in (a) retail, (b) manufacturing, and (c) 
ﬁ nancial services. 
  7.  Would you use  monster.com or  linkedin.com for 
recruiting top managers, or would you rather use a phys-
ical ofﬁ ce in a traditional agency? Why? 
  8.  Relate IBM’s Social Innovation Projects to knowledge 
management (KM) and social networks. 
  9.  Discuss the role of crowdsourcing in idea generation 
and market research. 
 10.  How can crowdsourcing reduce risks to merchants? 
  11.  Discuss the business value of social networking. Begin 
by reading Tom Davenport’s post titled “Where’s the 
‘Working’ in Social Networking?” at  blogs.hbr.
org/2007/10/wheres-the-working-in-social-n . 
 12.  Read the Bernoff and Schadler ( 2010 ) article. Then, dis-
cuss the top strategies employed by Sony Corp. Idea 
generation by employees or customers using crowd-
sourcing is becoming popular. However, some say that 
crowdsourcing is only an electronic suggestion box. 
Others disagree. Discuss. 
 13.  Debate: Some research suggests that the use of public 
social networks by employees can be good for a busi-
ness, because employees develop relationships and 
share information among themselves and with outsiders, 
which increases productivity and innovation. Others say 
it is a waste of time and ban the use of Facebook, 
YouTube, and other such sites in the company during 
working hours.  
 14.  Debate the pros and cons of the following: In order to 
control content, Manchester United (UK) does not allow 
its players to generate any content on its private social 
network site, nor on public ones (e.g., Facebook). 
Manchester United has banned its players from using 
social networking websites. All players news are com-
municated via its ofﬁ cial website,  manutd.com . 
Manchester United players are not allowed to maintain 
personal proﬁ les on social networking websites. 
 15.  Compare and contrast “social collaboration” and 
“crowdsourcing.”

  TEAM ASSIGNMENTS AND PROJECTS 
 1.  Assignment for the Opening Case 
 Read the opening case and answer the following 
questions:
  (a)  Describe the internal and external factors that drive 
Shift. 
 (b)  Describe its major beneﬁ ts. 
  (c)  Relate the case to Collaboration 2.0 and to 
crowdsourcing. 
 (d)  Review Garcia et al. ( 2011 ) and watch the supporting 
videos. Prepare a summary. 
 2.  Have teams explore knowledge management videos and 
other resources at  portal.brint.com and  kmworld.com . 
In addition, search YouTube and Google for KM videos. 
Relate them to knowledge management and social media 
(combined). Prepare a report. 
 3.  Each team is assigned a question-and-answer company 
(e.g.,  answers.com ,  ask.com ). Check the company’s 
 features, including social networking/games. Give a 
presentation. 
 4.  The crowdsourcing model works with designers in this 
way: (1) A company outlines an area for which they need 
a design. (2) The company turns the design outline into a 
competition between amateur and professional designers. 
(3) The company decides on a winner, either by having 
the participants vote in the competition (the crowd), or by 
an executive decision. This is all at little to no cost for the 
person or company looking for the design. Now, think 
about the future of the graphic industry in general. What 
will be the fate of large design ﬁ rms that are competing 
for the business of high-proﬁ le clients when the clients 
are now paying tiny, one-time fees to amateur designers? 
Is using crowdsourcing in your business (or a business 
you are familiar with) a viable model?  
 5.  Yammer, Huddle, Chatter, and Jive Software are cloud- 
based social networking services. They are considered 
very useful, replacing traditional enterprise tools. 
Investigate the issue and write a report. Begin with 
Marsan ( 2011 ). 
 6.  Each team should initiate a new group on LinkedIn and 
start some discussions (e.g., try to ﬁ nd some business 
opportunities).

 OPENING CASE: JUSTIN BIEBER—THE 
ULTIMATE STORY OF SOCIAL MEDIA FAME 
 Justin Bieber, a talented singer and guitar player who was 
discovered on the Web, has used social media to become 
what some call the “King of Social Media.” 
 The Problem/Opportunity 
 Justin Bieber was born in Canada in 1994 and grew up in a 
very poor family. He was not a musical prodigy, but wanted 
to become a musician. From a young age, he started practic-
ing his craft, teaching himself to play piano, drums, guitar, 
and trumpet, and practicing for thousands of hours. This was 
no small feat. He sang on the streets with a guitar case in 
front of him, hoping to earn some money. He collected some, 
but not very much. As he got older, he participated in some 
small-scale talent competitions. He won some, but this did 
not provide much money either. 
 The Solution 
 In 2007, when Justin turned 13, his mother posted some of 
his videos on YouTube. In one video, Justin was singing “So 
Sick,” by R&B singer Ne-Yo. Scooter Braun, a music 

206
 producer, came across the video by chance. Recognizing 
Justin’s talent, he contacted Bieber and started working 
with him. However, Braun had difﬁ culty marketing the 
young singer, so he decided to use social media to help 
 promote him. 
 Bieber was willing to perform anywhere and sing about 
almost anything. Therefore, Braun and Justin were able to 
post a very large number of videos on YouTube during the 
same time period that the site itself was peaking in popular-
ity. This resulted in a ﬂ ood of comments on these videos. 
Shortly thereafter, his music garnered over 10 million views 
on YouTube. As a result, Braun introduced Justin to Usher, 
the legendary singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. Justin 
signed a contract with Usher and became his protégé. In 
2010, the video for his song “Baby,” from his debut full- 
length album  My World 2.0 , was viewed over 408 million 
times on YouTube, making it the most-watched video of all 
time (it was overtaken by Psy’s  Gangnam Style in 2012). 
(See  mtv.com/news/articles/1654090/justin-biebers-baby- 
bed-intruder-song-most-watched-2010-youtube-videos.
jhtml  and  thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/23/youtube-
s- 10-most-watched-videos-ever.html .) At that time, Braun 
and Bieber expanded their use of social media even further. 
 Using Social Media 
 With Braun’s help, Bieber used social media in several cre-
ative ways to promote himself. Like other celebrities, 
Bieber regularly kept in touch with his millions of followers 
on Twitter, sending them tweets about his plans, new 
albums, and so forth. For example, on his ﬁ rst visit to 
Australia, Justin granted an interview to a girl who tweeted 
that she wanted to meet him. This girl had 90,000 followers 
in her Justin Bieber fan club, and when she posted the video 
of the interview on the club’s Twitter page, it became a sen-
sation in Australia. In fact, the Australian fans preferred to 
watch the video rather than read the newspaper articles 
about the visit. In addition, Justin posted the video and the 
story on his Facebook page, generating a tremendous 
response there as well. 
 In February 2011, Justin’s ﬁ rst movie,  Never Say Never , 
was released. Braun and Justin used social media to promote 
the movie, prompting many fans to go to their local theaters 
to watch the concert ﬁ lm. The promotion included a Web 
video campaign through JibJab (a digital entertainment stu-
dio that distributes original content via many outlets, includ-
ing a YouTube channel). According to a JibJab press release, 
the JibJab Web campaign resulted in a record of 2.8 million 
views from an engaged audience, who subsequently created 
400,000 of their own videos within a week. (See  prnews-
wire.com/news-releases/jibjab-and-paramounts-insurge-
pictures- partner-on-record-breaking-justin-bieber- 
never-say-never-movie-campaign-117063098.html .) 
 Unfortunately, social media may sometimes cause dam-
age to someone’s reputation as well, and Bieber was no 
exception. For example, the social media rumor mill had 
been busy churning out several Bieber stories. One of them, 
a Web hoax about Justin contracting syphilis, spread via 
Facebook and became the #1 item on Google Trends in 2010 
(see 
 gawker.com/5563416/how-justin-bieber-caught-a- 
contagious-syphilis-rumor ). On July 11, 2011, a rumor 
spread that YouTube would delete Bieber’s hit song “Baby” 
because it had over 1.5 million “dislikes.” This false infor-
mation resulted in millions of tweets to YouTube (“#dont-
deletebaby”) posting things like “DON’T DELETE BABY! 
If they do, I’m never going on YouTube again,” and “WWIII 
will start,” and the like. 
 The Results 
 By early 2015, Bieber had over 72 million Facebook 
fans ( facebook.com/JustinBieber ), over 5.38 billion 
views on YouTube ( vidstatsx.com/youtube-top-100-most-
subscribed- channels  ), over 59.3 million Twitter followers 
( twitter.com/justinbieber ), and 108 million “plays” on 
Myspace. In 2013, he was ranked number two on the list of 
Forbes’ Best-Paid Celebrities under 30 ($58 million). In 
2011, he was considered more inﬂ uential in the social net-
working sphere than President Obama or the Dalai Lama, 
according to the social media organization Klout, Inc. ( klout.
com ), which calculates its inﬂ uential index from the number 
of tweets, pingshots (see Chap.   10 ), and hits in cyberspace 
(see  blog.klout.com/2011/01/is-justin-bieber-really-more- 
inﬂ uential-than-barack-obama ). A major part of Bieber’s 
appeal stems from his two YouTube channels ( youtube.com/
justinbieber and  youtube.com/user/kidrauhl ). For Justin’s 
awards, statistics, and information on his album sales, see the 
Wikipedia entries noted in the Sources section and  statistic-
brain.com/justin-bieber-statistics .

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 First, this case demonstrates that talented performers 
can be discovered on the Web, especially through vid-
eos posted on YouTube. Seconds, with the help of 
social media, it is possible for people to not only be 
discovered, but also to advance rapidly in their careers.

 As e-commerce matures and its tools and applications 
improve, greater attention is given to its use in improving the 
business of public institutions and governments (country, 
state, county, city, etc.).  E-government is the use of infor-
mation technology in general, and e-commerce in particular, 
to provide citizens and organizations with more convenient 
access to government information and services. It also is an 
efﬁ cient and effective way of conducting governments’ 
 business transactions with citizens and businesses, and trans-
acting effectively within governments themselves. See 
Mergel ( 2012 ),  w3.org/egov , and  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
E-Government for details. 
 Several major markets ﬁ t within this broad deﬁ nition of 
e-government:  government-to-citizens (G2C),  government-
to- business (G2B),  government-to-government (G2G), and 
 government-to-employees (G2E), as well as  internal efﬁ -
ciency and effectiveness (IEE). Recently, many governments 
have introduced social government.  
 E-Government 2.0 (Social Government) 
 Social government (also known as  government 2.0 ) is an 
emerging ﬁ eld where governments use social media to 
improve their services to citizens, organizations, and 
 employees, in addition to improving their internal  operations. 
A social government can be viewed as a subset of e-government. 
 For an 85-slide presentation titled “Local Government to 
Social Media,” see Dawson ( 2010 ).  Social government is a 
new model for delivering the functions of e-government. For 
a review of social media use in e-government, see Magro 
( 2012 ). 
 Social Government in Action 
 According to Baumgarten and Chui ( 2009 ), government 
agencies often fail to meet users’ needs, despite spending 
enormous amounts of time and money on Web-based initia-
tives. By employing Web 2.0 tools, using new business mod-
els, and embracing social networks and user participation, 
government agencies can raise the effectiveness of their 
online presence and activities. Governments in all levels, 
from national to local (Black  2013 ), are using social media 
and social commerce applications. For extensive coverage 
on this topic, see NIC Inc. ( 2010 ). Government agencies 
around the world are now experimenting with social media 
(e.g., India; see Banday and Matto  2013 ). Governments use 
social media mainly for collaboration, dissemination of 
information, e-learning, and citizen engagement. An exam-
ple is the initiative in New Zealand, where social networking 
tools are being used extensively by the government, both for 
internal and external use (see Case  9.1 ). 
 Case 9.1 
 SC Application 
 Social Networking Initiatives by the New Zealand 
Government 
 The New Zealand government is very active in implement-
ing new technologies. As of 2008, it has created a number of 
e-government social networking initiatives (e.g., see  ssc.
govt.nz/bps-initiatives-spotlight ). 
 Cross-Government Initiatives 
 Various government agencies and their employees can now 
work better together due to the implementation of numerous 
Web 2.0 initiatives.
•  Shared Workspaces. Specialist groups and networks 
share experience, expertise, and good practices by utiliz-
ing a suite of online tools that supports interagency col-
laboration and information sharing. Blogs and wikis are 
the major tools used.  
•  E-Initiatives Wiki. Individuals working on like projects 
share experience and information through an online 
library. 
•  Principals Electronic Network. This interactive online 
community allows school principals and leaders to col-
laborate through discussion and learn from each other’s 
expertise. 
Social media can direct massive trafﬁ c to websites 
where artists can promote their products and services, 
and where retailers and others can sell products and 
services. Third, this is a great example of how social 
media can facilitate personal relationships and interac-
tions. Fourth, we learned about the power of tweeting. 
Finally, we learn that even greater success can be 
achieved when several social media tools are used. 
 The utilization of social media has facilitated enter-
tainment and its commercial side. This is only one 
innovative topic covered in this chapter. The other top-
ics are social government, B2B marketing uses of 
social media, social-oriented virtual worlds, social 
games, social entertainment, and social P2P (peer-to- 
peer) activities. 
9.1 Social Media and Commerce in E-Government

•  Best Practices Forum. A blog with a goal to impart lead-
ership in order to obtain best practices in signiﬁ cant work 
programs. 
•  Research e-Labs. Technology, Web trends, and open 
source software in government are explored in a blog in 
order to distribute research and case studies. 
 Public Engagement 
 Agencies have developed most of the government’s social 
networking initiatives with the aim of engaging with the 
public. The following are key examples:
•  Policing Act Wiki. The New Zealand Police imple-
mented a variety of social media initiatives ranging from 
sharing information on their Twitter feed to collaborating 
on LinkedIn and Facebook. For example, in 2009, the 
Queenstown Police gained worldwide notoriety for using 
Facebook to help catch a burglar (see  policingwithintel-
ligence.blogspot.com/2009/07/new-zealand-police-use-
facebook- to-stop.html ). In June 2011, the New Zealand 
Police received Social Media NZ’s “Best Use” award. 
•  National Library of New Zealand. Several initiatives 
have been created by the National Library of New Zealand 
( natlib.govt.nz ), including a blog with categories such as 
“behind the scenes” and “collections.” School services 
staff in New Zealand provide information to students and 
libraries about resources and services to support literacy, 
and more ( natlib.govt.nz/schools ), along with informa-
tion for librarians on services and digital tools ( natlib.
govt.nz/librarians ). Staff also share their views about 
work progress on the National Library’s technology on 
the Library TechNZ blog ( natlib.govt.nz/blog/catego-
ries/library-tech ). 
•  Twitter. In February 2014, The National Library had over 
8,000 followers on Twitter ( twitter.com/NLNZ ). This 
enables the Library to engage patrons online, disseminat-
ing information about new collections and exhibits. The 
people who run NLNZ’s Twitter account also post on a 
Twitter account known as #tbreaktweets. These posts are 
usually humorous.  
•  New Zealand Draft Standards.  Standards New Zealand 
( standards.co.nz ) is New Zealand’s leading developer 
and publisher of standards and standards-based solutions. 
They provide standards solutions on diverse subject areas 
such as health and disability. 
•  Participation Project Wiki. Established by the State 
Services Commission, the wiki is a tool for collaborative 
policy making.  
•  ePetitions. A program created by the Wellington City 
Council allows anyone the ability to make suggestions 
(create a petition or sign an open petition) related to 
Council business, via the Internet ( wellington.govt.nz/
have-your-say/epetitions ). 
•  Archives New Zealand Audio Visual Wiki. The public 
can view ﬁ lms online, discuss them with other users, and 
add information about the content or context of the ﬁ lms 
through an Archives of New Zealand initiative ( audiovi-
sual.archives.govt.nz ). 
•  Careers New Zealand Outreach. Careers New Zealand 
( careers.govt.nz ) not only joins social networks where 
they are likely to be inﬂ uential (e.g., on Facebook), but 
also actively does social media outreach. 
•  Crowdsourcing Images. The New Zealand Historic 
Places Trust ( historic.org.nz ) is using Flickr to collect 
images from the public for its Register of New Zealand’s 
historic places (see  webtoolkit.govt.nz/blog/2013/12/
confessions-of-a-social-media-phobe ). 
•  Distributing Content on YouTube. The New Zealand 
Ministry for Culture and Heritage uses YouTube ( you-
tube.com/user/ManatuTaonga ) to preserve and promote 
the country’s culture and heritage. 
•  Promoting Sports on Facebook. The Triathlon New 
Zealand, the national governing body for triathlon, duath-
lon, and aquathlon, has seen enormous interest and contri-
butions via social media, and raising awareness of the 
sports. 
•  Requesting Data Sets Online. The New Zealand 
Department of Internal Affairs ( dia.gov.nz ) provides 
information online to the public about government ser-
vices, forms to download (birth certiﬁ cates, marriage cer-
tiﬁ cates), and publications and reports. 
 Other Agency-Related Social Media Initiatives 
 Agencies also use social networking tools to collaborate 
with nongovernment organizations. Some examples of social 
media initiatives involve the use of Wikipedia, Facebook, 
Seconds Life, and online discussion groups. 
 A New Approach to E-Government 
 The New Zealand government has implemented an initia-
tive called Rethink Online (for details, see  ict.govt.nz/
guidance- and-resources/government-online/rethink- 
online  ). This is a new way for the government to invest in 
and manage its online channels to attain a more agile strat-
egy, improve the value of ﬁ nancial investments, and achieve 
better customer experiences. The Rethink Online program 
consists of four principles, which include coordination, 
sharing, centrality for users, and collaboration. It also 
addresses current difﬁ culties in online information and ser-
vice delivery, and supports government in order to meet 
people’s expectancies as well as the government’s ever-
changing needs.

9 Innovative Social Commerce Applications: From Social Government to Entertainment and Gaming

209
 Questions 
 1.  Given the richness of New Zealand’s offerings, do you 
believe that the portal style of e-government will be 
replaced by a social networking style? 
 2.  What are the beneﬁ ts of the internal social networking 
initiatives? 
 3.  Comment on the initiative’s connections to YouTube, 
Flickr, and Facebook. 
 4.  Why do wikis and blogs play such an important role in 
many of these initiatives? 
 5.  Which initiatives are related to e-learning? To 
e- commerce? In what ways? 
 6.  Enter  ict.govt.nz and identify new initiatives in SC as of 
January 2015. 
 Following are three other examples of effective social 
government. 
 Example 1: Open Government Places (OGP) 
 This project connects civil servants and government ofﬁ ces, 
enabling collaboration throughout communities in the 
Netherlands. It cuts the red tape and includes a multitude of 
social media- supported activities. The project won the 2011 
Management Innovation eXchange Award. For details, see 
Spinder ( 2011 ). 
 Example 2: U.S. Cost Guard 
 Ali ( 2010 ) provides an example of how the U.S. Coast Guard 
uses YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr to disseminate information 
and discuss their rescue operations. (See also the Coast Guard 
Social Media’s ofﬁ cial blog at  coastguard.dodlive.
mil/2009/07/ofﬁ cial-coast-guard- social-media .) Notable is 
FEMA’s Twitter feed (previously ‘FEMA in Focus’), a chan-
nel that provides dissemination of FEMA-related information 
(see  twitter.com/fema ). Law enforcement agencies use social 
media (like Facebook and Twitter) to hunt for criminals. (For 
some examples, see  digitaltrends.com/social-media/the-
new-inside-source-for-police-forces-social-networks .)  
 Example 3: The FBI 
 The FBI developed an early-warning system about potential 
domestic and global threats from material it collected from 
social networks. It is a kind of market research application 
(Chap.   10 ). For details, see BBC News ( 2012 ). 
 The Beneﬁ ts of Government 2.0 
 According to a December 2009 Australian government 2.0 
task force report ( ﬁ nance.gov.au/publications/gov20task-
forcereport/doc/Government20TaskforceReport.pdf ), 
embracing government 2.0 can provide the government with 
the following beneﬁ ts: 
 Some people believe that social networking will replace 
the current e-government “one-stop” passive portal (e.g., see 
Vaz  2014 ). Government initiatives are very diversiﬁ ed with 
the Web 2.0 approach. For example, many governments have 
owned islands on Seconds Life (e.g. eGov Island, Coalition 
Island) on which they present diplomatic issues and promote 
tourist attractions and investment opportunities. With such 
initiatives, it is important to have strict security, accountabil-
ity, and compliance functionality in place, which has proven 
challenging 
when 
implementing 
wikis 
and 
blogs. 
Government experts encourage employees to experiment 
with social networking, but suggest that such pilots have to 
remain very well-focused and somewhat isolated from main-
stream processes for at least the ﬁ rst 2 years. For more about 
what the U.S. government is doing in Seconds Life, see 
 www. 
rikomatic.com/betterverse/2009/09/federal-govern-
ment--in-seconds-life.html . 
•  Improve the quality and responsiveness of services 
in areas like education, health, public safety, and 
environmental management, and at the same time 
deliver these services with greater agility and 
efﬁ ciency. 
•  Cultivate and harness the enthusiasm of citizens, 
letting them contribute more fully to their well- 
being and that of their community. 
•  Make democracy more participatory and citizens 
more informed. 
•  Unlock the immense economic and social value of 
information and other content held by governments 
to serve as a platform for innovation.  
•  Revitalize the public sector and make government 
policies and services more responsive to people’s 
needs and concerns by:
  (a)  Providing governments with social media 
tools for a much greater level of community 
engagement 
 (b)  Allowing the users of government services 
much greater participation in their design and 
continual improvement of these services  
  (c)  Involving communities of interest and practice 
outside the public sector, which offer unique 
access to expertise local knowledge, and per-
spectives, in policy making and delivery  
 (d)  More successfully attracting and retaining 
bright, enthusiastic citizens to the public ser-
vice workforce by making their work less 
 hierarchical, more collaborative, and more 
intrinsically rewarding. 
9.1 Social Media and Commerce in E-Government

210
 Applications and Resources 
 Politicians use social networking extensively. For example, 
during the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Democratic can-
didate Barack Obama created pages on Facebook and 
LinkedIn, where he made thousands of connections and 
received hundreds of thousands of responses to his question, 
“What ideas do you have to keep America competitive in the 
years ahead?” Many of the responses were very interesting 
and insightful. President Obama also created an “Obama for 
America” interest group on LinkedIn. 
 In addition to the New Zealand Case  9.1 , you may look at 
what is going on in Australia regarding social commerce (see 
Australian Government  2012 ). 
 For an extensive list of resources on social networks in 
governments, including reports, applications, and policies, 
see the 2009 Slideshare presentation ‘Getting Started in the 
Social Web: Government 2.0’ at  slideshare.net/tamera/
getting-started-in-the-social-web-government-20 . 
For 
other presentations, search  slideshare.net for ‘social web 
government 2.0.’ E-government software and solutions are 
provided by most large software vendors (e.g., Adobe, Cisco 
systems, IBM/Cognos’s solutions for government, and 
Microsoft). For extensive coverage of e-government, see 
 wisegeek.com/what-is-e-government.htm . 
9.2 
 B2B SOCIAL NETWORKING 
 Although a large number of companies conduct social net-
working that targets individual consumers (B2C), there is 
also considerable activity in the B2B arena (see Mac  2014 ). 
The social B2B potential is huge, and new applications are 
added daily. See Bodnar and Cohen ( 2012 ) and the info-
graphic showing the 2014 B2B social media landscape at 
 b2bmarketing.net/knowledgebank/social-media- 
marketing/features/infographic-2014-b2b-social-media-
landscape . 
 E-Communities in B2B 
 B2B applications may involve many participants in the sup-
ply chain and in nonproﬁ t organizations, business buyers and 
B2B sellers, service providers, industry associations, and 
others. In many cases, the B2B market maker can provide 
typical social network services, such as chat rooms, bulletin 
boards, and, possibly, personalized Web pages to the com-
munity members. 
 E-communities connect employees, suppliers, distribu-
tion channel members, customers, and other business part-
ners and any combination of these. In addition, e-communities 
offer a powerful resource for e-businesses to leverage online 
discussions and interactions in order to optimize innovation 
and responsiveness. It is therefore beneﬁ cial to study the 
tools, methods, and best practices of building and managing 
B2B e-communities. 
 B2B e-communities are mostly communities of transac-
tions; as such, members’ major interests are trading and busi-
ness-related information gathering. Many of the communities 
promote partner relationships.  
 The Major Opportunities and Beneﬁ ts of Social 
Commerce in B2B 
 Companies that use B2B social networking may have the 
following opportunities: 
 MarketingCharts Staff ( 2014 ) summarizes B2B Marketing’s 
2014 Social Media Benchmarketing Report, which found that 
B2B marketers are focusing their social media efforts on gen-
erating sales leads and on pushing sales with branding and 
positioning as the major objectives. (See  b2bmarketing.net/
knowledgebank/social-media- marketing/features/
•  Discover new business partners and build relation-
ships with them (Gillin and Schwartzman  2011 ). 
•  Enhance the ability of participants to learn about 
new technologies, competitors, and the business 
environment. 
•  Find more sales leads (see Sysomos Inc.  2011 and 
Gillin and Schwartzman  2011 ). 
•  Post questions and facilitate discussions on 
LinkedIn by searching the Help Center, asking the 
community a question through the Help Forum, or 
by using the posting module on your homepage to 
ask your network a question. Post questions on 
other social networks and receive helpful answers. 
•  Use Instagram to tell the companies’ stories (Cohen 
 2014 a). 
•  Improve participation in industry association activi-
ties (including lobbying).  
•  Create brand awareness. 
•  Create buzz about upcoming product releases 
(Gillin and Schwartzman  2011 ). 
•  Advertise new and existing products and services. 
•  Drive trafﬁ c to vendors’ pages in social networks. 
Word-of-mouth communication also may increase 
trafﬁ c. 
•  Create social communities to encourage discus-
sions among business partners (e.g., buyers and 
suppliers).

Landscape infographic.) 
 For SC opportunities available on LinkedIn, see Schaffer 
( 2011 ); on Twitter, see Maddox ( 2010 ); on Instagram, see 
Cohen ( 2014 a); and in general, see Jensen ( 2012 ). 
 Most uses of B2B social networking are seen in  enterprise 
social networking , which involves private social networks 
within the enterprise. We discussed this topic in Chap.   8  . 
 Exploiting these opportunities may result in the following 
beneﬁ ts (reported by Wiebesick  2011b ): 
 These data are probably higher with the passage of time. 
 Marketo (undated) lists the following beneﬁ ts of B2B 
social media marketing:
•  Increases brand awareness 
•  Builds reputation as a thought leader 
•  Encourages promoters 
•  Can improve SEO ranking 
 For an infographic showing how B2B companies are 
using social media, see Melin ( 2013 ). 
 Speciﬁ c Social Networking Activities in B2B 
 Businesses can use B2B social networking to improve 
knowledge sharing, collaboration, and collect feedback. 
Furthermore, social networking sites also may prove beneﬁ -
cial in aiding decision making and problem-solving efforts 
(e.g., via crowdsourcing). 
 By the end of 2012, social networking was playing a 
much more important role in B2B. According to a 2010 
study by Regus (reported by Leggatt  2010 ), both small and 
large businesses are using social networks quite successfully 
to ﬁ nd and retain new business. A few highlights of the study 
include:
•  50–75 % of companies globally use social networks for 
various networking functions.  
•  40 % of businesses worldwide have found new customers 
via social networks. 
•  27 % of companies include social networking activities to 
both acquire and retain customers in their marketing 
budget. 
 The main uses of social networks are keeping in touch 
with business contacts; meeting with special interest groups; 
learning useful business intelligence; and organizing, man-
aging, and connecting with customer groups. 
 Some interesting statistical data are available in a report 
titled  Social Strategy for B2B Marketing 2011 from 
  GlobalWebIndex  
(see 
 slideshare.net/globalwebindex/
globalwebindex- b2b-social-media-strategy-2011 ). 
For 
details, see Cohen ( 2011 ). 
 According to a survey reported by Pardot ( 2011 ), social 
media use among B2B marketers is already very high. 
However, 30 % are not calculating the return on investment 
for social media. The survey also ranked Twitter as the most 
popular social media channel. Other surveys rank LinkedIn 
as the most popular, followed by Facebook, with Twitter in 
third place. 
 According to   BIA/Kelsey’s  U.S. Local Media Annual 
Forecast (reported by  MarketingProfs 2011 ), B2B advertis-
ing on social networking sites will grow from $2.1 billion in 
2010 to $8.3 billion by 2015. Other reports attempt to answer 
the following questions:
•  How much will marketers spend on social network adver-
tising aimed at a business audience? 
•  What types of B2B advertising can businesses do on 
social network sites? 
•  Why are companies creating social networks in order to 
market to business customers, vendors, distributors, and 
channel partners? 
•  What are the challenges of developing such networks? 
 Generating sales leads is one of the major activities of 
B2B marketing, which can be facilitated by social media. 
 Usefulness of Social Networking Activities in B2B 
 According to MarketingCharts Staff ( 2014 ), marketing vid-
eos on social networks are most effective, followed by 
images and photos. Social conversations and other engage-
ments are somewhat less effective. 
 Generating Sales Leads in B2B Social Commerce 
 Generating sales leads can be a time-consuming and complex 
challenge; however, it was ranked as the prime area of social 
B2B activities (MarketingCharts Staff  2014 ). Using social 
media, companies can use the following lead generation 
strategies (per Sysomos Inc.  2011 ). (See also Matlick  2013 .)
•  Find and create lead-generation opportunities in the 
blogosphere. 
•  Target competitors’ customers for highly motivated sales 
leads. 
•  B2B companies that blog garnered 67 % more leads 
per month than those who do not.  
•   69 % of B2B marketers are shifting their budgets 
toward social media. 
•  41 % of B2B companies acquire customers through 
Facebook. 
•  82 % of B2C companies use social media, while 
86 % of B2B companies use social media.  
•  B2B marketers improve search results aided by 
social media. 
9.2 B2B Social Networking

•  Run special offers and promotions that deliver higher 
conversion rates. 
 For an infographic, see McTigue ( 2014 ). For a discussion 
about how sales teams generate leads using social media, see 
Cohen ( 2014 b). 
 Using the Major Social Networks in B2B 
 Hallam ( 2014 ) provides the following percentages of B2B 
marketers who use the major social media sites to distribute 
content: LinkedIn 91 %, Twitter 85 %, Facebook 81 %,YouTube 
73 %, Google+ 55 %, Slideshare 40 %, Pinterest 34 %, 
Instagram 22 %. 
 The following are few examples of some of these uses. 
 The Major Social B2B Tools and Platforms 
 Among the social media tools, Twitter is becoming an impor-
tant B2B sales platform (e.g., see Viskovich  2013 ). Thomson 
( 2013 ) discusses the various social channels which are good 
for B2B. According to a 2013 survey of B2B buyers in Europe 
(reported by Rayson  2013 ), Google+ is the most inﬂ uential 
social media networking followed by Facebook and LinkedIn, 
while Twitter and Pinterest ranked lower. The survey also 
found that industry forums are the most frequently used social 
channels. (Friends and networks are the most inﬂ uential 
sources of information in B2B buying decisions.) Thus, 
building your social networks and relationships must be an 
essential part of your strategy. A special marketplace for B2B 
social networking is Tradescraper ( tradescraper.com ). 
 Example 
 Julig ( 2013 ) describes how salespeople in one company use 
Pinterest to reach a B2B market. The company grew their 
followers on Pinterest to over 18,000 small businesses in less 
than 2 years. Their goal is to expand the idea of the brand and 
think visually. In October 2013, the company had 92 Pinterest 
boards with over 4,000 pins. 
 Using LinkedIn in B2B 
 Some experts believe that the most popular social media 
marketing channel for B2B marketers is LinkedIn. The IAB 
has published the B2B Content Marketing Benchmarks, 
Budgets, and Trends (North America) data for 2014, (see 
 iab.net/media/ﬁ le/B2BResearch2014.pdf ). For example, 
they found that 91 % of B2B marketers use LinkedIn in some 
way to distribute their content. 
 Interesting examples of B2B case studies on social media 
best practices using LinkedIn’s marketing solutions are 
available at  business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/
social-media-case-studies.html . The Vestas Inc. case study 
provided there (at  snap.licdn.com/microsites/content/dam/
business/marketing-solutions/global/en_US/site/pdf/cs/
linkedin_vestas_case_study_us_en_130314.pdf ) is a com-
prehensive example (see Internet Exercise #12). 
 Using Facebook in B2B 
 There are many possibilities of using Facebook in B2B. Here 
are a few examples:
•  Pickering ( 2012 ) suggests using Facebook to (a) build a 
fan base; (b) share engaging content; (c) capture leads and 
contact information; (d) make it personal and fun; and (e) 
reach friends of fans. The author provides several exam-
ples of how this is done.  
•  Johnson ( 2013 ) suggests the following: (a) generate con-
tent to capture leads; (b) content strategy is the key; (c) 
concentrate on non-lead generation goals as well; (d) use 
visuals; and (e) advertise. Johnson ( 2013 ) also provides a 
presentation and free assessment. 
•  Harper ( 2014 ) suggests the following to make Facebook 
marketing works for B2B: (a) have an understanding of 
your audience; (b) create and curate thoughtful content; 
(c) publish updates on your audience’s schedule; and (d) 
target your advertising.  
 These guides can greatly improve the effectiveness of 
using Facebook for B2B. 
 Using Twitter in B2B 
 Twitter is used extensively in B2C mainly as a communication 
tool for customer service advertising campaigns, customer 
engagement platforms, CRM, and market research. Similar 
uses are evidenced in B2B. More examples are  provided in 
 blog.twilert.com/2014/03/use-twitter-b2b- marketing  . The 
applications include monitoring conversations for identifying 
business opportunities, enabling small businesses to engage 
with potential customers, making contacts with potential cus-
tomers, and buyers discovering potential suppliers. 
 Corporate Proﬁ les on Social Networks 
 LinkedIn and Facebook include substantial information on 
companies and their individual employees. In fact, employee 
proﬁ les can be part of a company’s brand. For example, in 
early 2012, IBM had approximately 280,000 employees reg-
istered on LinkedIn and Microsoft had around 134,000 as of 
early 2014. In addition, some sites feature company only 
proﬁ les, with comments by employees and customers. 
 Final note: There are less B2B social media applica-
tions than B2C ones. However, this situation is changing. 
For details, see Salesforce Marketing Cloud ( 2012 ), and 
Mac ( 2014 ).

 B2B Success Stories 
 BtoB ’s Interactive Marketing Guide (available at  btobon-
line.com ; now a part of AdAge) provides the following 
examples of successful applications:
•  Arketi Group ( arketi.com ) . Arketi Group created and 
sponsored a B2B marketing community on LinkedIn, and 
is known for its 500 ongoing daily discussions.  
•  Cisco Systems ( cisco.com ) . Cisco uses Facebook to 
aggregate Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, blogs, and RSS feeds 
from one interface. With about 40,000 fans, daily post-
ings include a video blog (vlog) from the CEO and social 
events (e.g., Halloween photos). 
•  Hewlett-Packard Co. (hp.com).  HP uses  animatics 
posted on YouTube to promote renewals of their Care 
Pack Service agreements (see  youtube.com/watch?v=
FIY9VxpIuUM ). 
•  Reed Business Information ( reedbusiness.com ) . Reed 
Business Information uses LinkedIn-generated content in 
a community of “Automation and Control Engineering.” 
The community has about 5,000 members that provide 
expertise to one another, in over 100 discussion groups.  
•  Deloitte ( deloitte.com ) . Deloitte leverages Facebook as a 
brand-building tool to build its technology innovation 
strategy. 
 Another example is that of Pﬁ zer Pharmaceutical Co. 
Pﬁ zer ( pﬁ zer.com ) developed a social commerce strategy 
initially internally, among its various units. These efforts 
were extended to the supply chain (see Dunay  2013 ). In 
Pﬁ zer’s community, over 25,000 fans are engaged in discus-
sions of how to better serve customers’ needs. Pﬁ zer launched 
an internal intranet platform in 2010, which drew 41,000 
unique users who generated 800,000 page views. In 2011, it 
rose to approximately 60,000 users driving 1.6 million page 
views. As part of the intranet, Pﬁ zer started a social network-
ing hub, called  My World, which they developed in partner-
ship with their Business Technology colleagues.  MyWorld is 
part of their  Pﬁ zerWorld intranet platform, which is used to 
engage their colleagues. See  socialmediacases.blogspot.

 The following are other examples of signiﬁ cant B2B 
social commerce activities: 
 Example 1: American Express-Sponsored Business 
Travel Social Network 
 American Express launched an online social network, 
Business Travel ConneXion (or BTX),  businesstravelcon-
nexion.com , for the corporate travel industry. 
 Example 2 
 Orabrush, Inc. ( orabrush.com ) is a start-up company that 
makes tongue cleaners that reduce bad breath. The company 
created funny YouTube videos targeting Walmart employ-
ees. In a short time, the company had over 160,000 sub-
scribers on YouTube, and more than 39 million views. In 
addition, the company advertised on Facebook at a cost of 
only $28, resulting in 300,000 fans. This publicity con-
vinced some Walmart buyers to try the product, and 
Orabrush landed a huge contract with Walmart. For details, 
see Neff ( 2011 ).

 B2B Virtual Trade Shows and Trade Fairs 
in Virtual Worlds 
 Trade fairs and trade shows are popular B2B (and sometimes 
B2C) marketing communication practices. Today, they are 
becoming popular online. 
9.2 B2B Social Networking

214
 How Virtual Trade Shows Are Arranged 
 The structure of a typical trade show (also known as a  trade 
fair ) often includes a virtual exhibition hall that visitors enter 
ﬁ rst. Exhibitors can build virtual booths where they present 
exhibits of their products or services and any related infor-
mation. Both exhibitors and visitors can create avatars of 
themselves. 
 Like their physical counterparts, virtual trade shows can 
be built for a whole industry, a specialized group within an 
industry, a group of related companies, a government, or an 
association. For a comprehensive video on the virtual trade 
show, see  youtube.com/watch?v=kAFpH5vEhCc . 
 Beneﬁ ts of Virtual Trade Shows 
 The major beneﬁ ts of virtual trade shows are: 
 Some trade shows are permanent (always open), whereas 
others take place once a year. For a discussion and list, see 
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_tradeshow . One example is 
Tradefair Plus+ ( plus.tradefair.com ). For a schematic view 
of virtual booths and exhibition halls, search Google images 
for ‘virtual trade shows.’ For a live demo, see 
 3d- virtualevents.com . 
 For a detailed description of virtual trade shows, see 
Lindner ( 2009 ), and the ‘Trade Show Guide’ at  trade-show- 
guide.com/articles/virtualtradeshows.html . 
 Example: MarketPlace365 
 MarketPlace365 ( marketplace365.com/marketing ) is a 
virtual tradeshow platform that gives companies tools to 
build virtual trade shows and attract trafﬁ c to the shows. For 
details, see  marketplace365.com/Marketing and  market-
place365.com/Marketing/features.aspx . 
 Note: Social media can be used to support exhibits even in 
physical trade shows. For more on using social media at 
trade shows, see Patterson ( 2012 ) and download his free 
‘Social Media Tradeshow Marketing Checklist’ at  trade-
showguyblog.com/downloads/Social-Media-Tradeshow- 
Marketing-Checklist.pdf . 
 The Process Used in Virtual Trade Shows 
 The trade fair participant goes to a speciﬁ c virtual trade show 
homepage, typically registering at the site. The participant 
then visits the virtual exhibit ﬂ oor. On the virtual exhibit 
ﬂ oor, the participant can select a virtual booth, gather infor-
mation, and engage in “live” interaction (e.g., live chat) and 
information dissemination. Technologies enable communica-
tion through features such as online chat, Web callback, fax, 
and e-mail. Participants have access to community-building 
features, such as online discussion boards and online forums 
that allow collaborations, discussions, and debates. 
Furthermore, the exhibitors can conduct online surveys. In 
addition, special speakers or guests can communicate through 
video-streamed keynote Webcasts. Attendees can also inter-
act with each other through a chat room. Although this 
enables the event attendees to exchange information in a 
same-time, different-place mode, it is not as media rich as is 
the avatar visibility experience available on Seconds Life. 
 Virtual trade shows can have all the features that you ﬁ nd 
in a physical trade show, and even more. For example, one of 
the main reasons for exhibitors to participate in trade fairs is 
to acquire new leads and contacts. In a virtual trade show, 
exhibitors can receive attendee leads in real time. A typical 
attendee report, containing the name of every registered 
attendee, is made available to all exhibitors. Exhibitors can 
also access trafﬁ c reports of all visitors to each virtual booth. 
Attendees visiting a booth can drop off an e-business card. 
The trafﬁ c report includes all attendees’ names, titles, and rel-
evant contact information, and whether the attendee has 
requested additional information on any products and ser-
vices, the company in general, or employment opportunities. 
 Strategy for B2B Social Networking 
 Gillin ( 2010 ) made several suggestions on how to maximize 
the value of multiple social marketing channels. Power 
( 2014 ) provides examples and sources for social media strat-
egy for B2B. 
•  The cost of a virtual trade show to the organizers is 
a fraction of the cost of a real-world trade show. 
Thus, the participation fees can be much lower, 
attracting many more exhibitors and attendees.  
•  Many more attendees can afford to visit due to sav-
ing money on travel expenses, accommodations, 
and registration fees. Additionally, there is no phys-
ical space constraint. 
•  It is possible to have the show as a stand-alone and/
or as an extension to a physical trade show. 
•  More events, entertainment, and interactions can 
occur in virtual trade shows. Although you cannot 
get a free cup of coffee, you can, however, get cou-
pons for free coffee and gifts from exhibitors.  
•  There is no need for organizers to print promotional 
material. 
•  There is no carbon footprint to pollute the 
environment. 
•  Booths can have superb designs (compared to phys-
ical ones), including choice of colors, videos, and 
so on.

 Eventually, companies will be able to use social network-
ing more efﬁ ciently. Success stories of ﬁ ve companies—
SAP, United Linen (a small laundry service), Forrester 
Research, Kinaxis, and Expert Laser Services—are dis-
cussed by Jensen ( 2012 ). 
 The Future of B2B Social Networking 
 Marketing users are developing social media and search 
tools. Businesses must embrace social networking in order to 
better understand their customers and business partners. 
 (Note:  B2B marketing refers to marketing by manufactur-
ers and wholesalers along the sell-side of the supply chain).

 SOCIAL COMMERCE: APPLICATIONS 
IN VIRTUAL WORLDS 
 Virtual worlds (see Chap.   2 ) can be effective platforms for 
online social interactions, community building, conducting 
business transactions, and facilitating learning and training 
(e.g., education). As brieﬂ y described in Chap.   2 , users can 
navigate and move around in a virtual world using their ava-
tars, which they can also use for communication and other 
activities. Virtual worlds also may enable trading in virtual 
goods, and paying for them with virtual money. For the uses 
of virtual worlds, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world 
and 
 makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-virtual-worlds-what- 
are-their-uses-makeuseof-explains . For a list of the major 
virtual worlds, see  arianeb.com/more3Dworlds.htm . For 
using virtual worlds in education, see Angel Learning’s 2008 
White Paper titled ‘The Power of Virtual Worlds in Education: 
A Seconds Life Primer and Resource for Exploring the 
Potential of Virtual Worlds to Impact Teaching and Learning,’ 
see  soma.sbcc.edu/Users/Russotti/SL/PowerofVirtual%20
WorldsEdu_0708.pdf . 
 Businesses can make use of virtual worlds, not just for enter-
taining their customers and prospects, but also by engaging 
them in an experience that may be unavailable in the real world. 
Due to the use of multiple senses in a virtual world, users’ expe-
riences can be more fulﬁ lling than in a 2D world, or sometimes 
even more than in a physical one. For instance, according to a 
posting on Seconds Life (February 2011), Seconds Life had 
over 22 million registered user accounts (unique residents) who 
spent more than 115 million hours a month on the site. As of 
June 2013, the number of registered users has risen to over 36 
million; the equivalent of total time users have spent in Seconds 
Life is 217,266 days. (See the article and infographic by 
Reahard  2013 ). Businesses can leverage features and spaces, as 
illustrated next, to exploit the opportunities in virtual worlds. 
For the business beneﬁ ts of Seconds Life, see Butler-Borrer 
( 2010 ). Companies make money in virtual worlds by inﬂ uenc-
ing people to buy virtual items, such as clothes, frequently 
while playing games. People are spending more and more 
time in online games. For example, in 2012, online game 
maker Team Fortress 2 made a half a million dollars from 
users who were creating content (making hats), which caused 
their PayPal account to break. Team Fortress 2 was compet-
ing against their own userbase. (See  makeuseof.com/tag/
virtual-world-millionaires-getting-rich-digital-market-
place .) 
 The Features and Spaces of Virtual Worlds 
 Virtual worlds have a set of properties or features that pro-
vide the capabilities where business can be conducted. 
 The Features That Businesses Can Leverage 
 IBM, Walmart, Toyota, Sears, Wells Fargo, and many 
other large companies have experimented with virtual worlds 
for testing new designs, customer service, employee train-
ing, and marketing communication.  
 The Landscape of Virtual World Commercial 
Applications 
 The potential of virtual worlds is large, particularly when 
they are integrated with other IT and business systems. A 
virtual world is particularly attractive to video game players, 
•  Shared space. The virtual world provides many 
users with the ability to participate simultaneously 
in activities, engage in discussions, and participate 
in collaborative activities. 
•  3-D visualization (graphical user interface). The 
virtual world depicts both 2-D and 3-D images.  
•  Immediacy. Interactions usually occur in real time, 
and users experience the results of their actions 
immediately. 
•  Interactivity. Participants can create or modify 
customized content. They may do so in collabora-
tion with others.  
•  Persistence. Activities in virtual worlds are hap-
pening whether members are present or not.  
•  Socialization and community formation. A vir-
tual world provides opportunities for socializing 
with other users and facilitates group formation of 
different types (e.g., work teams). 
9.3 Social Commerce: Applications in Virtual Worlds

216
where sellers can build communities of fans and advertise. 
Other businesses are using virtual worlds for collaboration, 
design testing, learning, and relationship building. 
 Virtual worlds can be viewed as a set of the following 
multidimensional spaces. 
 The Spaces in Virtual Worlds 
 The following are brief descriptions of the major spaces used 
in virtual worlds: 
 One can arrange for the use of one or more of these eight 
spaces in innovative ways for business, education, medical, 
political, and other uses. Business applications of virtual 
worlds are varied and their use depends on the type of busi-
ness in which a company is engaged, in the organizational 
objectives, and the target user proﬁ les. 
 The Major Drivers of Social Commerce 
in Virtual Worlds 
 The key factors that drive business applications in virtual 
worlds are: 
 The Major Categories of Virtual World 
Applications 
 It is common to classify major applications into 18 catego-
ries (adapted from Ciaramitaro  2010 ; Murugesan  2008 ; 
Reeves and Read  2009 , and  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Virtual_world ). 
 Business Applications in Virtual Worlds 
 The following are examples of business applications used in 
virtual worlds. 
•  Resemblance to the real-world environment. 
Businesses can use the technology since it can sim-
ulate, and even conduct real world activities (e.g., 
customer service) more promptly and a low cost 
(e.g., product design). Additionally, interactions 
with business partners are easy. It is also a place for 
attractive advertisements. Users can get a feel of the 
real world without cost and time constraints (e.g., 
buy properties, travel). 
•  Shopping for virtual goods. Buying and selling 
virtual real estate is the major shopping activity in 
virtual worlds. Users can buy land, develop it, build 
on it and sell it. Millions of people who cannot 
afford their dream house (e.g., in developing coun-
tries) are satisﬁ ed with buying virtual houses. You 
can also shop for fascinating virtual goods for your 
avatar or your virtual home on Seconds Life at  sec-
ondslife.com/shop . 
•  Attractions for the younger generations. Today’s 
youth are tomorrow’s shoppers. They grew up with 
computer applications and love games and online 
entertainment. 
•  New means of navigation and discovery. Virtual 
worlds enable the creation of visually attractive and 
unique products that visitors never knew existed.  
•  The attributes and capabilities. These are unique 
to 
virtual 
worlds. 
First, 
they 
are 
mostly 
3-D. Seconds, the worlds are populated with ava-
tars. The virtual worlds are interactive and can be 
manipulated and changed by users at very low cost. 
•  Better online meeting spaces and collaborative 
platforms. Virtual worlds provide interesting plat-
forms for collaboration, meetings, discussions, and 
chatting (e.g., t ry to chat in 3D at  imvu.com ). 
•  Interactive environment for education and 
 training. Several activities, as shown in Table  9.1 , 
can be used to facilitate training and learning.   
 1.  Social space.  Place where users’ avatars (and their 
owners) can meet, discuss, share information and 
opinions, and socialize.  
 2.  Entertainment space. Place where avatars (and 
their owners) can play games, watch movies, and 
attend concerts in a 3-D environment.  
 3.  Transaction space. Marketplace where one can 
conduct business and ﬁ nancial transactions, sell 
and buy available virtual goods as well as some real 
goods at a virtual webstore. 
 4.  Experimental/demonstration space. Place in the 
virtual world where real-world environments, prod-
ucts, and services can be simulated for experimen-
tation, demonstration, training, and testing.  
 5.  Collaboration space. Place for collaboration, inno-
vation, and new product design and development.  
 6.  Smart agent space. Place where software agents 
can seek information and engage with other agents 
to fulﬁ ll or facilitate transactions for their owners. 
 7.  Fantasy space. A dream world where people can 
do things that are not feasible or not affordable in 
the real world (e.g., take a trip to the moon or enjoy 
an expensive cruise). 
 8.  Educational Space.  Certain places in the virtual 
world are dedicated to educational activities such as 
teaching classes, evaluating projects, or learning by 
doing special projects. 
9 Innovative Social Commerce Applications: From Social Government to Entertainment and Gaming

217
 Table 9.1   The use of virtual worlds to facilitate learning 
 Description 
 Simulation 
 Users can manipulate simulated scenarios and 
see results. Creating a virtual business is a 
popular activity 
 Distance learning 
 A virtual world can be used as a place for 
working, learning, and/or collaborative learning 
and collaborative problem solving 
 Class meetings 
 Learning institutions offer a large number of 
virtual classes (many in Seconds Life). 
Students can interact and explore, as well as 
share and work with teachers, via avatars 
 Exploration 
 The virtual world is a good platform for 
explorative learning. Learners can explore in a 
way similar to the way they can in the real 
world. The information is communicated to the 
user/avatar visually, by text, or via other media 
 Visualization 
 Visualization is a key learning enabler. The 
virtual world can be used to visualize a process. 
It can be used as a set of data helping with 
problem analysis and ﬁ nding solutions 
 Imaginative 
scenarios 
 People can create fantasy objects and scenarios 
for entertainment 
 Information 
dissemination 
 Many organizations, governments, and 
universities provide updated interactive 
information, which can be used to learn 
geography, public administration, hospitality 
management, technology, and more 
 Sources: Based on Murugesan ( 2008 ), Terdiman ( 2008 ), and  second-
slife.com (accessed January 2015) 
  1.  Webstores and online sales. Companies have set 
up webstores in virtual worlds to enable customers 
to have a more immersive experience by trying 
out virtual products, including clothes, cars, or 
jewelry before they buy them. This is done in a 
3-D virtual salesroom. Potential buyers can also 
conduct research, dress avatars, and sometimes 
complete a purchase through links that lead them 
to a secure trading place. For details, see Seconds 
Life’s ‘Shop: Learn’ page at  secondslife.com/
shop/learn . 
  2.  Front ofﬁ ces or help desks. Virtual worlds can 
act as access points for customer service. The care 
center is staffed by avatars. This service is avail-
able around the clock. 
  3.  Advertising and product demonstrations. 
Marketers and advertisers can place 3D display 
ads and banners promoting products or services at 
various locations in virtual worlds to catch the 
attention of visitors. Consumers also can view 
demonstrations by avatars on how to install or 
assemble products such as washing machines or 
furniture. 
 There are several advantages for using virtual 
worlds. Virtual stores allow businesses to reach a 
variety of demographically diverse customers. 
 Furthermore, some real world constraints may 
be reduced or eliminated in virtual worlds. In addi-
tion, the cost of experimenting with virtual things 
is minimal and there is no cost when making errors. 
 Restrictions and costs that are found in real 
world situations are further reduced. 
 For details, see  wiki.secondslife.com/wiki/
Advertising_in_Seconds_Life . 
  4.  Content creation and distribution. Virtual 
worlds can serve as channels for delivering music, 
games, art, and other forms of interactive content 
for engaging participants. 
  5.  Meetings, seminars, and conferences. Virtual 
worlds are being used as venues for individuals to 
virtually meet, participate, and interact through 
their avatars. Such interactions can reduce the cost 
and time of conducting real world meetings.  
  6.  Training. Virtual worlds can also be used for 
interactive and/or collaborative training. Trainees 
can learn by participating in simulations and role- 
playing. For example, one hotel chain is using 
virtual lobbies to train receptionists. Other orga-
nizations are developing applications that can 
help them train staff on how to handle emergen-
cies such as accidents and natural disasters. 
Virtual worlds can also be used for military train-
ing (e.g., ﬂ ight and battleﬁ eld simulations). For 
details, see Heiphetz and Woodill ( 2010 ).   
  7.  Education. Universities are using virtual worlds 
as a new immersive and interactive platform that 
is useful for interacting with students, and even for 
teaching courses. 
  8.  Recruiting. A growing number of organizations, 
including governments and the military, are recruit-
ing employees via virtual worlds. All recruiting 
activities, ranging from providing job details to 
interviewing candidates, are conducted at the 
recruiter’s virtual ofﬁ ce. This mode of recruiting is 
gaining acceptance by technology- savvy graduates 
and job seekers.  
  9.  Tourism promotion. Government tourist boards 
and tourist operators are using virtual worlds to 
promote their tourism destinations by providing 
tourists with 3-D virtual immersive experiences of 
real places and activities of interest. 
 10.  Museums and art galleries. Many artists and 
agencies are setting up virtual museums and

9.3 Social Commerce: Applications in Virtual Worlds

218
 Example: Sony’s PlayStation Home for a Virtual 
Community of Gamers 
 Sony’s PlayStation Home ( us.playstation.com/psn/play-
station-home ) is a virtual 3-D social gaming platform and a 
large gathering place and marketplace for owners of 
PlayStation games. As of 2012, it has attracted about 25 
million users worldwide who spend an average of 70 min-
utes per session (see  digiday.com/publishers/sonys-home-
coming-back ). The community of gamers can play 
hundreds of games, attend different events, and buy many 
virtual goods. 
 Note: Unfortunately, Sony closed PlayStation Home on 
March 31, 2015.  
 Today, many organizations are looking for ways to conduct 
virtual meetings in Seconds Life, instead of in the real world. 
 For examples of how businesses and organizations are 
using virtual worlds to make the world greener, refer to  The 
Green Book: An Enterprise Guide to Virtual Worlds , pub-
lished by Association of Virtual Worlds (Note: No longer 
available). 
 Representative Virtual World Applications 
Around the Globe 
 Here are a few other representative examples of virtual world 
applications (some of which have changed over time):  
 galleries to display their creations and promote 
sales. They also use virtual worlds to stage musi-
cals and other performances. 
  11.  Information points. Virtual worlds are used as 
sophisticated information kiosks. They can act as 
extremely powerful, interactive, and dynamic 
online resources or brochures. 
 12.  Data visualization and manipulation. Interactive 
data visualization and manipulation in the virtual 
environment is an interesting new application of 
interest to enterprises and professionals . For 
instance, the  Glasshouse software by Green 
Phosphor ( greenphosphor.com ) allows users to 
export data from either a spreadsheet or database 
query to a virtual world and then presents the user 
with a 3-D representation of the data in a virtual 
world environment for the user to explore interac-
tively. A user’s avatar can then manipulate the 
visualization of the data by drilling down into it, 
re-sorting it, or moving it around to view from 
many different angles. 
 13.  Renting virtual world land and buildings. One 
can earn virtual money by selling or renting build-
ings and lands in strategic locations in virtual 
worlds and by engaging in the “real estate” busi-
ness in the virtual world.  
 14.  Platform for social science research. Virtual 
worlds are also a good platform for conducting 
experimental social science research to observe 
how people behave or react (through their avatars) 
in structured and unstructured situations, and for 
studying customer behavior in virtual worlds.  
 15.  Market research. Using virtual worlds as a plat-
form enables companies to test new products by 
getting feedback from customers. These insights 
may give companies a competitive edge.  
 16.  Platform for design. In order to receive feedback 
and opinions, many companies show images of 
virtual things such as parks and structures, furni-
ture, and avatars to potential customers and 
designers. 
 17.  Providing CRM to employees and a platform 
for socialization. Companies use virtual worlds to 
provide CRM to employees and/or customers. For 
example, several companies have created islands 
in Seconds Life dedicated solely for use by their 
employees or for customer care. 
 18.  Virtual tradeshows. Virtual tradeshows (some-
times called  virtual trade fairs ), which we 
described in Sect.  9.2 , take place in virtual worlds 
(see Yu  2010 ). 
 For additional examples and discussion, see Reeves 
and Read ( 2009 ). 
•  Hana City ( hanacity.com ). Hana Bank of Korea 
uses a virtual world to educate its future customers, 
(children) about home ﬁ nancing investment options. 
•  MeetMe ( meet-me.jp ). To make your retail shop-
ping experience more exciting, this virtual world 
takes you shopping (virtually) in Japan.  
•  New Belgium Brewing ( newbelgium.com ). This 
brewery provides an interactive tour of the 
brewery. 
•  Aloft 
( starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels/index.
html ). Aloft, the global brand of Starwood hotels 
and resorts tested the design of its hotels on Seconds 
Life. The company used the feedback collected 
from more than a million visitors to create its ﬁ nal 
design for the hotels.  
•  IBM. IBM is now (2015) selling on Seconds Life.

9 Innovative Social Commerce Applications: From Social Government to Entertainment and Gaming

219
 Trading Virtual Goods and Properties 
 There are many business opportunities for buying and selling 
virtual goods. Sales are conducted by using electronic cata-
logs, classiﬁ ed advertisements, and auctions (e.g., see  usd.
auctions.secondslife.com ). Payments are made with virtual 
money (e.g., “Linden dollars”) that can be converted to real 
money. The tax and contract/legal issues are not clear (e.g., 
see  secondslife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Ofﬁ cial:Required_
Tax_Documentation_FAQ and  secondslife.com/corpo-
rate/vat.php ). In 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability 
ofﬁ ce released some guidelines and deﬁ nitions for a virtual 
economy and currency (see  cpa2biz.com/Content/media/
PRODUCER_CONTENT/Newsletters/Articles_2013/
Tax/VirtualEconomy.jsp ). 
 The major products/services in this category are: land, 
retail, manufacturing, scripting, fashion, and the adult enter-
tainment industry. 
 Concerns and Limitations of Commercial 
Activities in Virtual Worlds 
 Although virtual worlds were expected to become a major 
platform for commerce, business, and social activities, they 
have not yet reached this level. Despite their promise, virtual 
worlds present several challenges and constraints of which 
developers, businesses, and individual users must be aware. 
Virtual worlds such as Seconds Life are not easy to use, and 
are expensive to build and operate. Software needs to be 
installed and updated, which is too cumbersome for many 
users. Additionally, substantial hardware is needed. There 
are also administrative issues such as legal, taxation, ethics, 
and reliability. Moreover, there are technology limitations, 
including reliability and accessibility, and security. 
 According 
to 
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_
Seconds_Life , there are occurrences of fraud and violation 
of intellectual property in Seconds Life. The Seconds Life 
Community also provides suggestions for dealing with abuse 
and harassment at  community.secondslife.com/t5/tkb/arti-
cleprintpage/tkb-id/English_KB@tkb/article-id/283 . 
 Virtual worlds are targets for cybercriminals. For instance, 
Seconds Life has been attacked not only by outsiders, but 
also by groups of residents who created objects that harass 
other residents, or disrupt or damage the system. 
 To protect the users, Seconds Life has increased security. 
 For a comprehensive history of Seconds Life, see 
Vitzthum et al. ( 2011 ). 
 For guidelines dealing with the major concerns regarding 
building and managing businesses in virtual worlds, see 
Mahar and Mahar ( 2009 ). 
 Note: In 2014, Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus VR, a 
virtual reality company. The idea was that, by delivering an 
altered sense of reality with a social experience, Facebook 
could give users a more compelling reason to visit regularly 
(per Kapko  2014 ).

 SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT 
AND SOCIAL TV 
 The rich media capabilities of Web 2.0 technologies, the abil-
ity to engage millions of people who congregate in social net-
works and who are interested in online entertainment, the 
availability of innovative social media tools, and the creative 
and collaborative nature of Web 2.0 all facilitate social enter-
tainment (e.g.,  Gangnam Style was YouTube’s most watched 
video in 2012 and 2013). Web 2.0 tools also are aiding in the 
proliferation of on-demand entertainment. The most well- 
known entertainment application is streaming music (e.g., 
iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, and Google’s All Access;  play.
google.com/about/music ). The trend today is to stream music 
on-demand usually for free, which gives listeners the ability 
to listen to whatever they want, at any time. Jurgensen ( 2014 ) 
provides comprehensive coverage of digital music today and 
tomorrow, including information about new subscription ser-
vices, such as Beats Music. Beats Music uses algorithms to 
discover each user’s taste, and recommends songs based on 
what they learn. Their editorial team consists of music experts. 
Finally, Facebook and Twitter have entered this area; Facebook 
has a music app, and in October 2014, Twitter announced its 
new Audio Card for Android and iOs. This section describes 
some of the entertainment social networks, as well as other 
issues related to entertainment in social commerce. Note 
that, a major issue with such social networks is copyright 
violations, a topic we discuss in detail in Chap.   11  . 
 Entertainment and Social Networks 
 A large number of social networks and websites that are using 
social media tools are fully or partially dedicated to entertain-
ment. Well known examples are Vimeo, Netﬂ ix, and 
MySpace. MySpace has a licensing agreement with Sony, 
BMG, and other large media companies, that gives its mem-
bers free access to streaming videos, music, and other enter-
tainment. The following are representative examples of how 
Web 2.0 applications are used for entertainment. 
 Mixi 
 In Japan, Mixi, Inc. ( mixi.jp ) is a highly visited social net-
working service, even though users must be invited to join. 
Mixi’s goal is to allow users to build friendships with other 
users who share common interests. As of March 2012, the 
9.4 Social Entertainment and Social TV

220
site had about 27 million members and over 1 million small 
communities of friends and interests. For details, see 
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixi and  digitalintheround.com/
japan-mixi-facebook . 
 Last.fm 
 Last.fm ( last.fm ) is a music discovery service that recom-
mends music to its listeners. In April 2014, Last.fm changed 
from a streaming radio service to delivering to its customers 
personalized music via a new music player. Instead of music 
coming from their own servers, it is piped in from YouTube 
and VEVO onto the new player. Customers can also listen 
through Spotify. For details, see  billboard.com/biz/articles/
news/digital-and-mobile/6022007/lastfm-pulls-out-of-
radio- streaming-plugs-in-youtube (accessed July 2015).  
 Web Series and Streaming Movies 
 Web series are similar to regular, episodic series on TV (e.g., 
soap operas), but you can only watch them on the Internet. 
The number of Web series is increasing, and some are already 
available on DVD. Examples include  Hemlock Grove, House 
of Cards, and  Johnny Dynamo . For more about Web series 
and other examples, see  webserieschannel.com/web-series-
 101  
and 
 variety.com/gallery/top-10-web-series-of-
 2013/#!1/introduction . 
 Hulu 
 Hulu ( hulu.com ) is an ad-supported online video service 
that offers a selection of hit TV shows, clips, movies and 
more. Their streaming service offers any current season epi-
sode of primetime TV shows from NBC, Fox, Disney 
(including ABC programs), and other networks and studios. 
Due to copyright laws, Hulu offers videos only to users in 
the United States and a few other countries. Hulu provides 
video in Flash video format. In addition, Hulu offers some 
TV shows and movies in high deﬁ nition in a manner similar 
to Google Sites, Fox Interactive Media, and Yahoo! Sites. 
Users can manually share videos they like on their Facebook 
page by using the “Facebook” button. It is not necessary to 
 connect their Hulu and Facebook accounts to do this. Hulu is 
one of the most popular Internet video sites ( nielsen.com/us/
en/newswire/2013/binging-is-the-new-viewing-for-over-
the- top-streamers.html ). Hulu offers some of its services 
free, supported by advertising. It also offers Hulu Plus, 
which includes premium shows and the ability to watch on 
more devices, for a monthly fee of $7.99. This service also 
features limited advertising. For more about their offerings 
and differences between Hulu and Hulu Plus, click on the 
“frequently asked questions” tab at  hulu.com/plus and 
watch the guided tour on  hulu.com/plus . 
 Advertising and subscriptions are the primary social com-
merce business models for most streaming entertainment 
sites. 
 Justin.tv (now Twitch.tv) 
 According to their website and Wikipedia,  justin.tv was a 
website that allowed users to create, share, produce, and 
watch live streaming videos. This network featured thou-
sands of live channels with over 300 live streams available 
each month. 
 In February 2014, the company was renamed Twitch 
Interactive, Inc. ( twitch.tv ). Twitch Interactive is a site for 
gaming-related content only. 
 Funny-or-Die and Cracked.com 
 According to their website, and Wikipedia, Funny or Die ( fun-
nyordie.com ) is a comedy video website created by actor and 
comedian Will Ferrell, among others. Like other viral video 
sites, members of Funny or Die are encouraged to vote on 
videos that they watch. If they think the video is funny, view-
ers cast a vote for “Funny.” The video then gets a score of the 
total percentage of people who voted the video “Funny.” If the 
video receives an 80 % or greater “Funny” rating after 100,000 
views, it gets an “Immortal” ranking. If the video receives a 
20 % or less “Funny” rating after 1,000 views, it “dies” and is 
relegated to the Crypt section of the site. Cracked.com, another 
humor website (which includes videos), also uses crowdsourc-
ing to solicit material from the Internet crowd.  
 Multimedia Presentation and Sharing Sites 
 Multimedia sharing can be done in several ways, and its pur-
pose is entertainment, advertising, training, and socializa-
tion. The following are the major types of sharing, with 
representative companies: 
•  Photography and art sharing. Flickr, Instagram, 
Picasa, SmugMug, Photobucket  
•  Livecasting. Livestream ( new.livestream.com ), 
Skype, Ustream ( ustream.tv ) 
•  Music and audio sharing. ccMixter ( ccmixter.
org ), 
FreeSound 
( freesound.org ), 
Last.fm, 
MySpace, ReverbNation, The Hype Machine

 Note that many of these have some features of social net-
works; therefore, they may be referred to as such. In addi-
tion, most of the above companies are generating revenue 
from advertising and/or subscriptions.  
 Internet TV and Internet Social TV 
 Two similar streaming technologies are popular on the Web: 
Internet TV and Internet radio. 
 Internet TV 
 Internet TV is the delivery of TV content via the Internet by 
downloading or streaming videos. The content includes TV 
shows, sporting events, movies, and other videos. Several 
video-on-demand and subscription services, such as  netﬂ ix.
com ,  hulu.com and  hulu.com/plus , as well as  amazon.
com/Prime-Instant-Video/b?node=2676882011 , offer this 
service. For a comprehensive description of Internet TV, see 
 wisegeek.org/what-is-internet-tv.htm . The major advan-
tage is the ability to select what and when to view content 
and the ability to do so from computers, tablets, smartphones, 
and Blu-Ray consoles. Some major players are: Apple TV 
( apple.com/appletv ), Roku, Google Chromecast ( google.
com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/ ), and Aereo. 
 Social Television (TV) 
 Social TV is an emerging social media technology that 
enables TV viewers who are in different locations to interac-
tively share experiences such as discussions, reviews, tweet-
ing, and recommendations while watching the same show 
simultaneously. According to WhatIsSocialTelevision.com 
( whatissocialtelevision.com ), social TV is “the union of 
television and social media” and refers to “the phenomenon 
of people communicating with each other while watching a 
TV show or discussing with each other about television con-
tent using the Internet as a medium of communication.” The 
communication can be done via texting in social networks, 
by tweeting (see Samsung  2014 ), using smartphones, tablets, 
etc. Social TV combines broadcast television programs and 
user-generated content with rich social media. Social TV 
was listed by  MIT Technology Review (reported by 
Evangelista  2011 ) as one of the ten most important emerging 
technologies of 2010. The editor of  Wired Magazine named 
social TV as number three of six important technology trends 
for 2011 (see  wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/11/david-
rowan-predictions-2011 ). 
 Characteristics of Social TV 
 Social TV has several unique characteristics: 
 Social TV is attracting an ample number of viewers. (The 
number of traditional television viewers is declining due to 
Internet viewing). Programmers are looking at social media 
interaction not just as an ampliﬁ er of TV programming but as 
content in its own right (e.g., see Poggi  2012 ). 
 Technology and Services of Social TV 
 A large number of social TV tools and platforms are emerg-
ing. According to Rountree ( 2011 ), there are three major 
types of social TV:
  1.  Using a seconds screen (such as a smartphone, tablet, etc.) 
or another communication device while watching TV.  
 2.  Using an on-screen experience where information is dis-
played directly within the TV. 
 3.  Using a personal computer or mobile device to watch TV 
shows. 
 These options are not pure social media tools, but they 
facilitate social interaction revolving around TV programs. 
•  The possibility of discovering new video content 
and sharing this discovery with friends.  
•  Most social TV activities are done in real time by 
watching content and commenting on it to others, 
even if the viewers are in different locations. 
•  Social TV allows people to connect in a unique way 
with other people who share the same interests.  
•  Presentation sharing. SlideSnack, SlideShare, 
authorSTREAM 
•  Media and entertainment platforms. Kaltura 
Open Source Video ( corp.kaltura.com/Video- 
Solutions/Media-and-Entertainment ;

9.4 Social Entertainment and Social TV

222
 Rountree ( 2011 ) and AngelList Social Television Startups 
( angel.co/social-television ) provide a list of start-ups in the 
ﬁ eld (e.g., Kwarter, and YouToo TV). Each start-up and tool 
has a different capability for speciﬁ c TV programs. For a list 
of the most tweeted-about shows of 2014, see  nielsen.com/
us/en/insights/news/2014/tops-of-2014-social-tv.html . 
 Vendors are interested in social TV mainly as an emerg-
ing tool for marketing communication strategies such as 
increasing brand awareness or conducting market research 
(e.g., see Proulx and Shepatin  2012 ). For the future of social 
TV, see  Redniss (2013) . Nielsen Corporation monitors audi-
ences on social TV (see  nielsensocial.com ). 
 Example 
 In 2011, Pepsi launched a robust community platform pow-
ered by Gigya’s social technology. The Pepsi Sound Off, a 
social TV venture, allowed fans of “The X-Factor” (the tal-
ent competition reality show) to meet online and interact 
with others to chat about the contestants and the judges. 
Interactions occurred mostly in real time.  
 Internet Radio and Social Radio 
 Known by several other names,  Internet radio refers to 
audio content transmitted live via the Internet. It is a broad-
casting service that enables users to listen online to thou-
sands of radio stations (e.g., over 4,000 in Europe; see 
 listenlive.eu ). The service can broadcast anything that is on 
the radio stations plus broadcasts from organizations, gov-
ernments, and even individuals. For details, see Beller 
( 2001 ) and  radio.about.com/od/listentoradioonline/qt/bl- 
InternetRadio.htm . Internet radio has the same copyright 
issues that apply to Internet TV. Note that, in many cases, 
there is an agreement between the content creators and the 
distributors (e.g., Warner Music and Apple reached an iRa-
dio deal in 2013; see  cnet.com/news/apple-reaches-iradio- 
deal-with-warner-music-suggesting-wwdc-launch 
and 
 apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio ). See also  blogtalkradio.
com/beverlymacy . 
 Example: Pandora Radio 
 Pandora is a leading free Internet radio service that delivers 
music not only from radio stations but also from many other 
sources. The core of the service is the  Music Genome Project . 
According to  pandora.com/about , the project is a compre-
hensive analysis of hundreds of musical details on every track. 
You can drop the name of one of your favorite songs, artists or 
genres into Pandora, and the Music Genome Project will 
quickly scan its own entire world of analyzed music to ﬁ nd 
songs with interesting musical similarities to your choice. 
 Pandora is actually a music streaming and automated 
 music recommendation service that, as of 2015, is available 
only in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. Users can cre-
ate up to 100 personalized stations that play pre-arranged 
selections. In February 2014, the company opened up its 
content submission process to independent artists (see  sub-
mit.pandora.com , 
 help.pandora.com/customer/portal/
articles/24802-information-for-artists-submitting-to-
pandora , and Hockenson  2014 ). For Pandora’s Help Center, 
see  help.pandora.com . 
 Social Radio 
 An extension of internet radio is  social radio , which is the 
integration of Internet radio with social networking activi-
ties. It is about listener’s choice and control from their 
news and entertainment sources (e.g., see  socialradio.org/
about ).  
9.5 
 SOCIAL GAMES, GAMING, 
AND GAMIFICATION 
 A  social game is a video multiplayer game played on the 
Internet, mostly in social networks or in virtual worlds. 
Gamers can play against computers, or against each other. 
Many social games are “massively” multiplayer online 
games (known as MMOG or MMO), which are capable of 
supporting hundreds or thousands of players simultane-
ously. MMOG players can compete, collaborate, or just 
interact with other players around the globe. Many game 
consoles, including the PSP, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, 
Nintendo DSi, and Wii, can be played on the Internet. 
Additionally, mobile devices and smartphones based on 
such operating systems as Android, iOS, webOS, and 
Windows Mobile are seeing an increase in the number of 
available MMO games. Social games are very popular. 
According to the 2013 State of Online Gaming Report, 44 % 
of worldwide Internet users play online games (see the 
report and infographic at  auth-83051f68- ec6c-44e0-afe5-
bd8902acff57.cdn.spilcloud.com/v1/archives/
1384952861.25_State_of_Gaming_2013_US_FINAL.pdf ), 
which is over 1.2 billion people (see  venturebeat.
com/2013/11/25/more-than- 1-2-billion- people-are-
playing-games ). Although some games require fees for 
enhanced features, many are free (see Pearce  2009 ). 
 Games on Social Networks 
 A  social network game is a video game that is distributed 
primarily through social networks, and usually involves 
9 Innovative Social Commerce Applications: From Social Government to Entertainment and Gaming

223
multiplayers. Social network games may have little or noth-
ing to do with how  social the games are. However, some 
games have social components such as educating the public, 
gift- giving, and helping others, or sharing playing strategies. 
For an overview, see Humbarger ( 2011 ). Social games are 
embedded within major social networks allowing many 
users to play together simultaneously. The games are usually 
simple and easy to learn and play. 
 For a game to be more social, it should facilitate and 
encourage engagement and communication about the envi-
ronment outside the game, run on or be integrated with a 
social network, and use that network to enhance game play-
ing between players. 
 Example: Popular Games on Facebook 
 Players can choose from several thousands of games on 
Facebook. Some games are played by 50–150 million each. 
The most popular games each attract tens of millions of play-
ers. Facebook’s list of popular games for November 2014 
includes Candy Crush Saga (the most popular in 2014), Texas 
HoldEm Poker, Dragon City, FarmVille 2, Pet Rescue Saga, 
Criminal Case, Farm Heroes Saga, and Words with Friends. 
(See  gamechitah.com/top-games-on-facebook.html .) 
 As of September 2013, the major Facebook developers 
for games are King, Zynga, Social Point, and Pretty Simple. 
(See  beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2013/10/
top-9-facebook-developer-list-games-September-
2013- 2-2644806.html .) Note that people are playing more 
casino games. For example, see  doubledowninteractive.
com/games . To enhance the game experience, some plat-
forms utilize the players’ social graphs. 
 To learn more about social games, go to  museumstuff.
com/learn/topics/Social_network_game . To ﬁ nd friends 
and share gaming experiences on the Web, see the following 
sites:  gamerdna.com ,  raptr.com ,  wegame.en.softonic.
com ,  ugamehome.com , and World of Warcraft ( us.battle.
net/wow/en ). 
 The Business Aspects of Social Games 
 To understand the variety of games and their properties and 
commercial possibilities, we suggest you watch the video 
“Social Media Games: Worldwide Gamiﬁ cation Is the New 
Paradigm for Life and Business” at  youtube.com/
watch?v=xCWsgBHY_VU . The video presents opportuni-
ties for advertising, marketing, and training, among others. It 
took Facebook 4.5 years to reach the same level of visitors that 
Zynga reached in 2.5 years. However, Zynga’s revenue was 
overestimated, causing the stock price to decline drastically. 
As far as revenues, Facebook games provide very little income 
per person per month. Electronic Arts, Inc., a Zynga competi-
tor, has some games that generate 3–5 times more per game. 
Both companies have gone mobile. For example, FarmVille2 
for iPad and iPhone are now available. For additional discus-
sion, see Reeves and Read ( 2009 ) and Humbarger ( 2011 ).  
 Educational Social Games 
 Games can also be educational, as the following examples 
show. Developers have also created environmental apps 
for kids for iPad and so forth (see  usatoday.com/story/
tech/ columnist/gudmundsen/2013/09/01/ecology-
learning-apps- kids/2700271 ). See also  ecogamer.org/
environmental-games . 
 Example 1: Pollution Reduction Game 
 The Filipino environmental awareness Facebook game 
called Alter Space aims to educate people on how to reduce 
pollution. Speciﬁ cally, it educates players about the concepts 
of carbon footprints and cleaner energy, and how they can 
help achieve a cleaner world. 
 Example 2: Economic and Finance 
Game—Empire Avenue 
 Empire Avenue ( empireavenue.com ) is a social media stock 
market simulation game where individuals and businesses 
buy and sell virtual shares from each other. The shares can be 
of individuals, companies, etc. The share price is based on 
the shares’ trading activity coupled with the players’ inﬂ u-
ence on the major social networks. The trading is done with 
reward points called  Eaves and  Vees . In the game, there are 
ﬁ nancial data and decision-making capabilities about divi-
dends, number of shares outstanding, and share prices, to 
name just a few. Empire has many variables within the game. 
The reward points can also be used as virtual currency to 
play the Social Market game. Players can interact via popu-
lar social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) 
across the Web. The more social the player is, the more vir-
tual currency the player will earn, and the bigger the player’s 
Empire will become. Several major brands are already using 
this site (e.g., Toyota, AT&T, Audi, and Ford). For details, 
see Empire Avenue at  businessesgrow.com/2014/01/08/
how-empire-avenue-crushed-my-soul/ . 
 For more on social games, see Reeves and Read ( 2009 ) 
and Pearce ( 2009 ). 
 Gamers Helped Scientists 
 For decades, scientists were unable to unfold the chemical 
chain of an enzyme of an AIDS-like virus. However, accord-
ing to a September 19, 2011 article in the Balita Filipino 
News ( balita.com ), researchers at the University of 
Washington used Foldit, a “fun-for-purpose” video game, 
created by the university. The gamers were divided into 
9.5 Social Games, Gaming, and Gamiﬁ cation

224
groups, and using Foldit, were challenged to compete by 
using their problem-solving skills to build 3-D models of a 
protein that scientists had been unable to ﬁ nd for years. 
The players solved the chemical chain problem accurately in 
just 3 weeks. (See  balita.com/online-gamers-crack-aids-
enzyme- puzzle  .) For more about Foldit (“Solve Puzzles for 
Science”), see  fold.it/portal . 
 Gamiﬁ cation 
 Social games are played by millions of people. Some social 
games are designed so that players will connect with vendors 
or brands in the game environments. This is only one aspect 
of  gamiﬁ cation , which refers to the introduction of gaming 
into social networking. Gamiﬁ cation can also be viewed as 
the introduction of social networking activities into online 
games. Our interest is in those applications that are related to 
social commerce and e-commerce. For more deﬁ nitions and 
limitations, see Gamiﬁ cation Wiki ( gamiﬁ cation.org ) and 
Duggan and Shoup ( 2013 ). 
 Social activities are not new to online gaming. For exam-
ple, players collectively agree to the rules of the games. In 
addition, gamers need trust between the players. What is new 
here is the integration of traditional multiplayer games and 
social networking. Given that so many people play online 
games, it is not surprising that vendors are encouraging play-
ers (e.g., via rewards) to engage in desired behavior (e.g., 
problem solving or collaboration). Vendors also use games 
as advertising platforms. 
 According to a Lithium ( 2011 ) and Florentine ( 2014 ), 
companies can create winning social customer experiences 
such as increasing loyalty, building trust, accelerating inno-
vation, providing brand engagement, and increasing relevant 
knowledge. 
 For commercial possibilities and strategies of social 
games and gamiﬁ cation, see Radoff ( 2011 ), Dignan ( 2011 ), 
and Zichermann and Linder ( 2013 ). According to Pedzai 
( 2013 ), gamiﬁ cation provides a new approach to create sus-
tained engagement between sellers and customers.

titled “The Essential Social Playbook: 3 Steps to Turn 
Social into Sales,” at  powerreviews.com/assets/new/

 SOCIALLY ORIENTED ONLINE 
PERSON-TO- PERSON ACTIVITIES 
 Many person-to-person (P2P) activities are not related to 
social media or commerce. However, there is a trend for an 
increasing number of socially-oriented innovative applica-
tions in this ﬁ eld. Here we provide only a few examples. 
Note that, when individuals trade with other individuals 
online, they may do so using some social elements. For 
example, some consider Craigslist to be a socially oriented 
virtual community. For the impact of P2P on teens, see 
Paquette ( 2014 ). 
 For information about selling products directly on 
Facebook, 
see 
 new.soldsie.com/blog/selling-facebook- 
drive-e-commerce-social-media . For why P2P selling to 
teens is taking off, see Paquette ( 2014 ). P2P is related to the 
topic of the collaborative (or sharing) economy. 
 Collaborative (or Sharing) Economy 
 The  collaborative ( or  sharing) economy  refers to an eco-
nomic system constructed around the concept of sharing 
goods and services among the participating people. Also 
known as ‘collaborative consumption,’ such systems appear 
in different forms and frequently use information technolo-
gies in their operations. A well-known example is  car shar-
ing . The essentials of this concept are described by 
Buczynski ( 2013 ). 
 The major beneﬁ ts for participants are cost reduction for 
buyers and ability to sell more for sellers. Societal beneﬁ ts 
include reduction of carbon footprints (e.g., in ride shar-
ing), increased recycling, and increased social interactions. 
For comprehensive coverage, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sharing_economy . 
 Sharing Economy and Social Commerce 
 Several SC models and companies are based on the concept 
of the sharing economy. Examples include Uber, connecting 
riders with drivers; Yerdle, a marketplace for trading used 
goods; Kickstarter, for crowdfunding; Krrb, a P2P local clas-
siﬁ ed marketplace; and Knok and Love Home Swap for 
home swapping. Vacation rentals, where home and condo 
owners provide short term rentals, and home exchanges, 
where two parties agree to exchange their homes for a short 
period of time, are also popular examples of the sharing 
economy (e.g., see Airbnb and HomeAway). 
 P2P Lending 
 P2P lending is growing rapidly, enabling people to lend 
money or other items to each other. During the process, par-
ticipants also get to know one another. An example of P2P 
lending is a community of people who rent goods to people 
in need, usually for the short term. 
 Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like 
SwapBabyGoods.com), while others are more general like 
Neighborhood Fruit, which helps people ﬁ nd and share fruit 
locally. All of the sites are encouraging  collaborative 
 consumption . Several variations of P2P exist. Some people

share cars; others invite travelers to stay in their homes at no 
cost; others can ﬁ nd a local host when they travel (see 
Couchsurﬁ ng International;  couchsurﬁ ng.com ), and many 
more. Even Google provides a service that connects borrow-
ers and lenders of money. 
 Social Money Lending 
 Person-to-person money lending (also known as  peer-to- 
peer lending and  social lending ) (abbreviated as  P2P lend-
ing ) is lending and borrowing that occurs directly between 
individuals. Person-to-person lending is usually managed by 
a third-party company, such as Zopa (in the UK) ( zopa.com ), 
the pioneer of lending, or Prosper (in the U.S.),  prosper.
com . It involves a community of lenders and borrowers. 
Another growing area of P2P is a type of  crowdsourcing 
known as crowdfunding (Chap.   8 ), where people raise money 
mainly from small contributors and investors, both non- proﬁ t 
and for commercial purposes. 
 The Lending Club 
 The Lending Club is an online P2P credit marketplace that 
uses an efﬁ cient, transparent, and consumer friendly money 
lending process. According to  lendingclub.com/public/
how-peer-lending-works.action , the company (which is 
now on the stock exchange), uses technology to cut expenses 
and provide qualiﬁ ed borrowers with loans with lower inter-
est rates, lower than they can get in most banks while provid-
ing investors with solid returns. The following process is 
done entirely online:
•  “Customers interested in a loan complete a simple appli-
cation at LendingClub.com” (per Lending Club)  
•  Lending Club leverages the information, assigns interest 
rates, and instantly presents a variety of offers to qualiﬁ ed 
borrowers, who can evaluate options (with no impact to 
their credit score). 
•  “Investors ranging from individuals to institutions select 
loans in which to invest and can earn monthly returns” 
(per Lending Club) 
 For a borrower’s experience with Lending Club, see 
Cunningham ( 2014 b). For an investor’s review, see 
Cunningham ( 2014 a). 
 For an extensive review and analysis, see Frankle ( 2013 ). 
 For more information, see  forbes.com/companies/
lending-club . 
 Issues in P2P Lending 
 Several issues are related to P2P lending. Lenders may ask 
the questions: Is it safe? What is the rate of default? What if 
Lending Club goes out of business? Am I getting the best 
income? Borrowers may question the interest rate they pay, 
the conditions for getting the loans, and how their credit 
score is determined (see Exercise # 7 in ‘Team Assignments’). 
 How Peers Use Social Media to Sell to Peers 
 Individuals are using social networking in many innovative 
ways to sell to other individuals. 
 Example #1 
 How Kawehi became a digital music phenomenon by using 
social media. Kawehi produces songs and videos with com-
puters and digital instruments. Kawehi formed a core of fol-
lowers. Here are some of her activities:
•  She uses Kickstarter to raise funds for her ventures. 
•  She uses  bandcamp.com marketplace to sell her own 
releases. 
•  She made videos and posted them on YouTube and Vimeo, 
thus building a fan base. About half of her fans come from 
outside the U.S. 
•  Her most successful music video is “Heart Shaped Box,” 
which was picked up by the digital press, giving her a lot 
of publicity. 
•  Her growing fan base comes from her videos. 
 For details, see Russo ( 2014 ). 
 Example #2 
 How the Talbots sold their house by themselves. ‘ For sale by 
owner ’ has been done for many years, but you can do it much 
better with the help of social networking. The Talbots did the 
following to sell their house in Seattle:
•  Created a website 
•  Produced home-tour videos and uploaded them to their 
website and YouTube. 
•  Added a ‘help us sell our house’ link to their blog. 
•  Posted that their house was for sale on Facebook. 
•  Got in touch with anyone who typed “move to Seattle” on 
Twitter. 
 For details, see Bankrate.com ( 2013 ). 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  Social government. Governments use social media to 
improve their interactions with the public, to get citizens 
more involved, to inﬂ uence citizens, and to improve their 
internal operations. The variety of possible applications is 
demonstrated in the New Zealand government case (Case 
 9.1 ). Social media facilitates collaboration between gov-
ernments and citizens and other government partners, as 
Summary

well as among employees of government agencies. Social 
governments facilitate more democratization and make 
citizens more satisﬁ ed. 
  2.  Social B2B. While most of the attention in social media is 
given to B2C market activities, social media tools and plat-
forms are used extensively in B2B markets as well. Some 
areas of action are: ﬁ nding sales leads, discovering suppli-
ers, organizing group purchasing, conducting virtual trade 
shows, collaborating on joint projects (such as joint design), 
and promoting industry activities. Social B2B commerce 
helps small organizations as well, and it can facilitate B2B 
global trade. Fostering relationships with business partners 
is a major objective of social B2B. Finally, social media 
can facilitate building B2B social strategy.  
  3.  Business activities in virtual worlds. An increasing num-
ber of business activities are conducted in virtual worlds, 
most notably in Seconds Life. Popular activities are mar-
keting communication, collaboration, learning and train-
ing, trading virtual goods, design testing, and customer 
service. In addition, there are professional discussions, 
entertainment and gaming, direct online sales, recruit-
ment, market research activities, and virtual trade shows.  
 4.  Social commerce and entertainment. Rich media, user- 
created content, and groups and subgroups with common 
interests open many possibilities for a seconds generation 
of online entertainment. Add to this the wireless revolu-
tion and the increased capabilities in mobile devices to 
support Web 2.0 tools and social networking activities 
and you will discover a new and exciting world of online 
entertainment. Social TV, where viewers interact with 
each other while simultaneously watching TV programs, 
is an emerging area. 
 5.  Social games. Social games are online multiplayer games 
that are played in social networks, mostly on Facebook. 
Tens of millions of players play popular games. One 
source of income for social networks is the selling of vir-
tual goods related to social games. They also make money 
from paid advertising on some of the games. Games can 
be educational, but can also be used for training purposes. 
Most of all, though, players have fun, make friends, and 
sharpen their competitive skills.  
 6.  Socially-oriented P2P. This emerging application area is 
currently limited to socially lending money, facilitating 
bartering, and providing services in communities of spe-
cial interest (e.g., travel, banking, real estate, education). 
For example, swapping residences while travelling and 
lending money are two popular activities.

 OPENING CASE: SOCIAL MEDIA-BASED 
MARKET RESEARCH HELPS DEL MONTE 
IMPROVE DOG FOOD 
 The Problem 
 Del Monte operates in a very competitive global food indus-
try. In addition to manufacturing canned fruits and vegeta-
bles for human consumption, Del Monte produces pet food 
such as Gravy Train, 9 Lives, and Meow Mix. Therefore, 
using market research, the company constantly looks for 
innovative ways to increase its competitive edge. The com-
pany noticed the fast growth of social media and decided to 
deploy social media projects “in order to capitalize on social 
networking as a marketing tool, to help the company get 
closer to its customers and create the kind of products con-
sumers want” (per Greengard  2008 ). Their primary goal 
was to decide the best way to use social media-based market 
research to support its diverse product line—in this case, 
dog food.  

234
 The Solution 
 The basic idea was ﬁ rst to connect and collaborate with dog 
lovers via social networks and then conduct their market 
research. The corporate IT department was unable to conduct 
social network research; therefore, the Pet Products Division of 
Del Monte Foods decided to use Insight Networks, a service 
launched by MarketTools, Inc., a provider of on-demand online 
market research (see MarketTools, Inc.  2008 for details). 
 The ﬁ rst activity conducted using Insight Networks was 
text analysis—gathering relevant content from over 50 mil-
lion blogs and analyzing relevant topics of conversation 
among the target customers. The seconds activity was to cre-
ate a special online community of dog lovers, where Del 
Monte could observe interactions and stimulate discussions 
with the community members. The third activity was on- 
demand survey research, used to determine the viability of 
new strategies and ideas (see MarketTools, Inc.  2008 .) 
 Through previous research, Del Monte Pet Products 
Division identiﬁ ed one segment of the dog owner commu-
nity as their target, and they wanted to understand that seg-
ment more in depth. Del Monte created an online community 
for dog lovers called “I Love My Dog,” where 400 members 
were chosen to join the private network. In order to connect 
with millions of dog owners, Insight Networks provided Del 
Monte Pet Products Division with a direct, interactive con-
nection to their consumers. Using their propriety software, 
Insight Networks monitors millions of relevant blogs in the 
blogosphere as well as forums in social networks, in order to 
identify key ideas in which dog lovers are interested. These 
ideas were then analyzed in order to predict consumer behav-
ior trends. Such analysis is usually done by using computer-
ized tools such as monitoring consumer interactions, 
analyzing consumer sentiments, and using social analytics 
(e.g., see Jayanti  2010 ). 
 By utilizing social media, Del Monte can now conduct 
better market research. The conventional approach was using 
questionnaires (or focus groups) that were expensive and dif-
ﬁ cult to ﬁ ll by qualiﬁ ed participants. Using social media, Del 
Monte can gather much of the same data faster and at a lower 
cost. All that is required now is to monitor customer conver-
sations, collect the data, and analyze the vast amount of 
information. The software provided by MarketTools also 
facilitates subgroup creation, idea generation, and panel 
creation. 
 Del Monte received positive results through their use of 
Insight Networks. According to Del Monte’s senior market 
research manager, they used the results of the text analysis 
and communication with the dog lover community to ask 
questions about which new products to introduce and 
which products to reﬁ ne. This method saves Del Monte 
time and money, helping them focus on products that cus-
tomers will value most, while helping them gain a new 
competitive edge. After the market analysis conducted by 
Insight Networks, Del Monte introduced two new prod-
ucts, with great success. The ﬁ rst was a new variety of 
Pup-Peroni ® dog snacks, with new packaging and a new 
marketing campaign, which resulted in increased product 
sales. The other was a new product—Snausages Breakfast 
Bites™, with sales ﬁ gures that pleased Del Monte (see 
MarketTools, Inc.  2008 ). 
 The Experiment 
 The results of the above application were used to help 
improve the company’s dog treat, called Snausages Breakfast 
Bites. For guidance, Del Monte relied on its dog lovers’ 
social community. By monitoring customer blogs and by 
posting questions to customers to stimulate discussions, Del 
Monte used text analysis methods to investigate the relation-
ship between dogs and their owners. Del Monte concluded 
from the analysis that people who own small dogs would be 
the major purchasers of Snausages Breakfast Bites. The 
company also found differences of opinions due to the age of 
owners. Next, a small sample of the improved dog food was 
produced and tested in the physical market. As a result of 
using both social media and traditional market research, the 
product design decisions were revised. In addition, market-
ing promotions were modiﬁ ed. Finally, the new approach 
solidiﬁ ed the community of dog lovers who are happy that 
their opinions were considered. 
 The Results 
 The results of the analysis help Del Monte understand its 
customers and consequently plan its marketing activities, 
communication strategies, and customer service applica-
tions. The results also help evaluate the success of special 
marketing campaigns, how well the business processes 
accomplished the corporate goals, and how to better justify 
proposed new activities. 
 Product cycle time was reduced by more than 50 % to 
only 6 months, and Del Monte was able to develop a better 
marketing communication strategy. Furthermore, the analy-
sis helped the company better understand customers and 
their purchasing activities, as well as predicting market 
trends and identifying and anticipating opportunities. Finally, 
the quality of the food was improved based on the sugges-
tions of the dog lovers, increasing sales.

10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

235
10.1 
 THE STRATEGY-PERFORMANCE 
CYCLE 
 Social media projects, like other projects, are implemented 
in order to improve  organizational performance . Companies 
can view improving performance as a challenge, a require-
ment for survival, or as a key to proﬁ tability and a positive 
reputation. 
 In this chapter, we look at performance improvement as a 
generic cyclical process, which is based on a strategy, met-
rics, performance assessment, analysis, and innovation. The 
process, illustrated in Fig.  10.1 , involves four major steps: 
(1) create goals and objectives that express the organiza-
tional mission; (2) create the strategy and make plans to 
attain the goals and objectives; (3) set performance metrics 
and monitor the performance, then analyze the difference 
between the two; and (4) develop a corrective strategy.
 The remaining portion of this chapter describes the four 
steps. A brief description of the four steps follows: 
 Step 1. Organizations exist to accomplish a mission (top box 
in Fig.  10.1 ). Any SC project is designed to help attain the 
goals and objectives. Four major objectives are listed on the 
right-hand side of the mission box, including the gain of 
competitive advantage and increased performance. Other 
goals and objectives relate to speciﬁ c social commerce proj-
ects, and they depend on the speciﬁ c situation. Examples are: 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 The opening case illustrates that market research can 
be useful in a competitive market by providing insights 
for better product development and marketing strategy. 
In this case, the company collected data online from its 
socially-oriented customers. One of the ﬁ rst activities 
MarketTools, Inc. provided was text analysis. By mon-
itoring, collecting, and analyzing relevant content from 
over 50 million conversations on blogs, MarketTools 
was able to determine the current topics of conversa-
tion among the consumers. The results of the analysis 
helped Del Monte determine what topics dog owners 
are most interested in. Using this information, Del 
Monte was able to improve its dog food and devise new 
marketing strategies. Online market research, as seen 
in the case, is related to strategy, planning, performance 
monitoring, social media analysis, and sentiment anal-
ysis; all these topics are addressed in this chapter. 
 The main focus of this chapter is on the basic steps 
in creating strategic planning for SC companies. The 
chapter also presents and discusses issues related to 
creating an e-strategy to engage in global SC and the 
opportunities that SC creates for small and medium- 
sized enterprises (SMEs).

 Step 2 . Once the goals and objectives are known, an organi-
zation needs to decide what to do to attain them. That is, how 
does the organization get what the organization wants (see 
right-hand side box in Fig.  10.1 ). The key activities in this 
step include strategy formulation and strategic planning 
(e.g., see Spredfest;  spredfast.com ). Section  10.2 describes 
these activities as they relate to social commerce. 
 Note that this step involves the justiﬁ cation of the social 
commerce initiative(s) (Sect.  10.3 ). Moreover, this step 
requires activities such as an analysis of the markets and the 
competition, which are done via market research (Sect.  10.4 ). 
 Step 3 . Once the strategy and plans are approved, organiza-
tions can proceed and deploy the social commerce 
program(s). After a few months, it is necessary to assess the 
program’s performance (bottom box of Fig.  10.1 ); namely, 
how well the company is performing, with respect to the 
attainment of its strategy, in terms of the social commerce 
program, and its contribution to the goals and objectives. 
This step involves two major activities: (1) setting measur-
able performance metrics and (2) monitoring, measuring, 
and comparing performance for these metrics. Several tools 
are employed here, including generic ones such as balanced 
scorecards. All these topics are described in detail in 
Sect.  10.5 . 
 Once the organizations collect performance information, 
they need to analyze the performance level (quantitatively 
and qualitatively). This analysis is partially done by using 
social media analytics, including sentiment analysis. Results 
of the analysis are presented via reports, tables, and dash-
boards (see Sect.  10.6 ). 
 Step 4 . The analysis tells management how well the com-
pany performs when it uses social commerce initiatives. 
Obviously, if the analysis shows negative results, it is neces-
sary to take some corrective action (left box of Fig.  10.1 ). A 
key activity here is to use innovations to improve the perfor-
mance. However, even if the results are good, the organiza-
tion may take actions that range from providing bonuses to 
the best performers identiﬁ ed in the analysis to raising the 
desired levels of employee performance for the future. The 
primary point is being innovative, because even a good per-
formance can be improved. In addition, techniques such as 
competitive analysis can be useful (Sect.  10.7 ). 
 Note that the process is cyclical. However, at each step, a 
return to a previous step in order to conduct some modiﬁ ca-
tion is possible. 
 In the remainder of this chapter, we will describe how 
social media and social networking are related to the four 
steps (center of Fig.  10.1 ). 
 Types of Social Media Projects 
 In addition to the organizational goals and objectives pre-
sented in Step 1, there are goals and objectives that relate to 
the speciﬁ c types of social media projects. 
 In Table  10.1 , we present representative types of social 
commerce projects, along with their potential goals. In addi-
tion, Forrester Consulting ( 2010 ) identiﬁ ed the major social 
commerce activities conducted by companies. Their study 
also identiﬁ ed the strategic goals supported by social media.
 For additional information, see  ibm.com/smarterplanet/
global/ﬁ les/us__en_us__socialbusiness__epw14008usen.pdf . 
 Note that, these goals are the basis for strategic planning 
(Sect.  10.2 ), justiﬁ cation (Sect.  10.3 ), market research 
(Sect.  10.4 ), metrics (Sect.  10.5 ), and analysis (Sect.  10.6 ). 
 To justify SC projects, a company needs to decide which of 
the goals listed in Table  10.1 and in Sect.  10.1 it wants to attain, 
and then decide the importance of each goal. This is done by 
assessing the potential contribution of each speciﬁ c social com-
merce project to the attainment of each goal. Note that, the 
measure of the goals and objectives is intangible, which makes 
the analysis difﬁ cult (see discussion in Sect.  10.3 ). Other chal-
lenges include the plethora of possible performance metrics 
and the quickly changing nature of social media.

10.2 
 ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY 
AND STRATEGIC PLANNING 
FOR SOCIAL COMMERCE 
 A  strategy is a framework a business sets forth indicating the 
direction it plans to take to accomplish its mission and goals. 
Strategy also outlines the plans and policies that need to be 
accomplished. According to Mintzberg et al. ( 2002 ),  strategic 
planning “is an organization’s process of deﬁ ning its strategy, 
or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources 
to pursue this strategy.…Strategy has many deﬁ nitions, but 
generally involves setting goals, determining actions to 
achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the 
actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be 
achieved by the means (resources).” In order to determine the 
direction of the organization, it is necessary to understand its 
current position and the possible avenues through which it can 
pursue a particular course of action. Generally, strategic plan-
ning is done for 3–5 years into the future. For a comprehensive 
discussion about strategy, see Porter ( 1996 ). 
 The  organizational strategy also expresses the speciﬁ c 
plans and policies, of how a business plans to take to achieve 
its strategy; these policies and plans are referred to as  tactics . 
For example, a strategy might be to use crowdsourcing for 
product improvement, whereas a tactic might be to create a 
social media page for consumers to post ideas (e.g., Dell and 
Starbucks do this, as discussed in previous chapters). It is 
important to note that objectives, strategies, and tactics can 
exist on many different levels in a company, ranging from 
high-level corporate strategic planning to a strategy of 
increasing trafﬁ c to a website. Social commerce strategies, 
including social media marketing and e-commerce strategies 
need to be aligned with the organization’s business strategy 
and implemented by appropriate departments. 
 An organizational  strategy is a comprehensive framework 
for expressing the manner in which a business plans to achieve 
its mission, what goals are needed to support it, and what plans 
and policies will be needed to accomplish these goals. Strategy 
is also about making decisions on what activities not to pursue 
and trade-offs between strategic alternatives. An organiza-
tion’s strategy (including EC and SC strategies) starts with 
understanding where the company is today with respect to its 
goals, and where it wants to be in the future. Strategies are 
often related to Porter’s competitive forces model.

and Related Strategies 
 Companies have used Porter’s competitive forces model to 
develop strategies and tactics for increasing their competi-
tive edge in their industry. The model also demonstrates how 
IT and SC can enhance competitiveness. 
 Porter’s “5 Forces” model has been used by companies to 
better compete in their industry. It also illustrates how SC 
can facilitate a company’s competitive advantage. According 
to Hanlon ( 2013 ), the “model helps marketers and business 
managers to look at the ‘balance of power’ in a market 
between different types of organizations…Porter’s Five 
Forces works best when looking at the entire market sector, 
rather than your own business and a few competitors.” 
 The model recognizes ﬁ ve major forces that may impact 
a company’s position in a given industry. Other forces, 
including the impact of government, affect all companies in 
the industry, and therefore may have a less direct impact on 
the relative success of an individual company within its 
industry. Although the details of the model differ from one 
industry to another, its general structure is universal. The ﬁ ve 
major forces are illustrated in Fig.  10.2 .
 The model recognizes the following ﬁ ve major forces that 
affect the degree of competition and, ultimately, the level of 
proﬁ tability, in an industry: 
  The strength of each force is determined by the industry’s 
composition and structure. Existing companies within an 
industry must watch these forces and need to be ready to pro-
tect themselves; alternatively, they can use the forces to 
improve their position or challenge the leaders in the industry. 
The deﬁ nitions and details of the model are provided in Porter 
( 1980 ) and Hanlon ( 2013 ). For an in-depth article on the ﬁ ve 
forces, along with a video and infographic, see Porter ( 2008 ). 
 Companies identify the forces that inﬂ uence performance 
in their marketplace and then develop a strategy to handle 
the forces. Typical generic strategies are shown in Table  10.2 .
 In Table  10.2 , we ﬁ rst list Porter’s three generic strategies 
(cost leadership, differentiation, and focus (market segmen-
tation, e.g., niche), then we add nine other strategies. Most of 
these strategies can be facilitated by social media, as shown 
throughout the book. 
 Any progressive strategy must consider the Internet. 
Porter ( 2001 ) argues that “a  coherent organizational strategy 
that includes the Internet is more important than ever before: 
Many have argued that the Internet renders strategy obso-
lete. In reality, the opposite is true… it is more important 
than ever for companies to distinguish themselves through 
strategy. The winners will be those that view the Internet as 
a complement to, not a cannibal of, traditional ways of 
competing. ” 
 1.  Threat of entry of new competitors 
 2.  Bargaining power of suppliers 
 3.  Bargaining power of customers or buyers 
 4.  Threat of substitute products or services 
 5.  Rivalry among existing ﬁ rms in the industry

 As an example, travel agencies closed because many were 
too slow to embrace Internet progress. Porter ( 2001 ) has 
identiﬁ ed several ways that the Internet affects each of the 
ﬁ ve forces of competitiveness. 
 The Impact of the Internet on Competitiveness 
 The Internet’s impact on strategic competitiveness and long- 
term proﬁ tability will differ from industry to  industry.

10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

239
Accordingly, many businesses are taking a focused look at 
the impact of the Internet and SC on their future. For these 
ﬁ rms, social commerce strategy involves the formulation 
and execution of a vision of how the company intends to do 
business electronically while deploying social commerce 
projects, such as those listed in Table  10.2 above. 
 The Key Elements of a Strategic 
Planning Process 
 According 
to 
 dummies.com/how-to/content/major-
components- of-a-strategic-plan.html , the major key ele-
ments (components) of a strategic plan include a mission 
statement, a vision statement, values statement, and strate-
gies. In addition, the key elements of a strategic plan are stra-
tegic vision; strategy (explaining the value you deliver); 
strategic plans, goals, and objectives; and strategic plan exe-
cution and evaluation. 
 Strategic planning can also be viewed as maintaining a 
viable ﬁ t between the organization’s objectives, resources, 
and its changing business environment (see Strauss and Frost 
 2014 for details). 
 The process of strategic planning will differ depending 
upon the type of strategy, the implementation method, the 
size of the ﬁ rm, and the planning tools and methodologies 
used. Nevertheless, any strategic planning process has a vari-
ation of ﬁ ve major stages, as shown in Fig.  10.3 :  initiation, 
formulation, implementation, assessment, and performance 
improvement . For a comprehensive look at the basics of stra-
tegic planning, including strategic management and the steps 
in strategic planning and management, see  planware.org/
strategicplan.htm ,  managementhelp.org/strategicplanning , 
and Chap.   13 in Turban et al. ( 2015 ).
 Strategy Implementation in Social Commerce 
 Businesses want to be sure they ﬁ nd the right social media 
strategies, tactics, and plans to achieve their goals and objec-
tives. The best place to start is with the company’s objec-
tives, as described in Sect.  10.1 . There is a continuum of 
social media goals, from broad business strategies to speciﬁ c 
brand tactics. As you may recall from Chap.   3 , the consumer 
purchasing decision process involves three steps: awareness, 
attitude, and behavior. These are called the hierarchical 
stages. Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ) developed a scale that indi-
cates which level of the hierarchy affects each goal in the 
strategy. Note that, many social media tools can facilitate 
these goals, and that an integrated marketing communication 
effort can be a very effective strategy over time. For why you 
need social media strategy, see Dragon ( 2013 ). Let us now 
explore some examples of how businesses implement SC 
strategies. 
 Examples of Successful SC Strategies 
 There are many successful cases of SC strategy implemen-
tation and many SC strategic models (e.g., see Sysomos 
 2011 ; Radian6  2012 ; and Shih  2011 ). A few examples 
follow.

process  
 
10.2 Organizational Strategy and Strategic Planning for Social Commerce

 Example 1: Groupon’s Strategy for Growth 
 Prior to its IPO debut in 2011, Groupon’s major strategy was 
revenue maximization. In order to attain this strategy, 
Groupon needed to work with as many vendors as possible 
in each target city. Their tactic was to send special teams to 
many cities (regardless of cost) to ﬁ nd qualiﬁ ed vendors and 
convince them to participate in Groupon deals. Groupon 
then used e-mail and banner ads to promote the special deals 
provided by the participating merchants. The strategy 
worked initially with respect to growth. However, the model 
was not proﬁ table for Groupon. Therefore, Groupon decided 
to use mobile applications and also have customers search 
for discounts themselves. 
 Example 2: Walmart’s Strategy for Acquiring New 
Suppliers and Products 
  On January 18, 2012, Walmart launched a contest called 
“Get on the Shelf” to let would-be suppliers pitch their prod-
ucts via YouTube videos. In general, suppliers face intense 
competition to get their products on any retailer’s shelves 
(especially Walmart’s), because in order to add a new prod-
uct, an old one must be removed or receive fewer facings 
(rows on the shelf). Consumers watched the YouTube vid-
eos, and voted for their favorite products online (similar to 
an  American Idol competition). The selected items would be 
sold at Walmart.com and the most liked brand would be sold 
at the physical stores. Walmart succeeded by using social 
media to engage customers and build customer loyalty. For 
details, see Hayes ( 2012 ). In 2011, Walmart began buying 
social media companies (e.g., privately held social media 
start-up Kosmix). See Bort ( 2012 ). Walmart ran the same 
type of contest again in 2013, and found entrepreneurs, 
whose new products are now sold at Walmart.com (see 
 getontheshelf.walmart.com ). 
 Example 3: Zynga’s Strategy for Dealing with 
Unpredictable Demand 
 When Zynga invents a new game for Facebook, they cannot 
anticipate if there will be 100 million players or only 5 mil-
lion. Zynga’s hybrid cloud strategy (Babcock  2011 ) helped 
solve this problem by allowing the company to develop ﬂ ex-
ibility and speed in their product deployment. This way, 
Zynga could adapt its capacity to the market’s fast- changing 
demands. In 2013, the company changed its business model 
to include online gambling in the UK, but decided not to 
invest money in U.S. real money online gambling, instead 
preferring to stay focused on free games (see  venturebeat.
com/2013/07/25/zynga-exec-explains-why-the- company-
is-abandoning-u-s-online-gambling ). Note: Gamers in the 
UK, but not the U.S., can now use real money to play online 
poker. It is not clear if the strategy will work. As of 2014, 
Zynga is struggling to survive.

infographic), see  digitalinformationworld.com/2014/01/
what-marketers-should-and-should-not-do-on-social- 
media-infographic.html . 
 It is important for a company to consider the following 
issues when planning a successful online SC strategy (con-
densed from  GoECart.com  2010  and updated with the 
authors’ experiences). 
 Monaco ( 2013 ) provides a comprehensive guide to social 
media strategy. Additional suggestions on how a company 
can develop a business-aligned social media and social net-
working strategy are provided at  ddmcd.com/managing- 
technology/how-to-develop-a-business-aligned-social-media-
social- networ.html . For the needs and beneﬁ ts of a social 
CRM strategy, see Ang ( 2011 ). 
  A Strategy for Successful SC Implementation 
 To succeed in the implementation of social commerce proj-
ects, especially in medium and large companies, a process 
needs to be properly planned with a deployment strategy. A 
popular strategy involves four steps:
 1.  Learn and understand the environment inside and outside 
the organization. 
•  Develop an overall e-commerce strategy with 
clearly deﬁ ned business goals. 
•  Show how SC strategy contributes to the 
e- commerce and overall sales revenue strategy. 
•  Identify the audiences you want to reach. 
•  Identify the resources available for SC. 
•  Decide on appropriate technologies to use. 
•  Create supportive social culture in the business. 
•  Effectively market to existing online customers 
with the support of social media.  
•  Know how to sell globally as well as locally (if it is 
cost effective to ship internationally).  
•  Develop consistent and synchronous online and 
ofﬂ ine brand strategies (“multichannel” strategies). 
•  Create a corporate business proﬁ le and invite cus-
tomers to post reviews on public and private social 
networks. 
•  Create surveys and two-way communication mech-
anisms to solicit feedback from customers.  
•  Develop monitoring and performance assessment 
plans.

 2.  Experiment with a small-scale project so you can observe 
and learn. 
 3.  Assess the results of the experiment. 
 4.  Develop or abandon the project. 
 Gombert ( 2010 ) proposed similar steps: evaluate oppor-
tunities, prepare a plan, engage your audience, and measure 
results. 
  Some Other Strategy Issues 
 There are several strategic issues that companies may need 
to address when dealing with social commerce. Here are 
some relevant questions related to these issues. 
 Some Policies and Guidelines 
 Dozens of experts provide answers to the previous list of 
questions, as well as to similar strategy questions; they also 
provide guidelines for success in speciﬁ c areas of social 
commerce (e.g., marketing, security, policy). Several exam-
ples can be found in Barnes and Barnes ( 2009 ). For 57 differ-
ent social media policies and resources, see  socialmediatoday.

strategy, see Berthon et al. ( 2012 ). 
10.3 
 JUSTIFICATION AND ROI IN SOCIAL 
COMMERCE 
 Justiﬁ cation of social commerce is a multidimensional task. 
While many people stress the ﬁ nancial justiﬁ cation (ROI and 
other methods), one also needs to check the technical justiﬁ -
cation (and feasibility), the organizational ﬁ t to social media 
(e.g., appropriate organizational culture), operational justiﬁ -
cation, and strategic justiﬁ cation. 
 An Overview of Justiﬁ cation 
 Justiﬁ cation of social commerce projects can be very 
complex. 
 To illustrate the potential complexity of justiﬁ cation, 
Brian Solis developed the concept of the  social marketing 
compass , which includes a large number of interrelated vari-
ables. (See  briansolis.com/2011/01/the-social-compass-is-
the- gps-for-the-adaptive-business , which includes an 
infographic and explanation of the four “halos” of the social 
compass.) 
 To begin with, several areas need to be considered: strate-
gic considerations, technical considerations, and operational 
considerations. One also needs to manage intangible costs 
and beneﬁ ts. On top of that, there are other difﬁ culties in 
executing justiﬁ cations. 
 One important aspect of justiﬁ cation is calculating the 
rate of return of investments (ROI). For a discussion on how 
to measure ROI in social commerce, see Blanchard ( 2011 ) 
and Sysomos ( 2011 ). 
 The total cost of SC projects (initial and operations) can 
be very high due to staff time and cost of potential risks 
(e.g., very negative social interactions; for example, con-
versations on social networks). Therefore, it is wise to jus-
tify such systems, including the risks. The methodologies 
available for justiﬁ cation are the same as for any other EC 
systems and information technology projects. For method-
ologies and related issues, see Turban et al. ( 2015 ). In this 
section, we cover only the selected topics that are most 
 relevant to social commerce. Speciﬁ cally, we cover the 
 following topics:
•  The justiﬁ cation process 
•  Some difﬁ culties in conducting justiﬁ cation 
•  Dealing with intangible costs 
•  The use of Gartner’s hype cycle 
•  Risk analysis 
•  Which channel is better for social commerce: 
Facebook, Twitter, or others? (See  blog.thelettertwo.
com/2014/08/12/62-of-consumers-prefer-
facebook- over-pinterest-twitter-as-their-social- 
commerce-channel .) 
•  Which social commerce platform drives the most 
sales? 
(See 
 shopify.com/infographics/social- 
commerce; with infographics.) 
•  How do you select a social network site(s) for paid 
media tactics, or in sales? 
•  How do you generate constant trafﬁ c to your SC 
site? (For 39 actionable ways to drive trafﬁ c to your 
website

10.3 Justiﬁ cation and ROI in Social Commerce

242
 The SC Justiﬁ cation Process 
 Justifying large-scale investments involves not only  selecting 
a justiﬁ cation method but also having a plan to execute it. 
The appropriate process is not simple. According to  Baseline 
( 2006 ) and the authors’ experiences, the major steps of this 
process are: 
 The justiﬁ cation process involves the comparison of costs 
and beneﬁ ts in a process called  cost–beneﬁ t analysis . 
 Difﬁ culties in Conducting Cost–Beneﬁ t 
Analysis and Justiﬁ cation 
 The execution of cost–beneﬁ t analysis for social commerce 
projects can be difﬁ cult due to the following obstacles. 
 Difﬁ culties in Measuring Productivity 
and Performance Gains 
 The beneﬁ ts in cost-beneﬁ t analysis are more difﬁ cult to 
measure and assess than costs. See 14 formulas to measure 
beneﬁ ts as suggested by Schottmuller ( 2013 ), and the con-
siderations companies face with the cost of social media in 
Nair ( 2011 ). 
 One of the major beneﬁ ts of using SC is increased pro-
ductivity, such as with an enterprise social network. However, 
productivity increases may be difﬁ cult to measure, for sev-
eral reasons. The major reasons are presented next: 
 Data and Analysis Issues 
 Data, or the analysis of the data, may hide productivity gains. 
For example, retailers now use SC to engage customers in 
proposing and evaluating new products. Knowing what cus-
tomers think may result in a beneﬁ t for the retailers. However, 
retailers must determine how to measure engagement in 
order to determine its value.  
 SC Productivity Gains in One Area May Be Offset by 
Losses in Other Areas 
 Another possible difﬁ culty is that SC gains in certain areas 
of the company may be offset by resultant losses in other 
areas. For example, a staff member may spend time respond-
ing to social media conversations and neglect the creation of 
new ofﬂ ine marketing communications. 
 Hidden Costs and Beneﬁ ts 
 Some costs and beneﬁ ts are less visible, or even completely 
hidden. These need to be determined and considered. 
Examples of hidden costs or beneﬁ ts include currency ﬂ uc-
tuations; the need to upgrade software over time; and the 
cost of underestimation or overestimation of beneﬁ ts (such 
as increased brand awareness). 
 Incorrectly Deﬁ ning What Is Measured 
 The results of any investment justiﬁ cation depend on what is 
actually measured. For example, to assess the beneﬁ ts of SC 
investment, one should usually look at productivity improve-
ment in the area where the SC project was deployed (e.g., in 
customer care). However, productivity increase may also 
result from other factors (e.g., due to a large investment in 
non-SC projects). 
 Intangible Cost-Beneﬁ t Analysis 
 Broadly speaking, SC costs and beneﬁ ts can be classiﬁ ed 
into two categories: tangible and intangible.  Tangible costs 
and beneﬁ ts are easier to measure. For example, the cost of 
software (cost) and the amount of labor saved (beneﬁ t) are 
easy to determine.  Intangible beneﬁ ts, such as customer sat-
isfaction, improved communication (e.g., by using Twitter), 
or increased word of mouth, are usually more difﬁ cult to 
measure; thus, it is difﬁ cult to determine their value. 
Therefore, some experts believe that one should not attempt 
to conduct an ROI study on social media projects (e.g., see 
Falls and Deckers  2012 ). This may be correct when the SC 
projects are small; however, in large projects, not conducting 
ROI may have negative consequences. 
 First, let us see what the intangibles are, and then see how 
companies can handle them. 
 1.  Establish an appropriate foundation for analysis 
with the software vendor (if you use software), and 
then conduct your ROI analysis.  
 2.  Conduct good research on the relevant metrics and 
validate them. 
 3.  Justify and document the cost and beneﬁ t and the 
assumptions made regarding data.  
 4.  Document and verify all data used in the calcula-
tions. Clarify all assumptions used in the analysis.  
 5.  Do not leave out intangible beneﬁ ts, including 
long-term ones. Is the project really improving the 
company’s competitive and strategic advantages? 
 6.  Be careful not to underestimate cost and overesti-
mate beneﬁ ts (a tendency of many managers). 
 7.  Make supporting ﬁ gures as realistic as possible and 
include risk analysis. 
 8.  Involve top management and all important partners, 
including suppliers and distribution channel 
members. 
10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

243
 Intangible Costs and Beneﬁ ts 
 Organizations must develop innovative metrics to track 
down  intangible costs and beneﬁ ts as accurately as possible. 
Intangible costs may include some vague costs; for example, 
the learning curve of the ﬁ rm’s customer service employees 
as they attempt to incorporate an SC system that responds to 
customer inquiries. Another intangible cost may involve 
having to adapt to changes in certain business processes, 
such as processing items returned by customers or operating 
a tracking system for customer complaints.  
 Handling Intangible Beneﬁ ts 
 The ﬁ rst step in dealing with intangible beneﬁ ts is to deﬁ ne 
them and, if possible, specify how they are going to be 
measured. 
 A straightforward way to deal with intangible beneﬁ ts is 
to make  rough estimates of their monetary values and then 
conduct an ROI analysis. The simplicity of this approach is 
attractive; however, in many cases, the simpliﬁ cation 
assumptions used in these estimates may lead to completely 
incorrect results. Another way to deal with intangible bene-
ﬁ ts is to develop a balanced scorecard (Sect.  10.5 ) for pro-
posed projects. This approach requires listing both tangible 
and intangible goals and their measures. For an example of 
how this works, see Person ( 2013 ). 
 The Use of Gartner’s Hype Cycle 
 An important technology that can help in justifying SC proj-
ects is Gartner’s Hype Cycle (updated annually). 
 Organizations can use this approach to assess the status of 
speciﬁ c SC technologies and tools so they can decide the fate 
of an SC project before they invest effort and money in cost–
beneﬁ t analysis and justiﬁ cation. 
 What Is Gartner’s Hype Cycle? 
 According to Gartner, Inc., the  hype cycle is a graphic repre-
sentation of the maturity, adoption, and social application of 
speciﬁ c IT and SC tools and how they are potentially rele-
vant to solving real business problems and exploiting new 
opportunities. The term, developed and used by Gartner Inc., 
is a similar concept to the marketer’s “product life cycle” 
curve (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). The hype 
cycle provides a snapshot of the relative maturity of different 
categories of IT technologies and management-related disci-
plines. It highlights over-hyped areas versus high impact 
matured technologies, and provides estimates of how long 
technologies and trends will take to mature. The Gartner 
Hype Cycle’s methodology shows how a technology or 
application will evolve over time. There are many different 
categories of Gartner hype cycles; each are customized to ﬁ t 
certain industries and technologies; research notes are 
updated each year (see  Gartner, Inc. undated ). 
 Each hype cycle has ﬁ ve overlapping stages that reﬂ ect 
the technology’s life cycle, starting with a trigger point, 
through implementation of technology, and then enduring 
disillusionment, before ﬁ nally becoming more mainstream 
and accepted. The ﬁ ve stages (as compiled from Gartner Inc. 
( undated ) and  whatis.techtarget.com/deﬁ nition/Gartner-
hype- cycle  are: 
 1.  Technology trigger. The cycle begins with a break-
through, public demonstration, product launch, or 
other event that generates signiﬁ cant media and 
industry interest. 
 2.  Peak of inﬂ ated expectations. A phase of over 
enthusiasm and unrealistic projections during 
which a ﬂ urry of publicized activity by technology 
and media leaders may result in some successes, 
but will more likely result in failures as the technol-
ogy is pushed to its limits. The only businesses that 
may make money at this stage are conference orga-
nizers, consultants, and magazine publishers. Early 
publicity results can be seen in success stories and 
some failures (early adopters). 
 3.  Trough of disillusionment. The point at which the 
technology becomes unfashionable and the media 
abandons the topic because the technology did not 
live up to its inﬂ ated expectations. 
 4.  Slope of enlightenment. Focused experimentation 
and solid hard work by an increasingly diverse 
range of organizations lead to a true understanding 
of the technology’s applicability, risks, and bene-
ﬁ ts. Commercial off-the-shelf software methodol-
ogies and tools become available to ease the 
development process. Understanding how the 
technology works and how it can beneﬁ t the enter-
prise as the technology becomes more widely 
understood.   
 5.  Plateau of productivity. The real-world beneﬁ ts of 
the technology are demonstrated and accepted. 
Tools and methodologies are increasingly stable as 
they enter their seconds and third generation. The 
ﬁ nal height of the plateau varies according to 
whether the technology is broadly applicable or 
beneﬁ ts only a niche market. This is the beginning 
of mainstream adoption, success of broad market 
applicability, and recognizable relevance. 
10.3 Justiﬁ cation and ROI in Social Commerce

244
 In addition, the time needed for each technology to reach 
mainstream adoption (maturity) is indicated on the curve. 
For example, in July 2011, Gartner estimated that it would 
take social analytics 2–5 years to reach the mainstream adop-
tion. For details on how several social commerce tools are 
placed on the hype cycle, see Hodgson ( 2012 ). 
 Application of the Hype Cycle 
 Gartner Inc. provides an annual report that covers about 80 
different hype cycles, evaluating over 2,000 different tech-
nologies, services, and trends in over 119 industries. For the 
2014 summary, see  gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918 . Of 
course, Gartner charges high fees for providing their reports, 
which include technology trends. The 2013 and 2014 reports 
cover several SC technologies such as social CRM, microb-
logging, social analytics, virtual worlds, location-based 
applications, and collective intelligence. 
 The 2014 cycle for emerging technologies is described in 
detail at  gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918 . The Pew 
Research Center provides an interesting discussion about 
several emerging SC and EC technologies in 2014. They also 
provide an image of the hype cycle of emerging technologies 
in July 2014. See  pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/15/
chart-of-the-week-the-hype-cycle-of-emerging- 
technologies  . 
 The Social Business Power Map 
 This map, created by Dachis Group, is similar to the hype 
cycle, but it is completely dedicated to social media and 
commerce. Dachis Group deﬁ nes social business “as the 
distinct process of applying social media to meet business 
objectives.” The map shows the major social media trends 
from the buzz stage to experimentation, adoption, and 
maturity. 
For 
details, 
see 
 stephenslighthouse.
com/2010/08/17/the-2010-social-business-landscape . In 
2011, the company launched its  social business index . In 
February 2014, Dachis Group was acquired by Sprinklr, a 
social media analytics ﬁ rm.  
 Risk Analysis 
 Deploying social commerce may involve some potential 
risks and possibly complex implementation issues. In justi-
fying social commerce projects, one must pay attention to 
the risk issues related to companies engaged in social com-
merce activities, as well as to individuals who participate in 
them. For further discussion, see Thompson et al. ( 2013 ) and 
corresponding summary/infographic at  grantthornton.com/
issues/library/survey-reports/advisory/2013/BAS-social- 
media-survey.aspx , and Shullich ( 2012 ). 
 The following are representative issues frequently cited 
by companies: 
 Risk to Users 
 In addition to risks to the company, there are some possible 
risks to users, mostly in the areas of fraud and privacy viola-
tion. As a result, some users abandon social networks or refrain 
from their use. For a discussion, see della Cava ( 2010 ). For an 
overview of personal risk and how people can protect them-
selves, see  netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial2/a/
socialpredators.htm and Alter ( 2014 ).  
 Conclusion 
 Because of the difﬁ culties cited earlier, many companies do 
not measure the value of SC projects. However, this may be 
a risky approach, since bad projects may be accepted and 
good ones may be rejected. 
 Despite all the difﬁ culties, there are many reported ROI 
studies for successful SC applications. For a list of 166 such 
cases, see Petersen ( 2012 ) and the corresponding 2014 sum-
mary at  barnraisersllc.com/2014/04/166-case-studies- prove-
social-media-roi . For an infographic on social media ROI, see 
Bennett ( 2013 ). In addition, many companies and vendors 
have developed their own ROI methods and calculators. 
Furthermore, several methodologies for e-commerce are suit-
able for SC justiﬁ cation. To learn more, see Owen ( 2013 ). See 
also ShopSocially’s new A/B Testing Framework, and how it 
helps e-commerce sites, at  digitaljournal.com/pr/1661430 .

 MARKET RESEARCH IN SOCIAL 
COMMERCE 
 Market research  involves data collection and analysis of 
information about consumers and competitors, the results 
of which are turned into marketing knowledge. Businesses 
 usually hire a market research company to conduct their 
research, but some businesses do it on their own (per 
 sbinfocanada.about.com/od/marketing/g/market-
research.htm ). 
 Why Conduct Market Research? 
 Market research is conducted to understand an organization’s 
markets in order to serve them better than the competition 
does. Accurate information about consumers and competitors 
is essential for the development of a successful marketing 
plan. According to   sbinfocanada.about.com/od/marketing/
g/marketresearch.htm  , “market research allows businesses 
to make decisions that make them more responsive to cus-
tomers’ needs and increase proﬁ ts.” It is important for both 
start-ups and established businesses to conduct market 
research. “Small business owners use market research to 
determine the feasibility of a new business, test interest in 
new products or services, improve aspects of their businesses, 
such as customer service or distribution channels, and develop 
competitive strategies” (per  sbinfocanada.about.com/od/
marketing/g/marketresearch.htm ). One major purpose of 
market research is to provide information for decision mak-
ing and strategy formulation as part of a business plan and 
justiﬁ cation. Market research is also conducted to help facili-
tate competitive intelligence (see Sect.  10.7 ). Another reason 
it is used is for justifying requests for funding for marketing 
plans, such as new product introductions, as well as for other 
purposes. Market research can be done ofﬂ ine and/or online. 
In this book, we mostly cover topics associated with online 
social commerce as related to the generic topic of Internet 
research. Market research can identify problems and opportu-
nities. For example, see Redsicker ( 2013 ). 
 Social commerce provides superb opportunities to con-
duct market research. In addition, it is necessary to conduct 
research on social commerce itself to identify viable SC 
strategies and tactics. Much of this research is done in social 
networks and/or by using social software. 
 Factors such as a person’s age, gender, and which web-
sites they use to engage in social networking provide a new 
opportunity to assess markets, sometimes even in real time. 
One major area is viral marketing (see Chap.   3 ). 
 E-Marketing Research in Brief 
 Social commerce, as described in Chap.   1 , has its roots in 
e-commerce and e-marketing. Therefore, conducting market 
research in social commerce includes methods and processes 
from these two disciplines. 
 The Major Generic Topics 
 The following topics are frequently described as being 
related to Internet-based generic market research: 
 For comprehensive coverage of these and e-marketing 
research in general, see Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ). For 
e- commerce market research, see Chap.   9  in Turban et al. 
( 2015 ). Both books provide additional resources. 
 For general related information, see Poynter ( 2011 ), 
MarketingSherpa ( marketingsherpa.com ), and Barker et al. 
( 2011 ). For research in the B2B arena, see Gillin and 
Schwartzman ( 2011 ). 
 Using Social Networking for Qualitative 
Market Research 
 Merchants can easily ﬁ nd customers on social networks and 
sometimes even see what they are doing online, as well as 
gather information about their customers’ friends. However, 
it may not be easy to conduct social-oriented market research. 
An unsolicited message that requests the page owner to fol-
low a link to a survey or comment on a brand will likely be 
ignored unless it comes from someone the user knows. In 
this section, we discuss  qualitative market research in social 
media, as opposed to  quantitative survey research. 
 Example: Mountain Dew 
 In the past, Mountain Dew’s strategy was to target video 
game lovers and extreme sports enthusiasts, as these indi-
viduals tend to drink high-caffeine beverages. However, 
because the company wanted to unite all of its customers 
•  Data sources and data collection methods 
•  Data and information quality 
•  Learning from (listening to) customers 
•  Internet social search methodologies and tools 
•  Support for competitive intelligence 
•  Internet-based research approaches and methods 
•  Ethics of online research 
•  Marketing databases, data and text mining, and data 
warehouses 
•  Legal issues and protection of privacy 
10.4 Market Research in Social Commerce

246
into one community, Mountain Dew used several 
“Dewmocracy” contests, which encouraged consumers to 
choose their next soda ﬂ avor. This market research (described 
next) was conducted for product development purposes. 
 Although several other food and beverage companies 
have also used social networks to help choose new product 
ﬂ avors, Mountain Dew did this ﬁ rst by using their most dedi-
cated customers, and then expanding to the public. The ﬁ rst 
step was to send seven ﬂ avors of soda to 50 Dew fanatics. 
These people were given cameras and asked to make a video 
of themselves debating the ﬂ avors and showing their love for 
each ﬂ avor. Having consumers create videos, was, according 
to Hespos ( 2010 ), “a great idea because they made the social- 
media effort more personable. Rather than just looking at 
static images or Tweets, Dew fans could see like-minded 
fanatics in action. One young man proved his allegiance by 
brushing his teeth with the soda. After narrowing the seven 
ﬂ avors to three, Mountain Dew turned to its Dew Labs 
Community, a 4,000-person group of passionate soda fans. 
Those fans then created nearly every element of the three 
sodas, including color, name, packaging, and marketing 
campaigns [an example of crowdsourcing at its best!]. After 
that process was complete, the three ﬂ avors were made avail-
able in stores for a limited time, with the general public 
selecting a winner via online voting” (emphasis added). 
 According to Hespos ( 2010 ), Mountain Dew’s SC market-
ing campaign was different from those at Starbucks and Dell. 
“Where these two brands set up sites soliciting ideas from all 
consumers, Dew began its promotion by reaching out to its 
most dedicated, loyal consumers ofﬂ ine, and then gave that 
ofﬂ ine community a place to assemble its testimonials and 
feedback. The Dewmocracy campaign used Facebook, 
Twitter, and YouTube just like the other campaigns used these 
social networks to unite consumers through a common inter-
est.” The Dewmocracy campaign, like other brands, also used 
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to unite consumers through 
a common interest. For further details, see Hespos ( 2010 ). 
 According to Mountain Dew’s marketing director, the 
campaign helped to increase the company’s social media 
presence (e.g., an 800,000 increase in Facebook fans from 
the time they started the campaign), and allowed customers 
to express themselves about the ﬂ avors and feel like they 
were being heard. The campaigns also generated word-of- 
mouth buzz and enthusiasm about the brand. (See  adweek.
com/news/advertising-branding/what-mountain-dew-
learned-dewmocracy-107534 .) 
 The Process of Conducting Qualitative 
Market Research for Social Commerce 
 There are several ways of conducting SC market research, 
depending upon a company’s products, research budget, 
and research objective. A company may hire a consultant 
(e.g., Bazaarvoice.com); alternatively, it may join a market 
research discussion group on LinkedIn and share ideas and 
best practices, expand their network, research and analyze, 
and more. Market research is an essential element of the 
strategy needed for success in social commerce. Decker 
( 2010 ) and Shih ( 2011 ) recommend that marketers go 
through the following seven-step process: 
 For additional information, see Rekenthaler ( 2013 ). 
 Learning from Customers: Conversational 
Marketing 
 Learning from customers is a major goal of market research. 
Long before the Internet and the Web, companies collected 
information  from customers and  about customers, and stored 
it in customer databases. They would use the information to 
develop marketing communication strategies, and help 
designers improve product design and customer service. The 
Internet has provided new opportunities to improve this pro-
cess by providing both methods and tools. 
 Companies are starting to utilize Web 2.0 tools to get 
feedback from customers. This process is referred to as  con-
versational marketing, learning from customers, or the 
 voice of customers (VOC) . In social commerce, customers 
 1.  Select social platforms (social networking pages, 
blogs, forums, etc.) to give people a place online to 
discuss your products or services. 
 2.  “Let these conversations unfold, but also encourage 
participation through promotions, contests, ratings 
and reviews, user-generated content (photo and 
video) uploads, and whatever else drives social 
interaction.” (Decker  2010 ) 
 3.  “Analyze the conversations to ﬁ nd out what people 
are saying and why, to spot trends, and to ﬁ nd out 
exactly what customers want” (see Sect.  10.6 ). 
(Decker  2010 ) 
 4.  “Deliver products, services, and promotions that 
meet these wants and needs.” (Decker  2010 ) 
 5.  “Continue to get customer feedback, and integrate 
these ﬁ ndings with sophisticated analytics and mar-
keting measurement tools to calculate the exact 
return on investment of social [networking] pro-
grams” (emphasis added). (Decker  2010 ) 
 6.  Use  conversational marketing as a source for mar-
ket research. How are consumer conversations and 
other user-generated content analyzed? 
 7.  Find opportunities for conducting social-based 
market research. 
10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

247
supply feedback and information via blogs (e.g., see 
 bloombergmarketing.blogs.com/Bloomberg_market-
ing ), wikis, Twitter, online forums, chat rooms, and social 
networking sites (e.g., Facebook). For an illustrative video, 
go to  vimeo.com/81504169 . 
 Companies are ﬁ nding that using social media tools to 
learn from customers fosters closer customer-vendor rela-
tionships. For example, Macy’s Inc. quickly removed a 
metal toothbrush holder from its product line after the 
product was criticized on several social media channels. 
Dell and Starbucks allow customers to suggest and vote on 
improvements to their products. In general, what compa-
nies are learning from the customers on social networks is 
frequently less expensive and yields quicker and possibly 
better results than the company might learn from using 
focus groups. 
 With  enterprise feedback management , companies are 
interested not only in collecting information, but also in 
 facilitating the interaction between customers and companies. 
 Illustrative Examples 
 Many methods and software products can be used to “listen” 
to customers. The following are a few examples illustrating 
how this is done. 
 Example 1: Cookshack 
 Barbecue company Cookshack Inc., according to their 
Barbecue Forum ( forum.cookshack.com/groupee ; archived), 
“invites customers to ask and answer questions about barbe-
cue sauces, beef smokers, barbecue ovens, and cooking tech-
niques. The community helps (Cookshack) save money by 
freeing up customer service personnel who used to answer 
such questions by phone or e-mail. The community also fos-
ters customer loyalty.”  
 Example 2: Del Monte 
 See the opening case to this chapter. 
 Methods for Listening to Social Customers 
 Several methods are available for listening to customers. 
Some are the same or similar to those described in Sect.  10.5 . 
However, in traditional market research, companies usually 
listen to customers during a short time period for a well- 
deﬁ ned purpose, whereas in social commerce, it is a routine 
and frequent listening. Representative examples of listening 
methods to customers are: 
 For further discussion, see Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ). 
 Conducting Market Research Using the Major 
Social Network Sites 
 Market research can be conducted by using public social 
network sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), in situations 
where social software tools are deployed, in social enter-
prises, and in social presentation sites such as YouTube, 
Pinterest, and Flickr. For using social media for market 
research in general, see Nelson ( 2013 ). Here are a few rep-
resentative examples. 
•  Polling . People like to vote (e.g.,  American Idol ) 
and express their preferences (see the Netﬂ ix case 
in Chap.   3 ). They provide opinions on products, 
services, and so forth. Voting is also popular on 
social networks. 
•  Blogging . Bloggers can raise issues or induce oth-
ers to express opinions.  
•  Chatting . Community members love to chat in 
public chat rooms. By following the discussions, 
you can collect current data. 
•  Live chat . Here, you can collect interactive data 
from customers in real time. 
•  Chatterbots . These can be partially interactive, but 
quick and inexpensive. Through them, you can ana-
lyze logs of communication. In certain cases, peo-
ple are more honest when they chat with an avatar 
than talking to a human.  
•  Discussion forums . People that have a common 
interest join a social media subgroup and use a 
 discussion forum to socialize and exchange 
opinions. 
•  Collective wisdom (intelligence) . This is a kind of 
community brainstorming. Researchers can ﬁ nd out 
what people are debating, agreeing on, or disagree-
ing with while working jointly on tasks.  
•  Find expertise . Expertise frequently is found via 
Web 2.0 technologies, many times for free (e.g., the 
“help forum” on LinkedIn).  
•  Folksonomy . This is a user-generated system of 
organizing information by social tagging, therefore 
making data easier to ﬁ nd and access. 
•  Data in videos, photos, and other rich media . 
Places where these media are shared contribute to 
valuable data collection. 
10.4 Market Research in Social Commerce

248
 Using Facebook for Market Research 
 Facebook is enabling an increasing number of social com-
merce activities. Here are some relevant suggestions for mer-
chants conducting market research on Facebook: 
 Note that such an approach must be executed carefully by 
someone who knows how to do market research; otherwise, 
you will get a very low response rate. 
 Example: Conducting Surveys 
 SurveyMonkey ( surveymonkey.com ) provides software for 
posting surveys on Facebook or other Web pages. With 
SurveyMonkey, businesses can easily share surveys on their 
personal pages with SurveyMonkey’s Facebook Collector, 
or post a survey questionnaire directly on their fan page with 
their Web Link Collector. For more information, see 
 surveymonkey.com/mp/facebook .  
 Facebook offers an application called Surveys for 
Facebook (see  facebook.com/simple.surveys ), making it easy 
for businesses to create and share surveys on their Facebook 
page. For more information, see  facebooksurvey.net . 
 Example: Brown Automotive Group 
 Brown Automotive Group (BAG) wanted to identify brand 
advocates among its fans on Facebook and make it easy for 
them to share their experiences with others. In other words, 
BAG used WOM to inﬂ uence people’s car purchasing deci-
sions. The fans were invited to connect with BAG by com-
pleting an online survey. Based on this, the company 
identiﬁ ed those fans who were highly satisﬁ ed with BAG. 
(Customers who were not satisﬁ ed were contacted by BAG 
for problem resolution.) BAG contacted the friends of the 
satisﬁ ed friends, directing them to the BAG website to 
see both special deals as well as customer recommenda-
tions. This provided the company with immediate feedback. 
To read the case study, see  empathica.com/wp-content/
uploads/2011/10/Empathica-Browns-Jeep- Chrysler-
Dodge-Case-Study.pdf .  
 For additional information about conducting marketing 
research on Facebook, see Silvestre ( 2012 ) and Pehrson ( 2013 ). 
 Using Twitter for Market Research 
 By using Twitter, it is easy to stay instantly updated on many 
relevant topics. Just follow @marketresearch or  twitter.
com/MarketResearch . The fact that millions of business-
oriented people and customers are using Twitter makes it a 
valuable monitoring tool. Following tweets is a great poten-
tial source of new ideas and resources. Here are a few exam-
ples of using Twitter for market research (per Harrison  2009 ) 
and the authors’ experiences: 
 Example: Customer Feedback Using Twitter 
 An increasing number of companies utilize Twitter to solicit 
information from customers and interact with them. Several 
examples can be found at  mashable.com/guidebook/twit-
ter . For how to advertise on Twitter using their tools, see 
 business.twitter.com/basics . To read the success stories of 
companies who used Twitter to promote their businesses, see 
 business.twitter.com/success-stories . 
•  Visit  search.twitter.com and enter a company’s 
Twitter name. Not only can you monitor what com-
panies are saying on Twitter, you can also legally 
follow what is said to or about these companies and 
what are the replies . All this can help competitive 
intelligence and strategy. 
•  Take advantage of the tools that enable you to ﬁ nd 
people in the industries where your company oper-
ates (target industries). Use  search.twitter.com to 
monitor industry-speciﬁ c key words. In addition, 
check out  twellow.com , which automatically cate-
gorizes a Twitter user into 1–3 industries based on 
their bio and tweets, and allows users to categorize 
themselves manually. 
•  To monitor your Twitter account, go to  tweetstats.
com . It will provide you with statistical charts 
showing information such as how many tweets you 
received during a certain time frame (e.g., day) and 
whose posts you retweeted. For an example, see 
 searchenginewatch.com/article/2327748/5-
Brilliant-Ways-to-Use- Hashtags-in-Social-
Media-Marketing . 
•  Get feedback from your Facebook fans (and their 
friends, if possible) on any promotional campaign, 
improvement in the product/process, and so on.  
•  Test market messages: Provide two or three options 
and ask fans which one they prefer and why. Do not 
forget to tell the fans that you love their contribu-
tions. Alternatively, see which messages get the 
highest click-through rate.  
•  Use Facebook to recruit users to participate in a sur-
vey. Facebook also allows companies to target their 
audience speciﬁ cally, based on traditional segmen-
tation variables (e.g., age, gender, etc.). 
10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

249
 For effective ways to use Twitter for market research, see 
Washington ( 2013 ). 
 Using LinkedIn for Market Research 
 There are many ways one can use LinkedIn for market 
research. One way is to post a question in the “help center” 
(e.g., solicit advice) regarding the topic in which you are 
interested. You may get better results if you go to a speciﬁ c 
LinkedIn group. Another source for research is the informa-
tion that people and organizations provide on LinkedIn about 
themselves. For a slideshow about using LinkedIn for mar-
ket research, see Outloutl ( 2013 ). For a comprehensive list of 
LinkedIn discussion groups related to market research, go to 
 quirks.com/resources/market_research_linkedin.aspx . 
 Using Virtual Worlds for Conducting Market Research 
 Using virtual worlds for market research gives researchers a 
clue about new products or services. This can provide com-
panies with a competitive edge. 
 Several companies are conducting market research on 
Seconds Life by presenting a 3-D plan of a product or project 
they want to test. 
 Example: Market Research and Product/Service 
Design 
 Starwood Hotels constructed a prototype of the new Aloft 
brand hotels before they appeared in the real world. The 
company purchased two islands on Seconds Life: Aloft, for 
the hotel prototype, and Argali, where visitors can view the 
development project. Working from a preliminary architec-
tural sketch, the designers started the process by roughing 
out the hotel’s layout, furnishings, and textures. These were 
then reﬁ ned in response to feedback from the brick-and- 
mortar architects and from Seconds Life visitors who were 
invited to assess and critique the design and layout. The 
company actually built the hotel after implementing the 
feedback from the Seconds Life residents. 
 Competitive Surveillance in Social Media 
 When companies use the previously mentioned techniques 
to test new products, competitors also see what the company 
is planning. This is good input for competitive analysis. 
Companies can also search  brandtags.com  to identify com-
petitive brand images based on descriptive words entered by 
users. In addition, organizations often review comments and 
how many “Likes” on their competitors’ social networks. 
Other good sources to ﬁ nd information about the competi-
tion include Google keyword searches for company and 
executive names, brands, and marketing communication 
campaign tag lines. Company researchers can follow these 
links to social media sites. Finally, organizations can search 
 allfacebook.com/tag/statistics to ﬁ nd demographics, num-
ber of visitors, and many other statistics for millions of 
Facebook fan pages. These are just a few examples; there are 
many other ways to use social media for competitive analy-
sis as well (e.g.,  uniﬁ edsocial.com ). However, it is impor-
tant for organizations to realize that while they can test 
marketing strategies and use competitive surveillance in 
social media, they are also being watched. For six free ana-
lytics tools to help you understand your competitor’s Web

Understand- Your-Competitor-s-Web-Trafﬁ c . 
10.5 
 METRICS AND MONITORING 
PERFORMANCE 
 The next step in the strategy-performance cycle is to monitor 
performance and compare it to target objectives. These tar-
gets are usually expressed in measurable quantities, such as 
increasing the number of Facebook fans by a certain percent-
age, and they usually appear as metrics. 
 Performance Monitoring and Analysis Cycle 
 In order to exploit the huge volume of information generated 
by social media, companies use a process referred to as 
 social media intelligence (see the following discussion), 
because it is similar to business intelligence (see Sharda 
et al.  2014 ). The social media intelligence process is illus-
trated in Fig.  10.4 . For the difference between social media 
monitoring and social intelligence, see  socialbusinessnews.
com/listening-look-social-monitoring-vs-social-intelligence .
   As shown in the ﬁ gure, the process starts by identifying 
the social media activities that generate the data and infor-
mation to be studied. Next, a monitoring system is employed 
to ﬁ nd out what is happening. Several methods and tools 
exist for this purpose. The monitoring results in various 
kinds of social data, from text to numbers, can be processed 
and shown to management via reports and/or dashboards. 
Many times, however, the collected data need to go through 
social media analysis techniques (Sect.  10.6 ), where they 
are compared to the target metrics, and analyzed, sometimes 
with the help of scorecards. A special type of analysis is 
 sentiment analysis  (positive or negative conversations, see 
Sect.  10.6 ), which automates the identiﬁ cation and interpre-
tation of subjective information. The results of the analysis 
10.5 Metrics and Monitoring Performance

250
are presented to management via dashboard (Sect.  10.6 ) and 
notiﬁ cation mechanisms, so management can develop 
 strategies and make decisions. For tools for supporting this 
cycle, see Dyer ( 2013 ). 
 Social Media Intelligence 
 According to psychologist Nicholas Humphrey,  social intel-
ligence refers to the capacity of people “to use very large 
brains to effectively navigate and negotiate complex social 
relationships and environments” (per  socialintelligencelab.
com/social-intelligence ). The related  social media intelli-
gence has many deﬁ nitions. It is generally referred to as the 
monitoring and collection of online opinions and other social 
data (such as conversations or reviews) used for guiding cor-
porate decisions and (private and public) actions. For details, 
see Moe and Schweidel ( 2014 ). The process of using social 
media intelligence is more than just collecting and analyzing 
social interactions; it also focuses on the ability to ﬁ nd hid-
den values in the social interactions (and then take appropri-
ate actions based on the ﬁ ndings). Social media intelligence 
includes tools that companies use to monitor, collect, aggre-
gate, and analyze social data. For information on how to 
implement social media intelligence, see Harrysson et al. 
( 2012 ). For a white paper discussing nine insights that drive 
business sales, see Bazaarvoice ( 2013 ). 
 The remainder of this section addresses measures and 
methods for organizing, analyzing, and displaying the huge 
quantity of social data that are collected by companies (Big 
Data). First, we present the topic of metrics. Then, we 
describe the methodology of scorecards. The section ends 
with a description of social media monitoring. In Sect.  10.6 , 
we introduce social media analytics and sentiment analysis, 
followed by a brief description of dashboards. For more on 
social media intelligence, including examples, see  listen-
logic.com/2010/04/what-is-social-media-intelligence . 
 Using Metrics in Performance Assessment 
 A  metric is a speciﬁ c, measurable standard against which 
actual performance is compared. Metrics are used to describe 
many things such as costs, beneﬁ ts, or the ratio between 
them. They are used not only for justiﬁ cation but also for 
measuring actual performance and other economic activities. 
Metrics can produce very positive results in organizations by 
 driving behavior in a number of ways, such as improving 
performance. According to Person ( 2013 ), metrics can: 
•  Be the basis for speciﬁ c goals and plans. 
•  Deﬁ ne the value proposition in business models 
(see Primer A). 
•  Communicate a business strategy to the workforce 
through performance targets.

10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

251
 Social commerce metrics can be tangible or intangible 
and must be related to goals and objectives, as shown in 
Table  10.1 (p. 230). 
 Metrics need to be deﬁ ned properly, with a clear way to 
be measured. For example, revenue growth in a company 
can be measured in total dollars, in percentage change over 
time, and in market share in the industry where the company 
operates. Deﬁ ning the speciﬁ c measures is critical; other-
wise, what the metrics actually measure may be open to dif-
ferent interpretations. For a comprehensive description, see 
Hoffman and Fodor ( 2010 ). 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 Metrics are frequently expressed by a set of  key performance 
indicators (KPIs), which involve the quantitative expression 
of some measures of each metric. One metric may have sev-
eral KPIs. 
 A  key performance indicator (KPI) is a quantitative 
measure commonly used in the industry that expresses the 
critical success factors of a company, department, or an ini-
tiative. Different companies measure success or failure by a 
different set of KPIs. For example, OrderDynamics ( order-
dynamics.com ) conducted a survey to identify the most 
used KPIs for e-commerce. 
 These KPIs are continuously monitored by organizations 
(e.g., via Web analytics, social media, or other methods 
described in Sect.  10.6 ). 
 Examples 
 In Australia, the government of Victoria is one of the leaders 
in exploiting the Internet to provide a one-stop service cen-
ter called “Do It Online” (see  vic.gov.au ). In the United 
States, the state of California website ( ca.gov ) offers many 
online social media-oriented services for residents. In both 
cases, the metric of “waiting time” is used to compare the 
government 2.0 services against traditional citizen service 
options. Such comparison is done to justify social media 
projects.    
 Using Metrics in Social Commerce 
 Social media metrics are different from generic e-commerce 
website metrics because users interact with branded media in 
several different ways. For an overview, see Lovett ( 2011 ), 
Poston ( 2012 ), and Sterne ( 2010 ). Unfortunately, there are 
too many different metrics in social media and commerce. 
For example, Simply Measured ( simplymeasured.com ) uses 
over 750 metrics. In addition, measurements can be complex. 
For example, when an Internet user watches an online video, 
he or she might spend 10 minutes watching it, but someone 
else might stop watching after 1 minutes. In addition, if the 
user uploads, comments on, or shares a branded video, how 
can this brand engagement be valued? Social media perfor-
mance metrics, as described in Chap.   5 , must capture the 
richness of user activity online in different areas. 
 Here are a few examples:
•  Earned media publicity. This is a message about the 
company or brand shared with others after an experience 
with the brand. Metric example: number of blogger posts 
about the brand or company, or number of users creating 
a buzz by sending a video link or Facebook widget to their 
friends. 
•  Company owned social media. These are messages sent 
through company owned social media channels. Metric 
example: the number of fans on Starbucks’ Facebook 
page and the weekly number of posts they shared.  
•  Paid media. These are messages on someone else’s media 
channels, rather than those controlled by the company; 
for example, using ofﬂ ine media like television. Metric 
example: the number of people who downloaded a place-
ment application on Facebook, or the cost per click on a 
display ad on a social media site.  
 For sample metrics in each category, see IAB ( 2009 ), 
Chap.   5  , and Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ). For a guide to track-
ing social media metrics, see Lee ( 2014 ). 
 A large number of metrics can be used in social media 
depending on the area of consideration. In fact, companies are 
drowning in metric availability and need to carefully select 
those that measure their social commerce objectives and tac-
tics. For a guide to using social media metrics in non- proﬁ t 
organizations, including social media ROI, what statistics to 
measure on Facebook and Twitter, and available metrics 
tools, read the articles and tutorials at  socialbrite.org/shar-
ing-center/metrics . For a beginner’s guide to social media, 
see  moz.com/beginners-guide-to-social-media . 
 Examples 
 Hoffman and Fodor ( 2010 ) and Poston ( 2012 ) suggested 
metrics that are related to marketing. Representative metrics 
are summarized in the following list: 
•  Increase accountability when metrics are linked 
with performance appraisal programs and rewards. 
•  Align the objectives of individuals, departments, 
and divisions to the enterprise’s strategic objectives. 
•  Track the performance of SC systems, including 
usage, types of visitors, page visits, conversion rate, 
and so forth. 
•  Assess the health of companies by using tools such 
as balanced scorecards and performance dashboards. 
10.5 Metrics and Monitoring Performance

252
 Bernoff and Li ( 2008 ) developed success metrics for the 
social Web in each of the following categories: marketing, 
sales, customer support, operations, and research and devel-
opment. Most are quantitative. They also provide the follow-
ing ﬁ ve categories of  strategic metrics : 
 Each metric may have several dimensions and measures. 
 For a comprehensive discussion about social metrics, 
types of analysis, actions taken, and more, see  personalweb.
about.com/od/socialmediaresearch/a/Social-Metrics.htm 
and Poston ( 2012 ). 
 Classifying Social Media Metrics 
 Given the large number of social media metrics, there are 
several ways to classify them. For example, in Chap.   5 , we 
categorized them as awareness/exposure, brand health, 
engagement, action, and innovation metrics. Other classiﬁ -
cations follow.
 1.  Jones ( 2011 ) uses the following ﬁ ve categories:
•  Awareness and exposure (e.g., video views, number of 
followers) 
•  Share of voice and sentiment (e.g., number of conver-
sations about a brand versus that of a competitor)  
•  Inﬂ uence (e.g., the chance that followers and fans are 
inspired by messages) 
•  Engagement (e.g., ratings, retweets, photo views) 
•  Popularity (e.g., number of “Likes” on a company’s 
Facebook page). 
 2.  Another way to classify metrics is by technology; for 
example, metrics for Twitter, for Facebook, for e-mail, 
for videos, and so on.  
 3.  In the marketing arena, one can apply traditional 
e- marketing metrics (e.g., impressions, click-through 
rate, cart conversion rate, and attention rate). 
 4.  One can use performance metrics that are related to the 
balanced scorecard (see description later in this section). 
 5.  Social metrics for business can be implemented. Lasica 
( 2010 ) provides a list of 10 areas, each with a list of spe-
ciﬁ c metrics: customer engagement, sales and proﬁ ts, 
search engine marketing and ranking, trafﬁ c and conver-
sation reach, brand sentiment, public outreach, lead gen-
eration, customer retention, cost savings, and employee 
recruitment. 
 6.  The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) provides over 
100 metrics in categories such as survey metrics, activity 
metrics, ROI measurement, and reporting metrics. The 
reporting metrics are subdivided into general social media 
metrics, blog metrics, conversation size, size relevance, 
author credibility, content, and widget and social media 
applications. Within each category, there are 5–10 spe-
ciﬁ c metrics. For details, see IAB ( 2009 ). For tracking 
these and other metrics, see Lee ( 2014 ). 
 The bottom line is that organizations select the metrics 
they need for measuring whether or not they reached their 
social media objectives. 
 1.  “ Listening. Learn about your customers by paying 
attention to what they are saying online to one 
another or directly to you.  
 2.  Talking. Communicate with your customers (and 
fans) by engaging in conversations.  
 3.  Energizing. Encourage current customers and fans 
to spread the word through ratings, reviews, and 
other positive ‘buzz.’ 
 4.  Support. Help customers solve problems by pro-
viding information and online resources like user 
forums, knowledge bases, and other tools.  
 5.  Embracing. Invite customers to generate ideas for 
new products and services.” 
  1.  Track trafﬁ c for ﬁ nding leads (e.g., sources, 
changes over time). 
  2.  Find the average engagement duration (e.g., 
4 minutes on a YouTube video). 
   3.   Bounce rate (the percentage of people who leave 
your site after only viewing one page).  
  4.  Fans on a Facebook page (numbers and their 
demographic composition).  
  5.  Activity levels (by type). 
  6.  Conversation levels (by type). 
  7.  Brand and company/product health/reputation; 
positive and negative comments in all social net-
working activities. 
   8.  Loyalty and sharing: Are members of social 
groups repeatedly interacting in the network, and 
sharing opinions, content, and links? How many 
members participate in discussions about a cer-
tain brand? How often do they reshare (e.g., a 
post)? (Several possible measures can be used 
here.)   
   9.   Extent of viral activity: For example, sharing 
tweets and Facebook comments relevant to your 
company. The speed of resharing (or retweeting) 
and the number of friends and their friends 
involved in the resharing.  
 10.  Blog interaction (several measures).

 Sources for Social Media Metrics 
 There are many sources for social media metrics (try a 
Google search). Here we list some representative examples:
•  Guide to social media metrics at  socialbrite.org/sharing- 
center/metrics . 
•  Facebook Insights. 
•  Books by Sterne ( 2010 ), Poston ( 2012 ), Lovett ( 2011 ), 
and Blanchard ( 2011 ). 
•  The Interactive Advertisement Bureau ( iab.net ); see IAB 
( 2010 ). 
•  Comprehensive coverage at  marketingsherpa.com . 
 The large number of available social media metrics poses 
a challenge for management: which one to use and how. For 
example, see how Shively ( 2012 ) deﬁ nes 40 different 
 metrics. A practical tool that helps someone make such a 
determination is the  balanced scorecard . 
 Balanced Scorecards (BSC) 
 One of the best-known and most widely used performance 
management systems is the balanced scorecard (see  en.wiki-
pedia.org/wiki/Balanced_scorecard , and the Balanced 
Scorecard Institute;  balancedscorecard.org ). Kaplan and 
Norton ﬁ rst articulated this methodology in their 1992 
 Harvard Business Review article “The Balanced Scorecard: 
Measures That Drive Performance.” 
 The balanced scorecard translates an organization’s strat-
egy into a set of objectives, measures, goals, and initiatives 
in both ﬁ nancial and non ﬁ nancial areas. The non-ﬁ nancial 
objectives fall into the following three perspectives:
•  Internal business processes. The processes the organiza-
tion must succeed at, in order to appease its customers 
and shareholders. 
•  Learning and growth. How an organization improves its 
adaptability to changes and its ability to learn so that its 
mission is achieved. 
•  Customers. How the organization is viewed by its cus-
tomers with respect to accomplishment of its vision and 
mission. 
 Aligning Strategies and Actions 
 As a strategic management methodology, the balanced score-
card enables an organization to align its actions with its over-
all strategies as well as with risk analysis (e.g., see Beasley 
et al.  2006 ). It accomplishes this task through a series of 
interrelated steps, although the speciﬁ c steps involved vary 
from one project to the next. In social commerce, the process 
can be depicted in ﬁ ve steps: 
 Note: A  strategy map is a graphical representation of an 
organization’s strategy. It illustrates how an organization 
plans to achieve its objectives by delineating the relation-
ships among the objectives across the scorecard’s different 
perspectives. 
 For speciﬁ c metrics that are used with the balanced score-
card in the areas of e-marketing and e-business, see Strauss 
and Frost ( 2014 ). 
 Metrics and Measurements for Social Inﬂ uence 
 Setting metrics and measurements for social inﬂ uence is dif-
ﬁ cult because inﬂ uence is mostly subjective; therefore, there 
is no agreed upon answer on how to accomplish this. 
However, several vendors offer interesting methodologies 
and tools to do just that. A major vendor in this area is Klout.
com, which developed a proprietary algorithm. The follow-
ing is an example of how Klout works. 
 Example 
 Klout, Inc. ( klout.com ) provides a way for users to build 
rapport with other users. For example, you can build lists 
within Klout and give something called +K’s, which are 
tokens of appreciation to someone who has inﬂ uenced you 
on a certain topic. Based on your Klout score and inﬂ uential 
topics, you are rewarded with “perks” (e.g., discounts, gift 
cards). Marketers use Klout to ﬁ nd inﬂ uential bloggers to 
spread the word about their products. Klout calculates a per-
son’s inﬂ uence from a number of attributes; for example, the 
number of retweets generated and the amount of engagement 
they drive from unique individuals. Klout monitors actions 
and stats from social networks such as Twitter, Google+, 
Facebook, and LinkedIn (see  klout.com/corp/score ). Since 
Klout is being criticized for being inaccurate, it is working to 
improve. In early 2014, Klout changed to a whole new busi-
ness model. For details, see “The Klout Score” at  klout.com/
corp/score . The Klout Score is a number between 1 and 100 
 1.  Identify strategic objectives for each of the three 
perspectives listed earlier (about 15–25 in all).  
 2.  Identify related measures for each of the strategic 
objectives; a mix of quantitative and qualitative 
should be used.  
 3.  Establish goals for all measures. 
 4.  Devise strategic initiatives to accomplish each of 
the objectives. 
 5.  Link the various strategic objectives through a 
strategy map.

that represents a person’s inﬂ uence. The more inﬂ uence you 
have, the higher your score. For example, President Obama’s 
score is 99 and Justin Bieber’s is 92. At another site,  triberr.
com , bloggers help other bloggers by developing a commu-
nity of sharing and support.  
 Monitoring the Social Media Field 
 The amount of social media data on the Web is increasing 
exponentially with billions of videos on YouTube, billions of 
photos on Flickr and Instagram, and endless tweets and other 
conversations. The problem that companies face is how to 
monitor the Web for data that are relevant to them. A major 
area of concern is reputation management. Google offers 
e-mail  alerts for any keywords of a user’s choice, such as a 
brand name, or a competitor’s brand name, and so forth (see 
 google.com/alerts ). Users can set up an e-mail alert for the 
entire Web, including blogs, social networks, vendors’ web-
sites, etc. (e.g., see Beal and Strauss  2008 ). 
 What and Where to Monitor? 
 Monitoring is done on all social data in all social platforms 
and channels. Beal and Strauss ( 2008 ) offer these 12 chan-
nels for online social media monitoring as it relates to repu-
tation management: 
 For additional channels, see Paine ( 2011 ). In addition, 
monitoring can be made simpler with special dashboards (e.g., 
see Sysomos’s Heartbeat social media monitoring dashboard 
and video at  sysomos.com/products/overview/heartbeat ).  
 Social Media Monitoring Tools 
 A large number of tools are available for social media mon-
itoring. For a comprehensive list, see  wiki.kenburbary.
com  and Paine ( 2011 ). For 50 top tools for social media 
monitoring, see  socialmediatoday.com/content/50-top-
tools- social-media-monitoring-analytics-and-
management . For ﬁ ve social media tools to simplify 
marketing along with a comprehensive beginner’s guide to 
social media  monitoring, see  socialmediaexaminer.
com/5-social-media-monitoring-tools-to-simplify-your- 
marketing . 
 A number of social media monitoring services provide 
data to businesses (e.g., Actionly, Radian6;  salesforcemar-
ketingcloud.com/products/social-media-listening , Visible 
Technologies, 
and 
Oracle; 
 oracle.com/applications/
customer- experience/social/index.html ). Most of these 
services track online content and then feed summaries and 
other statistics into dashboards. However, smaller companies 
can use a variety of free services to conduct monitoring. (For 
example, Google Alerts, Moreover Technologies, and 
Yahoo! Alerts monitor news about companies and indus-
tries.) Technorati speciﬁ cally tracks social media sites. 
Services such as CyberAlert, ChangeDetect, and Bloglovin’ 
all offer ways to track activities in the blogosphere. Some of 
the monitoring tools provide social media analytics as well. 
For a list of free tools, see Rayson ( 2013 ). For a review and 
comparison of nine top social media monitoring services, see 
 social-media-monitoring-review.toptenreviews.com . 
 Example of a Comprehensive Tool: Actionly 
 Actionly ( actionly.com ) is a social media monitoring dash-
board and listening platform that is integrated with Google 
Analytics (see Sect.  10.6 ). It enables businesses to measure 
their social media ROI. Users can pull reports to see which of 
the messages are generating leads, page views, or revenue. 
To do this, Actionly monitors key words across networks 
such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. Users can 
view in one dashboard what their customers are saying about 
them. Actionly’s technology also helps analyze social media 
  1.  Your own content channels—any blogs, comment 
sections on the company site, or other websites 
owned by the company that allow user posting.  
  2.  Social media and blogs using Technorati.com 
alerts and RSS feeds. 
  3.  Google’s network of video, news groups, and 
more (e.g.,  news.google.com ). 
   4.  Industry news via e-mail newsletters or competi-
tive site monitoring.  
  5.  Stakeholder conversations that occur on any other 
website not monitored in other ways.  
  6.  Social communities in the company’s industry, 
such as Tripadvisor.com for the travel industry. 
  7.  Social bookmarking sites such as  delicious.com , 
which allow users to tag websites for sharing.  
  8.  Multimedia content such as videos on YouTube 
and photos on Flickr. 
  9.  Forums and message boards, in Google Groups, 
LinkedIn, and Yahoo! Groups, and on any website 
in the company’s industry that hosts them.  
 10.  Customer reviews on sites such as Amazon.com 
(companies that only sell products online).  
  11.  Brand proﬁ les on social networks such as LinkedIn.

 SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYTICS 
AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 
 The importance of analytics in general has been recognized 
in the last few years (e.g., see Davenport and Harris  2007 
and Fuloria and Iyer  2011 ). 
 Analyzing social media data and information is a compre-
hensive ﬁ eld that utilizes many methods and tools. For com-
prehensive coverage, see Sponder ( 2013 ). We cover only the 
major ones in this chapter. 
 Deﬁ nitions, Importance, and Applications 
 The umbrella term  social analytics  includes several analysis 
techniques such as social ﬁ ltering, social network analysis, 
sentiment analysis, and opinion mining. Therefore, there are 
several deﬁ nitions.  Social media analytics describes the 
activities of monitoring and recording, analyzing, and inter-
preting the results of interactions and associations among 
people, topics, and ideas. It is the process of gathering data 
from blogs and social media sites and analyzing that data to 
make business decisions. These interactions may occur dur-
ing any social networking activity. The analysis is done on 
people’s opinions, sentiments, reviews, recommendations, 
and even attitudes and emotions (e.g., see Liu  2012 ). Social 
analysis is done frequently in order to check the activities 
done in communities, what conversations are taking place, 
and much more. For example, see  bazaarvoice.com/solu-
tions/conversations/intelligence . 
 Note that, social media analysis is different from social 
network analysis, which we presented in Chap.   3 . 
 Social media analytics is crucial for obtaining a strategic 
understanding of what is taking place in social media, either 
on the Internet or in private enterprise networks. Johnson 
( 2013 ) describes the use of social media analysis in market 
research. Social media analysis usually includes some forms 
of traditional data analysis, such as data mining (see 
McCafferty  2010 ), to create a comprehensive understanding 
of social consumers. Social media analytics provides the 
foundation that allows an enterprise to use data to improve 
its targeted engagements; to optimize social collaboration 
across multiple business functions, as well as support, 
 loyalty, and advocacy programs; and to enhance customer 
experience. Social media analytics are most commonly used 
to gauge customer opinions to support marketing 
 communication, product development, and customer service 
activities. Social media analytics can help governments bet-
ter engage and interact with citizens (Ong  2014 ). For an 
overview of Web analytics, its beneﬁ ts, its best practices, its 
hurdles, and the impact of Google Analytics, see Kaushik 
( 2009 ) and Peterson ( 2004 ). 
 The Web Analytics Process 
 According to the Digital Analytics Association, the deﬁ ni-
tion of Web analytics is “the measurement, collection, analy-
sis, and reporting of Internet data for the purposes of 
understanding and optimizing Web usage” (see  clarku.edu/
ofﬁ ces/its/webservices/pdf/web_analytics.pdf ). See also 
Beasley ( 2013 ). Performance data are collected, such as the 
sites from which visitors came, the pages they viewed while 
visiting the sites, how long they stayed on those pages, and 
how they interacted with the site’s information. Analytics 
also reveals what keywords users entered into a search 
engine prior to arriving at the site. Such data can reveal, for 
example, the success of SEO methods or advertising cam-
paigns, etc. Because the goal of most SC websites is to 
increase sales, valuable analysis shows the level of sales 
increases. 
 Information about Web analytics is available at  jimnovo.
com . Two of the many Web analytics tools are available at 
 webtrends.com and  google.com/analytics . 
 Example: Google Analytics 
 This comprehensive (and free) tool,  google.com/analytics , 
can perform many statistical activities (e.g., time-series anal-
ysis, cross-sectional analysis, scatter diagrams, trend analy-
sis, ROI, and much more). For details, see England ( 2013 ) 
and  google.com/analytics/features . Several companies 
have created tools to supplement Google Analytics. Examples 
are  sproutsocial.com ,  agencyplatform.com ,  argylesocial.
com ,  bazaarvoice.com , and  actionly.com . 
 Social Media Analytics 
 Social media analytics is a subset of Web analytics that con-
centrates on social media (see Sponder  2013 ). 
 According to Jayanti ( 2010 ), Internet consumer conversa-
tions facilitate the conducting of market research. Conversation 
analysis, according to Vittal ( 2009 ), also helps companies to 
“understand emerging issues, follow brand sentiment, bench-
mark companies against major competitors, detect damaging 
issues or rumors, spur product development, gather product 
suggestions, and discover alternate uses and enhancements

volunteered by consumers.” This requires appropriate analy-
sis. Social analytics was named by Gartner Inc. as one of the 
top 10 strategic technologies of 2011. For details about social 
Web analytics, see Ayanso ( 2014 ). See also Gartner’s Top 10 
Tech Trends Through 2015 at  slideshare.net/success_ehs/

Strategic Technology Trends for 2014” at  slideshare.net/

dcearley39921 . 
 Social analytics evaluates interactions and relationships 
among people, subjects of interest, ideas, and organizations. 
 Analytics are developed for each social network plat-
form. For example, see  business.pinterest.com/en/
pinterest-analytics .  
 Tools for Mining Social Media Activities 
 There are many ways to analyze social media. Generic 
e-commerce tools such as Web mining and text mining (e.g., 
Russell  2013 and Sharda et al.  2014 ) can be used here as 
well. Several other tools are also used for data, texting, and 
Web mining in social media. Comprehensive coverage on 
social media is provided by Danneman and Heimann ( 2014 ). 
Oracle Cloud ( 2012 ) provides a white paper on social media 
and business intelligence integration. 
 Example 1 
 IBM SPSS Modeler is a  predictive analytics software plat-
form that measures trends in consumer views of products 
and services as collected from Web 2.0 tools (e.g., blogs 
and social networks). IBM SPSS Modeler brings predic-
tive intelligence to decisions made by individuals, groups 
and others in the enterprise. It also analyzes data that is 
structured (e.g., price, product, location) and unstructured 
(text, e-mails, social media). The software covers 180 vari-
ables and 400,000 industry-speciﬁ c terms that can be 
analyzed.  
 Example 2 
 Wendy’s International uses software (from Clarabridge, Inc.) 
to analyze hundreds of thousands of relevant customer mes-
sages collected each year. Using Clarabridge’s text analytics 
software, Wendy’s analyzes comments from its Web-based 
feedback form, call center notes, e-mails, receipt-based sur-
veys, and social media. Before using Clarabridge’s text ana-
lytics software, the company used a combination of 
spreadsheets and keyword searches to analyze the data by a 
slow and expensive manual process. 
 Example 3 
 Compete, Inc. ( compete.com ) specializes in competitive 
analysis via Web analytics. It provides its customers with 
a proﬁ le of competitors featuring competitive analysis, 
 trafﬁ c data and analysis, identiﬁ cation of new threats, and a 
detailed blog. 
 Other Web analytic tools are: IBM’s Social Business and 
Social Media Analytics, Sysomos’s MAP (Media Analysis 
Platform), SAS Social Media Analytics; watch their videos 
at  youtube.com/SASsoftware , and IBM’s SPSS offerings, 
which includes  sentiment analysis (see Taft  2012 ). For social 
commerce analytics tools for small businesses, see  dirjour-
nal.com/articles/7-social-commerce-analytics-tools-for-
small-businesses . For a list of the top 29 social media 
analytics software (Fall 2014), see  predictiveanalyticsto-
day.com/top-social-media-analytics-software . 
 Finally, for top 10 social media analytics tools (December 
2013), see Hardawar ( 2013 ). 
 Sentiment Analysis and Web 2.0 
 Sentiment analysis or  opinion mining refers to a type of 
analysis that aims to determine the attitude or opinion of a 
person with respect to a particular issue as expressed in 
online conversations (e.g., if the opinion is positive, nega-
tive, or neutral). For details, see Pang and Lee ( 2008 ). 
Sentiment analysis is measured by techniques such as natu-
ral language processing (NLP), computational linguistics, 
and text analysis. 
 Automated sentiment analysis is a process of training a 
computer to identify sentiments within content using 
NLP. Various sentiment measurement platforms employ dif-
ferent techniques and statistical methodologies to evaluate 
sentiments, while some use a hybrid system. 
 IBM Social Sentiment Index 
 IBM has developed an index that aggregates and gauges 
public opinions from a range of social media sources. For 
example, the software identiﬁ es the emotional context of a 
conversation (e.g., between sarcasm and sincerity), and dis-
covers which conversations are important and should be 
monitored. For details and a video presentation, see  ibm.
com/analytics/in/en/conversations/social-sentiment.html . 
 For success in sentiment analysis, see Valentine ( 2014 ). 
For how Thomson Reuters is incorporating sentiment analy-
sis gained from Twitter for their market analysis and trading 
platform, see Lunden ( 2014 ). For more information on senti-
ment analysis including resources and related subjects, see 
 semantria.com/sentiment-analysis . 
 Dashboards in Social Commerce 
 Once data are analyzed and summarized in tables and charts, 
they need to be presented to management for decision- making 
purposes. One popular tool used to do this is a dashboard. 
10 Strategy and Performance Management in Social Commerce

257
 What Is a Dashboard? 
 A dashboard is a control panel. Its most well-known 
 application is the instrument panel facing a driver of an auto-
mobile, or a pilot in an airplane. It usually involves many 
gauges and indicators. An  information dashboard (referred 
to as just a dashboard in this chapter) is a visual display or 
presentation of data organized in ways easy to read and inter-
pret. The information is presented through gauges, charts, 
maps, tables, and so forth. It reveals trends and directions of 
the measured metrics. Dashboards are very popular business 
tools for use by executives and managers since they visually 
summarize the most important information (usually KPIs 
and metrics) and point to deviations from targets, using alerts 
(e.g., red colors), indicating where actions need to be taken. 
Dashboards are usually interactive and integrate information 
from multiple sources. Dashboards may be customized in a 
multitude of ways, and named accordingly; for example, 
“the CEO dashboard” is designed for chief executives. 
 Dashboards can be very colorful. Several dozen exam-
ples can be seen when you search Google Images for 
‘dashboards.’ 
 Social Media Dashboards 
 Social media dashboard  software organizes information 
from data about a company, brand, or any keyword cited in 
conversations, from any social media content, and organizes 
it in one place in images. This makes it easy for companies 
to monitor conversations and display selected metrics. 
Several vendors provide dashboards for social media. For an 
example, see the social media dashboard at  hootsuite.com . 
It lets you do more with social media, allowing engagement, 
listening, analytics, and more.

ics and management, see Dyer ( 2013 ). 
10.7 
 IMPROVING PERFORMANCE VIA 
INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVE 
ANALYSIS 
 The last step in the performance management cycle is to 
examine the results of the social analytics and take appropri-
ate actions. Three scenarios are possible: (1) performance is 
in line with expectations, (2) performance exceeds expecta-
tions, and (3) performance falls short of expectations. 
 In this section, we will brieﬂ y discuss two topics used to 
increase productivity (if needed): competitive intelligence 
and innovation. 
 Competitive Intelligence for Improving 
Performance 
 According to  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_intelli-
gence ,  competitive intelligence (CI)  “is the action of deﬁ n-
ing, gathering, analyzing, and distributing intelligence about 
products, customers, competitors, and any aspect of the 
 environment needed to support executives and managers in 
making strategic decisions for an organization.” Two key 
points of this deﬁ nition are:
 1.  Competitive intelligence (CI) is an ethical and legal busi-
ness practice. 
 2.  The focus is on the external business environment related 
to competition.    
 Note: The term CI is often viewed as synonymous with 
competitive analysis; in reality, competitive intelligence 
involves more than analyzing competitors—it is also about 
making the organization more competitive relative to its 
entire business environment and stakeholders. For compre-
hensive coverage, see Fleisher and Bensoussan ( 2007 ) and 
Strauss and Frost ( 2014 ). For further resources, see  entre-
preneur.com/encyclopedia/competitive-intelligence . 
 For the process of conducting social media competitive 
analysis, see Stuart ( 2013 ) and Hines ( 2013 ). For how to cre-
ate a social media strategy by spying on your competitors, see 
Hines ( 2013 ). 
 Competitive intelligence in social commerce may involve 
social intelligence activities, some of which were described 
in Sects.  10.5 and  10.6 . 
 Innovation in Social Commerce 
 Innovation in social commerce is similar to any other inno-
vation activity. It is the key to improving performance and 
may determine the success of social commerce projects, as 
well as the success of the entire organization and possibly 
its survival. What is unique today is that the development 
of philosophy, strategy, and tools of social media enable 
both management and employees to engage much more 
fully in the innovation process. Social media also provides 
management with new sources of innovation, such as the 
use of crowdsourcing for idea generation and listening to 
customers’ suggestions (and complaints) and using their 
input for product design or redesign and to improve the 
way they run their business (for an example of how Pepsi 
used social media for innovation, see York  2010 ). For 19 
ways to get more customer feedback, see  blog.clientheart-
beat.com/customer-feedback . To learn more about what 
companies gain from listening to customers, see  yourbusi-
ness.azcentral.com/companies-gain-listening-customer-

10.7 Improving Performance via Innovation and Competitive Analysis

258
 Spigit Inc. ( 2011 ) provides nine keys to innovation in the 
social media environment. A summary of the nine key points 
appears in the following list:
 1.  Treat innovation as a discipline. 
 2.  Use common, dedicated platforms to increase innovation 
IQ and strengthen innovation culture.  
 3.  Understand that innovation beneﬁ ts from a diversity of 
perspectives. 
 4.  Prevent employee self-censorship of ideas. 
 5.  Create a culture of constant choices. 
 6.  Focus employees’ innovation priorities. 
 7.  Recognize innovation as a funnel with valuable leaks. 
 8.  If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it. 
 9.   Pursue a balanced portfolio of incremental and disruptive 
innovations.    
  Finally, for automated review translation tools for global 
social commerce, see Realwire ( 2011 ). 
 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC issues as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
  1.  The strategy-performance cycle.  In order to attain its 
goals, an organization needs to implement a strategy 
and plans, as well as monitor its performance levels. 
Performance needs to be compared to social media met-
rics using social media analysis. Results are brought to the 
attention of management via dashboards. At that point, 
management may need to act. Strategy is related to Porter’s 
5 competitive forces model, which leads to decision mak-
ing concerning improved performance. The Internet has a 
major impact on strategy and competitive analysis.  
 2.  The strategic planning process. The strategic planning 
process includes the tactics that need to be deployed as 
well as the allocation of organizational resources. There 
are ﬁ ve stages in the strategy process: initiation, formula-
tion, implementation, assessment, and performance 
improvement. Companies need to have a strategy con-
cerning the use of social commerce. There are several 
guidelines for appropriate planning.  
 3.  Justiﬁ cation of social media projects. It is difﬁ cult to 
justify social commerce projects due to the intangible 
nature of many of their beneﬁ ts. Other difﬁ culties include 
measuring productivity levels and dealing with inaccu-
rate data. To help with the justiﬁ cation, one can use 
Gartner’s hype cycle to ﬁ nd the maturity of the social 
media technologies. Finally, risk assessment can be a part 
of the justiﬁ cation process. 
 4.  Market research in social commerce. Market research 
needs to be conducted as part of the justiﬁ cation and stra-
tegic planning. However, it also needs to be done as part 
of performance improvement. Relevant market research 
can be done in social network sites and in social software 
applications (e.g., blogs). Market research can facilitate 
competitive intelligence. Market research for social 
commerce is similar to any Internet-related market 
research. However, the use of communities impacts the 
process. A major subject of market research is learning 
from customers (e.g., listening to conversations). Many 
methods exist for listening to customers (e.g., monitor 
chatting, polling, blogging, searching for photographs 
and videos, and encouraging customer engagement on 
social networks). Other special methods are used to 
research social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, 
Instagram, and LinkedIn).   
 5.  Metrics and monitoring performance. Monitoring per-
formance and activities in social media can be done in 
several ways. One common way is to measure perfor-
mance against metrics (there are hundreds of them in 
social commerce). For example, one can monitor conver-
sations and other social media activities in order to learn 
about customer sentiments and then predict performance 
levels. There are many types of metrics in social com-
merce; some relate to customers, others to ﬁ nance. A tool 
that is used to study these relationships is the balanced 
scorecard, which emphasizes the major types of metrics 
(in addition to ﬁ nancials). Metrics can be measured by 
one or more key performance indicators (KPIs), which 
are monitored by computerized programs.  
  6.  Social media analytics and sentiment analysis. Whatever 
is monitored in social media needs to be analyzed, which 
is done mostly by computerized programs due to the huge 
volume involved (big data). Analysis is conducted by 
generic tools, such as data and text mining, as well as by 
statistical tools. In addition, there are methods, referred to 
as social media analytics, which are developed speciﬁ cally 
for social commerce. Google Analytics, IBM SPSS 
Modeler products, and Webtrends are good examples. A 
major area of analysis is the use of natural language pro-
cessing (NPL) to automatically identify and extract sub-
jective information in social media activities. 
 The analysis of results needs to be presented to man-
agement. Since this is time consuming for management, 
the results are often prepared graphically via computer-
ized dashboards. The dashboards can then present several 
performance management indications on one page.  
 7.  Improving performance via innovation. Performance 
monitoring and analysis may call management’s attention 
to a need to improve performance. Improvement can be 
accomplished by several methods (e.g., business process 
management) as well as via applied innovation. 
Additionally, conducting competitive intelligence can 
contribute to increased performance.

 OPENING CASE: DOMINO’S EMPLOYEES 
POST VULGAR VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE 
 Domino’s Pizza is a global company with 11,700 stores 
worldwide (May 2015 data). The company is a world leader 
in pizza delivery with a signiﬁ cant business in home delivery 
pizza. Domino’s pioneered practices including online order-
ing and expanded product variety, such as hot sandwiches. 
The company had a good reputation until 2009.  

266
 The Problem (The Incident) 
 In April 2009, during a slow workday at the Conover, NC, 
Domino’s Pizza franchise, two employees, Kristy Hammonds 
and Michael Setzer, created ﬁ ve prank videos and posted 
them on YouTube. The video went viral, amassing millions 
of views. These videos, which Hammonds ﬁ lmed, featured 
Setzer engaged in a variety of acts of food contamination, 
including putting slices of cheese up his nose and then on a 
sandwich and spreading nasal mucus on a sandwich. Over 
the course of the video, numerous orders were tampered with 
before being boxed up for unsuspecting customers who had 
no idea what had taken place. These videos would obviously 
be problematic from any standpoint, but the fact that they 
featured Domino’s employees in uniform engaged in these 
acts clearly represented a signiﬁ cant problem for the com-
pany. Furthermore, during the longest video by the pair of 
workers, titled “Domino’s Pizza Special Ingredients,” 
Hammonds jokes during the contamination of the food 
(seemingly intended for delivery to an identiﬁ ed customer) 
about this being “business as usual” and that’s how they 
“roll” at Domino’s. 
 Six hours after being posted, the videos were featured on 
the consumer advocacy site Consumerist ( consumerist.
com ). According to Peeples and Vaughn ( 2009 ), Consumerist 
readers alerted Domino’s to the situation and helped pinpoint 
Hammonds and Setzer and the store where they worked. 
However, the damage had already been done, even though 
YouTube pulled the videos; the links continued to spread 
rapidly across the Internet due to people downloading and 
reposting on numerous other sites. The precise number of 
times the videos were viewed is unknown; however, by the 
Wednesday following the release of the videos all ﬁ ve had 
trended to the top results on YouTube, and one of the videos 
had already been viewed over a million times (Peeples and 
Vaughn  2009 ). The reactions by customers were  exceptionally 
rapid (there was a “tidal wave of public disgust” (see  brian-
solis.com/2009/04/dominos-effect ), with the online research 
site YouGov.com ( today.yougov.com/opi ) reporting that 
Domino’s reputation had trended to negative. Even though 
the videos were pulled by Wednesday because of a copyright 
claim from Hammonds, they continued to damage the 
Domino’s brand, with many stores rapidly losing business.  
 The Solution (The Company’s Response) 
 Domino’s was unprepared for this disaster; according to VP 
of Corporate Communications Tim McIntyre, the company 
was in the process of putting together a social media com-
munications team, and was within a week of launch at the 
time of the incident. Consumerist readers assisted Domino’s 
in tracking down the perpetrators using a geolocation tech-
nique to identify the location from which the videos were 
uploaded. Using this information, the ﬁ rm identiﬁ ed the per-
petrators rapidly and Domino’s immediately ﬁ red them, 
requiring them to write a letter explaining the videos. 
Domino’s also threatened legal action, after ascertaining that 
no contaminated food had actually been served to customers. 
Domino’s also shared information about this process with 
the Consumerist site, garnering positive reactions from the 
site’s readers, as well as those on Domino’s own website. In 
addition, the company posted an apology on the site, detail-
ing the process they used. (The employees were arrested 
later and charged with a felony). 
 Perhaps the most effective action that was taken by 
Domino’s, involved CEO Patrick Doyle making a video, apol-
ogizing for the situation and saying that the two employees 
have been ﬁ red and arrested. This video, which was uploaded 
to YouTube under the same keywords used in the vulgar vid-
eos, offered a simple message to viewers who had seen the 
original videos. By using the same keywords, people search-
ing for the damaging videos would be shown links to the apol-
ogy video instead. The key message was: We (Domino’s) did 
not do this. We are sorry. And Domino’s wants to earn your 
trust back. This video was highly effective, given that it offered 
a direct response to both Domino’s customers and to others 
who had seen the videos, and it also explained what Domino’s 
was doing about the problem. Domino’s also expedited its 
social media expansion plans by immediately starting a corpo-
rate Twitter account, giving customers direct access to the 
company’s top management and offering a way to directly 
respond to customers concerned about the videos, as well as 
any other issues. Domino’s is now actively participating in 
social media by doing everything from social CRM to sharing 
promotions with its online social community.  
 The Results 
 Domino’s immediate reaction was similar to what we 
described in Chap.   5 (reputation management), but the com-
pany also implemented other measures. One of the most 
obvious points is that Domino’s did not have an active social 
media monitoring system in place, which is an absolute 
necessity for such a large retailer. According to McIntyre, the 
incident gave Domino’s the impetus to start a social media 
communications and monitoring program (see Chap.   10 ). 
This program started with a presence on Twitter and 
Facebook and was followed by an orderly entry into other 
online avenues, including using individual Twitter feeds for 
senior management; hiring a social media specialist in order 
to manage and maintain an up-to-date social media presence, 
identifying potential issues; and reﬁ ning their use of real- 
time social listening and monitoring software. Domino’s also 
started practicing proactive customer interactions via social

media, expanding their initial success with direct customer 
engagement and using social media as a means of rebuilding 
their brand and maintaining communications. Today, 
Domino’s has an active presence on Facebook and Twitter as 
well as an ofﬁ cial YouTube channel, in addition to active 
listening strategies in other social media sites. 
 Note that some social media gurus give “high marks” to 
Domino’s about their response (see  usatoday30.usatoday.

dominos-pizza_N.htm?POE=click-refer ).

11.1 
 SOCIAL COMMERCE 
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES 
 Once organizations formulate and complete a social com-
merce strategy, they need to carry out the agreed upon strat-
egy and tactics in what is referred to as  implementation . 
 What Is Implementation? 
 Implementation  is the process of carrying out, executing, or 
practicing a business plan. As such, implementation encom-
passes all the activities involved in getting the social commerce 
system operating properly, including installation, running, 
testing, and making necessary changes and updates. Although 
the word  deployment is sometimes used to mean implemen-
tation, some view deployment as just one activity in the imple-
mentation process, as we do in this book.  
 The Implementation Process 
and Its Major Issues 
 The implementation process depends on what system is put 
in place. For example, the process for conducting social 
media marketing differs from that used for conducting 
enterprise recruiting using LinkedIn. Nevertheless, there 
are similar activities in many types of applications. 
Additionally, several managerial and technical activities 
and issues exist in most of the applications, which are 
brieﬂ y described next. 
 The Major Issues and Activities of Social 
Commerce Implementation 
 In Chap.   10 , we introduced some activities related to imple-
mentation, such as developing justiﬁ cation and improving 
processes. Here, we deal with a slew of other issues, which 
are summarized in Fig.  11.1 . In the ﬁ gure, we marked the 
section numbers in this chapter where the speciﬁ c issues are 
presented. Management needs to consider these issues, since 
they may determine the success of failure of social com-
merce. Note that some of the issues relate to the limitations 
and risks of social commerce.
 For implementation issues related to marketing activities 
on Facebook and Twitter, and for social enterprise tactics, 
see the 115-slide show presentation titled “Social Media 
Implementation” at  slideshare.net/fated82/social-media-
implementation-slides . 
 Implementation Activities 
 Here, we present a brief description of the major implemen-
tation issues. For additional discussion, see Safko ( 2012 ) and 
Chui et al. ( 2009 ). For a comprehensive presentation, see 
Wollan et al. ( 2011 ). 
 Justiﬁ cation/Economics 
 The ﬁ rst issue is to ﬁ nd out if you need to get involved 
in a social commerce project(s). Then you must justify 
 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CASE 
 We can learn several lessons about the use of social 
media from the opening case. The ﬁ rst and most obvi-
ous is that employees are all spokespeople for the 
brand; therefore, they should all be trained in social 
media use (and misuse) to make them aware of the 
potential damage caused by the use of negative brand 
videos. A seconds lesson is that reputation-manage-
ment response should use the same social media chan-
nels, allowing the company to speciﬁ cally target the 
desired audience. Third, whether implementing social 
media or not, a company needs to explicitly monitor 
activities (Chap.   10 ) and be ready to respond immedi-
ately in case of a crisis, given the speed of content 
spreading on social media and the potential for dam-
age. This should include the use of real-time social 
media monitoring and specialist knowledge of social 
media. The ﬁ nal lesson that can be learned is that, in 
the social media world, companies do not have the 
luxury of long response times that may exist in more 
traditional media. Instead, ﬁ rms must immediately 
respond to this type of crisis in order to be effective. 
For social analytics tactics that can be deployed ahead 
of a crisis, see Hemann and Burbary ( 2013 ). The 
Domino’s incident demonstrates several issues involv-
ing social media implementation: security, employee 
behavior, company policies regarding social media, 
and technology issues, all of which, and several other 
issues, are the subjects of this chapter.

your need. This issue is part of strategy formulation, and was 
discussed in Chap.   10 under the heading “The SC Justiﬁ cation 
Process.” 
 Security Issues 
 Public social networks run on the unprotected Internet, and 
consequently suffer from security problems ranging from 
poor data protection to denial of service (DoS) and other 
attacks by hackers. These issues are discussed in Sect.  11.2 . 
 Legal, Privacy, Cyberbullying, and Ethical Issues 
 These issues are critical to the success of social commerce. 
They are discussed in Sect.  11.3 . 
 Technological Issues 
 Social commerce uses a computerized system; therefore, its 
implementation depends upon the hardware, software, net-
works, website design, and other related issues presented in 
Sect.  11.4 . 
 Employee-Related Issues 
 Employee-related issues include assuring the quality of the 
user-generated content, overcoming their reluctance to par-
ticipate, preventing them from wasting time surﬁ ng the 
Internet during working hours, and more (see Sect.  11.5 ). 
 Organizational Readiness and Impacts of Social 
Commerce 
 Issues such as how to organize the SC unit within an enter-
prise and how to deal with changing business processes, as 
well as other changes inﬂ uenced by social commerce adop-
tion, are all part of the implementation considerations. In 
addition, potential impacts on marketing, manufacturing, 
and people need to be addressed. Furthermore, some techni-
cal issues, such as connecting to other information systems, 
need to be addressed. These are all described in Sect.  11.6 . 
 Other Implementation Issues 
 There are several other implementation issues, some of 
which are generic. Representative examples are provided in 
Sect.  11.7 . A major issue is the use of social networks in 
SMEs. 
 Critical Success Factors 
 Section  11.8 deals with some of the critical success factors 
related to implementing social commerce projects. This 
includes learning from both successes and failures.  
11.2 
 SECURITY AND FRAUD PROTECTION 
IN SOCIAL COMMERCE 
 It seems that hackers and criminals are in love with social 
networks, as social networks frequently are subject to social 
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing). Therefore, users’ activi-
ties such as disclosing conﬁ dential and sensitive information 
on publicly accessible, or even internally shared workspaces, 
may result in security breaches, with possible losses suffered 
by both participating consumers and merchants. For an over-
view, see Wohlgemuth et al. ( 2014 ). For a white paper, see 
Dinerman ( 2011 ). 
 Major security issues are discussed next. 
 Social Engineering and Fraud 
 Social engineering  occurs when criminals use psychology 
to persuade unsuspecting people to disclose personal infor-
mation about themselves, in order to allow the criminals to 
gain unauthorized access into the user’s computer, to collect 
conﬁ dential information for use in illegal activities. The 
social engineers (hackers) may also attempt to gain access 
to the user’s computer in order to install malicious software

that will give them control over the user’s computer. The 
major social engineering attack method is phishing several 
methods. Typically, a phisher sends an e-mail that appears 
to come from a legitimate source, for example,  pretexting 
(e.g., an e-mail allegedly sent from a friend asking for 
money), and  diversion theft  (when a social engineer con-
vinces a courier company that she/he is the real recipient of 
the package but it should be “rerouted” to another address, 
whereupon the social engineer accepts the package). The 
information that is obtained from a victim, is frequently 
used for committing crimes (e.g., sabotaging the network), 
mostly for ﬁ nancial gain, or for posting advertisements 
(e.g., the social engineer creates a problem in the network 
and poses as a security consultant offering to help). The 
growth rate of vulnerabilities and the volume of e-mails 
result in increasing social engineering activities. For a com-
prehensive discussion and examples, see  webroot.com/us/
en/home/resources/tips/online-shopping- banking/
secure-what-is-social-engineering . A typical social engi-
neering process is shown in Fig.  11.2 .
 As you can see in the ﬁ gure, phishers (or other criminals) 
obtain conﬁ dential information by using methods ranging 
from hacking to physical theft of information. The stolen 
information (e.g., credit card numbers, users’ identity) is 
used by the thieves to commit fraud for ﬁ nancial gain, or it is 
sold in the underground Internet marketplace to another set 
of criminals, who then use the information to conduct ﬁ nan-
cial crimes. For details, see Goodchild ( 2012 ). In this sec-
tion, we will describe how phishing, which is a subset of 
social engineering, is conducted.  
 Social Phishing 
 In the ﬁ eld of computer security,  phishing is deﬁ ned as a 
fraudulent process of acquiring conﬁ dential information, 
such as credit card or banking details, from unsuspecting 
computer users. According to  webroot.com/us/en/home/
resources/tips/online-shopping-banking/secure-what-is- 
social-engineering , “a phisher sends an e-mail, IM, com-
ment, or text message that appears to come from a legitimate, 
popular company, bank, school, or institution.” However, 
such site is corrupted. Once the user enters the corrupted 
website, he or she may be tricked into submitting conﬁ den-
tial information (e.g., being asked to “update” his or her pro-
ﬁ le). Sometimes phishers install malware to facilitate the 
extraction of information. For an interesting novel that “cries 
out an alarm about cyber security,” read “ Marlins Cry A 
Phishing Story ” by Swann ( 2012 ). The process of Web- based 
phishing is illustrated in Fig.  11.3 
 For a discussion of what phishing is and how to recognize 
it, see  ehow.com/how_7350964_recognize-phishing.html . 
EMC/RSA ( 2014 ) provides comprehensive coverage of 
phishing with statistics and forecasts. Also see RSA Monthly 
Fraud Report (September 2014) at  emc.com/collateral/
fraud- report/rsa-online-fraud-report-0914.pdf . 
 Example: Using Fake Netﬂ ix 
 Casti ( 2014a ) describes a phishing scam on Netﬂ ix’s brand 
where users were tricked into contacting phony customer 
service representatives and handing over personal data. This 
has led to copycat scammers. Scammers have targeted other

companies, such as AT&T and Comcast, by attracting users 
to fake websites via phony sponsored ads. Another typical 
scam that is preying on trusting customers is where targeted 
users will see a phony webpage similar to the Netﬂ ix login 
page (e.g., via a link in a phishing e-mail, pop-up ad, etc.). 
When a user enters their Netﬂ ix account information into the 
fake site, they see a message that their Netﬂ ix account has 
been suspended due to “unusual activity” and then are pro-
vided with a fake “customer service” number for the cus-
tomer to call. When the user calls that number, a 
“representative” recommends purchasing and downloading 
“Netﬂ ix support software,” which is actually remote login 
software that gives the scammers complete access to the 
user’s computer, for example, banking information, lists of 
passwords, etc. Casti ( 2014b ). 
 Selling stolen information, like selling any stolen goods, 
can be proﬁ table and difﬁ cult to stop. Unfortunately, poten-
tial e-commerce customers list “the potential risk of fraud,” 
and “the mistrust of online merchants that you do not know” 
as their primary reasons for not shopping online. 
 Note that, as companies try to expand their e-businesses 
in countries where the legal systems are underdeveloped, 
opportunities for fraud expand, making it difﬁ cult to conduct 
EC and social commerce activities. 
 There are several different kinds of phishing. One of them, 
is  spear phishing , which occurs when attackers target speciﬁ c 
individuals by gaining personal data about them through 
information they share on the Internet, such as on social networks. 
Spear phishing is more dangerous than  regular phishing 
because the scammers are targeting speciﬁ c people or organi-
zations, rather than millions of unknown individuals.  
 Social Media Makes Social Engineering Easy 
 Social engineering attack tactics have become more diversi-
ﬁ ed with SC (e.g., see Teller  2012  and Ruble  2013 ). In the 
past, social engineers used mostly e-mails to extract infor-
mation from their victims. Now, however, social media sites 
that contain valuable information are major targets for new 
attack methods. More users are taking advantage of Web 
2.0 applications such as social networking sites, blogs, 
wikis, and tweeting. As a result, malware authors, identity 
thieves, and other criminals are exploiting the vulnerabili-
ties in the applications’ security, see Mello ( 2013 ).The most 
popular sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are attacked 
most frequently. 
 Social networking sites are vulnerable and fertile areas 
for hackers and con artists to gain a user’s trust, according 
to the following study by Danish-owned IT security com-
pany CSIS. 
 Example: The CSIS Security Group Research (csis.dk) 
 Dennis Rand, a security and malware researcher at CSIS 
designed the following experiment:
 1.  Using the name “John Smith,” he created a fake proﬁ le on 
LinkedIn.com. 
 2.  He selected thousands of people at random, inviting them 
to join his network.  
 Fig. 11.3   How phishing is accomplished 
 
11 Implementing Social Commerce Systems

271
 3.  He targeted several companies and posed on their enter-
prise social network as an ex-employee. 
 4.  Many existing employees of these companies, who were 
included in the randomly selected sample, accepted the 
invitation, creating a network of over a thousand trusted 
members for Rand. 
 5.  Rand communicated with the members, thereby collect-
ing their e-mail addresses. He harvested conﬁ dential data 
from some of the members. He also sent links (e.g., rec-
ommendations to videos), some of which were clicked on 
by the recipients. 
 The objective of the experiment was to study the potential 
security risks in using social networks. For example, mes-
sages may include links to malware in attachments which 
may be opened since they come from trusted friends. Some 
social networks do not even encourage users to select strong 
passwords and change them periodically. At the end of the 
experiment, Rand sent an e-mail to all participating mem-
bers, explaining the purpose of the experiment. Then he 
closed the “John Smith” proﬁ le. See Rand ( 2007 ) for details. 
 For phishing attacks on social networks, see Lemos ( 2014 ). 
 How Hackers Are Attacking Social Networks 
 Hackers are exploiting the trusted environment of social net-
works that contain personal information (especially 
Facebook) to launch different types of social engineering 
attacks, e.g., stealing passwords (see Chumley  2013 ). There 
is a growing trend among hackers to use social networking 
sites as platforms for stealing users’ personal data. 
 Examples 
 Here are some examples of security problems in social 
networking: 
 For the top 5 social media scams, see Norton ( undated ). 
 Spam in Social Networks and in the Web 
2.0 Environment 
 Social networks attract spammers due to the large number of 
potential recipients and the less secured Internet and social 
network platforms. Spammers like to attack Facebook in 
particular. Another problem area is blog spam. 
 Automated Blog Spam 
 Bloggers are spammed by automatically generated adver-
tisements (some real and some fake) for items ranging from 
herbal Viagra to gambling vendors. Blog writers can use 
software tools to ensure that a human, and not an automated 
system, posts comments on their blogs. 
 Examples 
 Some examples of spam attacks in social networks (social 
spam) are: 
 Defending Social Commerce Systems 
 In addition to standard protection of information systems and 
EC security systems, one needs to pay special attention to 
social commerce application protection. The major areas are: 
 Protecting Against Phishing 
 Because there are many phishing methods, there are many 
defense methods as well. Illustrative examples are provided 
by Wood ( 2013 ) and the FTC Consumer Information at  con-
sumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing and  scamwatch.gov.

•  Users may unknowingly insert malicious code into 
their proﬁ le page, or even their list of friends. 
•  Many anti-spam social networking-related solu-
tions cannot differentiate between legitimate and 
criminal requests to connect to a network.  
•  Facebook and other popular social networking sites 
offer free, useful, attractive applications. These 
applications may have been built by developers 
who used weak security. 
•  Twitter users are targeted by phishing, hacking, and 
spamming (Cluley  2014 ). 
•  Scammers may create a fake proﬁ le on a social net-
work and use it in a phishing scam.  
•  In January 2009, Twitter became a target for a 
hacker who hijacked the accounts of 33 high-proﬁ le 
users (including President Obama), sending out 
fake messages in their names. 
•  Instant messaging in social networks is frequently 
vulnerable to spam attacks.

 Anti- Phishing Working Group (APWG); this “worldwide 
coalition unifying the global response to cybercrime across 
industry, government and law-enforcement sectors.” 
 Protection Against Spam 
 Sending spam that disguises a sales pitch to look like a per-
sonal e-mail in order to bypass ﬁ lters, violates the 
U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography 
and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003. The Act makes it 
a crime to send commercial e-mail messages with false or 
misleading message headers or misleading subject lines. 
However, many spammers hide their identity to escape 
detection by using hijacked PCs, or spam zombies, to send 
spam. 
 Protecting Against Spyware 
 In response to the emergence of spyware, security compa-
nies are continuously inventing new antispyware software. 
Antispyware laws, available in many jurisdictions, usually 
target any malicious software that is installed without the 
knowledge of users. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission 
advises consumers about spyware infections and protection. 
For details and resources, see  ftc.gov/news-events/media- 
resources/identity-theft-and-data-security/spyware-and-
malware . 
 The Anti-Spyware Coalition is a group comprised of anti- 
spyware software companies and public interest groups, 
which is committed to combating the rise of unwanted spy-
ware. The combined experience of the members gives con-
sumers better ways to defend their computers against 
unwanted intruders, improves communications, and offers 
proposals for strengthening anti-spyware technology (see 
 antispywarecoalition.org ). 
 Fraud in Social Commerce 
 Social commerce is infested with fraudulent activities con-
ducted by sellers, buyers, and computer criminals. Social 
commerce has some unique aspects that make it a prime 
 target for fraud. For example, using fake proﬁ les on LinkedIn 
or Facebook, criminals can manipulate innocent buyers and 
sellers to commit fraud. Further, social networks are attrac-
tive targets to phishing and identify theft. An important issue 
in fraud is the sales of counterfeit items both in P2P and in 
some B2C transactions. For Alibaba’s problem with counter-
feiters and their repair strategy, see Chen ( 2014 ). For more 
details about the CAN-SPAM Act, see  spamlaws.com/ 
federal/can-spam.shtml . 
 Fraud Protection 
 It is necessary to protect both sellers and buyers (consum-
ers) against fraud they may commit against each other. In 
their special annual online fraud reports, CyberSource ( 2012 
and  2013 ) describes the problem of payment fraud commit-
ted by buyers, which has cost merchants several billions of 
dollars annually. The reports cover the areas of detection, 
prevention, and management of online fraud. The reports 
also list tools for automatic screening of credit cards. The 
world’s ﬁ rst online platform to ﬁ ght Internet fraud was 
launched in China in 2014. According to McCoy ( 2014 ), the 
system is used to verify consumer complaints, and if they 
are legitimate, Internet users will be notiﬁ ed of the scam 
websites. 
 According to Trulioo ( 2014 ), the following are common 
measures: card veriﬁ cation, address veriﬁ cation, proﬁ le 
database, rule-based ﬁ lters, and automated transaction scor-
ing. Trulioo suggested including a social login as an added 
security measure. 
11.3 
 ISSUES OF LEGALITY, PRIVACY, 
CYBERBULLYING, AND ETHICS 
 Several important legal, privacy, and ethical issues are 
related to social commerce implementation. Here, we 
 provide only some representative examples. 
 Legal Issues 
 The introduction of social commerce may create a host of 
legal issues already relevant to computer systems. According 
to Saper ( 2009 ), the following are some legal issues related 
to social media: 
•  Employees (and students) freely copying or using 
UGC, what they see on the Internet, including 
copyrighted material; 
•  Posting of inappropriate or offensive content on 
company bulletin boards or blogs (see the opening 
case); 
•  Discrimination in hiring employees through Internet 
job postings;  
•  Badmouthing a company on personal blogs; 
•  Using Facebook or other social networks, including 
those in-house, to discriminate against or harass fel-
low employees; 
•  Requirements for backing up electronic communi-
cations in the event of litigation;

Media” by Manishin ( 2010 ) at  slideshare.net/gmanishin/
social-media-managing-legal-risks . 
 Intellectual Property and Copyright: Violations 
 Social media is built on a free and open Internet. However, 
violations of intellectual property laws, intentionally or unin-
tentionally in user-generated content, are fairly common (see 
Case 11.1). For example, not requesting or receiving permis-
sion from individuals and organizations while creating con-
tent about them or using content created by these individuals, 
is a common phenomenon and may become a signiﬁ cant 
legal liability. Barnes and Barnes ( 2009 ) point to legal risks 
related to copyright and trademarks as well as to the inap-
propriate use of data. 
 Millennial consumers, also known as Generation Y (born 
in the 1980s and early 1990s), like companies that distribute 
social media content, such as Google, Facebook, and 
Amazon, more than they like the companies that produce 
and package the content and insist on being paid for doing 
so. Case 11.1 illustrates the controversy over users’ free 
Internet access to information against the intellectual prop-
erty rights of content creators presented online. 
 Case 11.1 
 SC Application 
 Internet Blackout against Anti-piracy Laws 
 On January 18, 2012, Wikipedia led an Internet  “blackout.” 
For 24 h, users attempting to access Wikipedia pages were 
met with a blank screen and a statement beginning, “Imagine 
a world without free knowledge.” Wikipedia indicated they 
were making the website unavailable for a 24-h period to 
protest against two acts that were being debated in the 
U.S. Congress at the time. Protests and outcry against the 
Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect Intellectual 
Property Act (PIPA) had been growing in online and real-life 
communities, and Wikipedia led the way in shutting off site 
access for a day. Notably, however, Wikipedia’s blackout 
was not complete—the blank screen carrying its protest mes-
sage also informed users that they could access Wikipedia 
during the “blackout” via mobile devices. Facebook voiced 
opposition to SOPA and PIPA, but did not participate in any 
blackout or shutdown that day. Google took part in its own 
anti-SOPA/PIPA protest, blacking out its own logo on the 
Google search page and providing a link to an online petition 
against the Acts. Twitter—the largest social microblogging 
site—did not join Wikipedia’s voluntary shutdown. 
 The U.S. Anti-piracy Bills: SOPA and PIPA 
 The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was a bill under consid-
eration in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Protect 
Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) was the analogous bill under 
consideration in the U.S. Senate. Both acts were intended to 
reduce online piracy. In particular, the bills sought to combat 
the illegal online distribution of downloaded ﬁ lms and other 
media when that media was hosted on a foreign server. If 
these bills were approved, anyone found to have streamed 
copyrighted media on more than ten occasions and without 
the copyright holder’s express permission could face a jail 
sentence of up to 5 years and pay a large ﬁ ne. This provision 
of the bills concerns Wikipedia, as the site could have been 
held liable for copyright infringement by other external sites 
to which users linked Wikipedia content. Further, SOPA and 
PIPA would have forbidden advertisers, ISPs, and companies 
processing payments from dealing with any individual or 
website alleged to have infringed a copyright. 
 For and Against Protest Viewpoints 
 Wikipedia’s protest found many supporters, and sites from 
Reddit to Google joined Wikipedia in a show of solidarity—
or so it seemed. All the sites taking part in the protest had a 
lot to lose if SOPA/PIPA had been passed, as they could have 
been made vulnerable to legal actions relating to third-party 
copyright infringements. The fact is that there is no realistic 
means of policing or monitoring information on their sites. 
Individuals and websites that joined the protests did so, 
believing in the freedom of users to access information on 
the Internet. However, sites were undoubtedly also acting 
out of self-interest, jumping on the hot topic of the day to 
generate Web trafﬁ c and revenue for themselves. Opinions 
against the Wikipedia-led protest centered on the right of 
intellectual property owners to protect their work, or alterna-
tively, on the idea that Wikipedia’s protest went about things 
the wrong way. Undoubtedly, copyright infringements are 
commonplace in the world of social media, having knock-on 
effects on creators of copyrighted material and the economy 
as a whole. 
 Implications of the Incident 
 In the twenty-ﬁ rst century, content is often distributed rather 
than sold in a physical format. This has enabled great cre-
ative freedom for everyone, from musicians to ﬁ lmmakers, 
and rappers to violinists. Technology has become more 
affordable, and access to digital distribution has widened. 
Independent musicians, for example, can sell their music on 
•  Management forcing employees to use the in-house 
social network; 
•  Electronic communications policies; 
•  Employees’ expectations of privacy on their ofﬁ ce 
computers or in their e-mail, and social media 
proﬁ les.

iTunes through distributors such as CDBaby for about $50. 
This represents a real bargain in comparison to the costs of 
creating CDs for distribution. The digital revolution has 
opened up the world of media for unprecedented sharing. 
However, this opening has come with a reduction in overall 
content quality due to the lack of third-party editing. Andrew 
Keen’s 2007 book,  The Cult of the Amateur: How Today’s 
Internet Is Killing Our Culture, argues that increased access 
to content creation has generated situations in which the 
Internet is awash with poor-quality media, opinions taken as 
facts, and a dilution of real knowledge and expertise. Open 
access to copyrighted material can also make it more difﬁ -
cult for creative professionals to earn their living doing the 
work they love. Perhaps an album, which a musician has 
spent 5 years making, should not be freely distributed with-
out that musician’s consent, partly because he or she cannot 
earn a living from that freely distributed work. Finally, the 
role of large corporations like Apple and Amazon in control-
ling media distribution cannot be underestimated. Amazon, 
iTunes, and similar content distribution channels commonly 
take up to half of all proceeds as a sales commission. 
Distribution through a large corporation is expensive for the 
copyright holder; however, it is often worth it for the broader 
distribution the company provides. In a market where mil-
lennial consumers are accustomed to paying low prices—or 
nothing—for digital media, making a living as a creative 
professional becomes more difﬁ cult, and our culture suffers 
as a result. The protest led by Wikipedia was successful in 
raising awareness of two particular pieces of proposed legis-
lation, but not in changing the landscape of the twenty-ﬁ rst 
century digital world.

 Questions 
 1.  What did Wikipedia’s blackout accomplish? 
 2.  Has Wikipedia damaged its reputation in the process? 
 3.  How can we keep a free and open Internet while protect-
ing the intellectual property rights and copyrights of 
social media content? 
 Privacy Issues in Social Commerce 
 Privacy means different things to different people. In general, 
 privacy is the right to be left alone and free from unwanted 
intrusions or disturbances in one’s private life or affairs. 
Privacy has long been a legal, ethical, and social issue in 
many countries. Today, every state in the United States, as 
well as many other countries, recognizes the right to privacy, 
either by statute or by common law. The deﬁ nition of privacy 
can be interpreted quite broadly. However, the following two 
rules have been followed fairly closely in past court deci-
sions: (1) The right to privacy is not  absolute—privacy must 
be balanced against the needs of society and (2) The public’s 
right to know is superior to the individual’s right to privacy. 
These two rules show why it is difﬁ cult, in some cases, to 
determine and enforce privacy regulations. Online privacy 
issues have their own characteristics and policies. One area 
where privacy may be jeopardized is discussed next. 
 Invasion of Privacy 
 Due to hacking attacks and the policy of some social media 
sites (notably Facebook) to collect and sell members’ infor-
mation to advertisers, there have been many reported cases 
of invasion of privacy. For example, in May 2010,  IT World 
reported that an employee who disclosed his sexual orienta-
tion on Facebook – a fact that was previously unknown to his 
employer – was ﬁ red when the employer discovered the 
Facebook post. Facebook’s insufﬁ cient security and weak 
commercial use of private data (Facebook controls the use 
and display of content published on its platform) has been 
cited in many other cases as the cause of invasion of privacy. 
However, it is worth noting that Facebook is constantly 
improving the security and privacy protection on its site. For 
guidelines to protect privacy in SC, see Johansson ( 2013 ). 
 Collecting Information About Individuals 
 Implementing social commerce may require individual 
employee or customer data. In the past, the complexity of col-
lecting, sorting, ﬁ ling, and accessing cases was a built-in pro-
tection against misuse of private information. It was simply 
too expensive, cumbersome, and complex to invade a person’s 
privacy in many cases. The Internet, in combination with 
large-scale databases and social networks, has created entirely 
new techniques for accessing and using personal data. The 
inherent power of systems that are able to access vast amounts 
of data can be used to invade privacy or misuse the informa-
tion. On the other hand, having such information may beneﬁ t 
a company or even society. For example, by matching records 
using a computer program, it is possible to eliminate or reduce 
fraud, crime, corporate mismanagement, and so on. However, 
what price must the individual pay in terms of loss of privacy 
so that a company can ﬁ ght fraud more efﬁ ciently? People’s 
private information may aid in perfectly matching people with 
products, but their privacy may be violated.  
 The Web and Information Collection 
 The Internet offers a number of methods to collect private 
information from individuals. Here are some of the ways it 
can be done: 
11 Implementing Social Commerce Systems

275
 Mobile User Privacy 
 Many users are unaware that their private information can be 
tracked through a mobile smartphone or other cellphone. For 
example, Sense Networks’ platforms are built upon the use 
of data from cellphone companies that track each phone as it 
moves from one cell tower to another, from GPS-enabled 
devices that transmit users’ locations, and from mobile 
devices transmitting information at Wi-Fi hotspots. Such 
data can be used in location-based systems, for example. 
Note: Location-powered behavioral targeting builds user 
proﬁ les, which incorporate behavioral attributes from loca-
tion data. 
 What happens when LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, or 
Foursquare provide the ability for a GPS-enabled mobile 
device user to dynamically share its location status with 
 others? Will businesses begin to take advantage of these 
capabilities to build applications, enabling GPS tracking of 
different kinds and support personnel, by leveraging the 
location status capabilities already available in their mobile 
devices? What are the privacy implications? Who will be 
held responsible or legally liable for unforeseen harm result-
ing from so much awareness and connectivity? Clear rules 
for social media sites are needed to govern what social 
media can do with the massive amount of personal data they 
collect, and how they inform their users about their 
practices.   
 Cyberbullying 
 According to  stopybullying.gov ,  cyberbullying is “bullying 
that takes place using electronic technology.” Electronic 
technology includes devices and equipment such as cell 
phones, computers, and tablets as well as communication 
tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and 
websites. Examples of cyberbullying include inappropriate 
text messages or e-mails, rumors sent by e-mail or posted on 
social networking sites, and embarrassing pictures, videos, 
websites, or fake proﬁ les (per  stopbullying.gov/cyberbully-
ing/what-is-it/index.html ). For more information, see 
 cyberbullying.us and  stopcyberbulling.org . 
 Cyberbullying Through Social Media 
 Cyberbullying through various social media outlets is on the 
rise because we are a civilization dependent on social media 
of communication. It is easy to hide behind a computer and 
post hurtful comments (per  socialnomics.net/2011/05/15/
cyber-bullying- rises-but-social-media-fights-back ).
Typical forms of cyberbullying include: (1) harassing another 
person; (2) exploiting someone in a sexual or violent manner; 
and (3) dissemination of false information that can cause 
mental or physical harm to others. According to  nobullying.
com/bullying- statistics-2014 , one study shows that seven 
out of ten young people have been victims of cyberbullying. 
 The MySpace Example 
 In 2008, a jury convicted a woman for her role in a mean- 
spirited Internet hoax that apparently drove a 13-year-old 
girl to commit suicide. The woman, Lori Drew, upset that a 
teen named Megan Meier was spreading rumors about her 
daughter, created a MySpace account for a ﬁ ctitious 16-year- 
old boy and then sent ﬂ irtatious messages from him to the 
teenage neighbor. After 4 weeks of ﬂ irting with Megan, the 
ﬁ ctitious boy sent her a message that the world would be a 
better off place without her, and other MySpace members 
who were linked to the “Josh Evans” proﬁ le also began to 
send her negative messages. Subsequently, Meier committed 
suicide. According to the prosecution, this was a clear case 
of “cyberbullying,” but the case hinged on an unprecedented 
and highly questionable application of the Computer Fraud 
and Abuse Act. The jury chose not to extend the law. As a 
result, felony conspiracy charges were dropped, and Drew 
was convicted of a misdemeanor violation. See  en.wikipe-
dia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Lori_Drew . 
 A similar case is that of the suicide of the popular 17-year- 
old soccer star Alexis Pilkington, who took her life following 
vicious taunts on Facebook. See Long and Gross ( 2010 ). 
 Ethics in Social Commerce 
 Several ethical issues are related to social commerce. 
Representative ethical issues that may be of interest in SC 
implementations include the following: 
•  Reading an individual’s social media proﬁ le and 
postings 
•  Looking up an individual’s proﬁ le in a social 
network 
•  Reading an individual’s e-mails, blogs, or discus-
sion board postings  
•  Wiretapping employees’ wireline and wireless 
communications 
•  Conducting surveillance on employees 
•  Asking an individual to complete a website 
registration 
•  Recording an individual’s actions using cookies or 
spyware as he or she navigates the Web 
11.3 Issues of Legality, Privacy, Cyberbullying, and Ethics

276
 Personal values constitute a major factor in the issue of 
ethical social commerce. An important ethical issue is 
human judgment; even though it may be subjective, it is fre-
quently a key factor in social support and recommendations. 
Human judgment may lead to unethical decision making; 
for example, should an organization employ productivity-
savings procedures that are not 100 % accurate? Another 
ethical issue is the use of knowledge extracted from people; 
for example, should a company compensate an employee 
who contributed special knowledge that was used for 
improving organizational efﬁ ciency? This issue is related to 
the motivation to participate in social commerce activities. 
It is also related to privacy and copyright. Should people be 
informed as to who contributed certain knowledge? 
Companies should provide an ethical code for those involved 
in social commerce.  
11.4 
 TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES 
 A large number of technological issues relate to the deploy-
ment of social networking. ( Deployment , which refers to the 
introduction of new technology into an organization, is a 
major aspect of implementation.) Here are some issues to 
consider. 
 Social Commerce Systems Integration 
 Several options exist for an organization to integrate social 
commerce functionality into its information systems envi-
ronment. Examples are: (1) adding collaborative technolo-
gies and tools; (2) integrating e-commerce data and 
applications with social networks; (3) connecting to third- 
party social media modules; and (4) using third-party system 
development platforms. The following sections describe 
how the Facebook platform can be used for the implementa-
tion of social commerce systems. 
 A Facebook Platform 
 Facebook created a platform that allows websites and apps 
to  share information about users allowing vendors to target 
customers on one-to-one basis to tailor offers, features, and 
services to each one’s interest and taste—even if that indi-
vidual has never visited the vendors’ sites before. See more at 
 developers.facebook.com/docs ,  mashable.com/2010/04/21/
facebook-open-graph , and  developers. facebook.com/docs/
opengraph/overview . 
 Open Graph 
 Facebook’s social graph describes people and the interac-
tions they have regarding everything they care about. In 
2010, Facebook introduced an early version of “open graph,” 
an extension of the social graph (Chap.   3 ), via the open graph 
protocol. The open graph protocol enables developers to 
integrate their pages into the social graph.  
 Social Plug-Ins 
 Facebook has developed plug-ins that websites and apps can 
deploy to make it easy for users to see information about (and 
from) their Facebook friends. Users can share things with 
their friends without leaving Facebook. One example is the 
“Like” button on each website, which allows users to “Like” 
content on a website and share it with their Facebook friends. 
(See  developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button .)  
 Social Commerce Tools 
 Businesses can use a wide range of social media tools to get 
more interactive and facilitate engagement—in other words, 
to communicate and exchange information with customers. 
Businesses are increasingly using these tools to implement 
social commerce. See  blog.interactiveinsightsgroup.com 
for more details. Several tools were presented in Chap.   2 . 
Here is a description of some tools, set forth by Sommer 
( 2010 ), that can be useful for social commerce: 
•  Really Simple Syndication (RSS).  RSS is a syndi-
cation format that allows websites and blogs to dis-
tribute their updated, dynamic content as feeds to 
users. 
•  Photo sharing. Photo sharing tools allow users to 
upload and post their photographs online to share 
them with other users. 
•  Podcasts. A podcast is a digital audio clip that is 
distributed via the Internet for playback on a user’s 
•  Accuracy of computer-generated recommendations 
•  Ethics in social commerce websites and application 
design 
•  Invasion of individuals’ privacy (e.g., by advertis-
ers or e-mail spam) 
•  Use of intellectual property, including reports and 
expertise, without permission from, or payments to, 
the creators 
•  Accuracy of user-generated content 
•  Use of corporate computer resources for non-work- 
related purposes

 Acquisition of Social Commerce Systems 
 In general, the information system acquisition issue is not 
simple, especially when medium- and large-scale projects 
are involved. The acquisition approach depends on the busi-
ness type, the product line, and the budget, as well as the 
functionality of the social commerce system. A simple social 
commerce system with a few key components can be devel-
oped with HTML, Java, or another programming language. 
Companies can deploy social commerce using commercial 
packages, which are purchased or leased from an application 
service provider (ASP), or from a site builder. Larger or spe-
cial social commerce applications can be developed in-house 
or their development can be outsourced, as Del Monte did 
(Chap.   10 ). Building medium to large applications requires 
extensive integration with existing information systems, 
such as corporate databases, intranets, and enterprise and 
other application programs. Therefore, although the process 
of building social commerce systems can vary, in many 
cases, it tends to follow a fairly standard format. Figure  11.4 
shows the major steps needed to develop a typical social 
commerce application.
 Managing the Development Process 
 The development process illustrated in Fig.  11.4 can be fairly 
complex, and must be managed properly. For medium-to- 
large applications, a project team is usually created to man-
age the process and the vendors. Collaboration with business 
partners is also critical. Projects can be managed using 
 project management software (see examples of various 
 project 
management 
software 
at 
 en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Comparison_of_project_management_software and 
reviews of the top project management software at  capterra.
com/project-management-software ). Best practice man-
agement also includes periodic evaluations of system perfor-
mance. Standard project management techniques and tools 
are useful for this task (see  project-management.com ).

•  Social news. Social news sites allow users to sub-
mit Web pages and articles and have other users 
vote on them, with the number of votes determining 
which articles are presented on the social news site 
(e.g., Digg.com). 
•  Video sharing. Video sharing allows users to 
upload and share videos to video sharing websites 
such as YouTube.

11.5 
 EMPLOYEE-RELATED 
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES 
 As illustrated in the opening case, there are several social 
commerce-related 
issues 
that 
involve 
employees. 
Representative examples are provided next. 
 Non-work-Related Use of Social Media 
 Employees are tempted to use social media while at work 
for non-work-related purposes. This use can be higher than 
work-related uses of the Internet. This problem has several 
dimensions. For example, social media can be used to 
harass other employees, which poses a legal threat to a 
company. Social media can also be used to conduct illegal 
gambling activities. Last, but not least, is the time employ-
ees waste surﬁ ng non-work-related websites, including 
social networks.  
 Employee Reluctance or Resistance 
to Participate 
 Employee resistance or reluctance to use enterprise social 
media applications, or contribute to them, can be a serious 
problem. Based on the experience of using wikis in a univer-
sity administration context, issues such as sufﬁ cient user 
training, resource availability, and skills to support technol-
ogy should be considered when planning for social com-
merce deployment. 
 Quality of Content and Biases of User- 
Generated Content 
 Any user-generated content, including contributions to 
Wikipedia, providing online advice, and generating feed-
back can be of poor quality or biased. An interesting research 
topic is how to judge the quality of user-generated content. 
 Data Leakage and Loss of Data 
 It is very easy for employees to post conﬁ dential informa-
tion about their company, regardless of its nature—be it 
unwittingly or deliberately—in a blog or on a social media 
site. Data leakage can lead to losses related to litigation, 
ﬁ nes, or even imprisonment of company ofﬁ cials. 
 Transferring Data 
 While social networks can be advantageous to support social 
CRM, the data related to individuals may not be secure. 
Thus, it would not be difﬁ cult for an untrusted or 
 inexperienced employee to transfer proprietary information 
to a competitor (intentionally or unintentionally) using a net-
work of friends/business colleagues on a social network site. 
For example, after having built up an extended network of 
friends/business colleagues through a social media site, it 
would not be difﬁ cult for an employee to take the company’s 
entire sales database with him. 
 Social Media Management at Work 
 Social media, when used in a corporate setting, represents a 
mix of rewards (e.g., business opportunities) and risks for a 
company. The following are some guidelines that organiza-
tions might undertake to properly deal with such a mix of 
rewards and risks (per Osterman Research  2011 ). 
 Develop Social Media Policies 
 An organization should develop detailed and thorough poli-
cies that focus on establishing acceptable use of social media. 
In addition, the policies must specify which functions and 
features are permitted, which are not permitted, and so forth. 
 Monitor Content 
 An organization should deploy procedures and technologies 
that will monitor social media. To prevent malware infec-
tions from social media—protect pages with real-time moni-
toring and removal of all unwanted content. There is a need 
to protect against generated malware, and to prevent poten-
tially libelous comments, trade secrets, or other inappropri-
ate content from being sent externally. This chapter’s opening 
case illustrates how inappropriate social media content 
shared by employees can damage a company’s brand. For a 
discussion of polices, see jeffbullas.com/2013/10/22/what-
is-the-right-social-media-policy-for-your-company. For a 
list of social media policies and guidelines for corporations, 
non proﬁ ts and media companies, see  socialmedia.biz/

 ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES 
AND THE IMPACTS OF SOCIAL 
COMMERCE 
 Limited statistical data or empirical research on the organi-
zational impact of social commerce is rarely available 
because the ﬁ eld is relatively new. Therefore, the discussion 
in this section is based primarily on expert opinions, logic, 
and only some actual data. 
 Existing and emerging Web technologies are offering 
organizations unprecedented opportunities to rethink strate-
gic business models, processes, and relationships. The dis-
cussion here is also based in part on the generic model of 
Bloch et al. ( 1996 ), who approached the impact of 
e- marketplaces on organizations in general, from a value- 
added point of view. Their model divides the impact of 
e-marketplaces into three major categories:  improving direct 
marketing ,  transforming organizations , and  redeﬁ ning orga-
nizations . This section brieﬂ y examines each of these impacts 
as applied to social commerce. For the impact on social com-
merce using Twitter, see Mohd and Uwandu ( 2013 ). 
 Improving Marketing and Sales Revenue 
 For digital products—software, music, books/other text, 
photo images, and videos—the changes brought about by 
social media are dramatic. These are already delivered in 
huge volumes over the Internet. New marketing models, such 
as group buying, increase sales potential, as described in 
Chap.   6 . The potential impacts of social media marketing on 
marketing and sales are summarized in Table  11.1 .
 Many of the changes may impact marketing with a provi-
sion of a competitive advantage over those that use only tra-
ditional direct-sales methods. 
 Transforming Organizations and Work 
 A seconds impact is the transformation of organizations to 
become social businesses. This topic is championed by IBM, 
which helps companies transform themselves to become 
social businesses (e.g., see  ibm.com/software/collaboration/

11.6 Organizational Issues and the Impacts of Social Commerce

280
social/business ). IBM sells software for social businesses and 
provides several interesting white papers on the topic. Here, 
we look at ﬁ ve key topics:  organizational learning ,  changing 
the nature of work ,  restructuring business processes, change 
management,  and  the structure of the social commerce unit . 
For a framework for research on social media and business 
transformation, see Aral et al. ( 2013 ). 
 Technology and Organizational Learning 
 Rapid progress in social commerce will force a Darwinian 
struggle: To survive, companies will have to learn and 
quickly adapt to the new technologies. This struggle will 
offer them an opportunity to experiment with new products, 
services, and business models, which may lead to strategic 
and structural changes. An example is the newspaper 
 industry, where losses, bankruptcies, and consolidations are 
regular events. These changes transform the way in which 
business is done. We believe that as social commerce pro-
gresses, it will have a large and long-lasting impact on the 
strategies and operations of many organizations and 
industries. 
 In summary, corporate change must be planned for and 
managed. Before getting it right, organizations may have to 
struggle with different experiments and learn from their 
mistakes. 
 The Changing Nature of Work 
 The nature of some work has been restructured already by 
the Social Web. For example, recruiting is moving to social 
networks and video ads are reshaping advertising. 
Crowdsourcing is an important tool for improved design and 
idea generation (Chap.   8 ). The upheaval brought on by 
changes due to social commerce creates new opportunities 
and new risks, and is forcing people to think about their 
careers and salaries in new ways. 
 The social age company will have to view its core of 
essential workers as its most valuable asset. Human capital 
and social capital are as important as physical assets. 
Therefore, companies will have to constantly provide 
employees with all means needed to expand their capabili-
ties. For details, see Boutros and Purdie ( 2013 ). 
 Restructuring Business Processes 
 By using technology and reorganization tools, a company 
can prepare a work analysis of its operations, including inter-
actions and transactions with its business partners, then 
devise an improved organizational structure and business 
processes that are an alternative to the existing ones. Such 
solutions may include new job descriptions and workﬂ ows. 
Several technologies, including  business process reengineer-
ing and  business process management , are available for such 
restructuring.  Business process reengineering (BPR) is a 
methodology for conducting a comprehensive redesign of an 
enterprise’s processes, and  business process management 
(BPM) is (1) a method for business restructuring that com-
bines workﬂ ow systems and redesign methods, covering 
three types of interactions: people-to-people, systems-to- 
systems, and systems-to-people; and (2) a holistic manage-
ment approach focused on aligning all aspects of an 
organization with the wants and needs of its customers and 
partners. It promotes business effectiveness and efﬁ ciency, 
while striving for innovation, ﬂ exibility, and integration with 
technology. For more details, see vomBrocke and Rosemann 
( 2015 ), and Dumas et al. ( 2013 ). 
 Change Management 
 Implementing a social commerce project, especially if it 
involves major restructuring, introduces changes to organi-
zations that must be managed properly.  Change manage-
ment  “is a structured approach to shifting/transitioning 
individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to 
a desired future state. It is an organizational process aimed at 
empowering employees to accept and embrace changes in 
their current business environment” (per Rajput et al.  2012 ). 
According to  change-management.com/tutorial-deﬁ ning- 
change-management.htm , a commonly accepted deﬁ nition 
of change management is “the process, tools, and techniques 
to manage the people-side of change to achieve the required 
business outcome…. Change management incorporates the 
organizational tools that can be utilized to help individuals 
make successful personal transitions resulting in the adop-
tion and realization of change.” 
 A formal organizational  change management should 
begin, according to Rajput et al. ( 2012 ), “with a systematic 
diagnosis of the current situation in order to determine both 
the need for change and the capability to change. The objec-
tives, content, and process of change should all be speciﬁ ed 
as part of a Change Management plan.” In addition, a “suc-
cessful change management is more likely to occur if the 
following are included” (per Rajput et al.  2012 ): 
•  “Beneﬁ ts management and realization to deﬁ ne mea-
surable stakeholder aims, create a business case for 
their achievement (which should be continuously 
updated), and monitor assumptions, risks, dependen-
cies, costs, return on investment, beneﬁ ts and cultural 
issues affecting the progress of the associated work.

agement, see Cameron and Green ( 2012 ). 
 How to Organize a Social Commerce Unit 
in a Company 
 If a company is engaged in social commerce, it may have 
several full-time employees working in this area. The ques-
tion is how to organize a social commerce unit. The best 
organizational structure depends on factors such as: 
 These factors need to be considered. Most likely, the 
social commerce unit will be a part of the marketing depart-
ment. Large retailers (e.g., McDonald’s) have an indepen-
dent social commerce department. 
 For how social entrepreneurship works, see Bornstein and 
Davis ( 2010 ). 
11.7 
 OTHER IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES 
 Several other topics are related to implementation. 
Examples are: 
 Here we will discuss the last two topics only. For other 
topics, see Shih ( 2011 ) and Safko ( 2012 ). 
 Implementation Issues in SMEs 
 Most of the social commerce implementation examples pro-
vided here and in other books involve large companies. The 
same is true of success stories provided by software vendors. 
An interesting question is: What are small and medium 
enterprises doing in social commerce? According to several 
reports (e.g., Leggatt  2010 ), even small companies can suc-
ceed in social commerce. We demonstrate this via the fol-
lowing examples. 
 Examples: Small Businesses Conducting Social 
Commerce on Facebook 
 Here are four examples of how small businesses are using 
social media (see Lai  2011 ):
•  The photographer and owner of Studio Seven, Lydia 
Schuster, started her business solely on the belief that 
Facebook would work for her. She had more than 600 
Facebook friends and had always received positive feed-
back about the photos she posted on her personal 
Facebook page. She then started her Facebook business 
page; to attract customers, she offered some incentives, 
such as the ﬁ rst person who reviewed a new photo would 
get a photo sitting at no charge. As her reputation grew, 
she started acquiring more fans, and her photos received 
thousands of votes. Schuster said she thinks that people 
today look on photographers’ Facebook pages instead of 
•  The absolute and relative size of the social com-
merce workforce 
•  The nature of the social commerce projects (e.g., 
marketing, recruiting) 
•  The existing organizational structure of the 
company 
•  Whether or not the company is a pure-play Internet 
company (only existing online)  
•   The nature of the products/services sold by the 
company 
•  The internal politics of the organization 
•  The budget of the social commerce workforce 
•  Effective communications that inform various 
stakeholders of the reasons for the change (Why?), 
the beneﬁ ts of successful implementation (What is 
in it for us, and you?) as well as the details of the 
change (When? Where? Who is involved? How 
much will it cost? etc.). 
•  Devise an effective education, training and/or skills 
upgrading scheme for the organization. 
•  Counter resistance from the employees of compa-
nies and align them to overall strategic direction of 
the organization. 
•  Provide personal counselling (if required) to allevi-
ate any change-related fears. 
•  Monitoring of the implementation and ﬁ ne-tuning 
as required.” 
•  Adoption of technology.

 Some Strategy Issues for SMEs 
 There are several strategic issues that SMEs may need to 
address. Here are some related questions, some of which 
apply to large companies as well.
•  Which is better for social media marketing: Facebook, 
Twitter, or others? 
•  How do you select a social media site(s) on which to 
advertise or sell? 
•  Do you need an internal private network? Why or why 
not? 
•  How do you generate constant trafﬁ c to your social com-
merce site? See ﬁ ve ways of doing so at  ecommerce-
weekly.com/tips/5-tips-to-increase-traffic-to-your-e-
commerce- site  . For seven strategies to increase trafﬁ c, 
see 
 postcron.com/en/blog/e-commerce-7-strategies-
increase-trafﬁ c-visibility- sales  . 
•  How can social media work for small businesses? How 
can a company with a page in a social network have a suf-
ﬁ cient number of fans and friends and have these people 
participate? 
 For a discussion on these questions, see Macarthy ( 2013 ) 
and Gratton and Gratton ( 2012 ). 
 A Small Number of Followers 
 One of the biggest challenges for almost all brands is the 
number of followers garnered by the brand. Unless a brand 
has a national reputation like Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and 
McDonald’s, it may not be easy for the brand to acquire mil-
lions of fans. Hiring a consultant to help is not a bad idea, but 
it may be expensive for small and even some medium com-
panies. Reading books, surﬁ ng the Internet, and posting 
questions asking what to do on Yahoo’s “Answers” and other 
Q&A sites, can help. Another way to draw trafﬁ c is to build 
a “thought leaders within their niche” and show your exper-
tise in social media by answering questions on Q&A sites, 
reviewing books on your specialty, writing blogs, and post-
ing slide show presentations and videos on YouTube. 
 Risk Factors and Analysis 
 Although social commerce presents many opportunities for 
organizations, its deployment may involve some potential 
risks and possible complex implementation issues (Steinhart 
 2009 ). Concerns and issues are related to both companies 
engaged in social commerce activities and to individuals 
who participate in them. 
 Interfacing with social media is not without risks. Aligning 
a product or a company with sites where content is user-gen-
erated and has not been checked or ﬁ ltered, may introduce 
some risk. A company is a good candidate for social com-
merce if it has positive customer relationships and strong 
positive feedback, and if it is willing to have customers share 
this feedback, whether it is good or bad. If, however, the 
company worries about what its customers might say, the 
business may not be ready for social commerce. 
 Another potential risk is a bias due to a few contributors 
submitting most of the content. For example, in an analysis 
of thousands of submissions over a 3-week period on the 
site Digg.com, the  Wall Street Journal reported that one-
third of the stories that made it to Digg’s homepage were 
submitted by 30 contributors (out of 900,000 registered 
members), and that a single user on Netscape was respon-
sible for 13 % of all stories that reached the most popular 
list the top posts on that site. Such distribution may result in 
bias in any user-generated content, see  wsj.com/articles/
SB117106531769704150 .

 SUCCESSES, FAILURES, 
AND LESSONS LEARNED 
 Many vendors, consultants, and experts try to assist compa-
nies to succeed in deploying social commerce. Here are 
some representative issues and sources for further study. 
 A Strategy for Social Commerce 
Implementation Success 
 To succeed in implementing a social commerce project, 
especially in medium and large companies, an implementa-
tion process needs to be properly planned with a deployment 
strategy. A popular deployment strategy involves four steps: 
(1) Learn and understand the environment inside and outside 
the organization; (2) Experiment with a small-scale project 
so you can observe and learn before taking a large risk; (3) 
Assess the results of the experiment; and (4) Develop or 
abandon the project. 
 Similar steps are proposed by Gombert ( 2010 ): Evaluate 
opportunities, prepare a plan, engage your audience, and 
measure results. For some guidelines, see Wollan et al. 
( 2011 ). 
 There are many ways to execute the previous strategy 
(Shih  2011 ). For example, a strategy that integrates social 
media with e-commerce can drive revenue growth, expand 
brand awareness, and increase customer loyalty and 
satisfaction. 
 Some Policies and Guidelines 
 It is useful for a company that is engaged in social commerce 
to have guidelines and policies regarding SC technologies. 
Several examples can be found at Macarthy ( 2013 ), and at 
Giordano ( 2014 ). For 57 different social media policies and 
resources, see  socialmediatoday.com/content/57-social- 
media-policy-examples-and-resources and Gratton and 
Gratton ( 2012 ). For guidelines to getting a business on the 
top social network sites, including Facebook and Twitter, see 
Williams and Klein ( 2014 ). 
 Learning from Failures 
 One can learn from both success stories (available at many 
vendors’ websites) and failures. 
 Example: Walmart’s In-House Social Network 
 In 2006, Walmart launched a social network similar to 
MySpace in order to target younger consumers. The company 
hired professional actors to pose as teens on the site; how-
ever, the actors were “not–so–hip” and young people were 
not impressed. In addition, in an attempt to avoid potential 
lawsuits, Walmart allowed parents to control page content, 
which turned off the young viewers. Walmart pulled down 
the site after a short time. (See  blogherald.com/2006/10/02/
w a l - m a r t s - a t t e m p t s - a t - c o p y i n g - m y s p a c e -
go-down-in- ﬂ ames .) Today, Walmart actively uses Pinterest, 
Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. For guidelines, see  corporate.
walmart.com/social-media-guidelines .  
 For other examples of failures, download the free white 
paper “5 Biggest Blunders to Avoid with Enterprise Social 
Software” at  socialtext.com/solutions/wp-social-software- 
blunders.php . For the example of Starbucks’ Foursquare 
failure, see Teicher ( 2010 ). For 13 brand and enterprise 
social media mistakes, see  solutions/wp-social-software- 
blunders.php . 
 For 15 lessons of failing social media strategies, see 
Liubarets ( 2013 ). 
 Adoption Strategies 
 Many companies, consultants, vendors, and researchers pro-
vide tips, guidelines, and recipes for success. For example, 
Dion Hinchcliffe offers adoption strategies at  ebizq.net/
blogs/enterprise/2011/09/ﬁ ve_emergent_strategies_for_
social_business.php . 
 Revenue Generation Strategies 
in Social Commerce 
 The success of social commerce depends on the ability to 
generate revenue and on the ability to solve problems. The 
following are some interesting ways social media generates 
revenue (see the social commerce business models in 
Chap.   1 and Primer A for a more complete list):
 1.  Offer premium service to individuals for a monthly or 
per-service fee. 
 2.  Partner with organizations that pay a monthly service fee. 
 3.  Create afﬁ liations with physical venues where members 
can meet (e.g.,  meetup.com ). Physical venues, such as 
coffee shops, may have to pay a fee to be afﬁ liated with 
social media. 
 Increased Revenue and Its Beneﬁ ts 
 Web 2.0 tools can generate revenue growth, user growth, and 
increased resistance to competition in indirect ways, which, 
in turn, leads to increased subscriptions, advertising, and 
commission revenue.

 THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL COMMERCE 
 Many researchers and consultants are speculating on the 
future of SC (e.g.,  adage.com/article/the-media-guy/
reasons- google-exploding-hurt-facebook/228851 , 
Shih 
( 2011 ), and  siliconprairienews.com/2010/07/lava-row-s- 
nathan-wright-predicts-future-of-social-media ). The pre-
dictions are diverse, ranging from “SC will dominate EC” to 
“it is a buzz word and will disappear soon.” The problem is 
that there are many drivers of SC. Tzeng ( 2014 ) lists ten sta-
tistics that drive the future. These include  consumer trust , 
 better shopping experience ,  future markets,  and the  future of 
e-commerce in general. Given the popularity of Facebook, 
Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, social games, social shopping, 
and social advertising, it is difﬁ cult to side with the pessimis-
tic predictions. It looks as if mobile social commerce will be 
a major area of growth. Also, several of the social shopping 
and social collaboration models could be very successful. In 
the enterprise area, there is a trend to have a “social as a ser-
vice” rather than as an application approach (due to the inﬂ u-
ence of cloud computing). For stats and trends of social 
commerce in the U.S. (2014) looking ahead to 2015—or pro-
jecting trends in 2015, see  adweek.com/socialtimes/
social-commerce-stats-trends/500895?red=at . 
 Creation of Jobs 
 Social commerce and media companies are creating a huge 
number of jobs with many opportunities emerging. As of 
2015, skilled SC employees have been in large demand, 
commanding very high starting salaries.  
 IBM’s Watson, Smart Computing and Social 
Commerce 
 There are many opinions on what the future of SC will be. 
Instead of presenting them, we decided to end this chapter 
by looking at IBM’s Watson supercomputer's cognitive 
technology. In February 2011, IBM’s Watson won a 
 Jeopardy 3-day tournament against two world champions. 
This was a great achievement for what IBM calls Social 
Business and Smart Computing. Aided by intelligent sys-
tems such as IBM’s Pure Systems, Watson will be able to do 
much more. According to  ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/
ibmwatson , Watson may assist people in the following 
social commerce- related tasks:
•  Personal investment advisor. There is no need to con-
duct research any longer. All you have to do is to state 
your 
investment 
goals 
and 
Watson 
will 
make 
 recommendations after checking all the needed input 
data. Given what goals you have, Watson can ﬁ gure out 
what you need, recommending what to buy or sell. Upon 
your approval, Watson can conclude the deal for you. 
•  Language translator.  In SC, in order to exploit global 
opportunities, we sometimes need language translation 
for introducing websites to people who understand other 
languages. We need it also for translating a natural human 
language to a language that a computer can understand. 
Today’s automatic machine translation is not optimal, but 
it is improving. Computer systems, such as IBM’s Watson, 
have powerful natural language processors that are get-
ting even better with time, and thus providing better 
machine translation. 
•  Customer service. Providing technical support is critical 
for success (e.g., see the iRobot case in Chap.   7 ). Watson’s 
intelligence will enable automatic guides for people who 
need help, taking them through all the necessary steps. 
The service will be consistent, top quality, and available 
in real time. 
•  Q&A service. Watson will provide the best answers to 
any business, medical, legal, or personal question you 
have. It can answer any question and subsequent 
subquestions. 
•  Matchmaking. Watson can match sellers and buyers, 
products and markets, job seekers and job offers, partners 
to bartering, P2P lending participants or any other match 
you can think of. For example, Watson will be able to ﬁ nd 
you a contact who will ﬁ t your stated goals. 
•  Other applications . Engagement advisor or discovery 
advisor, in industries such as healthcare, ﬁ nance, retail, 
and the public sector. see  ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/
ibmwatson/implement-watson.html . Watson, a Smarter 
Planet innovation, is related to IBM’s Smarter Commerce 
activities (see  ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_
commerce/overview ; for a full description, see Lawinski 
(2011) and  ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/
offerings.html ). 
 Conclusion 
 The commercial aspects of social networking are rapidly 
increasing. Facebook is making billions in revenue and prof-
its. Social commerce is continuously changing the face of 
marketing (including advertising), customer service, market-
ing research, collaboration and more. For a discussion, see 
Fallon ( 2014 ), and Sickles ( 2014 ). 
 Overall, 
Quora 
( quora.com/what-is-the-future-of- 
social-commerce ) predicts the total market of SC to be $14 
billion in 2015 (up from $9 billion in 2014), a 55 % increase. 
Yet, it is only 5 % of the total e-commerce 2015 estimate. 
But with a growth rate four times that of e-commerce, the 
future is very bright.  
11 Implementing Social Commerce Systems

 SUMMARY 
 In this chapter, you learned about the following SC topics as 
they relate to the chapter’s learning objectives.
 1.  The major issues of social commerce implementation. 
Four major categories exist for implementation: justiﬁ ca-
tion and economics (cost–beneﬁ t); acquiring and/or 
developing the social commerce systems; assurance of 
organizational readiness and performance of necessary 
restructuring, training, and so forth; and cultivating the 
necessary success factors while avoiding the mistakes. 
The process of implementing social commerce, and the 
issues involved, are similar to those of e-commerce and 
IT. The issues can be divided into technical issues (e.g., 
security, systems integration, scalability, appropriate 
design) and nontechnical issues (e.g., justiﬁ cation, 
employee resistance to contribute and use social network-
ing, lack of management support, lack of resources, risk 
mitigation, and training). Companies need to conduct a 
cost–beneﬁ t analysis of each project, including risk miti-
gation. Implementation is an important step in corporate 
strategy toward social networking and social media 
participation. 
 2.  Internet fraud, phishing, and spam.  A large variety of 
Internet crimes exist. Notable examples are identity theft 
and misuse, stock market fraud, get-rich-quick scams, 
malware, and phishing. Personal information is acquired 
from people by persuasion (e.g., masquerading as a trust-
worthy entity) and tricks, and that information is then 
sold to criminals who use it to commit ﬁ nancial crimes, 
such as fraudulently transferring money to fake accounts. 
A related area is the use of unsolicited advertising or sales 
via spam. 
 3.  Legal, privacy, and ethical issues. Issues of privacy, eth-
ics, and legal exposure may seem tangential to running a 
business, but ignoring them puts a company at risk for 
issues such as offending customers and disrupting opera-
tions. Social commerce operations are subject to various 
types of intellectual property (IP) laws. IP law provides 
companies with ways to be compensated for damages or 
misuse of their property rights. A social commerce 
 company needs a well-established principle of protecting 
customer privacy: Notify customers before collecting 
their personal information; inform them about content 
and so on; obtain consent regarding the type and extent of 
disclosures; make sure the data are accurate and securely 
managed; and apply some method of enforcement and 
remedy to deter privacy breaches. In this manner, the 
company can avoid litigation and gain the long-term trust 
of customers. 
 4.  The major technological issues. The major technologi-
cal issues include the integration of the SC system with 
other information systems (including supply chain-related 
systems), the platforms provided by social networks, the 
major support software tools, and the alternative for sys-
tems acquisition. 
 Because of their cost and complexity, large social 
commerce sites need to be developed in a systematic 
fashion. The development of a social commerce site 
should proceed in steps. First, a social commerce applica-
tion portfolio is deﬁ ned based on an organization’s strat-
egy. Seconds, the social commerce architecture is created. 
Third, a decision needs to be made whether to build, buy, 
or outsource the development. Fourth, the system is 
installed, tested, and deployed. Finally, the system goes 
into operation and maintenance mode, with changes 
being made continuously to ensure the system’s continu-
ing success. 
 5.  The major employee-related issues. These major issues 
are: (1) employees using social media sites for non-work- 
related uses during working hours, and how to control 
such use, (2) employee reluctance to participate and con-
tribute to the use of social media, and (3) the quality of 
employee-generated content, and data leakage by employ-
ees (intentional or unintentional). Related to these prob-
lems are solutions that include content monitoring, social 
media conduct policies, and the deployment of manage-
ment controls. 
 Companies should expect organizational changes in 
all functional areas once e-commerce reaches momen-
tum. Change is particularly evident in the ﬁ nancial ser-
vices sector, where additional services are continuously 
offered online. Social marketing and shopping are other 
areas with major potential changes (especially in 
F- commerce). E-procurement is changing the purchasing 
business processes, while afﬁ liate programs are changing 
the paradigm of marketing and business partnerships, and 
social CRM is changing customer service.  
 6.  Organizational impacts. The topics in this category 
include improving marketing and sales, transforming a 
traditional business to a social one, developing organiza-
tional learning, restructuring of business processes, con-
ducting change management, and organizing a social 
commerce unit in the enterprise. 
 7.  Other implementation issues. Several other implemen-
tation issues need to be considered. For example, the 
issue of deploying SC systems in SMEs is important. This 
includes the role of social networks and the strategy to be 
adopted. Another issue is how to increase the number of 
fans or followers in a social network. Next is the issue of 
risks. 
 There are several potential risks in deploying social 
commerce projects in organizations and/or when using 
public social networks. The major risks and concerns are 
invasion of privacy, opening the gate for hackers, misuse

of time and computing resources, revealing an organiza-
tion’s conﬁ dential information, introducing inappropriate 
or inaccurate content, the possibility of negative reviews, 
and the possibility of biased content by a few contributors 
(including bloggers) who supply a large portion of SC 
content. 
 8.  Successes and failures of social commerce. Strategies 
for the successes of, and ideas on how to eliminate fail-
ures in, social commerce implementation are essential. 
One area to consider is the use of appropriate policies and 
guidelines. Also important are the adoption strategies and 
the revenue generation strategies. 
 9.  The future of social commerce. Social commerce is 
growing rapidly both as an addition to traditional EC and 
IT and as a standalone ﬁ eld. A major area of growth is that 
of mobility both within the enterprise and in sales. A spe-
cial area of growth involves intelligent and smart socially-
based computing. This expansion will occur via social 
networks and in innovative SC apps.

 Primer A: E-Commerce Basics  
 1.  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE: DEFINITIONS 
AND CONCEPTS 
 The ﬁ eld of electronic commerce (EC) is diversiﬁ ed and has 
several deﬁ nitions. 
 Deﬁ ning Electronic Commerce 
 A common deﬁ nition of  electronic commerce (EC) is the 
process of buying, selling, transferring, or exchanging prod-
ucts, services, and/or information via computer networks, 
mostly the Internet and intranets. For an overview, see  en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce . EC is often confused 
with e-business. 
 What Is E-Business 
 Some people view the term  commerce as describing only 
buying and selling transactions conducted between business 
partners. If this deﬁ nition of commerce is used, the term 
 electronic commerce would be fairly narrow. Thus, many 
use the term  e-business  instead.  E-business refers to a 
broader deﬁ nition of EC, not just the buying and selling of 
goods and services, but doing all kinds of business transac-
tions online, such as servicing customers, collaborating 
with business partners, conducting e-learning, and support-
ing electronic transactions within an organization. In this 
primer, we use the broadest meaning of electronic com-
merce, which is basically equivalent to the broadest deﬁ ni-
tion of e-business. The two terms will be used interchangeably 
throughout the primer.

 Major EC Concepts 
 Several concepts are frequently used in conjunction with 
EC. The major ones are as follows: 
  Pure Versus Partial EC 
 EC can be either pure or partial, depending on the nature of 
its three major activities: ordering and payments, order ful-
ﬁ llment, and delivery to customers. Each activity can be 
physical or digital. Thus, there are eight possible combina-
tions as shown in Table  A.1 . If all activities are digital, we 
have pure EC, if none are digital, we have no EC, otherwise, 
we have partial EC.
  If there is at least one digital dimension, we consider 
the situation EC, but only partial EC. For example, pur-
chasing a computer from Dell’s website or a book from 
Amazon.com is partial EC, because the merchandise is 
physically delivered. However, buying an e-book from 
Amazon.com or a software product from Buy.com is pure 
EC, because ordering, processing, and delivery to the 
buyer are all digitally accomplished. Note that many com-
panies operate in partial EC. For example, Jaguar has a 
3-D application for self-conﬁ guration of cars online, prior 
to ordering (see Vizard 2013). For a video titled 
“Introduction to E-Commerce,” see  plunkettresearch.
com/video/ecommerce .  
 EC Organizations 
 Purely physical organizations (companies) are referred to 
as  brick-and-mortar (old economy) organizations , 
whereas companies that are engaged only in EC are con-
sidered  virtual (pure-play) organizations. Click-and-
mortar (click-and- brick) organizations are those that 
conduct some EC activities, usually as an additional mar-
keting channel. Gradually, many brick-and-mortar com-
panies are changing to click-and-mortar ones (e.g., 
Walmart, Target).  
 Electronic Markets and Networks 
 EC can be conducted in an  electronic market (e-marketplace) 
where buyers and sellers meet online to exchange goods, 
services, money, or information. Any individual company or 
even a person can also open a webstore selling products or 
services. Electronic markets are connecting sellers and buy-
ers via the Internet or via its counterpart within organiza-
tions, an  intranet . An  intranet is a corporate or government 
internal network that uses Internet tools, such as Web brows-
ers, and Internet protocols. Another EC computer environ-
ment is an  extranet , a network that uses the Internet to link 
intranets of several organizations in a secure manner (see  en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Extranet ). 
 2.  THE CONTENT AND FRAMEWORK 
OF THE FIELD 
 To illustrate the content of the EC ﬁ eld, let us look at Dell 
Computers. 
 Dell is selling computers online in several ways. Most of 
Dell’s sales are either business-to-consumer (B2C) or 
business- to-business (B2B). In B2C, online transactions are 
made between businesses and individual consumers, such as 
when a person purchases a dress at  net-a-porter.com or a 
computer at Dell. In B2B, businesses make online transac-
tions with other businesses, such as when Dell sells to busi-
nesses or purchases materials from suppliers. For more types 
see Turban et al. (2015). 
 AN EC FRAMEWORK 
 The EC ﬁ eld is a diverse one, involving many activities, 
organizational units, and technologies. Therefore, a frame-
work that describes its contents can be useful. Figure  A.1 
introduces one such framework.
 As shown in the ﬁ gure, there are many EC applications 
(top of the ﬁ gure), several of which are illustrated throughout 
the Primer (see Plunkett et al. 2014). To execute these appli-
cations, companies need the right information, infrastruc-
ture, and support services. Figure  A.1 shows that EC 
applications are supported by an infrastructure and by the 
following ﬁ ve support areas (shown as pillars in the ﬁ gure):

•  Public policy. Legal and other policy and regula-
tory issues, such as privacy protection and taxation, 
are determined by governments. Included as part of 
public policy is the issue of technical  standards, 
which are established by governments and/or indus-
try-mandated policy-making groups. Compliance 
with regulations is an important issue.  
•  Marketing and advertising. Like any other busi-
ness, EC usually requires the support of marketing 
and advertising. This is especially important in B2C 
online transactions, in which the buyers and sellers 
usually do not know each other. 
•  Support services. Many services are needed to 
support EC. These range from content creation to 
payments to order delivery. 
•  Business partnerships. Joint ventures, exchanges, 
and business partnerships of various types are 
common in EC. These occur frequently throughout 
the  supply chain (i.e., the interactions between a 
company and its suppliers, customers, and other 
partners).   
 
Primer A: E-Commerce Basics

 The infrastructure for EC is shown at the bottom of the 
ﬁ gure and it describes the hardware, software, and networks 
used in EC. All of these components require good  manage-
ment practices . This means that companies need to plan, 
organize, motivate, devise strategy, and restructure pro-
cesses, as needed, to optimize the business use of EC models 
and strategies. 
 3.  THE TYPES OF E-COMMERCE 
TRANSACTIONS 
 A common classiﬁ cation of EC is by the nature of the trans-
actions or the relationship among the participants. The major 
types of EC transactions are listed below. 
 Business-to-Business (B2B) 
 All 
the 
participants 
in 
 business-to-business 
(B2B) 
e- commerce are either businesses or other organizations (see 
Wirthwein and Bannon 2014). Today, about 85 % of EC vol-
ume is B2B. For Dell, the entire wholesale transactions are 
B2B. Dell buys almost all of its parts through e-commerce, 
and sells its products to businesses (and individuals) using 
e-commerce. 
 Business-to-Consumer (B2C) 
 Business-to-consumer (B2C) EC includes retail transactions 
of products or services, from businesses to individual shop-
pers. The typical shopper at Amazon.com is an individual. 
B2C is also called  e-tailing . 
 Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) 
 In  business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) EC, a business 
provides some product or service to a client business. The cli-
ent business maintains its own customers, who may be its 
own employees or business partners, to whom the product or 
service is provided. An example is  godiva.com . The com-
pany sells chocolates directly to business customers. Those 
businesses may then give the chocolates as gifts or sell them 
to employees or to other businesses. Godiva may mail the 
chocolate directly to the recipients (with compliments of…).  
 Consumer-to-Business (C2B) 
 The  consumer-to-business (C2B) category includes individu-
als who use the Internet to offer products or services to busi-
ness (e.g., a consumer may offer to buy an  airline ticket at a 
certain price, or higher). Then a seller may accept or reject 
the offer. (Priceline administers this type of C2B.) 
 Intrabusiness EC 
 The  intrabusiness EC category includes all internal EC orga-
nizational activities that involve the exchange of goods, ser-
vices, or information among various units and individuals in 
that organization. Activities can range from selling corporate 
products to one’s employees, to online training, and to col-
laborative design efforts. 
 Business-to-Employees (B2E) 
 The  business-to-employees (B2E) category is a subset of the 
intrabusiness group in which an organization delivers ser-
vices, information, or products to individual employees. A 
major category of employees is  mobile employees , such as 
ﬁ eld representatives or repair services that go to customers. 
EC support to such employees is also called  business-to- 
mobile employees (B2ME). 
 Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) 
 In the  consumer-to-consumer (C2C) category (sometimes 
refered to as person-to-person, P2P) consumers transact 
directly with other consumers. Examples of C2C include 
individuals selling residential property, cars, and so on in 
online classiﬁ ed ads. EBay’s auctions and sales are mostly 
C2C, and so are the classiﬁ ed ads at Craigslist. The 
 advertising of personal services over the Internet and the 
online selling of knowledge and expertise are other examples 
of C2C. 
 Collaborative Commerce 
 When individuals or groups communicate or collaborate 
online, they may be engaged in  collaborative commerce 
(c-commerce) . For example, business partners in different 
locations may design a product together using collaborative 
software and online procedures. 
 E-Government 
 In  e-government EC , a government entity buys or provides 
goods, services, or information from or to businesses (G2B) 
or from or to individual citizens (G2C). Governments can 
deal also with other governments (G2G). 
 The previous categories are summarized in Fig.  A.2 .

 The Interdisciplinary Nature of EC 
 Because EC is a relatively new ﬁ eld, it is just now developing 
its theoretical and scientiﬁ c foundations. From just the brief 
overview of the EC framework and classiﬁ cation, you can 
probably see that EC is related to several different disciplines. 
The major academic EC disciplines include the following: 
 accounting, business law, computer science, consumer behav-
ior, economics, engineering, ﬁ nance, human resource man-
agement, management, management  information systems, 
marketing, public administration, and  robotics.  
 4.  CAPABILITIES, BENEFITS, LIMITATIONS, 
AND DRIVERS OF E-COMMERCE 
 EC initiatives play an increasing role in supporting innova-
tions and strategies that help companies to compete and 
ﬂ ourish, especially companies that want to be proactive and 
introduce changes rather than be reactive and respond to 
them. What makes EC suitable for such a role is a  set of 
capabilities which are presented next. 
 The Capabilities of E-Commerce 
 The essential capabilities that drive EC are the ability to: 
 Fig. A.2   Categories of e-commerce transactions 
•  Provide 
efﬁ cient 
and 
effective 
business 
transactions. 
•  Provide global reach for selling, buying, or ﬁ nding 
business partners. 
•  Conduct business anytime, from anywhere, in a 
convenient way. For example, there were about 2 
billion smartphones in use in 2015 in the world. For 
comprehensive statistics and descriptions see 
Mobithinking (2014).  
•  Disseminate information rapidly, frequently in real 
time. 
•  Compare prices. 
•  Customize products and personalize services. 
•  Use rich media in advertisement, entertainment, 
and social networking. 
•  Receive 
experts’ 
and 
other 
users’ 
advice 
quickly. 
•  Collaborate in different ways, both internally and 
externally. 
•  Share information and knowledge. 
•  Increase productivity and performance, reduce 
costs, and compress time (e.g., by having smarter 
applications). 
•  Fing information about vendors, products, and 
competitors easily and quickly.

 Because EC technology is improving over time and 
decreasing in cost, its comparative advantage over manual 
systems is continuously increasing, further contributing to 
the growth of EC. 
 Beneﬁ ts and Limitations of Electronic 
Commerce 
 Few innovations in human history encompass as many ben-
eﬁ ts as EC does. The global nature of the technology, the 
opportunity to reach hundreds of millions of people, its inter-
active nature, the variety of possibilities for its use, and the 
resourcefulness and rapid growth of its supporting infra-
structures, especially the Web, result in many potential 
 beneﬁ ts to organizations, individuals, and society. These 
beneﬁ ts are just starting to materialize, but they will increase 
signiﬁ cantly as EC expands. It is not surprising that some 
maintain that the EC revolution is as profound as the change 
that accompanied the Industrial Revolution. The major ben-
eﬁ ts are summarized in Table  A.2 .
 The Limitations and Barriers of EC 
 Barriers to EC can be classiﬁ ed as either technological or 
non technological. The technological ones are declining 
with time. 
 The major barriers to EC are: (1) resistance to new 
 technology; (2) implementation difﬁ culties; (3) security

ers’ perspective ( customers’ value proposition ). 
concerns; (4) lack of technology skills by buyers; (5) lack 
of potential customers; (6) cost; (7) insufﬁ cient bandwidth; 
(8) cultural barriers; and (9) an incomplete set of standards. 
The barriers can be classiﬁ ed into: sectoral barriers 
(e.g., 
government, 
private 
sector, 
international 
 organizations); enterprise internal barriers (e.g., poor secu-
rity, lack of technical knowledge, incomplete B2B inter-
face, and lack of time and resources); external barriers 
(e.g., lack of government support); cultural barriers; orga-
nizational differences; international trade barriers; and lack 
of EC standards. These limitations need to be addressed 
when implementing EC.  
 Drivers of E-Commerce 
 The tremendous explosion of EC can be explained by its 
drivers and characteristics, beneﬁ ts, and by changes in the 
business environment.  
 Although EC is only about 20 years old, it is expected to 
have non-stoppable growth and expand consistently into 
new areas of our life. The question is why? What drives EC? 
 The Major Drivers of EC 
 EC is driven by many factors depending on the industry, 
company, and application involved. The major drivers are 
shown in the self-explanatory Fig.  A.3 .
 5.  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE BUSINESS 
MODELS 
 One of the major characteristics of EC is that it enables the 
creation of new business models. A  business model is a 
method of doing business by which a company can generate 
revenue to sustain itself. A model also spells out where the 
company is positioned in the value chain; that is, by what 
activities the company adds value to the product or service it 
supplies. 
 Note that, the January-February 2011 issue of  Harvard 
Business Review is dedicated to business model innovations 
(ﬁ ve articles), including several topics related to e-commerce. 
 THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES 
OF BUSINESS MODELS 
 Several different EC business models are possible, depend-
ing on the company, the industry, and so on. 
 A comprehensive business model is composed of the fol-
lowing elements: 
 
Primer A: E-Commerce Basics

300
 Models also include a  value proposition, which is an anal-
ysis of the beneﬁ ts of using the speciﬁ c model (tangible and 
intangible), for both customers and organization. A detailed 
discussion of and examples of business models and their 
relationship to business plans is presented at  en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Business_model . 
 This Primer presents two of a model’s elements:  revenue 
models and  value propositions . 
 Revenue Models 
 A revenue model outlines how an organization, or an EC 
project, will generate revenue. It includes costs as well. 
 SALES 
 Companies generate revenue from selling merchandise 
or services on their websites. For example, Amazon.
com and Godiva that sell products online. 
 TRANSACTION FEES 
 A company receives a commission based on the vol-
ume of transactions made. For example, when a home-
owner sells a house, he or she typically pays a 
 SUBSCRIPTION FEES 
 Customers pay a ﬁ xed amount, usually monthly, to get 
some type of service. An example would be the Internet 
access fee. Thus, the Internet provider’s primary revenue 
model is subscription fees (ﬁ xed monthly payments). 
 ADVERTISING FEES 
 Companies charge others for allowing them to place a 
banner or other ad on their sites. 
 AFFILIATE FEES 
 Companies receive commissions for referring custom-
ers to others’ websites. A good afﬁ liate program is 
available at Amazon.com. 
 LICENSING FEES 
 Another revenue source is licensing fees (e.g., see 
 progress.com/datadrect ). Licensing fees can be 
assessed as a monthly or annual fee or a per usage fee. 
Microsoft receives fees from each workstation that 
uses Windows NT, for example. 
 OTHER REVENUE SOURCES 
 Some companies allow people to play online games 
for a fee or to watch a sports competition in real time 
for a fee (e.g., see  espn.go.com ). 
•  A description of all  products and  services the 
 business will offer and the markets in which they 
will be sold. 
•  A description of the  business process that is required 
to make and deliver the products and services 
including distribution and marketing strategies.  
•  A list of the  resources required and the identiﬁ ca-
tion of which ones are available, which will be 
developed in-house, and which will need to be 
acquired (including human resources).  
•  A description of the organization’s  supply chain , 
including  suppliers and other  business partners. 
•  A list of the major competitors, their market share, 
and strengths/weaknesses. 
•  The competitive advantage offered by the business 
model. 
•  The anticipated organizational changes and any 
resistance to change.

model ), anticipated costs, sources of ﬁ nancing, and

transaction fee to the broker. The higher the value of 
the sale, the higher the total transaction fee. 
Alternatively, transaction fees can be levied  per trans-
action . With online stock trades, for example, there is 
usually a ﬁ xed fee per trade, regardless of the volume. 
Primer A: E-Commerce Basics

301
 A company uses its  revenue model to describe how it will 
generate revenue and its  business model to describe the  pro-
cess it will use to do so. The Internet allows for innovative 
revenue models. 
 The revenue model can be part of the value proposition or 
it may supplement it.  
 Value Proposition 
 Business models also include a value-proposition state-
ment. A  value proposition refers to the beneﬁ ts, including 
the intangible, non-quantitative ones, that a company can 
derive from using the model. In B2C EC, for example, a 
value proposition deﬁ nes how a company’s product or ser-
vice fulﬁ lls the needs of customers. The  value proposition 
is an important part of the marketing plan of any product 
or service.  
 Functions of a Business Model 
 Business models have the following functions or objectives: 
 Typical EC Business Models 
 There are many types of EC business models. Examples and 
details of EC business models can be found in Rappa (2010), 
 slideshare.net/kaiser2009/e-businessmodels-ppt , and Turban 
et al. (2015). The following four common models followed by 
some less common ones (# 5–18) are:
  1.  Online direct marketing. The most obvious model is 
that of selling products or services online. Sales may be 
from a  manufacturer to a customer, eliminating interme-
diaries or physical stores (e.g., Dell Computer), or from 
 retailers to consumers, making distribution more efﬁ -
cient (e.g., Walmart online). This model is especially 
efﬁ cient for digitizable products and services (those that 
can be delivered electronically). This model has several 
variations and it uses different mechanisms (e.g., auc-
tions). It is practiced in B2C (where it is called  e-tailing ) 
and in several B2B types of EC (e.g., e-procurement, 
e-wholesale). 
  2.  Electronic tendering systems. Large organizational 
buyers, private or public, usually make large-volume or 
large-value purchases through a  tendering (bidding) sys-
tem , also known as a  reverse auction . Such tendering 
can be done online, saving time and money. Pioneered 
by General Electric Corp., e-tendering systems are gain-
ing popularity. Indeed, several government agencies 
mandate that most of their procurement  must be done 
through e-tendering.  
  3.  Electronic marketplaces and exchanges. Electronic 
marketplaces existed in isolated applications for decades 
(e.g., stock and commodities exchanges). But as of 
1996, hundreds of e-marketplaces (old and new) have 
introduced new methods and efﬁ ciencies to the trading 
process. If they are well organized and managed, 
e- marketplaces can provide signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts to both 
buyers and sellers. Of special interest are vertical mar-
ketplaces that concentrate on one industry. 
  4.  Viral marketing. According to the viral marketing 
model, people use e-mail and social networks for spread-
ing word-of-mouth advertising. Thus, an organization 
can increase brand awareness, or even generate sales, by 
inducing people to send inﬂ uencing messages to other 
people or to recruit friends to join certain programs. It is 
basically Web-based  word-of-mouth advertising, and it 
is popular in social networks.  
  5.  Name your own price. Pioneered by Priceline.com, the 
name-your-own-price model allows buyers to set the 
price they are willing to pay for a speciﬁ c product or 
service. Priceline.com will try to match a customer’s 
request with a supplier willing to sell the product or ser-
vice at that price. This model is also known as a  demand- 
collection model . 
  6.  Find the best price. According to this model, also 
known as a search engine model, a customer speciﬁ es a 
need and then an intermediate company, such as Hotwire.
com, matches the customer’s need against a database, 
locates the lowest price, and submits it to the consumer. 
The potential buyer then has 30–60 minutes to accept or 
reject the offer. A variation of this model is available for 
purchasing insurance: A consumer can  submit a request 
•  Describe the major business processes of a 
company. 
•  Describe the business’s (the venture’s) positioning 
within the value network linking suppliers and cus-
tomers (includes identiﬁ cation of potential comple-
mentary companies and competitors). Also, 
describe the supply and value chains.  
•  Formulate the venture’s competitive strategy and its 
long-range plans. 
•  Articulate a customer value proposition. 
•  Identify a market segment (who will use the tech-
nology for what purpose).  
•  Specify the revenue-generation process; where the 
company will operate. 
•  Deﬁ ne the venture’s speciﬁ c value chain structure. 
•  Estimate the cost structure and amount, and the 
proﬁ t potential.

for insurance to Insweb.com and receive several quotes. 
Many companies employ similar models to show  price 
comparisons and ﬁ nd the lowest price. For example, 
consumers can go to  eloan.com to ﬁ nd the best interest 
rate for auto or home loans. A well-known company in 
this area is Shopping.com.  
  7.  Afﬁ liate marketing. Afﬁ liate marketing is an arrange-
ment whereby a marketing partner (a business, an orga-
nization, or even an individual) refers consumers to a 
selling company’s website. The referral is done by plac-
ing a banner ad or the logo of the selling company on the 
afﬁ liated company’s website. Whenever a customer who 
was referred to the selling company’s website makes a 
purchase there, the afﬁ liated partner receives a commis-
sion (which may range from 3 to 15 %) of the purchase 
price. In other words, by using afﬁ liate marketing, a sell-
ing company creates a virtual commissioned sales force. 
Pioneered by CDNow, the concept is now employed by 
thousands of retailers and manufacturers. For example, 
Amazon.com has over one million afﬁ liates, and even 
tiny Cattoys.com offers individuals and organizations 
the opportunity to put its logo and link on their websites 
to generate commissions. 
  8.  Group purchasing. In the ofﬂ ine world of commerce, 
discounts are usually available for purchasing large 
quantities. So, too, EC has spawned the concept of 
demand aggregation, wherein a third party ﬁ nds indi-
viduals or small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), aggre-
gates their small orders to attain a large quantity, and 
then negotiates (or solicits a tender offer) for the best 
deal. Thus, using the concept of group purchasing, a 
small business, or even an individual, can get a discount. 
This model is also known as the  volume-buying model . 
One leading aggregator is Letsbuyit.com. Online pur-
chasing groups are also called e-co-ops. Group purchas-
ing is now associated with social commerce with 
companies such as Groupon.  
  9.  Online auctions. Almost everyone has heard of eBay, 
the world’s largest online auction site. Several hundred 
other companies, including Amazon.com and Yahoo!, 
also conduct online auctions. In the most popular type of 
auction, online shoppers make consecutive bids for vari-
ous goods and services, and the highest bidders get the 
items auctioned. E-auctions come in different shapes 
and use different models. For example, eBay is using 
over 40,000 “assistants” in a model where the assistants 
perform the order fulﬁ llment function. 
  10.  Product and service customization. With customiza-
tion, a product or service is created according to the buy-
er’s speciﬁ cations. Customization is not a new model, 
but what is new is the ability to quickly conﬁ gure cus-
tomized products online for consumers at costs not much 
higher than their non customized counterparts. Dell is a 
good example of a company that customizes PCs for its 
customers; Nike will customize their shoes for you.  
  11.  Information brokers (infomediaries). Information 
brokers provide privacy, trust, matching, search, con-
tent, and other services (e.g.,  bizrate.com ,  google.com/
products ). 
 12.  Bartering. Companies use bartering to exchange sur-
pluses they do not need for things that they do need. A 
market maker arranges such exchanges (e.g.,  web- 
barter.com or  tradeaway.com ). 
 13.  Deep discounting. Companies such as Half.com and 
Groupon.com offer products and services at deep dis-
counts, as much as 50 % off the retail price. 
 14.  Membership. A popular ofﬂ ine model, in which only 
members get a discount, also is being offered online 
(e.g.,  netmarket.com ). 
 15.  Value-chain integrators. This model offers services 
that aggregate information-rich products into a more 
complete package for customers, thus adding value. For 
example, Carpoint.com provides several car buying–
related services, such as ﬁ nancing and insurance. 
 16.  Value-chain service providers. These providers spe-
cialize in a supply chain function such as logistics ( ups.
com ) or payments ( paypal.com ). 
 17.  Supply chain improvers. One of the major contribu-
tions of EC is in the creation of new models that change 
or improve supply chain management. Most interesting 
is the conversion of a linear supply chain, which can be 
slow, expensive, and error prone, into a hub.  
 18.  Negotiation. The Internet offers negotiation capabilities 
between individuals (e.g.,  ioffer.com ) or between com-
panies. Negotiation can also be facilitated by intelligent 
software agents.

 Primer B: E-Marketing Basics  
 1. WHAT IS E-MARKETING? 
 E-marketing is the result of information technology applied 
to traditional marketing. Applying this to the American 
Marketing Association’s deﬁ nition of marketing, e- marketing 
is the  use of information technology for the “marketing activ-
ity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communi-
cating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value 
for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.” 
Electronic marketing is only one part of an organization’s 
e-business activities. E-marketing is also called Internet mar-
keting, Web marketing, or online marketing. 
 E-marketing reaches far beyond the Web. First, many 
e-marketing technologies exist without the Web, including 
software and hardware used in customer relationship man-
agement, supply chain management, and electronic data 
interchange arrangements pre-dating the Web. For example, 
when you call a company to complain about a product, the 
information might be stored in a database and automatically 
sent over the Internet to marketing managers and product 
development teams. Seconds, non-Web Internet communica-
tions such as e-mail, Internet telephony like Skype, social 
media like Facebook, and text messaging are effective 
 avenues for marketing communication. Third, the Internet 
delivers text, video, audio, and graphics to many more 
 information-receiving appliances than simply personal 
 computers (PCs). These forms of digital content also go over 
the Internet infrastructure to the television, smartphones, 
tablets (like the iPad) and even the refrigerator or automo-
bile. Finally, ofﬂ ine electronic data-collection devices, such 
as bar code scanners and databases, receive and send data 
about customers and products over a secure internal net-
work, called an Intranet. 
 It is helpful to think of it this way: Content providers cre-
ate digital text, video, audio, and graphics to send over the 
Internet infrastructure to users who receive it as informa-
tion, entertainment, or communication on many types of 
appliances. As marketers think outside of the Web, they ﬁ nd 
many new possibilities for creating products that provide

value and communicate in ways that build relationships 
with customers. 
 E-marketing affects traditional marketing in two ways. 
First, it increases efﬁ ciency and effectiveness in traditional 
marketing functions. Seconds, the technology of e-market-
ing transforms many marketing strategies. This transforma-
tion also results in new business models that add customer 
value and/or increase company proﬁ tability, such as the 
highly successful Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, and Google 
Ad Sense advertising models. 
 In this primer we include a basic introduction to tradi-
tional marketing, and discuss ways that information technol-
ogy enhances and changes traditional ofﬂ ine marketing 
strategies and tactics. Along the way we’ll introduce a lot of 
terminology that will help you understand the ﬁ eld. 
 2. MARKETS 
 E-marketing is only effective if an organization’s target mar-
kets use the Internet. Most government agencies, non-proﬁ t 
organizations, and businesses use the Internet for business 
purposes. However, only 87 % of U.S. adults use the Internet. 
It would not beneﬁ t a company to use e-marketing tactics if 
its markets were mostly in the 13 % of Americans who don’t 
use the Internet. The less-connected groups tend to be older, 
less educated, in ethnic minority groups, do not have chil-
dren, live in rural areas, and have a lower income (according 
to research from Pew Research Internet Project 2014). 
 Also, only 42.3 % of the world’s population in 233 countries 
uses the Internet (3,035,749,340 people). Many countries have 
fewer than 50 % of the population using the Internet. Asia has 
the largest number of users (1,386.2 million), but North 
America has the highest penetration rate at 87.7 % (Internet 
World Stats 2014). China has 642.3 million users but that rep-
resents only 47.4 % of the population. Without major shifts, 
some countries may not ever achieve high levels of Internet 
adoption among individual  consumers, although high cell 
phone adoption may change this picture eventually. This is 
important to know as e-marketers chase international markets. 
 Marketers also want to know what their prospective and 
current customers do online. Table  A.3 shows that e-mail is 
far from dead and it is still a good way to reach target mar-
kets. However, younger generations use social networking 
and text messaging more often than e-mail, so again, market-
ing tactics depend on speciﬁ c target market behavior.
 Both individual and business buyers are more demanding 
than ever because they are just one click away from a pleth-
ora of global competitors, all vying for their business. As 
well, the Internet’s social media provide a communication 
platform where individual product comments can spread like 
wildﬁ re in a short time and quickly either enhance or damage 
a brand image. This phenomenon is only one part of a trend 
that has been growing for years because of the Internet—the 
power balance has ﬁ nally shifted from companies to indi-
viduals and this has huge implications for marketing strate-
gies and tactics. 
 3. MARKET RESEARCH 
 Marketers use both primary and secondary research for 
understanding their markets. The Nielsen Company recruits a 
panel of over 200,000 people and measures their Internet 
usage behavior at over 30,000 sites, then sells this to site own-
ers and advertisers as secondary research (Nielsen 2014). 
Marketers conduct quantitative primary research online 
through panels and survey research and also via their Web 
server logs that capture every click from site visitors (Web 
analytics). Qualitative online research involves creative 
experiments of online ads (e.g., which one got the most clicks 
to the advertiser’s site), online focus groups, and observation 
(e.g., monitoring conversation in social networks). This infor-
mation helps organizations to design strategies and tactics 
that meet marketing objectives. For an example, see Fig.  A.4 . 
This shows how Purina PetCare turned data into information 
and knowledge for advertising decision making. It is impor-
tant to recall that data need  careful analysis and insight to be 
actionable.
   Survey research response rates are declining, making it more 
difﬁ cult to collect market information both on and off line. 
Some other issues with Internet marketing research include:
 1.  Respondents are increasingly upset at getting unsolicited 
e-mail requesting survey participation.  
 2.  Some researchers “harvest” e-mail addresses from 
Internet forums and groups without permission. Perhaps, 
this practice is analogous to gathering names from a tele-
phone book, but some people object because consumers 
are not posting with the idea of being contacted by 
marketers. 
 3.  Some companies conduct “surveys” for the purpose of 
building a database for later solicitation. Ethical market-
ers clearly mark the difference between marketing 
research and marketing promotion and do not sell under 
the guise of research.

 4.  Privacy of user data is a huge issue in this medium, 
because it is relatively easy and proﬁ table to send elec-
tronic data to others via the Internet.  
 These and other concerns prompted ESOMAR ® , the 
European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research, to 
include guidelines for Internet research in its International 
Code of Marketing and Social Research Practice. ESOMAR 
has more than 4,900 members in 130 countries (see  boa 
Also, the U.S. Marketing Research Association has a code of 
Marketing Research ethics regarding honesty, professional-
ism, fairness, and conﬁ dentiality of respondents that help to 
support the marketing research profession as marketers con-
duct online research (see  marketingresearch.org/code ). 
 Real-time proﬁ ling and real-space primary data collection 
are two other important research techniques. 
 Real-time proﬁ ling occurs when special software tracks a 
user’s movements through a website, then compiles and 
reports on the data at a moment’s notice. Also known as 
“tracking user clickstream in real time,” or “behavioral tar-
geting,” this approach allows marketers to analyze consumer 
online behavior and make instantaneous adjustments to site 
promotional offers and Web pages. For example, if you look 
at a particular book on Amazon.com but don’t buy it, you 
might see that book presented to you on the Amazon home 
page on your next visit. 
 Real-space primary data collection refers to technology- 
enabled approaches to gather information ofﬂ ine that is subse-
quently stored and used in marketing databases to be used for 
e-marketing. The most important real-space techniques are bar 
code scanners and credit card terminals at brick-and- mortar 
retail stores, although computer entry by customer service 
reps while talking on the telephone with customers might also 
be included here. Ofﬂ ine data collection is important for 
e-marketing because these data, when combined with online 
data, paint a complete picture of consumer behavior for indi-
vidual retail ﬁ rms. Smart card and credit card readers, interac-
tive point of sale machines (iPOS), and bar code scanners are 
mechanisms for collecting real-space consumer data.  
 4.  E-MARKETING MANAGEMENT 
AND BUSINESS MODELS 
 Armed with data about an organization’s customers, 
competitors, and market conditions, marketing managers 
write objectives and strategies for achieving them. Marketing 
objectives generally include goals for acquiring new custom-
ers and increasing revenue or market share. An objective 
usually includes a measurable task and time frame. For 
example: “Increase sales on our website by 15 % within 12 
months.” 
 Next, the company designs strategies to achieve its objec-
tives.  E-marketing strategy is the design of marketing strat-
egy that capitalizes on the organization’s electronic or 
information technology capabilities to reach speciﬁ ed objec-
tives. In essence, e-marketing strategy is where technology 
strategy and marketing strategy wed. 
 For example, a Mexican hotel chain, with many hotel 
properties in South America, maintains a sophisticated, large 
customer database. It is able to send customized e-mails by 
customer segments, such as, customers who are high value, 
recent visitors, or who booked through a travel agent. By 
targeting special offers to relevant customers, it has increased 
hotel bookings and proﬁ ts. This relevant targeting keeps 
 customers happy and supports the company’s customer rela-
tionship management e-marketing strategy—ultimately sup-
porting the corporate growth strategy. In this example, the 
objectives were to increase hotel bookings and proﬁ ts; the 
strategy was to target high value recent hotel visitors and the 
key e-marketing tactic was to send special e-mails to these 
visitors. 
 E-Marketing Contributes to Business Models 
 The term  business model is often mentioned in print and by 
executives. A  business model is a method by which the orga-
nization sustains itself in the long term and includes its value

proposition for partners and customers as well as its revenue 
streams. This description is in line with the  marketing con-
cept , which suggests that the social and economic justiﬁ ca-
tion for an organization’s existence is the satisfaction of 
customer wants and needs while meeting organizational 
objectives. Business partners might include supply chain 
members such as suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers, or 
ﬁ rms with which the company joins forces to create new 
brands (such as the Microsoft and NBC alliance to create 
MSNBC). 
 Organizations 
deliver 
stakeholder 
value 
through 
e- business models by using digital products and processes. 
Whether online or ofﬂ ine, the value proposition involves 
knowing what is important to the customer or partner and 
delivering it better than other organizations.  Value encom-
passes the customer’s perceptions of the product’s beneﬁ ts, 
speciﬁ cally its attributes, brand name, and support services. 
Subtracted from beneﬁ ts are the customer costs involved in 
acquiring the product, such as monetary, time, energy, and 
psychic costs. Like customers, partners evaluate value by 
determining whether the partnership provides more beneﬁ ts 
than costs. This concept is shown as follows:
 
Value
Benefits
Costs
=
-
 
 
 Information technology usually increases beneﬁ ts and 
lowers costs to stakeholders. For example, consumers can 
search for the lowest price product online without leaving 
home. Conversely, it can decrease value when websites 
are complex, information is hard to locate, and technical 
difﬁ culties interrupt data access or shopping transactions. 
Table  A.4  lists e-marketing activities that contribute to a com-
pany’s e-business models.
 Now we move to the marketing mix. Product, price, place, 
and promotion (known as the 4 Ps) combine with informa-
tion technology to create value for customers. Figure  A.5 
demonstrates how these tools blend to create both transac-
tions and customer relationships.
 5.  CREATING VALUE: PRODUCT 
AND PRICE 
 Never has competition for online customer attention and 
dollars been ﬁ ercer. To succeed, ﬁ rms must employ strate-
gies—grounded in solid marketing principles—that result in 
customer value. What is value? First, it is the entire product 
experience. It starts with a customer’s ﬁ rst awareness of a 
product, continues at all customer  touch points (including 
the website experience, e-mail from a ﬁ rm, and much more), 
and ends with the actual product usage and post purchase 
customer service. It even includes the compliments a con-
sumer gets from friends while whipping out that iPad, or the 
fun she has when messaging friends on Skype or Facebook. 
Seconds, value is deﬁ ned wholly by the mental beliefs and 
attitudes held by customers. Regardless of how favorably the 
ﬁ rm views its own products, it is the customers’ perceptions 
that count. Third, value involves customer expectations; if 
the actual product experience falls short of their expectations, 
customers will be disappointed. Fourth, value is applied at all

price levels. Both a $0.05 micropayment for an online article 
in a news archive and a $2 million e-commerce computer 
application can provide value. 
 Marketers must make ﬁ ve general product decisions that 
comprise its bundle of beneﬁ ts to meet customer needs: attri-
butes, branding, support services, labeling, and packaging. 
Except for physical packaging, all of these can be converted 
from atoms to bits for online delivery:
•  Product attributes include overall quality and speciﬁ c 
features, such as, color, size, download speed, and so 
forth.  Beneﬁ ts , on the other hand, are the same features 
from a user perspective (i.e., what will the attribute do to 
solve problems or meet needs and wants?). For example, 
users can download media, music, software, and other 
digital products from the Web or a mobile app. Perhaps 
the most important beneﬁ t is mass customization (e.g., 
Pandora radio combines songs from many different artists 
as desired by customers). 
•  A  brand includes a name (McDonald’s), a symbol (golden 
arches), or other identifying information, but is much 
more than that. It is a perception in the mind of the cus-
tomer about the promised beneﬁ ts. Tangible and service 
products, companies, people (politicians/sports ﬁ gures), 
vacation destinations and ideas can all be branded. Brand 
names can generate trust in consumers if they deliver on 
the promise. E-marketing issues with branding include 
the selection of Facebook page and domain names 
(URLs), and the need to monitor brand mentions online 
for possible reputation damage.  
•  Customer  support services , both during and after the pur-
chase, are a critical component in the organization’s value 
proposition. Companies design support services when 
designing the product. The topic of customer service 
online is so important that it morphed into the topic of 
customer relationship management (CRM) and now 
social CRM. 
•  Product  labels identify brands, sponsoring ﬁ rms, product 
ingredients, and often provide instructions for use. Labels 
on tangible products create product recognition and inﬂ u-
ence decision behavior at the point of purchase. For online 
services, the “label” might include terms of product 
usage, product features, and other information on web-
sites. For example, when users download iTunes software 
for organizing their iPod music, they can ﬁ rst read the 
“label” to discover how to install and use the software. In 
addition, many companies have extensive legal informa-
tion about copyright use on their Web pages. 
 In the narrowest sense,  price is the amount of money 
charged for a product or service. More broadly, price is the 
sum of all the values (such as money, time, energy, and psy-
chic cost) that buyers exchange for the beneﬁ ts of having or 
using a good or service. For example, beside the dollars, is 
your price higher to drive to a physical bookstore or to search 
and ﬁ nd that book online? Online you might have to pay 
additional shipping costs but less time cost. E-marketers 
work this out as they decide which products to offer online 
and how to price them. 
 In addition, the increasing power of buyers means control 
over pricing in some instances—such as with online product 
bidding. The Internet’s properties also allow for  price trans-
parency —the idea that both buyers and sellers can view 
competitive prices for items sold online. This feature is avail-
able at shopping agent sites that compare prices among many 
online retailers, such as  shopzilla.com . Online auctions are 
another interesting e-marketing pricing tactic, especially in 
B2B markets where excess supplies exist (such as a company 
trying to unload a lot of excess wire). 
 Information technology complicated pricing strategies and 
changed the way marketers use this tool, especially in online 
markets. Some expenses are lower online, such as, self-ser-
vice order processing by customers, digital media that do not 
need to be produced in physical copies and less overhead

CRM strategies and tactics for 
relational and transactional 
outcomes

costs without physical retail stores. Others are higher, such as, 
technology, Web page design, and shipping costs. 
 A ﬁ nal consideration for pricing involves payment meth-
ods. Credit card companies and PayPal charge fees to sellers 
for each transaction. This electronic money is convenient for 
both buyers and sellers but also lowers company proﬁ t and 
opens the door to potential fraud and credit card database 
hacking. 
 6. DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS 
 A  distribution channel is a group of interdependent ﬁ rms that 
work together to transfer product and information from the 
supplier to the consumer. It is composed of the following 
participants:
•  Producers: Manufacturers and their suppliers, such as 
those who grow the raw ingredients.  
•  Intermediaries: Firms that match buyers and sellers and 
mediate the transactions among them (e.g., wholesalers, 
agents and retailers). For example Expedia.com is an 
online travel agent. 
•  Buyers: Consumers or business users of the product or 
service. 
 There are many successful e-marketing business models 
involving product distribution:
•  Content sponsorship occurs when companies create web-
sites, attract a lot of trafﬁ c, and sell advertising. 
•  The online  broker creates a market in which buyers and 
sellers negotiate and complete transactions. Brokers typi-
cally charge the seller and/or buyer a transaction fee, but 
they don’t represent either party for providing exchange 
and negotiation services. For example E*Trade brokers 
the stock market online and Autobytel allows customers 
to receive bids from qualiﬁ ed car dealers on vehicles 
available in their area without ﬁ rst phoning or visiting the 
dealer. 
•  Agents do represent either the buyer or the seller depend-
ing on who pays their fee. Expedia is paid commissions 
by hotels and airlines for booking travelers.  Afﬁ liate pro-
grams pay commissions to website owners for customer 
referrals (such as the Amazon afﬁ liates who show books 
and other merchandise on their websites). 
•  Online retailing is one of the most visible e-business 
models and the subject of this book. A huge part of 
 e- commerce  , merchants set up webstores and sell to busi-
nesses and consumers. 
 Note that there are many e-marketing tactics behind the 
scenes of these distribution models. For example, when 
online retailers send a physical product to a buyer, FedEx or 
another shipper will provide tracking information to both 
buyer and seller via the Internet. Another important aspect of 
product distribution involves multichannel marketing—the 
use of more than one sales channel, such as Web, mobile, 
brick and mortar store, and catalog. Most large traditional 
retailers are multichannel marketers because they also sell 
products online.  
 7. COMMUNICATING VALUE: IMC 
 Integrated marketing communication (IMC)  is a cross- 
functional process for planning, executing, and monitoring 
brand communications designed to proﬁ tably acquire, retain, 
and grow customers. IMC is cross-functional because every 
touch point that a customer has with a ﬁ rm or its agents helps 
to form brand images. For example, a Home Depot retail 
customer might buy and use a product from the website, then 
e-mail, Facebook message or call 1-800 to complain about a 
problem, and ﬁ nally return the product to the brick-and- 
mortar retail store. Every contact with an employee, a web-
site, a Facebook post, a blog comment about the product, a 
YouTube video, a magazine ad, a catalog, the physical store 
facilities, and so forth helps the customer form an image of 
the company brand. 
 IMC strategy begins with a thorough understanding of 
target markets, the brand, its competition, and many other 
internal and external factors. Then marketers select speciﬁ c 
Marketing Communication (MarCom) tools to achieve their 
communication objectives and media for reaching target 
markets. During and after implementation, they measure 
execution effectiveness, make needed adjustments, and re- 
evaluate the results. 
 MarCom consists of both planned and unplanned mes-
sages between ﬁ rms and customers, as well as those among 
customers. Companies use planned messages when trying to 
inform or persuade their target stakeholders, such as the 
owned and paid media in Chaps.   4 and  5 of this book. 
Unplanned messages include things such as word of mouth 
among consumers and publicity in media (earned media). 
 Using innovative technologies, e-marketers can enhance 
the  effectiveness (reaching the target market with little wasted 
coverage) and  efﬁ ciency  (low cost) of traditional MarCom in 
many interesting ways. Online marketing communication can 
be used for  brand communication (to build brand awareness 
and create a favorable brand image) or to elicit a  direct 
response in the form of a transaction, customer engagement, 
or some other behavior (such as website registration, social 
media “like”/comment post, or e-mail inquiry). Brand com-
munication works at the awareness and attitude levels (heads 
and hearts) of the Social Commerce Brand Decision Process 
model, also called the  hierarchy of effects model , while direct-
response communication primarily works at the behavioral 
level (do something). Advertising can be used for both brand-
ing and direct response, while marketing public relations aims 
to build brand images, and sales promotion, direct marketing, 
and personal selling primarily attempt to solicit a direct 
response (see Chap.   4 for deﬁ nitions of these tools).

 Advertising 
 There are many types of online advertising and below are 
just a few (recall that this is paid for space in someone else’s 
media property):
•  Display ads . These contain more graphics and white 
space than text, and include traditional banners and many 
additional sizes. 
•  Mobile ad . An SMS text or multi-media message sent to 
a cell phone. 
•  Map ad . Text or graphics linked from, and appearing in 
or over, a location on an electronic map such as on Google 
Maps. 
•  Pop-up . A new window, which opens in front of the 
current one, displaying an advertisement, or entire Web 
page.  
•  Contextual ads. Ad servers, such as Google’s Double- 
Click, maintain an inventory of ads from clients and serve 
them into websites as appropriate users are viewing par-
ticular pages. 
•  E-mail advertising . This is generally just a few sentences 
of text embedded in another ﬁ rm’s e-mail content. 
•  Sponsorships . Also called advertorials, these integrate 
editorial content and advertising, such as when Kraft 
Foods pays for space to put recipes on a food website.  
 Advertising is purchased using one of two main models 
(or a hybrid of both).  Cost per thousand impressions , known 
by all media buyers as CPM, charges the advertiser based on 
the number of users who are exposed to an ad online. It is 
calculated: (ad cost/number of impressions)/1,000. For 
example, an online ad costing $500 and reaching 30,000 
users would have a CPM of $16.67. The seconds model is 
 cost-per-click (CPC) , which charges advertisers based on the 
number of click-throughs to the advertiser’s Web property. 
CPC is also known as cost-per-action (CPA) and is perfor-
mance based. CPC/CPA are the pricing models used most 
often by website owners. 
 Other pricing models include cost per engagement (CPE) 
for actions such as number of votes, views, ratings, or sub-
mission of branded user-generated content and cost per 
install (CPI) for a widget or application on a social network 
or mobile device. 
 Marketing Public Relations 
 Marketing public relations (MPR) includes brand-related 
activities and nonpaid, third party media coverage to posi-
tively inﬂ uence target markets and generate earned media. 
MPR activities using Internet technology include the website 
content itself, online events, blogs, communities, and other 
social media and many ways to build a buzz online. These 
are owned media. 
 Online Sales Promotions 
 Sales promotion activities include coupons, discounts, 
rebates, product sampling, contests, sweepstakes, and premi-
ums (free or low-cost gifts). Of these promotion types, only 
sampling, discounts, and contests/sweepstakes/games are 
widely used on the Internet. For example, some sites allow 
users to sample digital products prior to purchase: software 
companies provide free downloads of fully functional demo 
versions of their software and iTunes or Amazon offer a por-
tion of the song for free listening.  
 Direct Marketing 
 These e-marketing tactics include  e-mail marketing ,  text 
messaging (also called  short message services—SMS), 
multimedia message services (MMS) , and  instant messag-
ing (IM) . 
 E-mail is still the Internet’s killer application: It has not 
been replaced by RSS feeds, blogs, or social networking, in 
spite of the many people predicting its demise. Instead, mar-
keters integrate e-mail with social media, such as sending an 
article excerpt in e-mail and linking to the full article on a 
blog, or offering customers the choice of receiving informa-
tion via an e-mail newsletter, RSS feed, Twitter feed. E-mail 
has several advantages over postal direct mail. First, it 
requires no postage or printing charges. Seconds, e-mail 
offers an immediate and convenient avenue for direct 
response; in fact, e-mail often directs users to websites using 
hyperlinks. Third, and perhaps most important, e-mail can be 
automatically individualized to meet the needs of speciﬁ c 
users—beyond just using a name in the e-mail. 
 Opt-in means that users check a box to receive e-mail 
from a company.  Opt-out means they have to uncheck a box 
to not get the mail. E-marketers use both techniques but opt-
 in techniques are more considerate of customers and produce 
better results. They are part of a bigger traditional marketing 
strategy called  permission marketing . 
 Search Marketing 
 Search engine optimization (SEO) is the act of altering a 
website and incoming links so that it does well in the organic, 
crawler-based listings of search engines. Also called natural 
search, this involves HTML meta-tags and the titles and text 
on the Web page itself. Search engines ﬁ gure out how to 
categorize the page based on the content, relevance, popular-
ity, and about 200 other variables.  Paid search is when adver-
tisers buy keywords that appear as sponsored links on search 
engine results pages, such as the Google AdWords program 
(this is advertising). 
Primer B: E-Marketing Basics

312
 Inbound marketing refers to being found online, versus 
interrupting users while they are consuming content, such as 
with a television ad or display ad on a website or social net-
work. SEO is a key tool for assuring that target markets ﬁ nd 
the marketer’s products. 
 IMC Performance Metrics 
 E-marketers are drowning in data, yet they need to assess the 
effectiveness of their IMC campaigns. The bottom line is that 
they want to see whether (1) their marketing objectives were 
achieved, and (2) to what extent the various IMC tactics con-
tributed. For marketing objectives involving sales or market 
share growth internal records and secondary data about com-
petitive sales will help. 
 IMC tactics are a different story. We presented some key 
metrics at the end of Chap.   5 , regarding awareness/exposure, 
brand health, engagement, action, and innovation. The met-
rics selected by e-marketers depend on what they are trying 
to achieve, however, some of the most common IMC metrics 
follow:
•  E-mail response rates, database growth (more customer 
information) and return on investment.  
•   Website  analytics tell e-marketers how people found the 
site, how long they stay on it and how they move through 
the site. If it is a retailer, they want to know  conversion 
rate  (how many site visitors purchased) and cost per 
order (the cost to acquire that customer/dollars spend on 
orders).  
•  Sales promotion metrics include number of coupons 
redeemed, contest entries, or number of sample down-
loads (such as music samples). 
•  Marketing public relations metrics might include number 
of video views for a viral video or other viral content and 
the size and sentiment of earned media discussion. 
Companies also measure the number subscribing to RSS 
feeds, number of “Likes” on Facebook pages, Twitter fol-
lowers, comments to blog posts, and much more.  
•  Share of voice is the brand’s advertising weight expressed 
as a percentage of a deﬁ ned market segment’s messages 
during a speciﬁ ed time period. 
•  Advertisers want to know the CPC (Cost per Click), CPA 
(Cost per Action), CPE (Cost per Engagement) and CPI 
(Cost per Installation) for performance-based advertising. 
They normally use CPM prior to purchasing advertising 
to evaluate its efﬁ ciency; however, they will also double- 
check this as the ad runs. 
 Marketers monitor their selected metrics very frequently 
because two of the Internet’s strengths are that (1) these are 
easy to measure, and (2) IMC tactics can change in minutes 
if something is not working as expected.  
 8. BUILDING VALUE: CRM 
 Customer relationship management (CRM) is a philosophy, 
strategy, and process. It involves acquiring, retaining and 
growing customer value. It is grounded in customer data and 
conversations, and facilitated by technology. The beneﬁ ts of 
CRM include increased revenue from better prospect target-
ing, increased wallet share with current customers, and 
retaining customers for longer periods of time. These bene-
ﬁ ts are quantiﬁ ed through databases that help companies 
understand their customers better and use this knowledge to 
build loyalty and optimize lifetime value. CRM tactics can 
also decrease costs, resulting in greater proﬁ tability. 
 An organization using relationship marketing focuses on 
wallet share more than market share.  Wallet share is the 
amount of sales a ﬁ rm can generate from one customer and, 
thus, reﬂ ects a focus on retention and growth rather than an 
acquisition focus (market share). For instance, Amazon 
wants to sell books, music, household appliances, and more 
to each customer. Relationship marketing differentiates indi-
vidual customers based on need rather than differentiating 
products for target groups—such as buyers of novels by a 
particular author. 
 CRM is facilitated online by cookie ﬁ les, WEB analytics, 
databases (and mining them for information on customer 
buying patterns), collaborative ﬁ ltering, behavioral targeting, 
and many other techniques discussed throughout this book. 
 E-marketers use numerous metrics to assess the Internet’s 
value in delivering CRM performance—among them are ROI 
(Return on Investment), cost savings, revenues, customer sat-
isfaction, and especially the contribution of each CRM tactic 
to these measures. Other important metrics include customer 
retention rates, average order value (AOV) and  customer 
lift —increased response or transaction rates. Finally, organi-
zations want to understand the customer  lifetime value (LTV) 
to the company so they know how much to invest in retention 
versus acquisition tactics.
