Preface
This book attempts to provide an overview of the process of microelectromechanical
system (MEMS) design. In order to design a MEMS device successfully, an appre-
ciation for the full spectrum of issues involved must be considered. The designer
must understand
•
Fabrication technologies
•
Relevant physics for a device at the micron scale
•
Computer-aided design issues in the implementation of the design
•
Engineering of the MEMS device
•
Evaluation testing of the device
•
Reliability and packaging issues necessary to produce a quality MEMS
product
These diverse issues are interrelated and must be considered at the initial stages
of a design project in order to be completely successful and timely in product
development. This book has ten chapters and eight appendices:
Chapter 1. Introduction
Chapter 2. Fabrication Processes
Chapter 3. MEMS Technologies
Chapter 4. Scaling Issues for MEMS
Chapter 5. Design Realization Tools for MEMS
Chapter 6. Electromechanics
Chapter 7. Modeling and Design
Chapter 8. MEMS Sensors and Actuators
Chapter 9. Packaging
Chapter 10. Reliability
Appendices
The MEMS ﬁeld is very exciting to many people for a variety of reasons. MEMS
is a multiphysics technology that provides many new, innovative ways of imple-
menting devices with functionality previously undreamed of. One of the challenges
facing the people entering this ﬁeld is the breadth of knowledge required to develop
a MEMS product; many of them are from a variety of technical ﬁelds that may be
tangential to the spectrum of MEMS design issues enumerated here. This book is
written for the new entrant into the ﬁeld of MEMS design. This person may be a
senior or ﬁrst-year graduate student in engineering or science, as well as a practicing
engineer or scientist exploring a new ﬁeld to develop a new device or product.

The organization of the book is meant to be a logical sequence of topics that a
new MEMS designer would need to learn. At the end of each chapter, questions and
problems provide a review and promote thought into the subject matter. The Appen-
dices provide succinct information necessary in the various stages of a MEMS design
project. The chapter on modeling, actuation, and sensing focuses primarily on the
mechanical and electrical aspects of MEMS design. However, MEMS design projects
frequently involve many other realms of science and engineering, such as optics,
ﬂuid mechanics, radio frequency (RF) devices, and electromagnetic ﬁelds. These
topics are mentioned when appropriate, but this book focuses on an overview of the
breadth of the MEMS designs technical area and the speciﬁc topics required to
develop a MEMS device or product.

1 Introduction
1.1 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Making devices small has long had engineering, scientiﬁc, and aesthetic motiva-
tions. For example, John Harrison’s quest [1] to make a small (e.g., hand-sized)
chronometer in the 1700s for nautical navigation was motivated by the desire to
have an accurate time-keeping instrument that was insensitive to temperature,
humidity, and motion. A small chronometer could meet these objectives and allow
for multiple instruments on a ship for redundancy and error averaging. A number
of technological ﬁrsts came from this work, such as the development of the roller
bearing. Driven by the need for portability, the miniaturization of many mechan-
ical devices has advanced over the years.
The 20th century saw the rise of electrical and electronic devices that had an
impact on daily life. Until the advent of the point contact transistor in 1947 by
Bardeen and Brattain [2] and, later, the junction transistor by Shockley [3],
electronic devices were based upon the vacuum tube invented in 1906 by Lee de
Forest. The transistor was a great leap forward in reducing size, power require-
ments, and portability of electronic devices.
By the mid 20th century, electronic devices were produced by connecting
individual components (i.e., vacuum tubes, switches, resistors and capacitors).
This resulted in large devices that consumed signiﬁcant power and were costly
to produce. The reliability of these devices was also poor due to the need to
assemble the multitude of components. The state of the art was epitomized by
the world’s ﬁrst digital computer [4], ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and
computer), which was developed at the University of Pennsylvania [5] for the
Army Ordnance Department to carry out ballistics calculations. The need for
ENIAC illustrates the need for computers to assist in the development of engi-
neering devices that was emerging at the time. However, ENIAC consisted of
thousands of electronic components, which needed to be replaced at frequent
intervals, consumed signiﬁcant power, and wasted heat.
Several key events occurred in the late 1950s that would motivate develop-
ment of electronics at an increased pace beyond the discrete transistor. The
development of the planar silicon transistor [6,7] and the planar fabrication
process [8,9] set the stage for development of fabrication processes and equipment
to achieve electronic devices monolithically integrated on a single substrate with
small feature sizes. The development of this technology for integrated circuits
started the microelectronics revolution, which led to the production of microelec-
tronic devices with smaller and smaller features and continues to the present day.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
Microelectronic technology developed rapidly, as can be seen by the paper
presented by Gordon Moore [10] in 1965 in which he predicted the rapid growth
of microelectronics. At this point, microelectronics was producing integrated
circuits with 50 transistors on 1-in. wafers, which could be spaced 50 µm apart.
Silicon had emerged as the microelectronic material of choice due to the ability
to produce a high-quality, stable silicon dioxide layer, which is essential to the
fabrication of transistors. In his paper, Moore stated, 
The complexity of minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a
factor of two per year. Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to
continue, if not increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more
uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant
for at least 10 years.
The pace of microelectronic development has been maintained over the years, as
can be seen in Figure 1.1.
Dr. Richard Feynman presented a seminal talk, “There’s Plenty of Room at
the Bottom” on December 29, 1959, at the annual meeting of the American
Physical Society at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); the text was
ﬁrst published in the 1960 issue of Caltech’s engineering and science magazine
[11] and has since been reprinted several times [12,13]. In the talk, Dr. Feynman

conceptually presented, motivated, and challenged people with the desire and
advantages of exploring engineered devices at the small scale. This talk is fre-
quently sited as the conceptual beginnings of the ﬁelds of microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology. Dr. Feynman provided some very insight-
ful comments on the scaling of physical phenomena as size is reduced as well
as some prophetic uses of the small-scale devices upon which he was speculating.
•
Scaling of physical phenomena 
•
“The effective viscosity of oil would be higher and higher in pro-
portion as we went down” in size.
•
“Let the bearings run dry; they won’t run hot because the heat
escapes away from such a small device very, very rapidly.”
•
Miniaturizing the computer 
•
“…the possibilities of computers are very interesting — if they
could be made to be more complicated by several orders of magni-
tude. If they had millions of times as many elements, they could
make judgments.”
•
“For instance, the wires should be made 10 or 100 atoms in diameter,
and the circuits should be a few thousand angstroms across.”
•
Use of small machines
•
“…it would be interesting in surgery if you could swallow the
surgeon. You put the mechanical surgeon inside the blood vessel
and it goes into the heart and looks around.”
During this presentation, Dr. Feynman offered two $1000 prizes for the
following achievements:
•
Build a working electric motor no larger than a 1/64-in. (400-µm) cube
•
Print text at a scale (1/25,000) that the Encyclopedia Britannica could
ﬁt on the head of a pin
In less than a year, a Caltech engineer, William McLellan, constructed a 250-
µg, 2000-rpm electric motor using 13 separate parts to collect his prize [14]. This
illustrated that technology was constantly moving toward miniaturization and that
aspects of the technology already existed. However, the second prize was not
rewarded until 1985, when T. Newman and R.F.W. Pease used e-beam lithography
to print the ﬁrst page of A Tale of Two Cities within a 5.9-µm square [14]. The
achievement of the second prize was enabled by the developments of the micro-
electronics industry in the ensuing 25 years. Images of these achievements are
available in references 16 and 17.

tems technology [MST] in Europe) has been inspired by the development of the

microelectronic revolution and the vision of Dr. Feynman. MEMS and MST were
built upon the technological and commercial needs of the latter part of the 20th
century, as well as the drive toward miniaturization that had been a driving force
for a number of reasons over a much longer period of time. The development of
MEMS technology synergistically used to a large extent the materials and fabri-
cation methods developed for microelectronics. Table 1.1 is a historical time line
of some of the key events in the development of MEMS technology.
MEMS technology is a result of a long history of technology development
starting with machine and machining development through the advent of micro-
electronics. In fact, in a continuum of devices and fabrication process MEMS
occupies the size range from 1 mm to 1 µm. In this book, size scales are referred
to as macro, meso, micro, and nano scale. Table 1.2 attempts to provide a more
deﬁnitive deﬁnition of these terms.
The development of the discrete transistor and its use began to replace the
vacuum tube in electronic applications in the 1950s. In the early days of the
development of the transistor, the piezoresistive properties of the semiconductor
materials used to develop the transistor, silicon and germanium, were researched
[18]. This advance provided a link between the electronic materials and mechan-
ical sensing. This link was exploited early in the time line of MEMS development
to produce strain gages and pressure sensors.
The key technical advances that precipitated the microelectronic revolution
were the development of the planar silicon transistor [6,7] and fabrication process
[8,9]. The planar silicon fabrication process provided a path that enabled the
integration of large numbers of transistors to create many different electronic
devices and, through continuous technical advancement of the fabrication tools
(lithography, etching, diffusion, and implantation), a continual reduction in size
of the transistor. This ability to increasingly miniaturize the electronic circuitry
over a long period of time was predicted by Moore in 1965 in what was to become
known as Moore’s law. The effects of this law continue today and at least for the
next 20 years [19]. This development of fabrication tools for increasingly smaller
dimensions is a key enabler for MEMS technology.
In 1967, Nathanson et al. developed the resonant gate transistor [20], which
showed the possibilities of an integrated mechanical–electrical device and silicon
micromachining. In the early days of microelectronics and through the 1970s,
bulk micromachining, which utilizes deep etching techniques, was developed and
used to produce pressure sensors and accelerometers. In 1982, Petersen [21] wrote
a seminal paper, “Silicon as a Mechanical Material.” Thus, silicon was considered
and utilized to an even greater extent to produce sensors that needed a mechanical
element (inertial mass, pressure diaphragm) and a transduction mechanism
(mechanical–electrical) to produce a sensor. Bulk micromachining was also uti-
lized to make ink nozzles, which were becoming a large commercial market due
to the computer revolution’s need for low-cost printers.
In 1983, Howe and Muller [22] developed the basic scheme for surface
micromachining; this utilizes two types of material (structural, sacriﬁcial) and
the tools developed for microelectronics to create a fabrication technology capable

of producing complex mechanical elements without the need for postfabrication
assembly. Many of the essential actuation and mechanical elements were dem-
onstrated in the ensuing years [23–25].
Also in the 1980s, the LIGA (Lithographie Galvanoformung Abformung)
process [26] was developed in Germany. The material set that LIGA uses is
signiﬁcantly different from bulk and surface micromachining, which tend to use

the microelectronic fabrication tools and materials. LIGA can be used to make
parts or molds from electroplateable materials or use the molds to make injection
molded plastics. 
The 1990s saw the development of commercial products that require the
integration of MEMS mechanical and electrical fabrication (IMEMS) technolo-
gies due to the need for high-resolution sensing of mechanical elements or the
addressing and actuation of large arrays of mechanical elements. Analog Devices,
Inc. developed an IMEMS technology [27] to facilitate the development of inertial
sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) for automotive applications. Texas Instru-
ments developed an IMEMS technology [28] to produce a large array (~106) of
mirrors used in projectors, cinema, and televisions. The development of IMEMS
technologies is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
1.3 MEMS: PRESENT AND FUTURE
The 1980s to the mid 1990s saw the development of three categories of fabrication
technologies for MEMS. Bulk micromachining, sacriﬁcial surface micromachin-
ing, and LIGA have unique capabilities based on the fabrication materials utilized,
ability to integrate with electronics, assembly, and thickness of materials. These
technologies enable many different types of applications and will be discussed
in detail in Chapter 3. The information available on MEMS technology has grown
as it has matured. Sample lists of journals, periodicals, and Web sites is provided
in Table 1.3 through Table 1.5; these offer a wealth of information and a starting
point for further research into the world of MEMS.

The mid 1990s to the present day has seen a shift in the emphasis of MEMS
technology research from fabrication process development and the demonstration
of prototype sensors and actuators to the commercialization of MEMS products.
The impact of MEMS technology is very broad as can be seen by the brief list
of MEMS applications in Table 1.6. These MEMS products range from physical
sensors (e.g., pressure, inertial), biological, optical, and robotics to radio frequency
(RF) devices. MEMS applications span the range of physics. As a result, the
MEMS ﬁeld affects a wide swath of engineers, physicists, chemists, and biologists.
Today’s automobile is one area in which the world of MEMS [29] has a direct
impact on daily life. A number of locations within the automobile contain MEMS
technology, for example:
•
Accelerometers are used for multiple functions, such as air bag deploy-
ment, vehicle security, and seat belt tension triggers.
•
Gyroscopes are used — possibly in conjunction with accelerometers
— in car stability control systems to correct the yaw of a car before
this becomes a problem for the driver.
•
Pressure sensors: the manifold absolute pressure sensor is used to
control the fuel–air mixture in the engine. Tire pressure monitoring
has also been recently mandated for use in automobiles.
•
The wheel speed sensor is a component of the ABS braking system
that can also be used as an indirect measure of tire pressure.
•
The oil condition sensor detects oil temperature, contamination, and level.

Introduction

The automotive market is a mass market in which MEMS is playing an ever
increasing role. For example, 90 million air bag accelerometers and 30 million
manifold absolute pressure sensors were supplied to the automotive market in
2002 [30].
Another mass market in which MEMS has an increasing impact is the bio-
logical medical market. MEMS technology enables the production of a device of
the same scale as biological material. Figure 1.2 shows a comparison of a MEMS
device and biological material. An example of MEMS’ impact on the medical
market is the DNA sequencing chip, GeneChip, developed by Affymetrix Inc.
[31], which allows medical testing in a fraction of the time and cost previously
available. In addition, MEMS facilitates direct interaction at the cellular level
[32]. Figure 1.3 shows cells in solution ﬂowing through the cellular manipulator,
which could disrupt the cell membrane to allow easier insertion of genetic and
chemical materials. Also shown in Figure 1.3 are chemical entry and extraction
ports that allow the injection of genetic material, proteins, etc. for processing in

a continuous ﬂuid ﬂow system. An additional illustration of the impact of MEMS
that would have been thought to be science ﬁction a few years ago is the retinal
prosthesis [33] under development that will enable the blind to see.
MEMS also has a signiﬁcant impact on space applications. The miniaturization
of sensors is an obvious application of MEMS. The use of MEMS for thermal
control of microsatellites is somewhat unanticipated. MEMS louvers [34] are
micromachined devices similar in function and design to conventional mechanical
louvers used in satellites; here, a mechanical vane or window is opened and closed
to vary the radiant heat transfer to space. MEMS is applicable in this context
because it is small and consumes little power, but produces the physical effect of
variable thermal emittance, which controls the temperature of the satellite. The
MEMS louver consists of an electrostatic actuator that moves a louver to control
the amount of gold surface exposed (i.e., variable emittance). Figure 1.4 shows the
MEM louvers that will be demonstrated on an upcoming NASA satellite mission.
The integration of MEMS devices into automobiles or satellites enables
attributes such as smaller size, smaller weight, and multiple sensors. The use of
MEMS in systems can also allow totally different functionality. For example, a
miniature robot with a sensor, control circuitry, locomotion, and self-power can
be used for chemical or thermal plume detection and localization [35]. In this
case, MEMS technology enables the group behavior of a large number of small
robots capable of simple functions. The group interaction (“swarming”) of these
simple expendable robots is used to search an area to locate something that the
sensor can detect, such as a chemical or temperature.
One vision of the future direction of MEMS is expressed in Picraux and
McWhorter [36], who propose that MEMS applications will enable systems to
think, sense, act, communicate, and self-power. Many of the applications dis-
cussed in this section indeed integrate some of these attributes. For example, the
FIGURE 1.3 Red blood cells ﬂowing through a cellular manipulator with chemical
entry/extraction ports. (Courtesy of Sandia National Laboratories.)

small robot shown in Figure 1.5 has a sensor, can move, and has a self-contained
power source. To integrate all of these functions on one chip may not be practical
due to ﬁnancial or engineering constraints; however, integration of these functions
via packaging may be a more viable path.
MEMS is a new technology that has formally been in existence since the
1980s when the acronym MEMS was coined. This technology has been focusing
on commercial applications since the mid 1990s with signiﬁcant success [37].
The MEMS commercial businesses are generally organized around three main
models: MEMS manufacturers; MEMS design; and system integrators. In 2003,
368 MEMS fabrication facilities existed worldwide, with strong centers in North
America, Japan, and Europe. There are 130 different MEMS applications in
production consisting of a few large-volume applications in the automotive (iner-

Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories.

tial, pressure); ink-jet nozzles; and medical ﬁelds (e.g., Affymetrix GeneChip).
The MEMS commercial market is growing at a 25% annual rate [37].
1.4 MEMS CHALLENGES 
MEMS is a growing ﬁeld applicable to many lines of products that has been
synergistically using technology and tools from the microelectronics industry.
However, MEMS and microelectronics differ in some very fundamental ways.
Table 1.7 compares the devices and technologies of MEMS and microelectronics,
and Figure 1.6 compares the levels of device integration of MEMS and micro-
electronics. The most striking observation is that microelectronics is an enormous
industry based on a few fundamental devices with a standardized fabrication
process. The microelectronics industry derives its commercial applicability from
the ability to connect a multitude of a few fundamental types of electronic devices
(e.g., transistors, capacitors, resistors) reliably on a chip to create a plethora of
new microelectronic applications (e.g., logic circuits, ampliﬁers, computer pro-
cessors, etc.). The exponential growth predicted by Moore’s law comes from
improving the fabrication tools to make increasingly smaller circuit elements,
which in turn enable faster and more complex microelectronic applications.
The MEMS industry derives its commercial applicability from the ability to
address a wide variety of applications (accelerometers, pressure sensors, mirrors,
ﬂuidic channel); however, no one fundamental unit cell [38,39] and standard
fabrication process to build the devices exists. In fact, the drive toward smaller
devices for microelectronics, which increased speed and complexity, does not
necessarily have the same impact on MEMS devices [40] due to scaling issues
(Chapter 4). MEMS is a new rapidly growing [37] technology area in which
contributions are to be made in fabrication, design, and business.

2 Fabrication Processes
This chapter will present an overview of the various processes used in the
fabrication of MEMS devices. The ﬁrst section will present an introduction to
materials and their structure. The processes that will be discussed in subsequent
sections include deposition, patterning, and etching of materials as well as pro-
cesses for annealing, polishing, and doping, which are used to achieve special
mechanical, electrical, or optical properties. Many of the processes used for
MEMS are adapted from the microelectronics industry; however, the conceptual
roots for some of the fabrication processes (e.g., sputtering, damascene) signiﬁ-
cantly predate that industry.
2.1 MATERIALS
2.1.1 INTERATOMIC BONDS
The material structure type is greatly inﬂuenced by the interatomic bonds and
their completeness. There are three types of interatomic attractions: ionic bonds,
covalent bonds, and metallic bonds (Figure 2.1). The ionic bonds occur in
materials where the interatomic attractions are due to electrostatic attraction
between adjacent ions. For example, a sodium atom (Na) has one electron in its
valence shell (i.e., outer electron shell of an atom), which can be easily released
to produce a positively charge sodium ion (Na+). A chlorine atom (Cl) can readily
accept an electron to complete its valence shell, which will produce a negatively
charged chlorine ion (Cl–). The electrostatic attraction of an ionic bond will cause
the negatively charged chlorine ion to surround itself with positively charged
sodium ions.
The electronic structure of an atom is stable if the outer valence shells are
complete. The outer valence shell can be completed by sharing electrons between
adjacent atoms. The covalent bond is the sharing of valence electrons. This bond
is a very strong interatomic force that can produce molecules such as hydrogen
(H2) or methane (CH4), which have very low melting temperature and low attrac-
tion to adjacent molecules, or diamond, which is a covalent bonded carbon crystal
with a very high melting point and great hardness. The difference between these
two types of covalent bonded materials (i.e., CH4 vs. diamond) is that the covalent
bond structure of CH4 completes the valence shell of the component atoms within
one molecule, whereas the valence shell of the carbon atoms in diamond are

completed via a repeating structure of a large number of carbon atoms (i.e.,
crystal/lattice structure).
A third type of interatomic bond is the metallic bond. This type of bond
occurs in the case when only a few valence electrons in an atom may be easily
removed to produce a positive ion (e.g., positively charged nucleus and the
nonvalence electrons) and a free electron. Metals such as copper exhibit this type
of interatomic bond. Materials with the metallic bond have a high electrical and
thermal conductivity.
Another, weaker group of bonds is called van der Waals forces. The mech-
anisms for these forces come from a variety of mechanisms arising from the
asymmetric electrostatic forces in molecules, such as molecular polarization due
to electrical dipoles. These are very weak forces that frequently only become
signiﬁcant or observable when the ionic, covalent, or metallic bonding mecha-
nisms cannot be effective. For example, ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding is
not effective with atoms of the noble gases (e.g., helium, He), which have
complete valence electron shells, and rearrangements of the valence electrons
cannot be done.
2.1.2 MATERIAL STRUCTURE
The atomic structure of materials can be broadly classiﬁed as crystalline, poly-
crystalline, and amorphous (illustrated in Figure 2.2). A crystalline material has
a large-scale, three-dimensional atomic structure in which the atoms occupy
speciﬁc locations within a lattice structure. Epitaxial silicon and diamond are
examples of materials that exhibit a crystalline structure. A polycrystalline mate-
rial consists of a matrix of grains, which are small crystals of material with an
interface material between adjacent grains called the grain boundary. Most metals,
such as aluminum and gold, as well as polycrystalline silicon, are examples of
this material structure. 
The widely used metallurgical processes of cold working and annealing
greatly affect the material grains and grain boundary and the resulting material
properties of strength, hardness, ductility, and residual stress. Cold working uses

lent bond, metallic bond.

mechanical deformation to reduce the material grain size; this will increase
strength and hardness, but reduce ductility. Annealing is a process that heats the
material above the recrystallization temperature for a period of time, which will
increase the grain size. Annealing will reduce residual stress and hardness and
increase material ductility. A noncrystalline material that exhibits no large-scale
structure is called amorphous. Silicon dioxide and other glasses are examples of
this structural type.
2.1.3 CRYSTAL LATTICES
The structure of a crystal is described by the conﬁguration of the basic repeating
structural element, the unit cell. The unit cell is deﬁned by the manner in which
space within the crystal lattice is divided into equal volumes using intersecting
plane surfaces. The crystal unit cell may be in one of seven crystal systems. These
crystal systems are cubic; tetragonal; orthorhombic; monoclinic; triclinic; hex-
agonal; and rhombohedral. They include all the possible geometries into which
a crystal lattice may be subdivided by the plane surfaces. The crystalline material
structure is greatly inﬂuenced by factors such as the number of valance electrons
and atomic radii of the atoms in the crystal (Table 2.1). The cubic crystal system
is a very common and highly studied system that includes most of the common
engineering metals (e.g., iron, nickel, copper, gold) as well as some materials
used in semiconductors (e.g., silicon, phosphorus).
The cubic crystal system has three common variants: simple cubic (SC), body-
centered cubic (BCC), and face-centered cubic (FCC), which are shown in Figure
2.3. The properties of crystalline material are inﬂuenced by the structural aspects
of the crystal lattice, such as the number of atoms per unit cell; the number of
atoms in various directions in the crystal; and the number of neighboring atoms
within the crystal lattice, as shown in Table 2.2. The unit cells depicted are shown
with the fraction of the atom that would be included in the unit cell (i.e., the
simple cubic has one atom per unit cell; the body-centered cubic has two atoms
per unit cell; face-centered cubic has four atoms per unit cell).As can be surmised,

the crystal structure and the unit cell size (i.e., lattice constant) will greatly
inﬂuence the density of the material. For example, dense materials such as metals
crystallize in the body-centered cubic (e.g., iron, tungsten) or the face-centered
cubic (e.g., aluminum, cooper, gold, nickel), which contain more atoms per unit
cell instead of the simple cubic crystal, which contains only one atom per unit cell.
Silicon and germanium are Group IV elements on the periodic table; these
have four valence electrons and need four more electrons to complete the outer
electron shell. This can be accomplished by forming covalent bonds with four
nearest neighbor atoms in the lattice. However, none of the basic cubic lattice
forms have four nearest neighbors (Table 2.2). Elements such as silicon and
germanium form a diamond structure, which can be conceptually thought of as
two interlocking face-centered cubic lattices with a one-fourth lattice constant
diagonal offset. This means that the diamond cubic lattice has four additional
atoms within a face-centered cubic-like lattice structure (Figure 2.4). The gallium
arsenide and indium phosphide compounds also use a version of the diamond
cubic lattice, called the zincblende, which has a reduced level of symmetry due
to the different atom sizes. Every atom in the diamond cubic lattice is tetrahedrally
bonded to its four neighbors. For example, in the zincblende lattice, each gallium
atom is tetrahedrally bonded to four arsenic atoms, and each arsenic atom is
tetrahedrally bonded to four gallium atoms.
The properties of crystalline materials such as mechanical strength or chem-
ical etch rates are affected by the lattice structure, and they may depend upon
the directionality of the lattice structure. For example, a cubic lattice is uniform
in all directions (i.e., the same number of atoms on any plane or in any direction).
However, the diamond lattice has a different number of atoms in any plane or
direction. The anisotropy of silicon material properties and etch rates can be
somewhat attributed to its crystal structure. 
2.1.4 MILLER INDICES
The Miller indices is nomenclature to express directions or planes in a crystal
structure. Figure 2.5 shows the Miller index notation for direction in a orthor-
hombic lattice. An orthorhombic lattice is deﬁned by orthogonal planes spaced
differently in each direction. Miller index notation is based on the lattice unit cell
intercepts within square brackets (e.g., [1 1 1]) vs. the Cartesian distances. For
FIGURE 2.4 The diamond cubic lattice can be formed by adding four atoms (shaded
dark) to the face-centered cubic lattice.

example, the Miller index [1 1 1] denotes the direction from the origin of the
unit cell through the opposite corner of the unit cell (i.e., not the Cartesian
direction vector; Figure 2.5). Note that the [2 2 2] direction is identical to the [1
1 1] direction and the lowest combination of integers is used (e.g., [1 1 1]).
The planes within a lattice also need to be identiﬁed. The planes are denoted
with labels within curved brackets — e.g., (1 0 0) — as illustrated in Figure 2.6.
The (1 0 0) plane is orthogonal to the [1 0 0] direction. The numbers used in the
Miller notation for planes are the reciprocals of the intercepts of the axes in unit
cell distances from the origin. The Miller index notation includes not only the
(1 0 0) plane shown in Figure 2.6, but also all equivalent planes. In a simple cubic
lattice structure, the point of origin is arbitrarily chosen, and the (1 0 0) plane

will have the same properties as the (0 1 0) and the (0 0 1) planes. The (1 0 0)
refers to all three planes. Conversely, in an orthorhombic lattice, the planes (1 0 0),
(0 1 0), and (0 0 1) are unique. 
2.1.5 CRYSTAL IMPERFECTIONS
The symmetry of the crystal is broken at the surface of the material. The atoms
at the surface are not bound to the other atoms in the same way as the bulk
material. Therefore, the surface will behave differently than the bulk crystal. For
example, the surface can chemically react and form an oxide or the surface can
become electrically charged. Integrated circuit manufacturers frequently build the
circuits upon a single-crystal silicon wafer with a (100) orientation (i.e., the [100]
plane is the wafer surface) because this orientation minimizes surface charges.
In addition to the surface differences, imperfections in the crystal lattices can
also be found. These can inﬂuence many characteristics of the material such as
mechanical strength, electrical properties, and chemical reactivity. The lattice
imperfections can be due to missing, displaced, or extra atoms in the lattice,
which are called point defects. Line defects have an edge due to an extra plane
of atoms.
Figure 2.7 illustrates several types of point defects, which include substitu-
tional, vacancy, and interstitial types of defects. A substitutional defect is due to
an impurity atom occupying a lattice site for the bulk material. In a vacancy
defect, a lattice site is not occupied. An interstitial defect involves an atom of
the bulk material or an impurity atom occupying space between the lattice sites.
These defects can arise from the imperfect lattice formation during crystallization
or due to impurities in the material during crystallization. The defects can also
arise from thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms at elevated temperatures. Vacan-
cies may be a single or they may condense into a larger vacancy. Conversely,
defects within a single-crystal lattice structure may be intentionally created via
FIGURE 2.7 Schematic of lattice point and line defects.

the processes of diffusion or implantation to produce effects in the electronic
structure of the material for MEMS or microelectronics manufacturing.
The most common type of line defect is an edge dislocation, which is the
edge of an extra plane of atoms within a crystal structure (Figure 2.7). This type
of dislocation distorts the lattice, thus increasing the energy along the edge
dislocation. There can also be surface defects, which are basically the transition
region, grain boundaries, in a polycrystalline material. Each grain of a polycrys-
talline material is a crystal oriented differently, and the grain boundary is the
transition between the grains (Figure 2.2b).
Atoms can move within a solid material as shown in Figure 2.8. However,
energy is required to facilitate the movement. The energy required for the move-
ment of the atoms is called the activation energy and depends on a number of
factors, such as atom size and type of movement. A vacancy movement requires
less energy than an interstitial movement. Atoms can move within a lattice
without point or line defects using a method called ring diffusion (Figure 2.9).
These various methods of atomic movement within a crystal are utilized in
diffusion processes.

2.2 STARTING MATERIAL — SUBSTRATES
A substrate is needed for mechanical support or a platform upon which to build
the MEMS device. The substrate could be made of any material; however, con-
sideration of subsequent processing and the applications of the device that are to
build upon it require careful selection of the substrate material. MEMS devices
are generally built using the fabrication processes developed in the microelec-
tronics industry and the MEMS device may need to be integrated with electronics.
To a large extent, the microelectronics industry has been developed using
silicon-based materials. Silicon dominates this industry because silicon forms a
stable oxide essential in the formation of a MOS-FET (metal-oxide semiconductor
ﬁeld effect transistor). Another popular material for electronics is gallium arsenide
(GaAs). GaAs has a higher electron mobility than silicon, but the hole mobility
is lower and GaAs has a poor thermal oxide. GaAs-based microelectronics is
generally limited to high-speed analog circuits; however, GaAs has found appli-
cations in optical devices [5] and MEMS in recent years. 
Because the MEMS industry is heavily leveraging the materials and processes
of the microelectronics industry, MEMS substrates generally come from the
microelectronics infrastructure as well. Two substrates of particular interest for
MEMS applications are single-crystal substrates and silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
substrates.
2.2.1 SINGLE-CRYSTAL SUBSTRATE
2.2.1.1
Czochralski Growth Process
Czochralski growth is the method used to produce most of the single-crystal
substrates used in microelectronics and MEMS. The process was developed by
Czochralski in the early 1900s, and Teal [1] developed the process for use in the
microelectronics industry. Czochralski growth (Figure 2.10) involves the solidi-
ﬁcation of a crystal from a molten bath. 
High-grade polycrystalline silicon is loaded into a fused silica crucible that
is purged with an inert gas. The crucible and its contents are heated to approxi-
mately 1500°C to form a molten bath. A seed crystal is then lowered into contact
with the molten bath. This crystal is approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, and it

has been carefully etched and oriented because it will serve as a template for
crystal growth. The solidiﬁcation or crystal growth is accomplished by the reduc-
tion in temperature as the seed crystal is gradually withdrawn from the molten
bath. A simple heat transfer analysis of the liquid–solid interface can be per-
formed, as depicted in Equation 2.1, which shows that the speed of withdrawal,
which is proportional to dm/dt, is limited by the transfer of the latent heat of
fusion across the interface:
(2.1)
where
K = thermal conductivity
L = latent heat of fusion
T = temperature
A = area
m = mass
x = pull direction of boule
t = time
In reality, the pull rate is slower than the heat transfer limit and changes
during the process. At the beginning of the process, the pull rate is rapid to form
a tang, which is a narrow, highly perfect crystal that will trap crystal imperfec-
tions. The crucible and the seed crystal are then counter-rotated; the pull rate and
temperature of the furnace are lowered to form a boule of the desired size. Boules
of up to 300 mm in diameter can be produced. 
Silicon in its pure or intrinsic state is a semiconductor with an electrical
resistance between that of a conductor and an insulator. The resistance can be
signiﬁcantly varied by introducing a small amount of impurities into the silicon
crystal lattice. These impurities or dopants are added to the molten bath to obtain
wafers of a particular resistivitiy.
Silicon is in group IV of the periodic table and it has four valence electrons,
which can form four covalent bonds with all four neighboring silicon atoms in
single-crystal silicon. If silicon is doped with a small amount of a group V
element, an excess of valance electrons will be present. Frequently used group
V dopants are phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), or antimony (Sb). Silicon doped with
these impurities is referred to as n-type, in which electrons are the majority
carriers. If silicon is doped with a small amount of a group III element such as
Boron (B), holes will be the majority carrier; this is referred to as p-type.
However, the dopant materials that are added to the charge of materials in
the Czochralski growth process have different solubility in the liquid and solid
phases. A segregation coefﬁcient, K, is a metric deﬁned as the ratio of the impurity
concentration in the solid phase (Cs) and phase liquid (CL) (see Equation 2.2).
Table 2.3 lists the segregation coefﬁcients of some commonly used impurities in

silicon. The segregation coefﬁcients for impurities in silicon are less than one,
which means that the dopants in the molten bath of the Czochralski growth
process are increasing as the boule is drawn from the bath. As a result, the dopant
concentration in the boule will also vary; however, reﬁnements to the Czochralski
process attempt to mitigate these effects.
(2.2)
The fused silica (SiO2) crucible used in the Czochralski process releases a
signiﬁcant amount of oxygen into the molten silicon, which will be incorporated
into the boule as shown by the segregation coefﬁcient of oxygen in silicon.
However, oxygen precipitates in silicon have several beneﬁcial features:
•
Oxygen helps localize crystal defects.
•
Oxygen increases the mechanical strength of silicon.
•
Oxygen traps mobile impurities.
2.2.1.2
Float Zone Process
The ﬂoat zone technique is used when very high purity silicon is required. Figure
2.11 is a schematic of a ﬂoat zone system, in which localized heating is done
using a high-power RF coil. The RF heater is moved along the length of the
silicon rod, where eddy current heating causes localized melting and crystalliza-
tion of the silicon. A crucible is not required in this process and the crystal
orientation is set by a seed crystal. The ﬂoat zone method is used for producing
high-purity, high-resistance silicon. It is difﬁcult to introduce a uniform distribu-
tion of dopants with this process; it is generally limited to production of smaller
diameter wafers and not generally used for GaAs.
2.2.1.3
Post-Crystal Growth Processing
Processing still remains to convert the boule of grown crystal into a polished
wafer suitable for use in microelectronic or MEMS processing (Figure 2.12). The
boule will have an undulating surface along its length due to the nature of the
growth process. First, the boule will have crystallographic and resistivity inspec-
tions after which the seed crystals will be removed and the boule ground to the

proper diameter. Silicon and gallium arsenide are brittle materials that can be
sawed and ground using diamond-bonded wheels. Flats will be ground into the
boules to identify crystallographic plane (Figure 2.13). For wafers greater than
150 mm, a notch will be ground into the edge. The boule will then be sawed into
wafers that are typically 625 to 725 µm thick. The edges of the wafers are rounded
by grinding to minimize chipping from subsequent mechanical handling. The
wafers are then lapped and polished, followed by subsequent etching to remove
any mechanical damage. Then, the wafers are laser marked for identiﬁcation and
quality-control purposes. Silicon wafers in use are typically 100 to 300 mm, with
commercial IC manufacturing currently working toward the use of 300-mm
wafers. GaAs wafers are typically 100 to 150 mm. 
2.2.2 SILICON ON INSULATOR (SOI) SUBSTRATE
Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers have found increased application in recent years
in the microelectronics industry. An SOI wafer consists of three layers: a base

single-crystal silicon layer or handling wafer; a buried silicon dioxide (BOX)
layer; and the silicon on insulator layer, as illustrated in Figure 2.14. The thickness
of the various layers can be speciﬁed when ordering SOI wafers.
Use of SOI wafers offers advantages for microelectronics and MEMS appli-
cations. In microelectronics, the active region (transistor junction) of the wafer
consists of only the top couple of microns. The rest of the wafer thickness

(typically ~700 µm) is for mechanical rigidity during processing and handling.
If the transistor could be fabricated on a very thin layer of single-crystal silicon
with an insulator below, the capacitance of the transistor could be reduced, thus
enabling higher speed switching cycles and lower power consumption. This
approach also reduces the microelectronic sensitivities to radiation, which can
cause data corruptions. This is a growing issue as operating voltages decrease. 
If the SOI layer can be made thick (10 to 100 µm), MEMS devices that
require very ﬂat stiff surfaces can be enabled. Optical MEMS devices frequently
require metalization or optical coatings to produce desired properties; however,
these layers can induce stresses in the optical structure that frequently have
ﬂatness constraints. Use of a thick SOI layer for this application is very attractive
[6]. Currently, two manufacturing processes are available for production of SOI
wafers: SIMOX and Unibond.
The SIMOX process, shown in Figure 2.15, produces SOI wafers by implan-
tation of oxygen. High-energy oxygen atoms are implanted into a single-crystal
silicon wafer. The depth of implantation of the oxygen atoms is controlled by
their energy. The implantation of oxygen will damage the silicon crystalline
structure. Then, the wafer is annealed, which will heal the damage induced by
the oxygen implantation as well as oxidize the silicon to create the BOX layer
of silicon dioxide.
An SOI wafer produced by the Unibond process involves the fusion bonding
of two wafers (Figure 2.16). One silicon wafer has an implanted subsurface layer
of hydrogen; the other has an outer layer of silicon dioxide. During the bonding
process, the heat causes the implanted hydrogen layer to fracture, yielding a thin
SOI layer.
2.3 PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (PVD)
Physical deposition processes are a class of material deposition methods that do
not require a chemical reaction for the deposition process to occur. Physical
deposition methods have the capability to deposit thin ﬁlms of conductors and
insulators that are used in MEMS application for optical coatings or electrical
conductors. The two physical deposition processes that will be discussed are
evaporation and sputtering.

2.3.1 EVAPORATION
A schematic of an evaporation chamber is shown in Figure 2.17. The key features
of an evaporator are:
•
High-vacuum chamber with an associated pumping system
•
Crucible containing the material to be deposited with an associated
heating system 
•
Wafer support structure for holding the samples to be coated
The evaporator may also have a shutter system for control of the deposition time
and multiple crucibles for depositing multiple layers or alloys. 
The crucible is frequently made of boron nitride (BN) and contains the molten
charge of material to be deposited. Several methods are available for heating the
charge of material. The simplest is resistive heating; however, for extremely high-
temperature evaporation, the resistive elements may also evaporate, leading to
contamination. Inductive heating and electron beam heating are alternative meth-
ods for these applications. 
Evaporation is a “line of sight” deposition phenomena from the molten mate-
rial source to the wafer. Several wafers may be ﬁxed around the crucible in various
orientations to increase throughput or enhance deposition on particular features.
Alloys or multilayer ﬁlms can be deposited via evaporation using an evaporator
equipped with multiple crucibles and a shutter system to control deposition times
of the various materials.
At low pressures and elevated temperatures, materials exhibit a vapor pres-
sure, Pv. The physical process for material loss from a molten sample due to the
elevated vapor pressure is evaporation. The process for material loss from a solid
due to an elevated vapor pressure is sublimination. Most practical processes

involve evaporation of material from molten samples. For materials of interest in
MEMS fabrication, vapor pressures less than a millitorr (i.e., 1 torr = 1 mm Hg)
are typical. Table 2.4 shows melting temperatures for various materials as well
as the range of temperature necessary for these materials to exhibit a vapor
pressure of 10–3 torr. These data show that the required temperature to achieve a
vapor pressure of 10–3 torr ranges from 889°C for aluminum (Al) to 3016°C for
tungsten (W). The higher temperature materials require specialized equipment
for heating and minimization of contamination due to the elevated vapor pressure
of other materials in the chamber at these temperatures.
The kinetic of theory gases (Equation 2.3) can relate the evaporator chamber
pressure, Pv, and temperature, T, to the ﬂux of atoms leaving the surface of the
molten sample, J:
(2.3)
where
Pv = vapor pressure
k = Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 J/°K)
T = temperature (°K)
M = atomic mass
J = atomic ﬂux 
The mass ﬂux of deposition in an evaporation process can be calculated from the
preceding equation and a geometric “view factor” from the molten sample to the
deposition surface because evaporation is a line of sight deposition process. This
information can be used to determine deposition times and material thickness.
The line of sight nature of the evaporation deposition process leads to the
issue of step coverage of topographic features on a wafer. In any MEMS pro-
cessing sequence, topography will be generated on the wafer due to the sequence
of deposition, patterning, and etching that has preceded the evaporation process.
This issue for MEMS is accentuated due to the thickness of the layers involved.
Because evaporation is a line of sight phenomena, the rate of material deposition

on the top and bottom of a topographic feature is greater than on the side walls
of the feature (see Figure 2.18). This leads to thinner coverage of the side walls
and possibly very thin coverage in the corners of the topographic features.
Methods such as rotating the wafer during deposition or heating the wafer to
increase the surface mobility of the deposited atoms have been used to mitigate
the step coverage issues encountered in evaporation. However, step coverage
issues of a particular process can sometimes be used to advantage — for example,
in the development of a “lift-off” process for patterning of deposited layers (see
Section 2.6.2). Also, a self-shadowing design feature can be used in a MEMS
device to allow a blanket evaporation of a conductive material such as gold and
yet maintain electrical isolation of different portions of a design.
2.3.2 SPUTTERING
Sputtering is a process that has its roots as far back as 1852 [2]. The sputtering
process utilizes a plasma formed by a large voltage in a low pressure gas (0.1
torr) across a closely spaced electrode pair. The target material (source material
to be deposited) is on the cathode. The ions come from an inert gas within the
chamber. Bombardment of the cathode by energetic ions gives rise to the sput-
tering process. When ions strike a material surface, several things can happen,
depending on the energy of the ions:
•
Bouncing off the surface
•
Absorption by the surface to produce heat
•
Penetration of the surface to deposit the energy within the material
•
Ejection of surface atoms from the cathode (sputtered)
FIGURE 2.18 Step coverage of topographic features.
© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

Fabrication Processes
35
Sputtered atoms have more energy than evaporated atoms, which increase the
surface mobility of the sputtered atoms. Increased surface mobility produces better
step coverage than is attainable with the evaporation process. Because ion colli-
sions give rise to the sputtering of the target material, a gas with a high atomic
weight is advantageous.Argon is a frequently used inert gas in a sputtering process.
Sputtered ﬁlms can be deposited at ambient temperature. The sputter depo-
sition does not depend on the substrate temperature; however, substrate may be
heated to promote adhesion or prevent ﬁlm cracking.
There are several variations to the sputtering process to achieve special effects.
•
Reactive sputtering. A chemical combination between the sputtered
material and the ambient gas reacts to form a compound (e.g., sputter
silicon with a nitrogen ambient to form silicon nitride ﬁlms).
•
Triode sputtering. An additional ﬁlament in the chamber is used to
increase the sputter rate by producing additional electrons.
•
Magnetron sputtering. A magnetic ﬁeld is used to increase density of
electrons, which will increase the sputter rate.
2.4 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD)
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes involve a chemical reaction in the
deposition of a material. The chemical reactions can occur in the gas phase or
on the surface; however, the reaction that occurs on the surface is generally
more useful. The reactions that occur in the gas phase tend to produce particles,
which is not usually beneﬁcial. The CVD chemical reactions can have the
following variants:
•
A compound decomposes at temperature. For example, silane gas
(SiH4) can decompose under heating at greater than 400°C to produce
silicon and hydrogen.
•
A combination of compounds react to produce a ﬁlm. Silane gas (SiH4)
and oxygen (O2) react to form silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silane is very
reactive and it can spontaneously ignite or explode.
A large number of CVD reactions can be useful for deposition (Table 2.5). CVD
reactions can be used for deposition of silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride
ﬁlms, as well as tungsten, aluminum, titanium nitride, and copper ﬁlms.
A CVD reactor is a complicated system in which pressure, energy, and ﬂow
of reactants must be carefully controlled to produce a good ﬁlm (Figure 2.19). An
evacuation system is also needed for the reactor to remove the reaction by-products
and to remove contaminants. The reactor is carefully designed with the ﬂuid and
thermal transport issues in mind to produce a carefully controlled, uniform depo-
sition process. The ﬂuid dynamic issues in CVD reactor design include:
© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

36
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
•
Fluid boundary layer control. This greatly inﬂuences the diffusion of
reactants to the wafer surface.
•
Nonuniformity of gas ﬂows. Phenomena such as recirculation cells can
have a great impact on uniformity of deposition across the wafer surface.
These considerations lead to design of wafer mounting and the ﬂow paths within
the reactor. The resultant CVD processes must be controlled kinetically or by
mass transport. Kinetically controlled processes are limited by the reaction rate
that can take place at the wafer surface. A mass transport-controlled process is
limited by the ﬂow of reactant gases in the CVD reactor.
Several versions of CVD processes are available:
•
Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD). Due to its high deposition rates,
APCVD is primarily used to deposit thick dielectrics such as silicon
nitride. A drawback of APCVD is particulate contamination.
•
Low-pressure CVD (LPCVD). LPCVD operates at 0.1 to 1 torr pres-
sure and produces high-quality conformal ﬁlms. Due to the low pres-
sure, the diffusion effects in the process are minimized. LPCVD is
used to deposit silicon dioxide, polycrystalline silicon, tungsten, and
silicon nitride.
•
Plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD). The plasma decomposes the
incoming reactant gases generating ions and radicals, which recom-
bine to form a surface ﬁlm. PECVD is a low-temperature process
(i.e., <400°C), but the low temperature also reduces surface mobility
of the reactants, which frequently leads to amorphous ﬁlms. The
PECVD process is frequently used for deposition of silicon nitride
passivation layers.
The choice of process generally depends on the maximum processing tempera-
ture, ﬁlm stress, and ﬁlm quality (number of pinholes).

2.5 ETCHING PROCESSES
Etching processes are a fundamental process used in microelectronics and MEMS
to impress a desired pattern into a material. There are several options, depending
upon the various features that are important to be achieved. The considerations
for selection of a particular etch process include:
•
Etch rate. The speed of the etch needs to be fast enough to be viable
for production but controllable.
•
Uniformity. The etch is not location dependent.
•
Selectivity. The etch rate ratio of the material desired to be etched vs.
the material that is not desired to be etched is important in selecting
the mask to be used in the etch process and the layer or material upon
which the etch will stop.
•
Directionality. The etch can be isotropic (omnidirectional), or aniso-
tropic (directional). 
Etching processes can be characterized by the method used to achieve the
material etch. Etching can be done by physical or chemical attack of the material.
Ion milling is an example of a physical attack of a material to achieve an etch.
The material is physically bombarded by ions that will remove material similar
to sputtering of a target. A chemical etch involves a chemical reaction that can
be isotropic or anisotropic. Wet etching, plasma etching, and ion milling will be
discussed further.
2.5.1 WET CHEMICAL ETCHING
Wet etching is purely a chemical process that is an isotropic etch in an amorphous
material such as silicon dioxide and can be directional in crystalline materials
such as silicon. Contaminants and particulate in this type of process are purely
a function of the chemical purity and chemical system cleanliness. Figure 2.20
illustrates the phases involved in chemical etching:
•
Movement of the chemical reactants to the surface
•
The chemical reaction that performs the etching
•
Removal of the chemical reaction by-products
The slowest step in this process is called the rate limiting step. Agitation of
the wet chemical bath is frequently used to aid in the movement of reactants and
by-products to and from the surface. Agitation will also aid the uniformity of the
etch because the by-product may form solids or gases that must be moved. A
modern wet chemical bench will usually have agitation, temperature, and time
controls as well as ﬁltration to remove particulate.

with a 6:1 by volume water to HF mixture. Equation 2.4 is the chemical reaction
involved in this etch. Because hydroﬂuoric (HF) acid is consumed in this reaction,
the concentration will decrease as the etch proceeds; this would require that more
HF be added to maintain concentration. Alternatively, a buffering agent could be
used to help maintain a concentration and pH in this reaction. Equation 2.5 shows
the chemical reaction that would enable NH4F to be used as a buffering agent in
the HF etch.

Wet etching methods can be used on crystalline material to achieve anisotro-
pic directional etches. For example, a common directional wet etchant for crys-
talline silicon is potassium hydroxide (KOH). KOH etches 100 times faster in
the (100) direction than the (111) direction. Patterned silicon dioxide can be used
as an etch mask for these types of etches. Very directional etches can be achieved
with these techniques, as illustrated in Figure 2.21. Note the angular features
(54.7°) that can be etched in silicon. Table 2.6 lists some of the common etchants
for crystalline silicon and their selectivity.
Boron-doped silicon has a greatly reduced etch rate in KOH. Boron-doped
diffused or implanted regions have been used to form features or as an etch stop
(Figure 2.22).

Plasma etching includes a large variety of etch processes and associated
chemistries that involve varying amounts of physical and chemical attack. The
plasma provides a ﬂux of ions, radicals, electrons, and neutral particles to the
surface to be etched. Ions produce physical and chemical attack of the surface,

and the radicals contribute to chemical attack. The sequence of events that occur
in a plasma etch chamber (Figure 2.23) are listed below:
•
Plasma breaks down the feed gases into chemically reactive species.
•
Reactive species diffuse to the wafer surface and are adsorbed.
•
Surface diffusion of reactive species takes place until they chemically
react.
•
Reaction product desorption occurs.
•
Reaction products diffuse away from the surface.
•
Reaction products are transported out of the chamber
The details and types of etch chemistries involved in plasma etching are varied
and quite complex. This topic is too voluminous to be discussed in detail here,
but a number of excellent references on this subject are available [3,4]. The proper
choice of these chemistries produces various etch rates and selectivity of material
etch rates, which is essential to the integration of processes to produce micro-

electronics or MEMS devices. Fluoride etch chemistries are one of the most
widely studied for silicon etches. Equation 2.6 through Equation 2.8 illustrate
some of the ﬂuoride reactions involved in the etching of silicon, silicon dioxide,
and silicon nitride, respectively. A number of feed gases can produce the free
radicals involved in these reactions.
(2.6)
(2.7)
(2.8)
The anisotropy of the plasma etch can be increased by the formation of
nonvolatile ﬂuorocarbons that deposit on the sidewalls. This process is called
polymerization and is controlled by the ratio of ﬂuoride to carbon in the reactants.
The side wall deposits produced by polymerization can only be removed by
physical ion collisions. Etch products from the resist masking are also involved
in the polymerization.
End point detection of an etch is important in controlling the etch depth or
minimizing the damage to underlying ﬁlms. This detection is accomplished by
analysis of the etch efﬂuents or spectral analysis of the plasma glow discharge. 
Types of plasma etches include reactive ion etching (RIE) and high-density
plasma etching (HDP). RIE etching utilizes a low-pressure plasma. Chlorine (Cl)-
based plasmas are commonly used to etch silicon, GaAs, and Al. RIE etching
may damage the material due to the impacts of the ions; this can be removed by
annealing at high temperatures. HDP etches utilize magnetic and electric ﬁelds

to increase dramatically the distance that free electrons can travel in the plasma.
HDP etches have good selectivity of Si to SiO2 and resist.
2.5.3 ION MILLING
Ion milling is a purely physical etching process; no chemical reactions are
involved. Ion milling uses noble gases with signiﬁcant mass such as argon in a
process analogous to sputtering. This process is very isotropic because the ion
impinges the surface nearly vertically. However, the process has an etch rate
selectivity of the material to be etched to the mask material of nearly 1:1 because
the process is purely physical. Ion milling is not widely used for production
applications, and it is generally limited to the smaller wafer sizes (<200 mm).
The etch rates can be increased by increasing the ion densities impacting the
surface through the use of magnetic ﬁelds.
2.6 PATTERNING
The ability to pattern deposited layers is an essential capability required in
microelectronics and MEMS processing. Three widely utilized methods of pat-
terning will be discussed: lithography, the lift-off process, and the damascene
process.
Lithography is the mainstream process utilized for patterning in MEMS
processes. Lift-off and damascene are processes used for patterning materials in
which a reliable etch process such as metallization layers or optical coating layers
does not exist. These are frequently required in the postprocessing of MEMS
devices.
The current research and development in patterning for very ﬁne line widths
(<0.35 µm) involve the development of sophisticated tools such as x-ray lithog-
raphy [7] or direct-write E-beam lithography [8]. Microelectronics will need the
capability to pattern features (line widths) of this size in the future in order to
continue development of microelectronic devices of increasing speed and capa-
bility. However, mainstream MEMS technology does not currently require such
ﬁne features, so these methods will not be discussed here.
2.6.1 LITHOGRAPHY
Lithography is the most widely used method to pattern layers in microelectronic
and MEMS processing. Figure 2.24 is a schematic of a basic lithography system.
The basic components of a photolithographic system include:

Illumination source
•
Shutter

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
Lithography is the most critical process in microelectronics and MEMS
processes, and the equipment is generally the most costly in a microelectronics
or a MEMS fabrication facility. For example, a microelectronic process will
require 20 or more lithography steps, and a surface micromachine process will
require 10 or more lithography steps. A lithography process step will generally
require application and prebaking of the photoresist to harden the resist; the
exposure of the photoresist in the lithography tool; development of the photoresist;
and a postbake of the photoresist to fully harden the resist to deﬁne the feature
accurately. Thus, a lithography step requires several subprocesses that are repeat-
edly performed to fabricate a MEMS or microelectronic device. The other pro-
cessing steps required in a MEMS or microelectonic fabrication may go through
different tools for a speciﬁc deposition or a particular type of etch, but lithography
is the common tool that will always be used. Therefore, lithography is the critical
path in the fabrication facility and much attention is paid to the development of
technology and enhancements that can speed this process step.
The performance metrics most important to lithographic processing are res-
olution, registration, and processing throughput. The resolution for optical lithog-
raphy is very closely tied to the wavelength of the illumination source. The
development of lithographic equipment has used ever decreasing wavelength
illumination from the visible spectrum to ultraviolet (UV) and on to the research
and development use of extreme ultraviolet (EUV). 
The design of the optical system of the lithographic equipment is very com-
plex, as can be illustrated by the discussion of a few key parameters of the optical
system. The minimum line width, Wmin, capability of the lithographic system can
be expressed by Equation 2.9, which is very similar to the Raleigh criteria [9]
for optical resolution:

(2.9)
where
Wmin = minimum line width
K = a measure of the ability of the photoresist to distinguish changes in 
intensity
λ = illumination source wavelength
NA = numerical aperture
The numerical aperture deﬁned by Equation 2.10 is a function of the refractive
index, n, of the medium between the objective and wafer and the half angle of
the image, α:
(2.10)
Another optical parameter of interest in the design of the lithographic system
is the depth of focus, σ (Equation 2.11). The depth of focus is an issue in MEMS
fabrication due to the thickness of the ﬁlms involved and the possible wafer
warpage due to residual stress of the deposited ﬁlms. Films involved in MEMS
processes can be several microns thick. Patterning of the various layers will give
rise to topographic features on the wafers. When photoresist is spread on a wafer
containing these topographical features or the wafer is warped due to ﬁlm residual
stress, the lithographic process will attempt to expose the photoresist at various
heights, thus making the depth of focus capability a critical issue. 
(2.11)
As can be seen from this limited subset of the optical design parameters, the
optical design is complex and the design parameters interrelated. For example,
to make Wmin smaller, utilizing a smaller wavelength source, λ, and a larger
NA would be beneﬁcial; however, the depth of focus, σ, will be reduced as a
result.
Masks contain the patterns that need to be etched into the material to imple-
ment the MEMS design. The masks can be the same size (1:1) as the patterns to
be transferred and etched into the MEMS material. Depending on the lithographic
system, the masks may be larger than the patterns to be etched into the material.
Masks are typically 1×, 5×, or 10× larger than the patterns to be imaged and
etched. The mask is made of materials (e.g., fused silica) that are transparent at
the illumination wavelength, with the patterns deﬁned by an opaque material
(e.g., chromium) at the illumination wavelength. The mask will need to be very
ﬂat and insensitive to changes in temperature (e.g., small coefﬁcient of thermal

expansion, αT). Contamination control is also an issue in the lithography process.
For example, masks may have a pellicle membrane (Figure 2.25) held above the
patterned area to keep particles off the mask surface and out of the image plane
of the mask to prevent degradation of the lithographic image.
Photoresist is a photosensitive organic compound applied to the wafer surface.
The photoresist consists of three components:
•
Resin material is organic material that forms the bulk material of the
photoresist that will affect the durability during subsequent processing
and resolution of the photoresist.
•
Photoactive compound is the photosensitive material that determines
the sensitivity of the photoresist (mJ/cm2) to the illumination needed
to produce a chemical change.
•
Solvent is the component affecting the viscosity of the resist that affects
the application of photoresist, which is generally done by spinning the
wafer and using centrifugal force to spread the photoresist to a uniform
thickness. The solvent in the resist is then removed during the baking
steps to make the material structurally rigid.
FIGURE 2.25 Photomask with pellicle.

Fabrication Processes
47
The lithographic process will transfer the image from the mask to photoresist
on the wafer surface. Two types of photoresist can be used:
•
Negative resist. The region of photoresist that has not been exposed to
the illumination will dissolve during the development process and be
removed.
•
Positive resist. The region of photoresist that has been exposed to the
illumination will dissolve during the development process and be
removed. Positive resist has the best resolution and is more widely used.
After it is exposed and developed, the photoresist will be used as a physical
mask during subsequent etching processes to transfer the pattern in photoresist
on to the thin ﬁlm of MEMS material beneath the photoresist. Photoresist is a
key material in the lithographic processing sequence as well as the subsequent
etch steps. It must have a diverse set of properties to enable the deﬁnition of the
pattern and also maintain physical integrity during subsequent etching processes. 
The aligner is the piece of mechanical equipment that supports the litho-
graphic optical system and mask. It will align the masks relative to target patterns
on the wafer; this will have the effect of aligning the masks and their subsequently
etched patterns on the wafer with the mask and patterns utilized later in the
fabrication sequence. Figure 2.26 shows a typical alignment target, which is
typically speciﬁed by the lithographic system manufacturer. Two general types
of aligners will be considered here:
•
Contact/proximity aligner. The mask is held in contact or close prox-
imity (a few microns) of the photoresist surface. These aligners utilize
1× masks and do not have pellicles due to the lack of available clear-
ance between the mask and photoresist. The contact aligner actually
FIGURE 2.26 Example of a lithographic alignment target.

48
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
presses the mask under pressure against the photoresist, which will
have the effect of degrading the mask under repeated use. This category
of aligner is the least expensive, and has the lowest resolution capa-
bility. These aligners are generally used for research or limited pro-
duction applications.
•
Projection aligner. The mask and wafer are separated as dictated by
the design of the optical system. This class of aligner can have high
resolution that is only limited by optical system performance. These
systems can be very expensive and are utilized in high-volume
manufacturing.
2.6.2 LIFT-OFF PROCESS
Lift-off is a patterning process frequently used in MEMS for patterning materials
that do not possess a reliable process to etch them (e.g., noble metals). The lift-
off process is accomplished via the use of an intermediate layer and deposition
process, which has poor step coverage. Figure 2.27 is a schematic of a lift-off
process that will deposit and pattern a material on a substrate or underlying layer.
This process involves the following steps:
•
Deposit and pattern a thick intermediate layer of a material that is easy
to remove (e.g., SiO2 or photoresist) and that will have a slightly
reentrant proﬁle.
•
Deposit a layer of the material to be patterned utilizing a process that
has poor step coverage (e.g., evaporation). The material thickness
should be a fraction of the intermediate layer thickness.
FIGURE 2.27 Lift-off process schematic.

•
Removal of the intermediate layer will cause the metal layer to fracture
due to the stress concentration in the region of poor step coverage.
Alternatively, the lift-off process can involve a process that will explicitly
form an undercut metal layer and not rely on the metal layer to fracture at the
step. Figure 2.28 is a schematic of a process that will involve the explicit devel-
opment of an undercut region:
•
Deposit thick intermediate layer of a material (e.g., SiO2).
•
Deposit and pattern a layer of photoresist.
•
Undercut the photoresist with a process such as wet chemical etching.
•
Deposit a layer of the material to be patterned utilizing a process that
has poor step coverage (e.g., evaporation). The material thickness
should be a fraction of the photoresist and oxide layers.
•
Remove the SiO2 and photoresist, which will leave only the patterned
metal layer.

2.6.3 DAMASCENE PROCESS
The damascene process is an ancient process ﬁrst developed in the Middle East
[10] and utilized to inlay elaborate patterns on metal swords with various soft
metals that could be easily polished. The concept of the damascene process
(Figure 2.29) starts with forming a mold upon a substrate, depositing a metal
which ﬁlls the mold and covers the surface. The surface is then polished so that
only the material within the mold remains. Then the mold material can optionally
be removed. The damascene process like the lift-off process is used to pattern
materials that do not possess a reliable method of etching. For MEMS and
microelectronics, these processes are used for patterning metal layers (e.g.,
copper, gold, etc.). The method frequently utilized for polishing the metal layer
back to the mold is chemical mechanical polishing, which is discussed later in
this chapter.
2.7 WAFER BONDING
Wafer bonding processes are used in packaging and to build up more complex
structures. For example, bulk micromachined devices can be assembled into more
complex structures by bonding multiple wafers together. Also, microﬂuidic chan-
nels can be formed by DRIE etching the channel in one wafer and bonding a
wafer to seal the channel. The two categories of wafer bonding processes that
will be discussed are silicon fusion bonding and anodic (electrostatic) bonding.
FIGURE 2.29 Damascene process schematic.
© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

Fabrication Processes
51
The choice of bonding process will be inﬂuenced by the thermal budget of the
devices and materials involved.
2.7.1 SILICON FUSION BONDING
At room temperature, two highly polished ﬂat silicon wafers brought into contact
will bond. The mechanism is believed to be hydrogen bonds between the surfaces.
The bond can be converted into a stronger Si–O–Si bond at an elevated temper-
ature (>800˚C). The main concern with this bonding technique is voids in the
bonded wafer due to surface defects, residues, and particulate on the surface. The
processing sequence for silicon fusion bonding will generally include the follow-
ing steps:
•
Polishing of the wafer surfaces to be bonded
•
Wafer surface wet cleaning processes to make the bond surface hydro-
philic, which will facilitate the bonding mechanism
•
Wafer surface inspection
•
Precise alignment of bond surfaces in a clean environment
•
Annealing of the bonded wafers
Other silicon-based materials such as polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon),
silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride can be similarly bonded. However, yield of
the bonded wafers due to voids will increase due to the different mechanical
properties of the wafers.
2.7.2 ANODIC BONDING
Anodic bonding is an electrostatic bonding technique for glass to silicon wafers
or silicon wafers with a thin silicon dioxide layer between the wafers. Anodic
bonding utilizes a heated chuck with an electrode capable of applying a DC
voltage of up to 200V. Pressure may be optionally applied to facilitate the bonding
process. Figure 2.30 is a schematic of an anodic bonding process.
2.8 ANNEALING
Annealing is a process of elevating materials to a high temperature to achieve
one of the following effects:
•
Reduction of residual stresses in a material. The deposition process
temperature will greatly inﬂuence the residual stress in a deposited
ﬁlm. A way to reduce the ﬁlm residual stress is to anneal the ﬁlm at
a high temperature for a length of time (e.g., polysilicon residual stress
can be reduced by annealing at >1100°C for several hours in an inert
atmosphere, N2, which minimizes oxidation).
•
Activation of dopants. When dopants are implanted or diffused into a
material to create active electronic devices or piezoresistors, the dopants
© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

52
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
are activated by an anneal process. This process facilitates the dopants’
movement to an appropriate location within the material lattice struc-
ture. An anneal temperature of >600°C is typical for this application
•
Healing of material damage. Implantation of dopants into a material
will cause physical damage to the material through dislocations of the
material atoms. The material damage is healed by annealing the mate-
rial at an elevated temperature (e.g., >600°C).
•
Annealing bonded wafers to modify the wafer bond mechanism. Sili-
con to silicon wafer bonds are initially hydrogen bonds that are trans-
formed to a Si–O–Si bond through an annealing step that improves
the wafer bond strength. An anneal temperature of >800°C is typical
of this application.
Several anneal process issues are of concern, depending upon the application:
•
Thermal stresses, particularly when dissimilar materials are involved
•
Doping proﬁle perturbation at elevated temperatures
•
Melting of metal layers, which generally occurs at greater than 450°C
Annealing can be accomplished via an isothermal process in which the
material is exposed to the elevated temperature over a long period of time. The
isothermal annealing processes generally require a thermal controlled volume
with a controlled atmosphere.
Rapid thermal annealing processes that anneal only a small distance into the
material exist. This process will minimize doping proﬁle perturbations and melt-
ing of metal layers within a device. This localized rapidly varying thermal cycling
can be achieved within a fast ramp furnace, which can achieve thermal transients
on the order of 75°C/min. A more rapid thermal transient can be achieved by
moving the wafer within a furnace that has thermal gradients designed into the
equipment. Figure 2.31 is a schematic of a rapid thermal anneal furnace in which

the wafer temperature is controlled via an elevator within the furnace. Thermal
transients on the order of 100°C/sec can be achieved with this type of system.
2.9 CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING (CMP)
Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a process originally developed in the
microelectronics industry to planarize the layers of interconnect. CMP has also
been adapted to MEMS processing in surface micromachining (see Figure 2.32).
CMP has become essential to MEMS fabrication to remove the topography
formed due to the repeated deposition, patterning, and etching of multiple thick
ﬁlm of material typical in MEMS surface micromachine processes. The topog-
raphy generated in the MEMS processes make patterning with lithographic meth-
ods difﬁcult due to depth of focus issues and poor photoresist coverage over the
uneven surface. The topography also makes the design difﬁcult as well. Figure
2.32 shows a comparison of a MEMS layer in a surface micromachine process
with and without CMP in the process.
In Figure 2.33, CMP utilizes a slurry of silica particles and a dilute etching
agent applied between the wafer and a pad that is mechanically moved (i.e., a
combination of rotation and linear motion). The removal rate, typically on the
order of 1000s of angstroms per minute, is a function of the pad pressure, relative
velocity, and slurry chemistry. For surface micromachining processes, CMP can
be applied to the sacriﬁcial layers so that the structural layer deposited on top
will not have topography. CMP can also be used in the damascene process
discussed previously to polish the metal layer back to the mold.

2.10 MATERIAL DOPING
Dopants are impurities intentionally added to a semiconductor that can achieve
several objectives. Active electronic devices are produced by adding dopants to
a semiconductor material to create the necessary n- and p-junctions. Piezore-
sistors can be used in sensing applications and are created by doping a portion
of a semiconductor material located in a region of high strain. Also, because
doped silicon has different etch characteristics than single-crystal silicon, a
doped layer can be used as an etch stop; this will facilitate bulk micromachining
manufacture.
Figure 2.34 is a two-dimensional representation of a silicon lattice structure
with a doping material included in the lattice. Silicon is in group IV of the
periodic table and has four electrons in its outer shell; it shares these with four
adjacent atoms to form a three-dimensional lattice structure. Covalent bonding
is the sharing of electrons in the outer shell. For pure single-crystal silicon, all
of the electrons in the outer shell of the silicon atoms are shared, thus producing
a silicon crystal with no free electrons. If the silicon lattice has a small amount
of a dopant, a free electron or a hole can be produced. Figure 2.34a shows
silicon doped with phosphorus, a group V element with ﬁve electrons in the
FIGURE 2.32 SUMMiT (Sandia ultraplanar multilevel MEMS technology) polysili-

outer shell. This will produce a free electron in the lattice and produce what is
referred to as an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, a silicon lattice doped with
a group III element, such as boron (with three electrons in the outer shell), will
produce an unfulﬁlled covalent bond in the structure or a hole. This is a p-type
semiconductor. Table 2.7 is a short list of the group III, IV, and V elements
commonly used.
Two types of processes are utilized to introduce the dopants into a semicon-
ductor material: diffusion and implantation. A diffusion will place the source
material for the dopant atoms on the surface of the semiconductor material and
allow the dopants to diffuse into the semiconductor under elevated temperature.
Implantation will use a particle accelerator to implant the dopant atoms physically
into the semiconductor. As a result of this physical implantation of the dopant
atoms, the semiconductor lattice structure is damaged. The implant damage is
then healed and the dopants activated via an anneal process step.

and boron to produce an n-type and a p-type semiconductor, respectively.

2.10.1 DIFFUSION
The diffusion process is performed by placing the source material for the dopant
atoms on the surface of a wafer and allowing the dopant atoms to diffuse into
the semiconductor wafer under elevated temperature. Frick’s law provides a
mathematical model of the diffusion process (Equation 2.12), which is illustrated
in a one-dimensional example in Figure 2.35.
(2.12)
where
C = concentration of dopant atoms as a function of space and time
D = diffusion coefﬁcient, which depends upon the dopant and condition 
of the diffusion process, such as temperature
The diffusion coefﬁcient is the proportionality constant between the dopant
atom ﬂux across a surface, J, and the rate of change in dopant atom concentration
across that interface, as shown in Equation 2.13. The negative sign indicates that
the material will diffuse to decrease the concentration:
(2.13)
Frick’s law is a boundary value problem that can be solved analytically for
the one-dimensional case to yield solutions that will correspond to physical
implementations of the diffusion process used to dope semiconductors. Two
instructive solutions of Frick’s law will be examined.

Case 1. In this case, the dopants constantly arrive at the surface of the
wafer to maintain a constant dopant concentration, Cs, on the wafer surface
(Equation 2.14). The dopant concentration deep within the wafer is 0, as shown
in Equation 2.15:
(2.14)
(2.15)
Equation 2.14 and Equation 2.15 are the problem boundary conditions. The initial
condition at t = 0 is that the concentration is zero throughout the domain:
(2.16)
Frick’s equation with these boundary and initial conditions can be solved to
yield, Equation 2.17.
 is called the diffusion length — a quantity that appears
in the analytical solutions of Frick’s equations. The solution of Frick’s equation
also involves the complementary error function, which is tabulated in a number
of references [11]. Figure 2.36a plots this solution of Frick’s equation, which
shows the dopant concentration increasing within the wafer and penetrating
deeper as time increases. The concentration remains constant at the wafer surface.
(2.17)
Case 2. In this situation, a ﬁxed amount of dopant, Q, has been initially
introduced to the wafer, as shown in Equation 2.18. The initial distribution is
approximated as a delta function at x = 0, and the initial concentration elsewhere
in the wafer is 0 (Equation 2.19). There are two boundary conditions for this
case. For the surface, x = 0, no additional dopants are added (Equation 2.20).
This boundary condition is obtained from Frick’s ﬁrst law, Equation 2.13, which
relates the dopant ﬂux at a surface, J, and the rate of change of the concentration
at the surface. The second boundary condition assumes that the wafer is thick;
therefore, at x = ∞, the concentration is zero (Equation 2.21).

The analytical solution for Frick’s law with these initial and boundary con-
ditions is a Gaussian function shown in Equation 2.22. The solution for this case
is illustrated in Figure 2.36, which shows that the slope of the concentration is
zero at x = 0 because there is no dopant ﬂux at the x = 0 surface. Also, the
concentration at the surface x = 0 decreases with time, which can be calculated
from Equation 2.22:
(2.22)
The implementation of the diffusion process can involve a gaseous, liquid,
or solid source of dopants (Table 2.8). The wafer can be masked to allow the
dopants to diffuse into selected locations (Figure 2.37). Silicon dioxide can be
used for the masking material in the diffusion process because the diffusion
coefﬁcient for silicon dioxide is approximately 104 less than the diffusion coef-
ﬁcient of silicon at typical processing temperatures (Table 2.9). Two mechanisms
of diffusion occur, as illustrated in Figure 2.38. Interstitial diffusion is the mech-
anism through which atoms (e.g., H2, He, Na, O2) that do not strongly interact
with silicon diffuse through the silicon lattice. Lattice vacancy exchange is the
mechanism used by the important group III and V dopants.

2.10.2 IMPLANT
Implantation is the most common method for doping a semiconductor used today.
Implantation utilizes a particle accelerator to implant the ions of up to 200 keV
physically into the wafer material. This physical implantation process will damage
the lattice material, which is subsequently annealed to remove the damage and
allow the implanted ion to ﬁll vacancies in the silicon lattice (i.e., activate the
dopants). Implantation is the most frequently used method of doping material
because of several signiﬁcant advantages:
•
Precise dopant control 
•
Less lateral diffusion
•
Variety of doping proﬁles attainable (Figure 2.39)
Figure 2.40 shows a schematic of an ion implantation system. The principal
components are the ion source; magnetic analysis system; resolving aperture;
accelerator; beam control system; mask; and Faraday cup. The ion source pro-
duces a ﬂux of ions that is sent through the magnetic analysis system to select
the desired ions, which produce a collumated beam after they pass through the
resolving aperture. The ions are then accelerated to the desired energy level by
the accelerator and the beam position controlled and scanned by the beam control
system. The ion dose is measured by the Faraday cup where the wafer is posi-

dopants to the wafer.
2.11 SUMMARY
This chapter provided an overview of the individual processes that can be used
in MEMS fabrication technology. Most of the fabrication processes that have
been presented are an outgrowth of the microelectronics industry. The fabrication
processes can be combined to form a fabrication sequence or technology. MEMS
technologies are discussed in the next chapter.
The fabrication process for starting material or substrates was presented in
Section 2.2. MEMS fabrication frequently involves the deposition, patterning,
and etching of a material upon a substrate (i.e., an additive process) or etching

the substrate material (i.e., a subtractive process). The fabrication methods were
presented for a single-crystal substrate (i.e., Czochralski growth, ﬂoat zone) as
well as for silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates (i.e., SIMOX, Unibond).
A fundamental process sequence will generally involve deposition, pattern-
ing, and etching. The deposition processes of physical vapor deposition (PVD)
and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and their variants were presented. The
selection of deposition process and its parameters will control characteristics of
the deposited ﬁlm such as residual stress, and conformal or nonconformal layer.
These characteristics can be very important to subsequent MEMS fabrication
processes or the MEMS device.
Etching processes can be isotropic or anisotropic in nature. The selection of
the speciﬁc etch process and material is important in determining these charac-
teristics. The wet chemical etching, plasma etching, and ion milling processes
were discussed. To a large degree, patterning is performed via lithographic meth-
ods. However, for materials that do not have a viable etch process, the lift-off or
damascene process can be utilized.
A number of other processes used to achieve speciﬁc effects were presented.
Annealing is utilized in a manner similar to macroscale manufacturing to relieve
residual stresses. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is used to remove topog-
raphy in ﬁlms or for patterning a ﬁlm in a damascene process. The doping of a
material for electrical purposes can be achieved by diffusion or implantation
processes. Wafer bonding is a process that can be used to produce a speciﬁc
structure for packaging or a MEMS device.

3 MEMS Technologies
For all but the simplest of applications, the large assortment of individual fabri-
cation processes discussed in Chapter 2 needs to be combined synergistically to
form a technology that can produce useful MEMS devices. Three dominant
MEMS fabrication technologies — philosophically different in their approach —
are currently in use:
•
LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung)
•
Bulk micromachining
•
Sacriﬁcial surface micromachining 
Figure 3.1 illustrates the basic concepts of each of the three fabrication
approaches. Bulk micromachining and sacriﬁcial surface micromachining are
most frequently silicon based and are generally very synergistic to the microelec-
tronics industry because they tend to use common tool sets. 
Bulk micromachining (BMM) utilizes wet- or dry-etch processes to produce
an isotropic or anisotropic etch proﬁle in a material. Bulk micromachining can
create large MEMS structures (tens of microns to a millimeter thick), which can
be used for applications such as inertial sensing or ﬂuid ﬂow channels. Commer-
cial applications of bulk micromachining have been available since the 1970s.
These applications include pressure sensors, inertial sensors, and ink-jet nozzles.
Sacriﬁcial surface micromachining (SSM) is a direct outgrowth of the fabri-
cation processes of the microelectronics industry. SSM technology also has a
path toward the integration of electronics with the MEMS structures, which will
facilitate control or sensing functions. SMM technology has had several com-
mercial successes in the last decade (Figure 3.2), including optical mirror arrays
and inertial sensors. Both of these applications include integrated microelectron-
ics for sensing and control functions. This technology is generally limited to
individual ﬁlm thicknesses of 2 to 6 µm with an overall device thickness of <15
µm. The resulting devices are assembled as they are fabricated, thus relieving a
difﬁcult task; this gives SSM technology a large advantage for applications
involving large arrays of devices.
LIGA technology was ﬁrst demonstrated in the1980s. This technology can
fabricate devices with small critical dimensions and high aspect ratios (i.e.,
thickness/width) with electroplated metallic materials. The metallic LIGA parts
can be used directly or as a die for an injection molding process to produce plastic
parts. This gives this technology the advantage in applications requiring a broad

set of materials. However, assembly of large numbers or arrays of devices that
require assembly is an issue that has spurred research in microassembly methods
(see Section 9.1.1.4).
The evaluation and selection of a fabrication process appropriate for an
application requires the assessment of a number of factors:
•
Feature size: the smallest dimension that can be fabricated with the
technology
•
Device thickness: inﬂuences the mass and stiffness of the MEMS
device; this is related to the aspect ratio capability of the fabrication
technology
•
Lateral dimension: how large a device can be made by the fabrication
technology
•
Precision: the technology precision (i.e., dimensional accuracy/nomi-
nal device dimension) that can be achieved
•
Materials: the materials that can be utilized in the fabrication technology
•
Assembly requirements: assembly required to produce a functioning
MEMS device (i.e., piece part vs. assembled system)
•
Scalability: whether the fabrication technology can produce large quan-
tities of devices if required
•
Ability to be integrated with microelectronics: the ability of the tech-
nology to be integrated directly with microelectronic circuitry on the
same die
A comparison of these capabilities for the MEMS fabrication technologies
as well as conventional machining for reference purposes is presented in Table
3.1. The impacts of the fabrication process capabilities on the capabilities of a
MEMS device are summarized in Table 3.2. MEMS device capabilities include
actuation method, mass, capacitance, out-of-plane stiffness, etc. These are the
issues through which the MEMS design engineer must sort to select a fabrication
process suitable for the device of interest.
3.1 BULK MICROMACHINING
Bulk micromachining technologies can use a combination of wet and dry etching
methods to achieve isotropic and anisotropic etches of features in materials. In
order to manufacture items of practical interest, a number of different aspects of
the etch processes need to be considered. Petersen [1] and Kovacs et al. [2] present
detailed information on etch rates and selectivity of crystallographic orientation
and materials. Pister [3] offers a very instructive fold-up model of silicon and its
etching rates for various orientations:
•
Masking
•
Etch selectivity due to crystallographic orientation or materials

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
3.1.1 WET ETCHING
Wet etching is purely a chemical process that is an isotropic etch in an amorphous
material such as silicon dioxide; it can be directional in crystalline materials such
as silicon. Contaminants and particulate in this type of process are purely a
function of the chemical purity and chemical system cleanliness. Agitation of the
wet chemical bath is frequently used to aid in the movement of reactants and by-
products to and from the surface. Agitation will also aid etch uniformity because
the by-products may form solids or gases that must be removed. A modern wet
chemical bench will usually have agitation, temperature, and time controls as well
as ﬁltration to remove particulate. For example, etching of SiO2 utilizing a 6:1 by
volume water to HF mixture is a common wet-etch process employed in a surface
micromachining release etch or the production of isotropic features. 
Wet-etching methods can also be used on crystalline materials such as silicon
to achieve anisotropic directional etches. For example, a common directional wet
etchant for crystalline silicon is potassium hydroxide (KOH). KOH etches 100
times faster in the (100) plane than the (111) plane. Patterned silicon dioxide or
silicon nitride, which etches very slowly in KOH, can be used as an etch mask
for these types of etches. Very directional etches can be achieved with these
techniques, as illustrated in Figure 3.3. Note the angular features (54.7°) that can
be etched in silicon due to the etch selectivity of the (100) vs. the (111) crystal
plane. Table 2.6, Petersen [1], and Kovacs et al. [2] list some of the common
etchants for crystalline silicon and their selectivity.
If there are no etch stops in a wet etching process, the two options available
to the process engineer to achieve a speciﬁc etch depth are a timed etch or etching
completely through the material. A timed etch is difﬁcult to control accurately

due to the many other variables in a wet-etch process, such as temperature,
chemical agitation, purity, and concentration. If this is not satisfactory, etch stops
can be used in wet etching to deﬁne a boundary on which the etch can stop.
Several etch stops methods can be utilized in wet etching:
•
p+ (boron diffusion or implant) etch stop
•
Material-selective etch stop
•
Electrochemical etch stop
For example, the etch rate of boron-doped silicon (p-silicon) by KOH or EDP
can be up to 100 times less than the etch rate in undoped silicon [1–3]. Therefore,
boron-doped regions produced by diffusion or implantation have been used to
form features or as an etch stop (Figure 3.4).
A material-selective etch stop can be produced by a thin layer of a material
such as silicon nitride, which has a greatly reduced etch rate in etchants such as
KOH, EDP, and TMAH (Table 2.6). For example, a thin layer silicon nitride can
be deposited on a silicon device to form a membrane on which the etch will stop.
An electrochemical etch stop can also be used (Figure 3.5). Silicon readily
forms a silicon oxide layer that will impede etching of the bulk material (Table
2.6). The formation of the oxide layer is a reduction oxidation reaction, which
can be impeded by a reversed biased p–n junction that prevents the current
ﬂow necessary for the reduction oxidation reaction to occur. The p–n junction
can be formed on a p-type silicon wafer with an n-type region diffused or
implanted with an n-type dopant (e.g., phosphorus or arsenic) to a prescribed
depth. With the p–n junction reverse biased, the p-type silicon will be etched

because a protective oxide layer cannot be formed, and the etch will stop on
the n-type material.
3.1.2 PLASMA ETCHING
Plasma etching offers a number of advantages compared to wet etching, including:
•
Easy to start and stop the etch process
•
Repeatable etch process
•
Anisotropic etches
•
Few particulates
Plasma etching includes a large variety of etch processes and associated
chemistries [5] that involve varying amounts of physical and chemical attach.
The plasma provides a ﬂux of ions, radicals, electrons, and neutral particles to
the surface to be etched. Ions produce physical and chemical attack of the surface,
and the radicals contribute to chemical attack. The details and types of etch

chemistries involved in plasma etching are varied and complex and beyond the
scope of this book. 
The anisotropy of the plasma etch can be increased by the formation of
nonvolatile ﬂuorocarbons that deposit on the sidewalls (Figure 3.6). This process
is called polymerization and is controlled by the ratio of ﬂuoride to carbon in the
reactants. The side wall deposits produced by polymerization can only be removed
by physical ion collisions. Etch products from the resist masking are also involved
in the polymerization.
End-point detection of the etch is important in controlling the etch depth or
minimizing the damage to underlying ﬁlms. This detection is accomplished by
analysis of the etch efﬂuents or spectral analysis of the plasma glow discharge
to detect. 
Types of plasma etches include reactive ion etching (RIE); high-density
plasma etching (HDP); and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). RIE etching utilizes
a low-pressure plasma. Clorine (Cl)-based plasmas are commonly used to etch
silicon, GaAs, and Al. RIE etching may damage the material due to the impacts
of the ions. However, this damage can be removed by annealing at high temper-
atures. HDP etches utilize magnetic and electric ﬁelds to increase dramatically
the distance that free electrons can travel in the plasma. HDP etches have good
selectivity of Si to SiO2 and resist. The DRIE etch cycles between the etch

etching to produce deep channels and an electrostatic resonator.
3.1.3 EXAMPLES OF BULK MICROMACHINING PROCESSES
This section will present two examples of bulk micromachining processes used
to make various devices for teaching and research purposes. The SCREAM and
PennSOIL technologies utilize the fabrication processes discussed in Chapter 2
and Chapter 3 to produce two unique methods of bulk micromachine fabrication.
The SCREAM process is developed around etching of single-crystal silicon to
produce complex high aspect ratio devices. The PennSOIL process starts with an
SOI wafer and uses anisotropic plasma etching and wet etching of single-crystal
silicon to produce the device of interest. SCREAM and PennSOIL are very
capable bulk micromachining processes with advantages for MEMS devices,
depending on the device requirements. From a device design perspective, bulk
micromachining provides the capabilities of large capacitance, mass, and out-of-
plane stiffness, as listed in Table 3.2.

3.1.3.1
SCREAM
The SCREAM (single-crystal reactive etching and metallization) process [7,8] is
a bulk micromachining process that uses anisotropic plasma etching of single-
crystal silicon to fabricate suspended single-crystal silicon (SCS) structures. High-
capacitance actuators and sensors, such as accelerometers and vibratory gyro-
scopes, can be fabricated in this process. The fabricated structures may ﬂex in the
plane of fabrication. The SCREAM process yields millimeter-scale SCS structures
greater than 100 µm deep and 1.5 µm minimum feature sizes (beam widths and
separations). This results in a process capable of producing devices with an aspect
ratio > 66.6. Devices have been fabricated with suspension space greater than 5 mm.
SCREAM process outline (Figure 3.8):
1. Start with a clean silicon wafer. (100) and (111) wafers with highly
doped n-type (arsenic) or moderately doped p-type boron wafers have
been used.
2. Deposit mask oxide. PECVD deposition of 1 to 2 µm oxide is used
because of high deposition rate and low temperature (~240°C).
3. Pattern and etch mask oxide. Etch is accomplished by an RIE process.
4. Strip resist. This is an O2 plasma strip.
5. Deep silicon etch I. The mask oxide is used to transfer the pattern into
the substrate. Depending on the structure height to be obtained, 4 to
20 µm may be accomplished. An anistropic BCl3/Cl2 RIE etch is
utilized. Process details are given in Shaw et al. [7].
6. Sidewall oxide deposition. Deposit ~0.3-µm conformal oxide layer
with PECVD process. This oxide protects the sidewall during release.
7. Remove ﬂoor oxide. An RIE (CF4/O2) etch [7] is used to remove 0.3
µm of oxide from mesa top and trench bottom. This etch will leave
the sidewall oxide largely undisturbed.

8. Deep silicon etch II. Use RIE to etch silicon ﬂoor down another 3 to
5 µm below the sidewall oxide. This exposed silicon on the sidewalls
below the sidewall oxide will be removed via a subsequent release etch.
9. Isotropic release etch. The release is an isotropic SF6 RIE etch [7] that
removes the silicon at the bottom of the trench to produce a suspended
structure. This etch is highly selective to oxide (i.e., several microns
of silicon are etched with only a nominal erosion of the oxide coating).
10. Metal sputter deposition. Sputter deposition of a 0.1- to 0.3-µm alu-
minum layer is made. This produces a uniform coating.
NOTE: A thin silicon dioxide or silicon nitride passivation layer (50 nm) may be
deposited to prevent electrical shorting of the electrode.
3.1.3.2
PennSOIL
PennSOIL (University of Pennsylvania silicon-on-insulator layer) [9,10] is a
silicon bulk micromachining process developed to pursue research on electro-
thermal-compliant (ETC) microdevices; this is an embedded actuation technique.
ETC devices are compliant mechanisms that elastically deform due to constrained
thermal expansion under joule heating. The shapes of ETC devices are designed
so that the joule heating induced by the application of voltage between two points

creates a nonuniform temperature distribution that causes the desired deformation
pattern due to the material thermal expansion.
The qualities required of a fabrication process to pursue ETC research are:
•
The ability to produce any two-dimensional shape
•
Adequate out-of-plane stiffness
•
Ability to etch through large depths with good dimensional control
•
The ability to change the resistivity of the structure selectively by
masked doping
•
Released structures that can be mechanically anchored in desired
locations
•
Electrical insulating layer beneath the mechanical anchors of the device
The PennSOIL process utilizes silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers in which
the handling wafer is KOH etched from the bottom and the epitaxial single-crystal
silicon layer is plasma etched to deﬁne the shape of the ETC device. The buried
oxide layer is etched with HF, which releases the device. The epitaxial layer can
be selectively doped in speciﬁc locations to modify the resistivity. The PennSOIL
process is described next and illustrated in Figure 3.9. Figure 3.10 contains some
examples of ETC devices fabricated in the PennSOIL process.

PennSOIL process outline:
1. The SOI wafers that have been used in the PennSOIL process are 525
to 550 µm thick. The buried silicon dioxide layers (BOX) used in
various runs have been 0.4, 2, and 3 µm, and the epitaxial layer
thicknesses have been 10, 12, and 15 µm.
2. A thin layer of silicon nitride is deposited and patterned on the handling
wafer side of the SOI wafer to deﬁne the membrane opening. 
3. Conduct a KOH etch to form the membrane opening. This opening
provides thermal isolation for the devices deﬁned on the epitaxial layer.
4. Strip the nitride layer with an HF etch; this removes the exposed silicon
dioxide as well.

3.2 LIGA
The LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung) process [11] is capable
of making complex structures of electroplateable metals with very high aspect
ratios with thicknesses up to millimeters. This process utilizes x-ray lithography,
thick resist layers, and electroplated metals to form complex structures. Because
x-ray synchonotron radiation is used as the exposure source for LIGA, the mask
substrate is made of materials transparent to x-rays (e.g., silicon nitride or poly-
silicon). An appropriate mask opaque layer is a high atomic weight material such
as gold, which will block x-rays. 
The LIGA fabrication sequence shown schematically in Figure 3.11 starts
with the deposition of a sacriﬁcial material used for separating the LIGA part
from the substrate after fabrication. The sacriﬁcial material should have good
adhesion to the substrate, yet be readily removed when desired. An example of
a sacriﬁcial material for this process is polyimide. A thin seed layer of material
is then deposited; this will enable the electroplating of the LIGA base material.
A frequently used seed material would be a sputter-deposited alloy of titanium
and nickel. Then, a thick layer of the resist material, polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA), is applied. A synchrotron provides a source of high-energy collimated
x-ray radiation, which is needed to expose the thick layer of resist material. The
exposure system of the mask and x-ray synchrotron radiation can produce vertical

sidewalls in the developed PMMA layer. The next step is the electroplating of
the base material (e.g., nickel) and polishing the top layer of the deposited base
material. Then the PMMA and sacriﬁcial material are removed to produce a
complete LIGA part. 
LIGA has the advantage of producing metal parts that enable magnetic
actuation. However, the assembly of LIGA devices for large-scale manufacturing
is a challenging issue (Section 9.1.1). Figure 3.12 shows an assembled LIGA
mechanism. Alternatively, LIGA can fabricate an injection mold made of metal,
which is then used to form the desired part typically made of plastic (see the
next section).
3.2.1 A LIGA ELECTROMAGNETIC MICRODRIVE
New applications in medicine, telecommunications, and automation require pow-
erful microdrive systems. Speeds up to 100,000 rpm and torques in the micro-
newton-meter range with a diameter of a few millimeters are typical requirements.
Microdrive applications include a microdrive-equipped catheter that will enhance

the capability of minimally invasive surgery, automated assembly of miniaturized
components, and use in small appliances such as a camcorder.
The Faulhaber Group [12] and the Institute for Microtechnology, Mainz, Ger-
many [13], have jointly developed an electromagnetic motor with an outer diameter
of only 1.9 mm [14–16]. Figure 3.13 shows the 1.9-mm motor and an exploded
view of its components. For ﬂexibility in application, these micromotors must be
combined with microgear heads of the same outer diameter. The development of
this system illustrates the development of a mesoscale device (>2 mm) that contains
components fabricated with microscale fabrication technology (LIGA).

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
A synchronous motor design was utilized for the design to avoid the need
for a mechanical commutator; this precludes a long operational lifetime. The
synchronous motor consists of a permanent magnet (neodymium–iron–boron)
coated with a very thin gold layer for corrosion protection mounted on a 240-
µm diameter shaft with a microcoil mounted in the motor casing.
The microcoil is produced by winding enameled copper wires that have two
different coatings. After the wires are wound, they are heated; this melds the
outer coating to connect the separate wires mechanically. The winding process
is optimized for an outer diameter of 1.6 mm, which allows the microcoil to ﬁt
within the motor casing.
A sleeve bearing was selected for the micromotor. Miniature ball bearings
and jewel bearing used in the watch industry were considered. However, a high
rotor speeds up to 100,000 rpm; the losses in a sleeve bearing are lower. Due to
the manufacturing tolerances, the relative play is high and hydrodynamic gliding
starts at speeds between 10,000 and 20,000 rpm.
Gear ratios from 50 to 1000 are required for the microgear head to convert the
power of the micromotor to lower speeds and higher torques. For this application,
a planetary gear system with involute tooth proﬁle was found to be the most
suitable. The advantages of a planetary gear system in this application include:
•
High gear ratios attainable in one stage
•
High-power density allowed by splitting the torque to the three plan-
etary wheels
•
Planetary gears supported by the sun gear, which eliminates the need
for planetary gear bearings
•
Multistage gear system realizable in a compact form
All the components of the microgear head (Figure 3.14), except the output
shaft (steel) and output sleeve bearings (brass), are produced by microinjection
molding in LIGA [17]-made molds. The microgears are made of the polymer
POM (polyacetal polyoxymethylene) with a tooth-face width of 300 µm. The tip
diameter of the planetary wheels is 560 µm and the axles ﬁxed in the carrier have
a 180 µm diameter. The frame is divided into two parts with rigid connections
between the planetary wheels. The sun gear of the following stage or the output
shaft is ﬁxed to the upper part of the frame. The output shaft diameter is 500 µm.
The development of the microdrive system was accomplished with manual
assembly techniques for the microgear head. The assembly must take place in a
class 100 to 1000 clean-room environment. The assembly was accomplished with
tweezers, vacuum pipettes, and specially designed tools and ﬁxtures. The assem-
bly was visually guided with a stereo microscope with variable magniﬁcation.
Mass production is possible only with automated assembly whose development
was guided by the experiences of manual assembly during the development phase.
The microdrive system, which consists of the micromotor and microgear
head, has been developed and is commercially available. The micromotor is 5.5
mm long × 1.9 mm diameter and can produce 7.5 µN-m torque. The maximum

output torque of the microdrive, which combines the micromotor and a 47:1 gear
head, is 150 µN-m in continuous operation. Operation times of 1500 h with a
motor speed of 12,000 rpm have been demonstrated. 
3.3 SACRIFICIAL SURFACE MICROMACHINING
The basic concept of surface micromachining fabrication process has its roots as
far back as the 1950s and 1960s with electrostatic shutter arrays [18] and a
resonant gate transistor [19]. However, it was not until the 1980s that surface
micromachining utilizing the microelectronics tool set received signiﬁcant atten-
tion. Howe and Muller [20,21] provided a basic deﬁnition of polycrystalline
silicon surface micromachining; Fan et al. [22] illustrated an array of mechanical
elements such as ﬁxed-axle pin joints, self-constraining pin joints, and sliding
elements. Pister et al. [23] demonstrated the design for microfabricated hinges
that enable the erection of optical elements.
Surface micromachining is a fabrication technology based upon the deposi-
tion, patterning, and etching of a stack of materials upon a substrate. The
materials consist of alternating layers of a structural material and a sacriﬁcial
material. The sacriﬁcial material is removed at the end of the fabrication process
via a release etch, which yields an assembled mechanical structure or mecha-
nism. Figure 3.15 illustrates the fabrication sequence for a cantilever beam
fabrication in a surface micromachine process with two structural layers and
one sacriﬁcial layer.
Surface micromachining uses the planar fabrication methods common to the
microelectronics industry. The tools for depositing alternating layers of structural
and sacriﬁcial materials and photolithographically patterning and etching the

layers have their roots in the microelectronics industry. The etches of the structural
layers deﬁne the shape of the mechanical structure, and the etching of the sacri-
ﬁcial layers deﬁnes the anchors of the structure to the substrate and between
structural layers. Deposition of a low-stress structural layer is a key goal in a
surface micromachine process. From a device design standpoint, it is preferable
to have a slightly tensile average residual stress with minimal or zero residual
stress gradient. A small tensile residual stress alleviates the design consideration
of device structure buckling. The stress in a thin ﬁlm is a function of deposition
conditions such as temperature. A postdeposition anneal is frequently used to
reduce the layer stress levels. For polysilicon, the anneal step can require several
hours at 1100°C in an inert atmosphere such as N2.
Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) and silicon dioxide are common sets of
structural and sacriﬁcial materials, respectively, used in surface micromachining.
The release etch for these materials is hydroﬂouric acid (HF), which readily etches
silicon dioxide but minimally attacks the polysilicion layers. A number of different
combinations of structural, sacriﬁcial materials and release etches have been
utilized in surface micromachine processes. Table 3.3 summarizes a sample of
surface micromachine material systems utilized in commercial and foundry pro-
cesses. The selection of the material system depends on several issues, such as
the structural layer mechanical properties (e.g., residual stress, Young’s modulus,
hardness, etc.) or the thermal budget required in the surface micromachine pro-
cessing, which may affect additional processing necessary to develop a product.
Even though surface micromachining leverages the fabrication processes and
tool set of the microelectronics industry, several distinct differences and challenges
exist. The surface micromachine MEMS devices are generally larger (>100 µm
vs. <1 µm) and they are composed of much thicker ﬁlms than microelectronic

devices are (2 to 6 µm vs. <<1 µm). The repeated deposition and patterning of
the thick ﬁlms used in surface micromachining will produce topography of
increasing complexity as more layers are added to the process. Figure 3.15 shows
the topography induced on an upper structural by patterning of lower levels, which
is caused by the conformal ﬁlms deposited by processes such as chemical vapor
deposition (CVD). Figure 3.16 shows a scanning electron microscope image of
this effect in an inertial sensor made in a two-level surface micromachine process. 
In addition to the topography induced in the higher structural levels by the
patterning of lower structural and sacriﬁcial layers, two other signiﬁcant process
difﬁculties can be encountered. The ﬁrst difﬁculty results from the anisotropic
plasma etch used for the deﬁnition of layer features to attain vertical sidewalls.
The topography in the layer will inhibit the removal of material in the steps of
the topographical features. This is illustrated in Figure 3.17, which shows an
increased vertical layer height at the topographical steps that prevents removal
of material at these discontinuities. This will give rise to the generation of small

particles of material, stringers, that can be attached to the underlying layers or
ﬂoat away during the release etch (Figure 3.18). Stringers can cause a MEMS
device to function improperly due to mechanical interference or electrical short-
ing. The second process difﬁculty is the challenge of photolithographic deﬁnition
of layers with severe topography. The photoresist coating is difﬁcult to apply and
the depth of focus will lead to a decreased resolution of patterned features.
The application of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to a surface micro-
machine MEMS process directly addresses the issues of topography (Figure 3.19).
CMP was originally utilized in the microelectronics industry for global planariza-
tion [24], which is needed as the levels of electrical interconnect increase. CMP
planarization was ﬁrst reported in MEMS by Nasby et al. [25,26]. Figure 3.19

shows a linkage that has been fabricated in a surface micromachined process,
SUMMiT™, before and after CMP was included in the process. In addition to
solving the fabrication issues of topography, the use of CMP also aids in realizing
designs without the range of motion and interference constraints imposed by the
topography. CMP will also aid in the development of MEMS optical devices [27]
by enhancing the optical quality of the surface micromachined MEMS mirrors.
The release etch is the last step in the surface micromachine fabrication
sequence. For a surface micromachine process such as SUMMiT, the release etch
would involve a wet etch in an HF to remove the silicon dioxide sacriﬁcial layers.
The removal of the sacriﬁcial layers will yield a mechanically free device capable
of motion. For very long or wide structures, etch release holes are frequently
incorporated into the structural layers to provide access for the HF to the sacriﬁcial
silicon dioxide in underlying layers. This will reduce the etch release process time.
Because the MEMS device is immersed in a liquid during the release etch, an
issue is the adhesion and stiction of the MEMS layers upon removal from the
liquid release etchant [28]. Polysilicon surfaces are hydrophilic and the removal
of liquids from the MEMS device can be problematic. Surface tension of the liquid
between the MEMS layers will produce large forces pulling the layers together.
Stiction of the MEMS layers after the release etch can be addressed in several ways:
•
Make the MEMS device very stiff to resist the surface tension forces.
•
Fabricate a bump (i.e., dimple) on the MEMS surfaces that will prevent
the layers from coming into large area contact.
•
Use a fusible link to hold the MEMS device in place during the release
etch; this can be mechanically or electrically removed subsequently [29].
•
Use a release process that avoids the liquid meniscus during drying, such
as supercritical carbon dioxide drying [30] or freeze sublimation [31].
•
Use a release process that will make the surface hydrophobic; this is
accomplished via the use of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings
[32]. It has been reported that SAM coatings also have the effect of
reducing friction and wear.

SUMMiT (Sandia ultraplanar, multilevel MEMS technology) is a state-of-the-art
surface micromachine process developed by Sandia National Laboratories [33,34]
that utilizes standard IC processes optimized for the thicker ﬁlms (e.g., 2 to 6
µm) required in MEMS applications. Low-pressure chemical vapor deposition
(LPCVD) is used to deposit the polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) and silicon
dioxide ﬁlms. Optical photolithiography is utilized to transfer the designed pat-
terns on the mask to the photosensitive material applied to the wafer (e.g., pho-
toresist or resist). Reactive ion etches are used to etch the deﬁned patterns into
the thin ﬁlms of the various layers. A wet chemical etch is also used to deﬁne a
hub feature as well as the ﬁnal release etch of the SUMMiT process. Figure 3.20
schematically shows the layers and features in the SUMMiT V™ surface micro-
machine process. This process uses 14 photolithography steps and masks to deﬁne
the required features. Table 3.4 lists the layer and mask names and a summary of
their use. To illustrate the SUMMiT V fabrication sequence, Figure 3.21 and
Figure 3.22 show the masks and fabrication process at several intermediate stages.
The SUMMiT fabrication process begins with a bare n-type, (100) silicon
wafer. A 0.63-µm layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is thermally grown on the bare
wafer. This layer of oxide acts as an electrical insulator between the single-crystal
silicon substrate and the ﬁrst polycrystalline silicon layer (MMPOLY0). A 0.8-
µm thick layer of low-stress silicon nitride (SiNx) is deposited on top of the oxide
layer. The NITRIDE layer is also an electrical insulator, but acts as an etch stop
as well, protecting the underlying oxide from wet etchants during processing.
The NITRIDE layer can be patterned with the NITRIDE_CUT mask to establish

electrical contact with the substrate. A 0.3-µm thick layer of doped polycrystalline
silicon known as MMPOLY0 is deposited on top of the nitride layer. MMPOLY0
is not a structural layer, but it is usually patterned and is used as a mechanical
anchor, electrical ground, or electrical wiring layer.
Following MMPOLY0 deposition, the ﬁrst sacriﬁcial layer of 2 µm silicon
dioxide (SACOX1) is deposited. SACOX1 is a conformable layer that will reﬂect
any patterning of the underlying MMPOLY0 layer. Upon deposition of the
SACOX1 layer, dimples are patterned and etched into the oxide. The dimples
(primarily used for antistiction purposes) are formed in the MMPOLY1 (the next
polysilicon deposition) by ﬁlling the holes etched into the SACOX1 layer. The
dimple depth is controlled via timed 1.5-µm deep etch.

Following the dimple etches, the SACOX1 layer is patterned again with the
SACOX1_cut mask and etched to form anchor sites through the depth of SACOX1
to the MMPOLY0 layer. Figure 3.22a shows the deposited and patterned SACOX1
layer. MMPOLY1 deposited over the SacOx1 layer will be anchored or bonded
to MMPOLY0 at the SACOX1 cuts as well as to the substrate at the nitrade cuts.
This will act as electrical connections between MMPOLY0, MMPOLY1 and the
substrate. With the anchor sites deﬁned, a 1-µm thick layer of doped polysilicon
(MMPOLY1) is deposited.
The MMPOLY1 layer can be patterned with the MMPOLY1 mask to deﬁne
a pattern in the polysilicon layer, or the PIN_JOINT_CUT mask to deﬁne a feature
used in the formation of a rotational hub/pin-joint structure. The hub/pin-joint is
deﬁned at the PIN_JOINT_CUT site by the combination of an anisotropic reactive
ion etch and a wet etch to undercut the MMPOLY1 layer. This feature will be
used to form a captured rivet head for the hub/pin-joint.
A 0.3-µm layer of silicon dioxide, SACOX2, is then deposited and patterned
with the SACOX2 mask. The SACOX2 is deposited by an LPCVD process that
is comformable and will deposit on the inside wall of the hub structure. The
thickness of SACOX2 deﬁnes the clearance of the hub structure. SACOX2 can
also be used as a hard mask to deﬁne MMPOLY1 using the subsequent etch that
also deﬁnes MMPOLY2.
Upon completion of the SACOX2 deposition, pattern, and etch, a 1.5-µm thick
layer of doped polysilicon, MMPOLY2, is deposited. Any MMPOLY2 layer mate-

rial that is deposited directly upon MMPOLY1 (i.e., not separated by SACOX2)
will be bonded together. Following the MMPOLY2 deposition, an anisotropic reac-
tive ion etch is performed to etch MMPOLY2 and composite layers of MMPOLY1
and MMPOLY2 (laminated together to form a single layer approximately 2.5 µm
thick). The MMPOLY2 etch will stop on silicon dioxide; thus, MMPOLY1 will be
protected by any SACOX2 on top of MMPOLY1 and the SACOX2 layer can be
used as a hard mask to deﬁne a pattern in MMPOLY1. Figure 3.22b shows the
SUMMiT V fabrication after the MMPOLY2 etch has been completed.
At this point in the SUMMiT V process, all the layers have been conformable
(i.e., assume the shape of the underlying patterned layers). To enable the addition
of subsequent structural and sacriﬁcial levels without the fabrication and design
constraints of the conformable layers, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is
used to planarize the sacriﬁcial oxide layers. With the MMPOLY2 etch complete,
approximately 6 µm of TEOS (tetraethoxysilane) silicon dioxide (SACOX3) is
deposited. CMP is used to planarize the oxide to a thickness of about 2 µm above
the highest point of MMPOLY2. Following planarization, SacOx3 is patterned
and etched to provide dimples and anchors to the MMPOLY2 layer using the
DIMPLE3_CUT and SACOX3_CUT masks, respectively. The DIMPLE3_CUT
etch is performed by etching all the way through the SACOX3 layer and stopping
on MMPOLY2. Then 0.4 µm of silicon is deposited to backﬁll the dimple hole
to provide the 0.4-µm stand-off distance. The processing of the DIMPLE3 feature
will provide a repeatable stand-off distance.
A 2-µm thick layer of doped poly (MMPOLY3) is deposited on the CMP
planarized SACOX3 layer. The MMPOLY 3 layer will be ﬂat and not have any
of the topography due to the patterning of the underlying layers (Figure 3.22c).
This will ease design constraint on the higher levels and enhance the use of
MMPOLY3 and MMPOLY4 layers as mirror surfaces in optical applications. The
MMPOLY3 layer is patterned and etched using the MMPOLY3 mask. 
The processing for the SACOX4 and MMPOLY4 layers proceeds using the
SACOX4_CUT, DIMPLE4_CUT, and MMPOLY4 mask in an analogous fashion
to the SACOX3 and MMPOLY3 layers, except that the DIMPLE4 stand-off
distance is 0.2 µm (Figure 3.22d).
Release and drying of the SUMMiT V die are the ﬁnal fabrication steps
(Figure 3.22e). The device is released by etching all the exposed oxides away
with a 100:1 HF:HCl wet etch. Following the wet release etch, a drying process
can be employed using simple air evaporation, supercritical CO2 drying [30], or
CO2 freeze sublimation [31]. The choice of the drying process will depend upon
the design of the particular devices. Very stiff structures will be less sensitive to
the surface tension forces, and they can be processed by simple air drying.
Supercritical CO2 drying processing for large devices would be a better option.
The SUMMiT V sacriﬁcial surface micromachine fabrication process is
capable of fabricating complex mechanisms and actuators (Figure 3.23 and
Figure 3.24). The ability to make a low-clearance hub enables rotary mecha-
nisms and gear reduction systems, as well as hinges that can be used to fabricate
moveable mirrors (Figure 3.25). Figure 3.26 shows a vertically erected mirror

rotationally indexing table driven by an electrostatic comb drive actuator. SUM-
MiT V has also been used to fabricate arrayed devices; this is possible because
surface micromachined devices are assembled when they are fabricated.
3.4 INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONICS AND MEMS 
TECHNOLOGY (IMEMS)
The integration of electronics for control and sense circuitry and MEMS tech-
nology becomes essential for sensing applications, which require increased sen-
sitivity (e.g., Analog Devices ADXL accelerometers [35]), or actuation applica-
tions that require the control of large arrays of MEMS devices (e.g., TI DMD
[36]). For sensor applications, the packaging integration of a MEMS device and
an electronic ASIC becomes unacceptable when the parasitic capacitances and
wiring resistances have an impact on sensor performance (i.e., RC time constants
of the integrated MEMS system are signiﬁcant). For actuation applications such
as a large array of optical devices that require individual actuation and control
circuitry, a packaging solution becomes untenable with large device counts.
Of the three MEMS fabrication technologies previously discussed, surface
micromachining is the most amenable to integration with electronics to form an
IMEMS process. The development of an IMEMS process faces some challenges:
•
Large vertical topologies. Microelectronic fabrication requires planar
substrates due to the use of precision photolithographic processes.
Surface micromachine topologies can exceed 10 µm due to the thick-
ness of the various layers.
•
High-temperature anneals. The mitigation of the residual stress of the
surface micromachine structural layers can require extended periods of
time at high temperatures (such as several hours at 1100°C for polysil-
icon). This would have adverse effects due to a thermal budget of micro-
electronics that is limited because of dopant diffusion and metalization.
There are three strategies for the development of an IMEMS process [37]:
•
Microelectronics ﬁrst. This approach overcomes the planarity restraint
imposed by the photolithographic processes by building the micro-
electronics before the nonplanar micromechanical devices (Figure
3.27). The need for extended high-temperature anneals is mitigated
by the selection of MEMS materials (e.g., aluminum, amorphous
diamond [38]) and/or selection of the microelectronic metallization
(e.g., tungsten instead of aluminum); these make the MEMS and
microelectronic processing compatible. Examples of this IMEMS
approach include an all-tungsten CMOS process developed by
researchers at Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center [39], and the Texas

95
Instruments’ process [36] used to fabricate the DMD (Figure 3.2),
which utilizes aluminum and photoresist as the device structural layer
and sacriﬁcial layer, respectively. 
•
Interleave the microelectronics and MEMS fabrication. This approach
may be the most economical for large-scale manufacturing because it
optimizes and combines the manufacturing processes for MEMS and
microelectronics. However, this requires extensive changes to the over-
all manufacturing ﬂow in order to accommodate the changes in the
microelectronic device or the MEMS device. Analog Devices has
developed and marketed an accelerometer and gyroscope that illustrate
the viability and commercial potential of the interleaving integration
approach [35].
•
MEMS fabrication ﬁrst. This approach fabricates, anneals, and pla-
narizes the micromechanical device area before the microelectronic
devices are fabricated, thus eliminating the topology and thermal pro-
cessing constraints. The MEMS devices are built in a trench that is then
reﬁlled with oxide, planarized, and sealed to form the starting wafer
for the CMOS processing (Figure 3.28). This technology was targeted
for inertial sensor applications. Figure 3.29 shows prototypes designed
in this technology by the University of California, Berkeley Sensor and
Actuator Center (BSAC) and by Sandia National Laboratories.
3.5 TECHNOLOGY CHARACTERIZATION
The design of MEMS devices requires adequate knowledge of the material prop-
erties of the technology in which the device is built. Many classical methods for
obtaining bulk material properties are available; however, the thin-ﬁlm material
properties, which are difﬁcult to obtain accurately because of size-scale issues,
are required for MEMS device design. These properties are unique to the speciﬁc
technology used to build a MEMS device due to the variety of processing steps

that can be utilized and the sequence in which they are utilized. Appendix E
provides a list of common MEMS material properties extracted from a number
of sources. Reference 40 provides a broad catalog of MEMS material properties
that is frequently updated from a variety of sources.
The development of technology characterization capability is essential to
process monitoring which ensures the technology processing is consistent from
run to run. Also, in-situ monitoring of some parameters may be quite beneﬁcial
to design development and qualiﬁcation. Figure 3.30 shows some representative
in-situ technology characterization devices.
Technology characterization requires the measurement of a number of param-
eters. The measured parameters that relate directly to MEMS device function are
process dimensional control and process material properties. Examples of process
dimensional control parameters are:

•
Etching proﬁles. The shape of the sidewall of a MEMS structure
depends upon the control of the etch process. These variations can result
in stiffness or natural frequency perturbations in the MEMS device.
•
Registration errors. Multilayer processes such as surface micromachin-
ing can have up to 14 masks, which must be aligned relative to one
another to produce the MEMS device. Registration errors can cause
structural errors in the device.
•
Resolution errors. The lithography process, which transfers the image
on the mask to photoresist on the wafer surface, and the etch process,
which etches the resulting photoresist image onto the MEMS material,
deﬁne the shape (clearances, widths) of the MEMS device. These types
of errors can cause variations in device operation and possibly affect
the device’s ability to operate.
•
Layer thickness and uniformity. Errors of this type will also affect the
device’s operation.
The principal process material properties important to MEMS device design are
Young’s modulus (E), residual stress/strain (σr,εr), fracture strength (σf), and
electrical resistance.
Because the methods for process dimension control methodology tend to be
speciﬁc to technology or fabrication process equipment, techniques for material
property characterization will be the focus here. This section will discuss exam-
ples of material property characterization methods for common useful material
parameters. The structures for this characterization will be presented generically.
A speciﬁc implementation of the device for a particular technology will be
required for implementation.

3.5.1 RESIDUAL STRESS
The behavior of MEMS devices is considerably inﬂuenced by residual stress of
the materials. Residual stresses can cause signiﬁcant change of shape and
“warpage” of a device, as well as change the device’s operating parameters such
as stiffness or natural frequencies. Fracture or delaminating of the material is also
a possibility.
Residual stress in a thin ﬁlm deposited on a substrate is caused by a thermal
expansion coefﬁcient mismatch of the ﬁlm, αﬁlm, and substrate material, αsub, and
the deposition conditions. A mismatch in the thermal expansion coefﬁcients will
produce a residual strain in the ﬁlm, εﬁlm, if the temperature of deposition, Tdep,
is different from room temperature, T0 (Equation 3.1). Residual stress due to
deposition conditions is less well understood and is inﬂuenced by a number of
factors such as substrate temperature, deposition rate, and ﬁlm thickness. Gen-
erally, low-temperature deposition will result in lower residual stress.
(3.1)
Residual stress can be compressive or tensile. A thin ﬁlm with compressive
residual stress that is deposited upon a wafer will want to expand, causing the
wafer to bow, as shown in Figure 3.31a. Conversely, a thin ﬁlm with tensile
residual stress that is deposited upon a wafer will want to contract, causing the
wafer to bow, as shown in Figure 3.31b. If the thickness of the thin ﬁlm, tﬁlm, and
substrate, tsub, are known, the Stoney equation (Equation 3.2) [41] can be used to
calculate the residual stress of the thin ﬁlm, σﬁlm, by measuring the wafer initial
and ﬁnal radius of curvatures, ρi and ρf, respectively.

Residual stress may vary through the thickness of a MEMS material layer
(Figure 3.32). The portion of the residual stress distribution that is constant
through the material thickness is called the average residual stress. Alternatively,
the portion of the residual stress that varies through the material thickness is the
residual stress gradient. The average residual stress will cause deﬂections prima-
rily in the plane of the material layer except where the constrained boundary
condition of a structural member may cause buckling and deﬂect out of plane.
The residual stress gradient will cause an internal bending moment in the material
that will directly result in out-of-plane deﬂections.
The simplest test structure for compressive residual stress [42] is an array of
ﬁxed–ﬁxed beams (Figure 3.33a). When the underlying material (sacriﬁcial layer)
is removed, the compressive residual stress of the material will cause expansion.
Buckling will occur on beams greater than a critical length as deﬁned by Euler
column theory (Section 6.1.7). Buckling of the beams can be observed by inspec-
tion using a microscope, interferometer, or SEM. The ﬁxed–ﬁxed beam test
structure is a “proof” test device that establishes that the residual stress is greater
than a particular value by inspection of the array. The residual stress, σr, can be
calculated with Equation 3.3 if the beam thickness, t, and Young’s modulus, E,
are known for the shortest buckled beam of length, L. The negative sign in
Equation 3.3 indicates compressive residual stress. Tensile residual stress will
produce no observable effect on this test structure.
(3.3)
The ring and beam test structure [43–45] shown in Figure 3.33b is also a
“proof” test device fabricated in an array of various sizes that establish that the
tensile residual stress is greater than a particular value by inspection of the array.
When the underlying material (sacriﬁcial layer) is removed, the tensile residual
stress of the material will cause the ring structure to contract; however, the ring
is anchored at a particular diameter. The ring diameter at a 90° position away

from the anchors will contract causing the beam structure to compress. If the
beam length is greater than a critical length speciﬁed by Euler column theory,
the beam will buckle, which is determined by optical inspection. The residual
stress, σr, can be calculated with Equation 3.4 if the beam thickness, t, and Young’s
modulus, E, are known for the smallest buckled ring-beam structure of radius,
R. G is a geometry parameter that is a function of the inner and outer ring radius
and G ≤0.918.
(3.4)
A bent-beam test structure [46,47] will produce a quantitative measurement
of residual strain for tensile and compressive residual strain. This test structure
(Figure 3.33c) consists of a pair of opposed vernier scales; each is supported by
two beams at the center with a shallow angle of bend. The opposed vernier scales
allow for a 2× ampliﬁed quantitative readout of tensile and compressive residual
strains. The relationships between residual stress and vernier deﬂections are given
by the detailed analyses in Gianchandani and Najaﬁ [46] and Zavracky [47]. Lin
et al. [48] present another test structure that utilizes mechanical ampliﬁcation of
displacements and can also produce a quantitative vernier readout for compressive
and tensile residual stress.
The residual stress gradient depicted in Figure 3.32 is due to an internal
bending moment of the ﬁlm whose magnitude is due to the integration of the

stress through the ﬁlm thickness (Equation 3.5). The simplest test structure to
assess the residual stress gradient is an array of cantilever beams (Figure 3.34a).
The out-of-plane deﬂection due to the internal bending moment can be simply
calculated [49]; however, the quantitative measurement of the out-of-plane deﬂec-
tion requires an SEM or interferometer. Figure 3.34b shows another test structure
used to measure residual stress gradients, the Archimedes spiral [50]. The spiral
will expand or contract upon release from the substrate; three response variables
(endpoint height, endpoint rotation, and lateral contraction) may be related to the
residual stress gradient. This gradient can be estimated from just one of the
variables; two of the variables can be simply obtained with an optical microscope,
which is advantageous. However, the Archimedes spiral may need to be large to
obtain the required sensitivity.
(3.5)
3.5.2 YOUNG’S MODULUS
Young’s modulus, E, (Section 6.1.1), which is the proportionality between stress,
σ, and strain, ε, and the essential parameter for calculation of the stiffness of
structures, is necessary for design. This modulus may be obtained by directly

testing the thin-ﬁlm material using specialized devices such as a nanoindenter,
which plunges a diamond tip into the material and measures the deformation.
Alternatively, a lateral electrostatic resonator (Figure 3.35) may be used to
extract the value of Young’s modulus. The lateral resonator moves parallel to the
substrate and thus minimizes damping effects and allows observation with an
optical microscope. The resonator structure is driven by opposed interdigitated
electrostatic comb drives. The resonator is suspended by a pair of folded beams
that minimize the effect of residual stress. The stiffness of the suspension can be
calculated using the equations in Appendix F. Resonance is the frequency, f, at
which the resonator obtains its largest amplitude of motion; this is observed via
a microscope. The resonance frequency is a function of the resonator mass, M,
and spring stiffness, K. The mass of the resonator is readily obtained by the
dimension of the moving structure and density of the material. Young’s modulus
is estimated from the spring stiffness equations of Appendix F.
(3.6)
3.5.3 MATERIAL STRENGTH
The traditional method for obtaining material strength for a bulk material is a
pull test of a tensile specimen until failure occurs. This has been attempted with
thin-ﬁlm materials [52] with specialized instruments such as a nonoindenter or
atomic force microscope. Figure 3.36 shows two thin-ﬁlm test structures for
material strength measurement. Figure 3.36a [53,54] is a structure moved with a
probe; the movement of the shuttle brings several beams ﬁxed to the shuttle in
contact with a ﬁxed post. The beams are deﬂected until the material fails. Non-
linear beam theory can extract the material strength,  σf, when given data collected
by observation with an optical microscope system.

Figure 3.36b shows a structure similar in intent to a bulk material tensile
specimen. The wide portion of material can produce sufﬁcient force via residual
stress or electrostatic force [55] to fracture the small material specimen in the
narrow portion of the structure. Many other kinds of strength measurement
devices have been proposed. One comprises T- and H-shaped structures [56,57]
and deﬂects due to tensile residual strain that ultimately fractures the material.
The movement at the top of the T- or H-structure is measured to provide data for
the ultimate strength, σf, calculation.
3.5.4 ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE
Electrical resistance is a quantity that must be known for device design. The
several ways in which resistance can be expressed (resistance, resistivity, sheet
resistance) need to be explained. Figure 3.37 shows a slab of material with a
speciﬁed thickness (t), width (W), and length (L) that is part of an electrical
circuit. Equation 3.7 states that resistance, R, which is measured in ohms is a
product of the resistivity, ρ — a characteristic of the material with units of ohms-
meter and a geometric term. Equation 3.7 shows that resistance varies directly
with the length of the slab and inversely with the slab cross-section area (A =
Wt). In most MEMS and microelectronic technologies, the layers have a ﬁxed
thickness, and the resistivity is a characteristic of the material and doping that is
also ﬁxed for a speciﬁc technology.
Grouping these terms together, the sheet resistance, Rs, which is a constant
for a particular layer in a MEMS or microelectronic technology, is deﬁned in
FIGURE 3.36 Material strength test structure.
(a)
(b)
© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

104
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
Equation 3.8. Equation 3.9 states that the resistance of a slab of material is the
product of the sheet resistance, which has units of ohms per square and the length-
to-width ratio, which has units of squares. This ratio is deﬁned as the number of
squares, Ns. The unit “square” is, of course, dimensionless and it is frequently
denoted symbolically by .
The use of the sheet resistance concept enables an easy method for calculation
of the resistance of run of material. For example, a run of a material ten units
long by one unit wide has ten squares of material, Ns; therefore, the resistance
of the run of material is 10 × Rs. If the run of material is doubled in width, the
number of squares, Ns, is ﬁve. This means that the resistance of this wider run
of material is 5 × Rs, which is half of what it was before.
(3.7)
(3.8)
(3.9)
The sheet resistance can be measured in a number of ways. The simplest is
the four-point probe method (Figure 3.38a). In this method, current is passed
between the two outer probes and voltage is measured across the inner pair of
probes. The sheet resistance is the ratio of the voltage drop to the forced current
time — a geometric factor that depends upon the probe geometry [61].
The second method is the van der Pauw method [62] (Figure 3.38b). Current
is forced between one pair of electrodes and voltage is measured across the other
pair of electrodes. To improve accuracy, the measurement is repeated three times
by rotating the probe conﬁguration 90° and repeating the measurement. The

measured resistance is then averaged. The calculation of sheet resistance also
involves a geometrical correction factor. Figure 3.39 shows examples of van der
Pauw structures. The measurement of thermal sheet resistances for thin ﬁlms can
also be measured with a van der Pauw type of test structure [63].
3.5.5 MECHANICAL PROPERTY MEASUREMENT FOR
PROCESS CONTROL
The test structure discussed in previous sections utilized some combination of proof
test structure arrays, optical microscope obtainable data, and mechanical probing
of devices to obtain data to extract the material parameters. In recent years, it has
been determined that a combination of mechanical analysis, high-precision optical
measurements (interferometry), and data extraction methods is needed to obtain
material properties of an accuracy necessary for process control. The literature
shows two major approaches, M-TEST [58] and IMap [59,60], to this difﬁcult
problem, which is essential to MEMS process control and MEMS design.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
M-TEST is a set of electrostatically actuated MEMS test structures and anal-
ysis procedures utilized for MEMS process monitoring and property measurement.
M-TEST uses electrostatic pull-in of three sets of test structures (cantilever beams,
ﬁxed-ﬁxed beams, and clamped circular diaphragms) followed by the extraction
of two intermediate quantities, S and B parameters, that depend on a combination
of material properties and test structure geometry. The test structure geometry,
such as beam width and gap, is obtained with high accuracy with a proﬁlometer.
The IMaP (interferometry for material property measurement in MEMS) uses
a set of test structures that are electrostatically actuated to obtain the full voltage
vs. displacement relationship. Values for the material properties and nonidealities
of the test structure such as support post compliance are extracted to minimize
the error between the measured and modeled deﬂections. It is clear that, for
MEMS process control and material property information, automation of detailed
measurement procedures such as M-TEST or IMAP will be required.
3.6 ALTERNATIVE MEMS MATERIALS
3.6.1 SILICON CARBIDE
Silicon carbide (SiC) has outstanding mechanical properties, particularly at high
temperatures. Silicon is generally limited to lower temperatures due to a reduction
in the mechanical elastic modulus above 600°C and a degradation of the electrical
p–n junctions above 150°C. Silicon carbide is a wide bandgap semiconductor
(2.3 to 3.4 ev) suggesting the promise of high-temperature electronics [64]. SiC
has outstanding mechanical properties of hardness, elastic modulus, and wear
resistance [66] (Table 3.5). SiC does not melt but sublimes above 1800°C and
also has excellent chemical properties. Therefore, SiC is an outstanding material
for harsh environments [65].

SiC has a large number (>250) of crystal variations [67], polytypes. Of these
polytypes, 6H-SiC and 4H-SiC are common for microelectronics and 3C-SiC are
attractive for MEMS applications. Technology exists for the growth of high-
quality 6H-SiC and 4H-SiC 50-mm wafers. Single-crystal 3C-SiC wafers have
not been produced, but 3C-SiC can be grown on (100 to 150 mm) Si wafers.
However, polycrystalline 3C-SiC wafers are available. 
The chemical inertness of SiC or polycrystalline SiC presents challenges for
micromachining of these materials. Uses of conventional RIE techniques for SiC
result in relatively low etch rates compared to polysilicon surface micromachining
and the etch selectivity of SiC to Si or SiO2 is poor; these characteristics make
them inadequate etch stop materials. 
An alternative approach for micromachining of SiC is a micromolding tech-
nique (damascene process) to pattern the SiC ﬁlms [68]. An example of a single-
layer SiC micromolding process is shown in Figure 3.40 and outlined next.
1. Deposit a 2-µm SiO2 layer on a silicon wafer.
2. Deposit and pattern a 2-µm polysilicon layer to form the mold.
3. Deposit poly-SiC so that the mold and its surface are covered. Poly-
SiC is deposited with atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition
(APCVD) in which hydrogen is the carrier gas. Silane and propane

are the precursor gases for the chemical reactions involved in this
CVD process.
4. Polish the wafer with a diamond slurry to remove the poly-SiC from
the top surface of the mold and planarize the wafer.
5. Remove the polysilicon mold with KOH. Poly-SiC is inert to most
acids; however, it can be etched by alkaline hydroxide bases such as
KOH at elevated temperatures (>600°C).
6. The SiO2 is not etched by the KOH in the previous step. The patterned
poly-SiC can now be released by removing the SiO2 with hydroﬂuoric
acid (HF) and partially undercutting the base of the poly-SiC to form
an anchored region.
The micromolding process for SiC is able to bypass the RIE etch rate and
selectivity issues for SiC mentioned earlier and yields a planarized wafer ame-
nable to multilayer processing. However, control of the in-plane stress and stress
gradients of SiC is still under development. SiC micromachining technologies
have been used to fabricate prototype devices [69] required to operate under
extreme conditions of temperature, wear, and chemical environments.
3.6.2 SILICON GERMANIUM
Polycrystalline silicon–germanium alloys (poly-Si1–x Gex) have been extensively
investigated for electronic devices and also present some attractive features as a
MEMS material [71]. Poly-Si1–x Gex has a lower melting temperature than silicon
and is more amenable to low-temperature processes, such as annealing, dopant
activation, and diffusion, than silicon is. Poly-Si1–x Gex offers the possibility of
a MEMS mechanical material with properties similar to polysilicon; however,
the fabrication processing can be accomplished as low as 650°C. This will make
poly-Si1–x Gex an attractive micromachining material for monolithic integration
with microelectronics, which requires a low thermal budget [72].
Also, a surface micromachining process can be implemented utilizing poly-
Si1–x Gex as the structural ﬁlm and poly Ge as the sacriﬁcial ﬁlm with a release
etch of hydrogen peroxide when x < 0.4. Poly Ge can be deposited as a highly
conformable material and thus enables many MEMS structures.
3.6.3 DIAMOND
Diamond and hard amorphous carbon are a promising class of materials with
extraordinary properties that would enable MEMS devices. The various amor-
phous forms of carbon, such as amorphous diamond (aD) tetrahedral amorphous
carbon (ta-C) and diamond-like carbon (DLC), have hardness and elastic modulus
properties that approach crystalline diamond, which has the highest hardness
(~100 GPa) and elastic modulus (~1100 GPa) of all materials [73]. The appeal
of this class of materials for MEMS designers is the extreme wear resistance,

hydrophobic surfaces (i.e., stiction resistance), and chemical inertness. Recent
progress has been achieved in the area of surface micromachining and mold-
based processes [74,75] and a number of diamond MEMS devices have been
demonstrated [76,77]. The use of diamond ﬁlms in MEMS is still in the research
stages. Recent progress in stress relaxation of the diamond ﬁlms at 600°C [78,79]
has been essential to the development of diamond as a MEMS material.
3.6.4 SU-8
EPON SU-8 (from Shell Chemical) is a negative, thick, epoxy–photoplastic, high-
aspect-ratio resist for lithography [80]. SU-8 is a UV-sensitive resist that can be
spin-coated in a conventional spinner in thicknesses ranging from 1 to 300 µm.
Up to 2-mm thicknesses can be obtained with multilayer coatings. SU-8 has very
suitable mechanical and optical properties and chemical stability; however, it has
the disadvantages of adhesion selectivity, stress, and resist stripping. SU-8 adhe-
sion is good on silicon and gold, but for materials such as glass, nitrides, oxides,
and other metals the adhesion is poor. The thermal expansion coefﬁcient mismatch
between SU-8 and silicon or glass is large. SU-8 has been applied to MEMS
fabrication [80,81] for plastic molds or electroplated metal micromolds. SU-8
MEMS structures have also been used for microﬂuidic channels and biological
applications [82].
3.7 SUMMARY
Three categories of micromachining fabrication technologies have been pre-
sented: bulk micromachining, LIGA, and sacriﬁcial surface micromachining.
Bulk micromachining is primarily a silicon-based technology that employs wet
chemical etches and reactive ion etches to fabricate devices with high aspect ratio.
Control of the bulk micromachining etches with techniques such as etch stops
and material selectivity is necessary to make useful devices. Commercial appli-
cations utilizing bulk micromachining, such as accelerometers and ink-jet nozzles,
are available.
LIGA is a fabrication technology utilizing x-ray synchrotron radiation, a thick
resist material, and electroplating technology to produce high-aspect-ratio metal-
lic devices. Surface micromachining uses thick ﬁlms and processes from the
microelectronic industry to produce devices. This technology employs a sacriﬁcial
material and a structural material in alternating layers. A release process removes
the sacriﬁcial material in the last step in the process; this produces free-function
structural devices. Surface micromachining enables large arrays of devices
because no assembly is required. It can also be integrated with microelectronics
for sensing and control. Two notable commercial applications of surface micro-
machining are Texas Instruments’ digital mirror device (DMD) [36] and Analog
Devices’ ADXL accelerometers [35].

4 Scaling Issues for MEMS
Mankind has been driven over hundreds of years toward miniaturization of devices
for various reasons. Some of these reasons are merely aesthetic and some are to
attain increased functionality. However, only during the late 20th century, when
the investigation of the engineering and physics of systems involved a very large
size scale decrease of more than three orders of magnitude (i.e., 0.001), has the
issue of size had signiﬁcant impact on the “relevant” physical phenomena. These
large-scale reductions have come about via the engineering of microelectronic
and MEMS devices and on to the extreme scale reduction of quantum mechanics
at the atomic level. The issue of relevance can arise in a number of ways.
•
Entering different physics regimes at a particular scale
•
Physical phenomena scaling at different rates, which changes their
relative importance
These are important issues for the MEMS design engineer to consider because
the intuition attained in the engineering experience of macroscale devices does
not directly transfer to the microscale in many ways. Figure 4.1 shows the
diversity of size encountered in the macro, micro, and nano domains. 
This chapter will explore a number of aspects of how things change with
scale. Things that will be considered range from simple geometric effects; the
behavior of physical systems of interest (e.g., mechanics, ﬂuidics, electrical, etc.);
new physical regimes (e.g., Brownian motion, electron tunneling, etc.); fabrica-
tion tolerances; material issues; and even computational issues.
4.1 SCALING OF PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
4.1.1 GEOMETRIC SCALING
In order to evaluate the effect on a system due to size reduction, it is necessary
ﬁrst to look at the system geometry and deﬁne a framework to make that evalu-
ation. For the discussions in this chapter, an isomorphic scaling of the system
(i.e., all dimensions scaled equally) will be considered. A dimension of length,
Xo, can be scaled to a smaller dimension, Xs, by a scale factor, S. Because we are
studying the effect of scale reduction, 0 < S  ≤1. The geometry of length, area,
and volume scale by decreasing powers of S is shown in Equation 4.1 through
Equation 4.3.

Figure 4.2 shows the effect that various powers of the scaling parameter, S,
will have on the scaled variable. The effect of MEMS device scaling would not
affect heuristic macroscale engineering expectations if all the scaling is linear. If
other scalings arise, this will change the relative importance of phenomena or
give rise to new phenomena. 
The mass of an object is directly proportional to the object volume. Therefore,
because the object size is reduced by 1000 (i.e., S = 10-3), the volume and mass
are reduced by 10–9. The mass is a signiﬁcant variable in numerous engineering
phenomena and calculations.
Various geometric ratios such as the area to volume ratio are signiﬁcant in
many engineering ﬁelds — especially ﬂuid dynamics and heat transfer. The area
to volume ratio scales as the inverse of S (Equation 4.4). Therefore, as systems
are reduced to the MEMS scale the area to volume ratio increase, which implies
that physical phenomena sensitive to the area–volume ratio will change from
heuristic macroworld expectations.

4.1.2 MECHANICAL SYSTEM SCALING
The two most fundamental parameters describing a mechanical system are the
mass and stiffness. The mass of a linear translating object is simply the volume
times the density. Therefore, the mass scales the same as volume, S3. As the
system scale decreases by S, the mass and volume are decreasing even more
rapidly (i.e., S3).
Ms = ρS3 Vo = S3 Mo
(4.5)
The stiffness of a mechanical system is a fundamental quantity describing
the ability of a mechanical system to resist applied forces. Stiffness, K, is the
ratio of the force applied to a mechanical member to the resulting deﬂection. The
stiffness of a mechanical suspension may consist of a combination of beams and
rods. Figure 4.3 shows a schematic of a simple circular beam and rod. A beam
will resist deﬂection due to transverse bending and a rod will resist axial deﬂec-
tion. The details of beams and rods will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Equation 4.6 and Equation 4.7 show the basic proportionality of stiffness for
a circular cross-section beam and rod, respectively, to the material property for
stiffness, E (i.e., Young’s modulus), and the geometric quantities of area, A, and
area moment of inertial, I. In these equations, the area, A, and area moment of
inertia, I, have been converted to their underlying dimensional deﬁnitions and
the scaling parameters inserted. These proportionality equations show that the
mechanical stiffness decreases linearly in proportion to the system scaling.

In terms of geometrical dimensions,
Use the scaling parameter to determine the effect on stiffness:
The torsion stiffness scales as S3, which is different than the bending and
axial stiffness that scales as S, due to the units involved in torsion stiffness (i.e.,
N–M/radian). However, the net effect on more descriptive parameters such as
natural frequency is consistent with previous results for mechanical systems.
Mass and stiffness are fundamental quantities of a mechanical system, but
the actual values of these quantities for comparing one mechanical system or
design to another are not very insightful. The natural frequency is a parameter
that relates the elastic and inertial forces to deﬁne directly the frequency of
oscillation of a mechanical system. This frequency of oscillation is a measure of
the relative stiffness of a mechanical system and is encountered in the design of
mechanical oscillators and ﬁlters. 
The natural frequency of a one degree of freedom translational mechanical
system is deﬁned as the square root of the stiffness divided by the mass (Equation
4.8). The scaling parameters for mass and stiffness that have been developed
previously have been inserted to show that, as a system reduces in scale, S, the
natural frequency scales by 1/S. This means that the natural frequency increases
for system scale reductions. The effect is due to the stiffness decreasing more
slowly than the mass for a reduction in size.
(4.8)
It has been noted that MEMS scale devices are more rugged in mechanical
shock and vibration environments [8,9] than their macro world counterparts. MEMS
inertial sensors have been shown to survive shock environments of tens of thousands
of g’s (gravitational acceleration) [5,7]. A MEMS reliability study [6] has shown
that a packaged MEMS device was tested to 40,000 g, which caused failure of the
package; however, the MEMS device was still operational (Figure 4.4).

Example 4.2
Problem: In a system shown in Figure 4.5, the cubic mass of dimension, L, is
supported by a square rod of cross-section dimension, 0.1L, which is 2L long.
This system is subjected to a step acceleration of a, which causes the rod to fail
due to stress, σs. If this system is isomorphically scaled by a factor of S = 0.001,
what acceleration level would be achieved when the rod fails due to stress?
Solution: The stress is related to a dynamic loading factor, D, times the inertial
force (Ma) divided by the cross-section area, A, which, upon substitution for the
problem dimensions, yields the following equation. The dynamic loading factor,
D, accounts for the type of dynamic loading (i.e., impulse, step, etc.) for an
acceleration or force [10]. For a step load, the dynamic loading factor is equal
to 2 (D = 2).
In this case, the density, ρ, is constant as the system scales in size; therefore,
the failure stress, σs, is proportional to the product of length and the input
acceleration, a.

σs ∝La
At the reduced scale, S, the failure stress, σs, is given by
σs ∝SLa
This means that the acceleration, a, required to achieve failure due to stress
scales by 1/s, as shown next.
Therefore, when this system is isomorphically scaled by a factor of S = 0.001
the acceleration required for a stress failure of the rod increases by 1000.
Reduction in scale in mechanical systems has some negative consequences.
For example, the deﬂection of an inertial mass in a sensing device will require
a more sensitive detection system, because the inertial mass and the resulting
inertial force scale as S3 but the stiffness scales as S. This different scaling causes
the mass to deﬂect less as smaller size scales.
4.1.3 THERMAL SYSTEM SCALING
The effect of scaling a thermal system can readily be determined by analyzing
the basic heat transfer relationships [11]. The thermal energy storage capability
for an object is determined by Equation 4.9. The thermal energy storage of an
object is the product of the mass, m, constant pressure speciﬁc heat, cp, and the
temperature change, ∆T, in the material; it is a measure of the temperature increase
in an object due to thermal input. The thermal mass for any speciﬁc system will
involve the volume of the system, V, and it will therefore scale with size by S3:
(4.9)
Heat can be transferred within a system by the mechanisms of conduction,
convection, and radiation (see Figure 4.6 and Equation 4.10 through Equation
4.12, respectively). Conduction is heat transfer through the material of an object
due to a temperature gradient, ∇T. Convection is a form of heat transfer through
a liquid or gas to an object, due to a temperature difference between the object
surface or wall, Tw, and the temperature of the bulk ﬂuid or gas, T∞. K and h are
the conduction and convection heat transfer coefﬁcients, respectively, and are
functions of the medium through which the heat is transferred. The convection
heat transfer coefﬁcient, h, also involves complex relationships of the medium
ﬂuid ﬂow.
Radiation heat transfer between objects in space is driven by the temperatures
of the objects to the fourth power, where σ is the Boltzmann constant. These

three heat transfer mechanisms all involve the area, A, through which the heat is
transferred. Therefore, the heat transfer mechanisms scale with area by S2. Any
speciﬁc system can involve any combination of these heat transfer mechanisms
and may be modeled via an effective heat transfer coefﬁcient, Keff.
(4.10)
(4.11)
(4.12)
A signiﬁcant question remaining to be answered is how the heat transfer rate
differs between the macro- and microscale. The preceding discussion showed that
heat storage of a system is scaled by S3, and heat transfer in/out of a system is
scaled by S2.
Now consider a thermal system, shown in Figure 4.7, that involves a system
with internal heat generation, qgen, thermal storage within the system, and heat
transfer in/out of the system. These effects can be modeled by the ﬁrst-order
differential Equation 4.13. This equation can be rearranged into a form in which
a time constant, τ, of the system will become apparent. The time constant, τ, can

be shown to consist of a term, α, that involves the material and heat transfer
mechanisms of the system and the volume to area ratio. Alpha is known as the
thermal diffusivity constant. Therefore, the thermal time constant scales by S. As
the system scale decreases, the heat storage capacity decreases by S3 and the heat
transfer decreases by S2. This means that the thermal time constant decreases by
S (i.e., the thermal system responds more quickly as scale decreases) and that
thermal systems will respond quickly at the microscale.

sionless ratios that imply heat transfer effects due to reduction in scale will now
be discussed.
The Biot number (Bi) (Equation 4.17) is the ratio of the heat convection
coefﬁcient, h, and characteristic length, L, product divided by the thermal con-
ductivity of a solid, K. Bi is the ratio of the convection heat transfer coefﬁcient
to the conduction heat transfer coefﬁcient for a solid body immersed in a liquid
or gaseous substance. The Biot number indicates the ability of a body to come to
thermal equilibrium rapidly without setting up signiﬁcant internal thermal stresses.
For example, an ice cube immersed in hot water will frequently crack. For Bi <
1, the internal conduction heat transfer coefﬁcient of the object is greater than the
convection heat transfer coefﬁcient of the surrounding ﬂuid. This means that
internal thermal gradients and stresses are not likely to be developed in the object.
Equation 4.17 shows that, as the size is decreased, the Bi number is also decreased.
(4.17)
The Grashof number (Gr), Equation 4.18, is a dimensionless group frequently
used to access or empirically determine the free convection heat transfer coefﬁ-
cient. Gr is the ratio of the buoyancy forces (i.e., numerator of equation) to the
viscous forces. Free convection heat transfer is due to the circulation or induced
ﬂow of the ﬂuid medium due to ﬂuid expansion due to temperature change and
buoyancy of the expanded less dense medium. The Grashof number is a compar-
ison of the buoyancy forces inducing convective ﬂuid motion vs. the viscous forces
impeding the convective ﬂuid motion. The scaling effects on the Gr are apparent
in Equation 4.18, which yields an S3 dependency on scale; this means that natural
convection is less effective as size is reduced due to ﬂuid motion being impeded.

surface tension. The difﬁculty in solving these equations has caused engineers to
utilize nondimensional ratios of these quantities to relate the various physical
regimes of ﬂuid mechanics for different systems of varying complexity and scale.
To evaluate the effect of scale on the ﬂuid mechanics of MEMS systems, three
of these dimensionless quantities will be examined: Reynolds number, Knudsen
number, and the Weber number.
The Reynolds number, Re, is a dimensionless ratio relating inertia forces to
viscosity forces in a ﬂuidic system. Equation 4.19 deﬁnes Re with density, ρ,
characteristic length, L, characteristic velocity, V, and viscosity, µ. The Reynolds
number is indicative of the regime of the ﬂuid ﬂow (i.e., laminar ﬂow vs. turbulent
ﬂow). Laminar ﬂow occurs when Re < 2000, and the velocity distribution across
the ﬂow channel is parabolic. The viscous forces are dominant in laminar ﬂow.
Turbulent ﬂow occurs when Re > 4000, where the inertial forces dominate and
the viscous forces cannot dampen disturbances caused by roughness of the ﬂow
channel walls. The velocity proﬁle in turbulent ﬂow is more uniform, with eddies
in the ﬂow ﬁeld, which enhances a mixing action. A transition region occurs 2000
< Re < 4000, where the nature of the ﬂow ﬁeld depends upon the surface
roughness of the ﬂow channel. 
(4.19)
The Reynolds number scales by S, which will decrease the Reynolds number,
indicating that the viscous forces are dominating and microscale ﬂuid ﬂow will
be laminar. The laminar ﬂow regime will make ﬂuidic mixing at the microscale
difﬁcult. 
The Knudsen number (Kn), Equation 4.20, is the ratio of the molecular mean
free path, λ, to a characteristic length of the ﬂow ﬁeld, L. Kn is used as a measure
for gas ﬂow ﬁeld characteristics. Gas ﬂows occur in a number of MEMS appli-
cations such as microactuators, inertial sensors (i.e., accelerometers, gyroscopes)
as well as in MEMS fabrication tools such as CVD reactors. Based upon the
Knudsen number, gas ﬂow can be classiﬁed [12,13] as follows:
•
Kn < 0.01: continuum
•
0.01 < Kn < 0.1: slip
•
0.1 < Kn < 10: transition
•
Kn >10: free molecular
Table 4.1 lists several gas ﬂow examples and their Knudsen number regime. An
exercise at the end of this chapter will discuss some of these examples in more
detail.
For a very small size gas ﬂow ﬁeld, which occurs in MEMS devices and the
clearance in a gas bearing (i.e., ~2 µm), there are only a few tens of mean free
paths (mfps) across the clearance. In a macroﬂow of gas in a pipe, there may be

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
many 1000s of mfps across the diameter of the pipe, thus putting this in the
continuum regime. At the other extreme of the Knudsen regime is the free
molecular ﬂow that can be seen to occur in a disk drive head with a clearance
of approximately 15 nm. The various Knudsen regimes are important to the
operation of the physical system involved and indicative of the assumptions
required to model the phenomena properly. 
The ﬂuid mechanics that occurs in the microdomain are one of the least
understood physical phenomena. The work of Dohner et al. [14] is just one
instance of the inconsistencies of current ﬂuid mechanic theories at the microscale
that must be addressed in the future to aid MEM design engineers to understand
the physics with which they are dealing.
(4.20)
The Weber number, We, is a nondimensional ratio relating inertia forces and
surface tension in a ﬂuid system. Equation 4.21 deﬁnes the Weber number with
density, ρ, characteristic length, L, characteristic velocity, V, and surface tension,
σ (N/M). We scales with S, which is indicative of the increasing inﬂuence of
surface tension forces as the system scale, S, decreases. An example of the
signiﬁcance of surface tension at the microscale is the release process in surface
micromachining and the resulting issues of stiction. During the drying phase of
the release process, it is possible for a meniscus to form in which the surface
tension force can possibly pull the mechanical layers together. 
Surface tension forces can also be used to advantage in MEMS applications.
These forces can be used to assemble a MEMS structure as demonstrated in Syms
et al. [15]. Figure 4.8 shows a MEMS steam engine in which the meniscus is
used to seal the space between the piston and cylinder.

Problem: Given a cube of dimension, d, on a side and density, ρc, ﬂoating in a
liquid of surface tension, σ. (a) Calculate the cube dimension, d at which surface
tension force is greater than the cube weight. (b) The cube is made of silicon (ρc
= 2300 kg/M3) and the liquid is water (σ =0.072 N/M). What is the cube dimension
from part a? 
Solution: (a) The surface tension force is the liquid surface tension, σ, around
four sides of length d. The cube weight is the product of cube volume, d3, cube
density, ρc, and gravity, g:
(b) Substituting the preceding values with g = 9.8 M/s2, yields d = 3.575 mm.
A cube of this dimension or smaller will ﬂoat in the water due to surface tension
effects only.

The voltage required to produce an equivalent electrostatic distributed force
to the distributed forces produced by gravity and surface tension is:
(c) The scaling for the three types of distributed forces is shown in the
following equations. As the scale factor, S, decreases, the only force that increases
is electrostatic. However, the surface tension force is strong as evidenced by the
high voltage to offset it in part (b). To reduce the required voltage may require
an impractically small gap. 
4.1.5 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SCALING
The effect of scale for electrical systems will be considered by accessing the
impact of scale on the basic electrical circuit elements (i.e., resistor, capacitor,
inductor), shown in Figure 4.10, and the actuation capabilities of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
The resistance, R, of a piece of material is a function of the resistivity, ρ, of
the material and its geometric size. The geometry enters the equation via the ratio
of the length of material, l, in direction of current ﬂow and the cross-section area,
A. This results in the resistance of an object increasing by 1/S when the object
is isomorphically reduced in size, S.
(4.22)
The capacitance of a capacitor, C, is deﬁned by the permittivity, ε, of the
dielectric material between two plates of area, A, separated by a gap, g, as shown
next. Therefore, the capacitance will be reduced by S when isomorphically scaled.
(4.23)
The inductance, L, of a N loops of material encompassing material of per-
meability, µ, can be calculated by Equation 4.24. The inductance, L, similar to a
capacitor, will scale by S upon isomorphic scaling.
(4.24)
Electrical circuit elements of inductance and capacitance will decrease in
proportion to the reduction in scale, but resistance will increase inversely with
scale. CMOS microelectronics has capabilities of fabricating transistors, resistors,
and capacitors; in a simple view, CMOS transistors are just capacitance controlled
switches. This means that a simple reduction of size of an existing MEMS or
CMOS design containing some combination of these circuit elements cannot be
done because the different circuit elements scale differently. 
Knowledge of the scaling effects on the electrical circuit elements is useful
in the design of many MEMS devices that may contain electrical circuit elements
on the same die or as part of the mechanical structure for the MEMS device. For
example, a MEMS inertial sensing device (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) will
contain a suspended mass and use a variable capacitor to enable capacitative
sensing of the displacement of the suspended mass.
Electrical scaling also has importance for the design of actuated MEMS
devices. In the macroworld, electromagnetic actuation dominates. With extremely
few exceptions, electrical to mechanical (i.e., electric motors) or mechanical to
electrical (i.e., electric generators) utilize magnetic ﬁelds. As the sizes of devices
are reduced to the MEMS scale, it is necessary to evaluate whether this still
remains the best choice [21].

One way to make this assessment of electric vs. magnetic ﬁelds for actuation
is to consider the energy density of an electric, Uelectric, and a magnetic, Umagnetic,
ﬁeld for a region of space at the appropriate operational condition (Figure 4.11).
Equation 4.25 and Equation 4.26 deﬁne the electric and magnetic ﬁeld density,
respectively, where ε is the permittivity and µ is the permeability of the region
that contains the electric ﬁeld, E, and the magnetic ﬁeld, B. For purposes of this
assessment, the free space permittivity, ε0 = 8.84 × 10–12 F/M, and the free space
permeability, µ0 = 1.26 × 105 H/M will be used. The maximum value of the
electric ﬁeld, E, and magnetic ﬁeld, B, will be limited by the maximum obtainable
operational values. 
The maximum obtainable electric ﬁeld is at the point just before electrostatic
breakdown. This breakdown occurs when the electrons or ions in an electric ﬁeld
are accelerated to a sufﬁcient energy level so that, when they collide with other
molecules, more ions or electrons are produced, resulting in an avalanche break-
down of the insulating medium; high current ﬂow is produced. For air at standard
temperature and pressure, the electric ﬁeld at electrostatic breakdown in macro-
scopic scale gaps between electrodes (i.e., > ~10 µm) is Emax = 3 × 106 V/M.
(4.25)
(4.26)
The maximum obtainable magnetic ﬁeld energy density is limited by the
saturation of the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux density in magnetic materials. In materials,
the spin of an electron at the atomic level will produce magnetic effects. In many

materials, these atomic level magnetic effects are canceled out due to their random
orientation. However, in ferromagnetic materials, adjacent atoms have a tendency
to align to form a magnetic domain in which their magnetic effects collectively
add up. Each magnetic domain can be from a few microns to a millimeter in size
[17], depending upon the material and its processing and magnetic history. How-
ever, the domains are randomly oriented and the specimen exhibits no net external
magnetic ﬁeld. If an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the magnetic domains
will have a tendency to align with the magnetic ﬁeld.
Figure 4.12 shows a plot of the magnetic ﬂux density, B, vs. the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity, H, for a ferromagnetic material. The magnetic ﬁeld intensity, H,
is a measure of the tendency of moving charge to produce ﬂux density (Equation
4.27). Figure 4.12 shows that, as H is increased, the magnetic ﬂux density, B,
increases to a maximum in which all the magnetic domains are aligned. For
magnetic iron materials, the saturated magnetic ﬂux, Bsat, is approximately 1 to
2 T. A Bsat of 1 T will be used for this assessment of magnetic ﬁeld density.
(4.27)
Using the limiting values of Emax and Bsat discussed earlier to calculate the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld densities will yield the values shown next. These
results indicate that the magnetic ﬁeld energy density is 10,000 times greater than
the electric ﬁeld energy density. This calculation explains why electromagnetic
actuation is dominant in the macroworld.

However, for MEMS scale actuators, the electrode spacing or gaps can be
fabricated as close as 1 µm. MEM researchers [1,2,19] have noticed that the
electric ﬁeld, E, can be raised signiﬁcantly above the breakdown electric ﬁeld,
Emax discussed earlier for macroscale gaps. This increased breakdown electric
ﬁeld for small gap sizes is predicted by Paschen’s law [18], which was developed
over 100 years ago. This law predicts that the electric ﬁeld at breakdown, Emax,
is a function of the electrode separation (d) – pressure (p) product. Figure 4.13
illustrates the basic functional dependence of Paschen’s law, Emax = f(p,d). Figure
4.13 shows that the separation-pressure product decreases to a minimum, which
is the macroscopic breakdown electric ﬁeld,
.
However, as the separation-pressure product is decreased further, the break-
down electric ﬁeld starts to increase. This increase in the electric ﬁeld required
for breakdown is because the gap is small and there are few molecules for
ionization to occur. As the electrode separation becomes smaller, a fewer number
of collisions occur between an electron or ion with a gas molecule because the
mfp (mean free path) between collisions is becoming a greater fraction of the
electrode separation distance. Decreasing the gas pressure also results in fewer
collisions because decreasing the number of molecules increases the mfp length
between collisions. This means that fewer collisions occur in a given electrode
separation distance. The effect causes the breakdown electric ﬁeld to increase
FIGURE 4.13 Paschen’s law: breakdown electric ﬁeld, Emax (V/M), vs. the electrode
separation — pressure product (M-atm).

, for micros-
cale electrode spacings. The electric ﬁeld for small electrode separation distances
in vacuum have been reported [20] to be
Using this new value for Emax will change the comparison of the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld energy density calculation of Equation 4.29 as shown next. This
results in a more favorable but neutral comparison of the energy density of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. However, the literature indicates that, for MEMS applica-
tions, electrostatics predominates. This is due to the added fabrication and assem-
bly complexity of fabricating MEMS scale permanent magnets, coils of wire,
and the associated resistive power losses with their use.
(4.29)
In another simple comparison of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, it can be seen
that the magnetic ﬁeld energy density, Umagnetic, does not change with size scaling
because Bsat and µ are material properties that do not change appreciably with
scaling to the microdomain. However, assuming that the applied voltage remains
constant up to the limit of Emax at electrostatic breakdown shows that the electric
ﬁeld energy density, Uelectric, varies with scale as shown in Equation 4.30. This
gives electrostatic actuation increasing importance as devices are scaled to the
microdomain.
(4.30)
4.1.6 OPTICAL SYSTEM SCALING
Optical MEMS applications and research is an extremely active area, with MEMS
devices developed for use in optical display, switching, and modulation applica-
tions. These MEMS scale optical devices [23,24] include LEDs, diffraction grat-
ings, mirrors, sensors, and waveguides. Their operation can depend upon optical
absorption or reﬂection for functionality.

Optical absorption-based devices are governed by Beer’s law (Equation 4.31),
which can be seen to scale unfavorably to MEMS size because absorption depends
on path length. This has spurred the development of folded optical path devices
[22] to overcome this disadvantage, but this is ultimately limited by the reﬂectivity
losses incurred with a large number of path folds. 
(4.31)
where
A = Optical absorption
ε = molar absorptivity (wavelength dependent)
C = concentration 
L = distance into the medium
Optical reﬂection-based MEMS devices are used for optical switching, dis-
play, and modulation devices. MEMS optical devices that have a displacement
range from small fractions of a micron to several microns can be made. This
corresponds to the visible light spectrum up to the near infrared wavelengths
(Figure 4.1). Because electrostatic actuation is frequently used in MEMS devices,
very precise submicron displacement accuracy is attainable. Also, very thin low-
stress optical reﬂective coatings are possible. These attributes make a MEMS
optical element very attractive.
4.1.7 CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM CONCENTRATION
Miniaturization of ﬂuidic sensing devices with MEMS technology has made
miniature chemical and biological diagnostic and analytical devices possible
[25,26]. To assess the effect that reduction in scale will have on these devices,
the concentration of chemical or biological substances and how it is quantiﬁed
must be studied.
Before the concentration of a chemical solution can be deﬁned, a few pre-
liminary deﬁnitions will be stated. A mole (mol) is a quantity of material that
contains an Avogadro’s number (NA = 6.02 × 1023) of molecules. The mass in
grams of a mole of material is the molecular weight of the chemical substance
in grams. The is known as the gram molecular weight (MW) and has units of
grams per mole. Example 4.5 illustrates how the MW is calculated for salt.
Example 4.5
Problem: Calculate the gram molecular weight (MW) of common table salt (i.e.,
sodium chloride, NaCl). The atomic mass of sodium (Na) = 23.00. The atomic
mass of chlorine (Cl) = 35.45. The molecular weight of NaCl = 58.45. The gram
molecular weight of NaCl is MW = 58.45 g/mol.
Solution: The concentration, C, of a chemical in a solution is known as the
molarity of the solution. A 1-molar solution (i.e., 1 M) is 1 mol of a chemical

dissolved in 1 liter of solution. For example, a 1-M solution of NaCl consists of
58.45 g of NaCl dissolved in a liter of solution. This relationship is expressed in
Equation 4.32.
(4.32)
For chemical detection, the number of molecules, N, in a given sample
volume, V, may be important to quantify. This relationship between number of
molecules in a given concentration of solution, C, and volume of solution, V, is:
(4.33)
Figure 4.14 shows the relationship between concentration, C, and sample
volume, V, as expressed by the preceding equation. The boundary for less than
one molecule, N1, of chemical or biological substance in a given sample volume
is shown; this is an absolute minimum sample volume for analysis. The number
of molecules required for detection, ND, is some amount greater than N1 (i.e.,
ND > N1). The required sample volume for analysis would be at the intersection
of the ND boundary with the concentration of the analyte available for analysis.
Petersen et al. [26] have shown that the typical concentrations of chemical
and biological material available for a few types of analyses are as shown in
Table 4.2.
The miniaturization of chemical and biological systems has a few fundamen-
tal limits:
•
The trade-off between sample volume, V, and the detection limit, ND,
for a given concentration of analyte, C, is illustrated in Figure 4.14.
•
Further miniaturization may require increasing the concentration of
analyte or increasing the sample volume.
•
The use of small sample volumes requires increasingly sensitive detec-
tors, which may be limited by other scaling issues (i.e., electrical,
ﬂuidic, etc.).
•
The physical size limitation of biological sensing devices is limited by
the size of the biological entity. A cell is approximately 10 to 100 µm,
whereas DNA has a width of only ~2 nm but is very long.

4.2 COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES OF SCALE
The computational aspects of the scale of MEMS devices need to be considered
because much of modern engineering design depends upon numerical simulation
to achieve success. Due to fabrication challenges, long fabrication times, and
experimental measurement difﬁculties, MEMS applications rely more upon sim-
ulation than their macroworld counterparts do. Therefore, time would be well spent
in assessing the unique issues encountered in simulation of MEMS scale devices.
Engineering calculations are almost exclusively performed on digital com-
puters in which the numbers representing the input data (i.e., mechanical and
electrical properties, lengths, etc.) and the variables to be calculated are repre-
sented by a ﬁxed number of digits. Due to this digital representation of numbers,

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
the quantity known as machine accuracy, εm, is the smallest ﬂoating point number
that can be represented on a given computer. The machine accuracy is a function
of the design of the particular computer. Two types of errors arise in the calcu-
lations performed on digital computers [38]:
•
Truncation error arises because numbers can only be represented to a
ﬁnite accuracy (i.e., machine accuracy) on a digital computer.
•
Round-off error arises in calculations, such as the solution of equations,
due to the ﬁnite accuracy of the computer. Round-off error accumulates
with increasing amounts of calculation. If the calculations are per-
formed so that the errors accumulate in a random fashion, the total
round-off error would be on the order of
, where N is the number
of calculations performed. However, if the round-off errors accumulate
preferentially in one direction, the total error will be of the order Nεm.
The topics of truncation and round-off error arise in regular macroscale
engineering simulation; however, a unique aspect of computation for MEMS scale
simulation needs to be addressed: 
•
Convenient units scale of numbers for MEMS simulation. The system
of units typically used in engineering simulations (e.g., MKS) uses
units of measure of quantities typically encountered for macroscale
devices. For example, the MKS system of unit length measure is
meters. However, MEMS devices are on a size scale of microns (i.e.,
0.000001 m).
•
Numerically appropriate scale of unit for MEMS simulation. Numerical
simulations such as ﬁnite element analysis (FEM) [39,40] typically
involve the solution of a large system of equations (e.g., 1,000 →
1,000,000). This system of equations will become ill conditioned when
the quantities involved in the equations vary widely in magnitude. A
large ill-conditioned system of equations can produce inaccurate results
or may even be unsolvable. For example, ill conditioning can arise
when a very small number is subtracted from a very large number; this
will make the result unobservable due to the truncation and round-off
errors of digital computation. 
From a CAD layout perspective, the unit of length most appropriate for a
MEMS scale device is a micron (i.e., 1 µm = 0.000001 m). This will allow the
CAD design of the device to be done using reasonable multiples of a basic unit
of measure.
From a numerical computation perspective, the system of units needed to
express the basic quantities used in MEMS device simulation should be a numer-
ically similar order of magnitude. This will avoid the ill conditioning of the
numerical simulation problem. A system of units for MEMS simulation has been
proposed [41] for ﬁnite element analysis. Appendix C provides the conversion

factors between the MKS system and the µMKS system, which will be used in
the design sections of this book. Several different permutations of an appropriate
system of units are possible. However, a consistent set of units must be used in
any simulation. This will maintain dimensional consistency for material properties
and simulation problem parameters such as loads and boundary conditions.
4.3 FABRICATION ISSUES OF SCALE
To assess the fabrication issues unique for MEMS scale devices, it is necessary
to put MEMS fabrication processes and technologies in perspective with manu-
facturing processes for other size scales. The size scales for manufacturing that
will be discussed are large-scale construction, macroscale machining, MEMS
fabrication, and integrated circuit (IC) and nanoscale manipulation. These are
individually discussed next. These four size groups provide a wide spectrum that
will enable the evaluation of any fabrication issues due to scale.
•
Large-scale construction (>15 m). The fabrication of things in this size
category includes civil structures, marine structures, and large aircraft.
Manufacturing at this size scale involves a wide array of processes for
materials such as wood, metal, and composite materials.
•
Macroscale machining (2 mm to 15 m). Manufacturing at this scale
includes a plethora of processes and materials. In many cases, the man-
ufacturing processes and materials have been under development and
improvement for an extended period. These manufacturing processes
are mature and quite ﬂexible. In most instances, more than one approach
to the manufacture of a given item is available. Examples of items
manufactured in this category include automobile or aircraft engines,
pumps, turbines, optical instruments, and household appliances.
•
MEMS scale fabrication (1 µm to 2 mm). MEMS fabrication includes
the processes and technologies discussed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3
to produce devices that range in size from 1 µm to 2 mm. This category
of manufacturing has been under development for 30 years and has
started to produce commercial devices within the last 10 years. To a
large degree, the fabrication methods for MEMS are rooted in the IC
infrastructure. As a result, the range of materials and the ﬂexibility of
the fabrication processes are more restrictive than in macroscale
machining. Silicon-based materials are frequently used in surface and
bulk micromachining. LIGA uses electroplateable materials (e.g.,
nickel, cooper, etc.). When LIGA molds are used with a hot embossing,
plastic materials can be utilized to create devices.
•
IC and nanoscale manipulation (<1 µm). The size scale for these
fabrication technologies is 1 µm and below (i.e., <1 µm). IC fabrication
technology has been under development and continuous improvement
for 40 years [29] and relies on leading edge photolithography, CVD
deposition, and etching techniques similar to those presented in Chap-

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
ter 2. The IC manufacture included in this category are state-of-the-art
capabilities that are rapidly approaching 0.1 µm feature sizes and
below. Nanoscale manipulation [32] is a recent demonstrated use of
surface proﬁling tools [30,31] such as an atomic force microscope
(AFM) and a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). These enable the
individual manipulation of molecules. Nanoscale manipulation is a
laboratory-based research capability as contrasted with IC manufac-
ture, which is a mature large industrial capability.
The smallest feature that can be fabricated on a part is the feature size. From
a design perspective, a more useful quantity to assess a fabrication capability is
the relative tolerance. Relative tolerance is deﬁned as the feature size divided by
part size; this provides a measure of the precision with which a fabrication process
can produce a part of any given size.
Figure 4.15 shows a graph of the relative tolerance vs. size over a considerable
range. The four size categories deﬁned earlier are noted in this ﬁgure, and the
data for this graph are extracted from a number of sources [2,27,28,30–35]. Due
to the extended size range and large number of fabrication processes that exist,
the data in this graph should be viewed as a broad statement of the fabrication
processes in a given size range rather than as indicative of any speciﬁc fabrication
process or capability. Because of the large number and variety of macroscale
fabrication processes, data were extracted [27,33] for some broad ranges of
processes (e.g., grinding, milling, etc.) within this category. Figure 4.15 shows
that macroscale fabrication has the smallest relative tolerance or precision, with
the relative tolerance increasing as the size scale increases or decreases. This
shows that MEMS scale fabrication has about the same precision as that of large-
scale fabrication (i.e., MEMS devices have about the same level of precision as
one’s house!). 
Due to the large variety and ﬂexibility of macroscale fabrication processes,
a number of categories of precision or relative tolerance have been deﬁned
[27,33]; these are shown in Figure 4.16 and Table 4.3. Ultraprecision machining
is at the extreme level of precision and is reserved for only a few applications
due to the time and expense necessary. Only a few instances, such as some large
optical applications [36,37], require this level of precision. Figure 4.16 shows
where these levels of precision lie relative to the MEMS-scale and nanoscale
manipulation.
The fabrication issues of scale show that a MEMS designer is faced with
fewer options and more restrictions than those faced by the macroworld design
engineer. MEMS scale fabrication imposes the following concerns for the design
engineer; they will need to be addressed in the device design:
•
Limited material set availability
•
Fabrication process restrictions upon design
•
Reduced level of precision in the fabricated device

4.4 MATERIAL ISSUES 
As the size of a device is decreased, two general trends become evident:
•
The granularity of the solid or ﬂuid materials becomes increasingly
apparent. This granularity can be expressed by quantities (see Table
4.4) such as the grain size of a material or the mfp in a gas. Does this

violate the assumption of continuum mechanics frequently used in the
macroworld to model engineering phenomena?
•
New physical phenomena (e.g., Brownian motion, Paschen effect, elec-
tron tunneling current) become signiﬁcant due to the reduced volume
or spacing in MEMS devices.
The classical engineering models used to design and simulate macroworld
physics and devices are based upon continuum mechanics, which models the
physics of interest with a set of partial differential equations. Table 4.5 shows
a sampling of the array of physical phenomena modeled by such equations.
These equations involve partial derivatives of the variable of interest, such as

continuum mechanics approach.
As one tries to design and model systems on smaller scales, a certain gran-
ularity of the physics is observed. In Chapter 2, the material structures of crys-
talline, polycrystalline, and amorphous were discussed. (Figure 2.2 illustrates
these three material structures.) The spacing of atoms in crystalline and amor-
phous materials is at the atomic scale (i.e., <1 nm). The size of the individual
crystals in a polycrystalline material are on the order of 100 to 500 nm, depending
upon the material processing used. Many materials of engineering signiﬁcance
are polycrystalline. The physical parameters used to describe material behavior
(e.g., Young’s modulus, speed of sound) in a continuum mechanics model are
statistical averages of the effects of the individual grains or molecules of material
within a large object (relative to the grain size).
For example, for a macrodevice that is 2 cm wide with a 500 nm grain size,
the statistically averaged property representing a parameter such as Young’s
modulus is adequate. However, a 2-µm wide microdevice contains only a few
grains of material, and a statistically averaged approximation of a material prop-
erty is not adequate. Research has been ongoing to measure microscale effects
[42]; develop theories that apply at the microscale [43,44]; and incorporate these
effects into simulations of the microscale phenomena [45].
The statistically averaged assumption also plays a role in the failure model
of materials. The stress at which a material yields or fails is quantiﬁed by the
parameters, yield strength, Sy, or failure strength, Su. These parameters also have
statistics in their origin. A material has a certain number of defects in the material
structure (e.g., crystal lattice imperfections, corrosion products in the grain bound-
aries) that give rise to locations at which a material will yield or ultimately fail.
These defects are assumed to be statistically distributed throughout the material.
The defect density of a material and statistical process control is frequently used
in the microelectronic community [46] in assessments and modeling of the yield
(i.e., percentage of good devices manufactured) of their processes. A potential
advantage of scaling devices down to densities approaching the defect density
of the material is that devices could be produced with a low defect rate.
4.5 NEWLY RELEVANT PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
Several new phenomena are enabled or become relevant at the MEMS scale.
The three brieﬂy discussed next are examples of such phenomena, which gain
importance because of the size of a MEMS device or the small gaps used in
MEMS devices.
•
Brownian noise. Also called thermal noise or Johnson noise for elec-
trical systems, Brownian noise is a low-level noise present in electrical
and mechanical systems. This thermal noise is present everywhere in
the environment and is due to such things as the vibrations of atoms
in the materials from which a device is made and the environment in

which the device operates. This indicates that the thermal noise is a
function of temperature of these materials. The mechanisms that couple
these thermal vibrations to the mechanical or electrical device of inter-
est are the energy dissipation mechanisms (i.e., damping for mechan-
ical devices, resistance for electrical devices). As a device is reduced
in size, these thermal noises or vibrations become signiﬁcant for
MEMS scale sensors. A detailed discussion of Brownian noise is in
the chapter on MEMS sensors.
•
Paschen’s effect. The phenomenon that the breakdown voltage in a gap
increases as the product of the pressure of the gas in the gap and gap
spacing is reduced was discovered in 1889 [19]. This phenomenon is
effective when the gap size is very small (<2 µm), which is typical of
MEMS devices. This enables increased effectiveness of electrostatic
actuation as discussed in detail in Section 4.1.5.
•
Electron tunneling current. Quantum entities such as electrons can
“tunnel” across a very small gap (on the order of nanometers) due to
the uncertainty in the wave description of quantum mechanical entities.
This especially appears to be strange due to the barrier of classical
physics in which like charges repel. This phenomenon can be used in
MEMS devices as a very sensitive displacement transduction method
capable of resolving displacements on the order of 0.01 nm. A MEMS
cantilever can be fabricated with a tip suitable for tunneling that is
electrostatically brought within operating distance for this phenomenon
to be effective. The tunneling phenomenon will be discussed in more
detail in the chapter on MEMS sensors. 
4.6 SUMMARY
A MEMS designer needs to be aware of a number of wide ranging issues and
cannot rely solely on macroworld engineering experiences and training when
considering the implementation of a MEMS design. System parameters will
change in relative importance as the system scale is reduced. Table 4.6 shows
four quantities that can be directly or indirectly related to actuation forces (i.e.,
gravity, surface tension, electrostatic, magnetic) in a device. If these forces all
scaled in the same manner, heuristic macroworld intuition would be valid; how-
ever, these forces all scale differently.
Gravity forces become increasingly small with reduced size, and surface
tension increases in importance. Surface tension forces can be used for assembly
of devices; however, they can be a concern during MEMS fabrication release
processes. Also, the table shows that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the
forces derived from them scale differently, with the magnetic ﬁeld forces not
depending on scale. Table 4.7 summarizes a number of scaling effects for mechan-
ical, ﬂuidic, and thermal systems. The data in this table show that mechanical
and thermal time constants are reduced for MEMS systems, and regimes of
operation for thermal and ﬂuidic systems are different at MEMS scale. The

discrete nature of solids and ﬂuids (e.g., material grain size, mfp of a gas) also
become apparent at MEMS scale.
Furthermore, new physical phenomena such as Paschen’s effect, which
greatly enables electrostatic actuation, become apparent for MEMS scale devices.
Brownian motion and the tunneling effect also become signiﬁcant at small size,
which may cause concern in some instances (i.e., Brownian noise in sensors) or
provide additional capability in others (i.e., electron tunneling sensors).
Scaling also has impact in calculations for MEMS devices. An appropriate
set of units must be utilized to be convenient in CAD systems and reduce adverse
numerical effect in large-scale calculations for MEMS devices.

1. Explain the effect that scale factor reduction has on mechanical system
parameters of mass, stiffness, and natural frequency.
2. Figure 4.17 shows a resonator made with a single level surface micro-
machine process that oscillates in the x axis. The layer thickness is t
= 2.5 µm. The width of the springs is 2 µm. This system can be
idealized as a lumped spring mass system, in which the total spring
stiffness of the resonator can be calculated from the equation in Figure
4.17. I is the area moment of inertial of the spring (see Appendix G).
Assume the mass of the springs is negligible and consider only the
mass of the central oscillating plate. Calculate the natural frequency
of the resonator for several spring lengths: L = 10 mm, 1 mm, and 100
µm. Does this follow the approximate scaling for natural frequency
discussed in this chapter?
3. The spring mass system shown in Figure 4.18 will be actuated by an
electrostatic force and have electrical contact on the opposite end. The
switch is required to close repeatedly in 0.1 ms. Which of the spring
lengths considered in question 2 is most appropriate?
4. The electrodes shown in Figure 4.19 are to be used to produce an
actuation force of 10 µN with an applied voltage of less than 10 V. A
gap of 1 µm is the smallest that can be manufactured. Plot the obtained

5 Design Realization 
Tools for MEMS
Just as MEMS fabrication has its roots in the microelectronics fabrication infra-
structure, the MEMS design realization infrastructure has its roots in the micro-
electronics infrastructure as well. However, the MEMS design realization require-
ments are signiﬁcantly different. MEMS design involves complex geometric,
three-dimensional moving mechanical devices similar to macroworld machine
design. The result is a MEMS design realization environment that leverages a
signiﬁcant portion from microelectronics while plotting a new path to meet the
new demands.
5.1 LAYOUT
The design of a device that is to be fabricated via LIGA, surface micromachining,
or bulk micromachining requires a mask to be made for the patterning step of
the fabrication process. Figure 5.1 shows how the mask set, which is the interface
for the design engineer’s information (i.e., design), ﬁts in the fabrication process
ﬂow. A mask is a two-dimensional design representation that will be patterned
and etched into the working material. Bulk micromachining and LIGA products
typically require a minimal number of masks, typically only one or two masks,
to produce a high aspect ratio MEMS part. Surface micromachining can require
as many as 14 masks to produce a complex MEMS design. Thus, the three MEMS
fabrication technologies share a common need to interface design information
with the mask-making infrastructure; however, surface micromachining is more
complex due to the number of masks required. Surface micromachining will be
emphasized in this chapter because the complexities of design in this MEMS
fabrication technology is a superset of the issues involved with the others.
The infrastructure for mask making is an established industry primarily ser-
vicing the microelectronics production complex. The two common data formats
for the exchange of design layout information for use in the mask-making industry
are GDSII stream format [1] and the Cal Tech Intermediate Format (CIF) [2].
GDSII is a binary format and CIF is an ASCII format; both have become de facto
standards, but GDSII is much more prevalent.
Due to the geometric simplicity needed for microelectronics, the GDSII ﬁle
formation is merely a sequence of closed polygons that may be an approximation

156
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
of the true geometry. However, current implementations of the GDSII ﬁle format
and the supporting translators enable a large number of line segments, which
enable a faithful representation of the desired geometry. A closed polygon is a
sequence of line segments that start and end at the same point (Figure 5.2).
Obviously, the complete suite of two- and three-dimensional geometries (e.g.,
circles, ellipses, curves, cubes, spheres, cylinders) standard in the macroworld
machine design infrastructure does not exist within the context of a GDSII ﬁle
format. Figure 5.3 shows the mask data preparation path between the CAD layout
tool and the GDSII ﬁle used by the mask supplier.
Current MEMS layout tools may have the ability to lay out complex geometric
entities such as circles, ellipses, and curves; however, when the data are exported
to a GDSII data ﬁle [1], the geometric entities are approximated by closed

polygons in a GDS ﬁle format. For example, the SUMMiT™ (Sandia’s ultraplanar
multilevel MEMS technology) design tool suite [3,4] utilizes the two-dimensional
geometric layout capabilities of AutoCAD, which has the full set of geometric
entities to facilitate complex mechanical design. However, to transfer these data
to the mask-making process requires that data pass through a translator to put the
data in the GDSII format. In this example, the data are exported from AutoCAD
[5] to a DXFﬁle format (i.e., an AutoCAD proprietary ﬁle format) that retains
the geometric entity information and then to the GDSII ﬁle format, which does
not retain the geometric entity information. The translation from the DXF format
to the GDSII format can be accomplished with a translator such as ASM3500 [6]. 
Geometric editing (e.g., changing the radius of a circle, radius of a ﬁllet, etc.)
of the design information can be easily done when the geometric entities are
preserved. For example, the AutoCAD binary data ﬁle and DXF ﬁle utilized in
the SUMMiT design tool suite retain the geometric entity information. Similar
editing of design information utilizing a GDSII ﬁle format is severely inhibited
because all curved geometry is merely approximated by a sequence of chords.
Therefore, to edit a curved surface would involve the individual editing (i.e.,
repositioning) of a series of individual points that specify the curved surface.
Within the MEMS layout tool, layers corresponding to the masks that will
be used in the fabrication processing are deﬁned. Figure 5.4 shows the SUMMiT
design environment [4] implemented in AutoCAD. Also shown in Figure 5.4 is
the access to the drawing layers utilized for device layout as well as access to
the standard components, design rule checking, and visualization tools discussed
later in this chapter. Figure 5.5 shows the detailed layer deﬁnitions within the
SUMMiT design tool suite; Table 5.1 lists the deﬁnitions of the mask names,
layout layer names, and GDS layer numbers utilized in the SUMMiT design tool
suite. Figure 5.6 illustrates the SUMMiT material layers deposited on the sub-
strate. The mask name refers to the physical mask that will be utilized in fabri-
cation, and the layer name refers to a drawing layer that will be used to deﬁne
the design data used to make the physical mask. The additional layers shown in
Figure 5.5 that are not listed in Table 5.1 are utilized for layout construction and
notation purposes.
Table 5.1 has several instances in which two drawing layers correspond to
one physical mask. For example, the MMPOLY2 mask is composed of informa-
tion from the MMPOLY2 and MMPOLY2_CUT drawing layers. The two drawing
layers are deﬁned to provide ease in layout. For example, Figure 5.7 shows the
layout for the seismic mass of an accelerometer in which only one drawing layer
was used. Surface micromachine processes require etch release holes in layer

surfaces to enable the release etchant to remove the sacriﬁcial material below.
Because GDSII is limited to closed polygons, the etch release holes are described
by closed polygons. For the case shown in Figure 5.7, a polygon is formed by a
continuous sequence of line segments that deﬁne the periphery of the mass as
well as the individual etch release holes. This form of layout for a device is
circuitous and difﬁcult to modify if changes are required. 
If two layers are used in the CAD layout tool and then combined, a much
easier and more editable layout of the MEMS device can be performed. Figure
5.8 shows the layout of the same seismic mass shown in Figure 5.7, but two layers
(i.e., layer and layer_cut) are utilized. These layers can be combined via a logical
XOR operation (Figure 5.9) to form the mask description necessary for mask
production. The XOR operation is typically performed by the mask production
vendor. Proper use of this technique requires that a master layer be deﬁned
(denoted by “a” in Table 5.1). For example, MMPOLY2 is the master layer for the
MMPOLY2 mask. The layer_cut is only valid when contained within the master
layer, as shown in Figure 5.8. Figure 5.10 and Figure 5.11 show several approaches
to the layout of some typical geometric shapes using the two layer concept. 
5.2 SUMMIT TECHNOLOGY LAYOUT
This section will provide examples of the layout of devices and structures that
can be manufactured in the SUMMiT technology [3]. Of the three categories of
MEMS technologies (i.e., surface micromachining, bulk micromachining,

LIGA), surface micromachining usually contains a superset of the issues involved
in MEMS layout or design. The following subsections will discuss the layout
details of ﬁve types of structures, which span the spectrum of device layout
frequently encountered. Review of the layout of these structures will provide the
basis for the discussion of manufacturing issues and design rules in subsequent
sections. Although some speciﬁc details of these layouts may be unique to
SUMMiT, the general techniques, issues, and concerns will be typical in com-
parable MEMS technologies. The layout of these devices will involve a combi-
nation of the 14 masks utilized in the SUMMiT V™ technology. Figure 5.12
shows the cross-hatch patterns for the various masks that will be utilized in the
following discussions.
5.2.1 ANCHORING LAYERS
Anchoring or attaching mechanical layers to each other and to ground is the most
basic function to be achieved in any surface micromachined device such as

SUMMiT. Because surface micromachining is an alternating stack of two types
of materials (i.e., structural and sacriﬁcial), mechanical layers are attached by
etching a hole or via in the sacriﬁcial material; this enables the next mechanical
layer material deposited to attach to the mechanical material below at the via.
Figure 5.13 shows SEM images of various layers of SUMMiT anchored to each
other. The attachment between the layers at the via produced by the SACOX_CUT
can be seen between the adjacent layers. The term “SACOX_CUT” refers to a
generic operation of opening a via in a sacriﬁcial oxide layer to allow attachment
of adjacent structural layers. SACOX#_CUT is the use of a SACOX_CUT on a
speciﬁc SACOX# layer.
A particular layer cannot be directly anchored to ground in the SUMMiT
technology because deep SACOX_CUTs are not allowed. The SACOX_CUT

enables the mechanical layers immediately above and below to be attached. For
example, a SACOX3_CUT will enable MMPOLY3 and MMPOLY2 to be
attached. Figure 5.14 shows a demonstration of the ﬁve layers of the SUMMiT
process. Figure 5.15 show a cross-section visualization and the masks for a post
that extends from MMPOLY0 to MMPOLY4. Notice that the SACOX_CUTs are
all on top of each other and the size of the SACOX_CUT becomes bigger at each
higher level. The size increase enables the mechanical material at the higher level
to attach to the shoulder of the via to the mechanical material on the level
immediately below. This is denoted as a nested anchor.
The nested anchor method can produce the smallest size post possible. How-
ever, a nested anchor will have encased silicon dioxide trapped inside the post
as shown in the cross-section of Figure 5.15. The encased silicon dioxide is due
to the inability of the etching processes to remove material completely at locations
that have signiﬁcant vertical topography. This artifact is known as a stringer and
is discussed in Section 3.3 and Section 5.3.1.6. The residual stress of the entrapped
silicon oxide in the post can cause slight deﬂections [7]; this may be a design
consideration, depending upon the application.
A staggered anchor is a method of reducing the amount of encased silicon
dioxide in an anchor; however, the required size of the post will increase. Figure
5.16 shows a cross-section visualization of a post utilizing a staggered anchor
approach.
5.2.2 ROTATIONAL HUBS
Rotational hubs are structures that enable 360° rotation similar to a wheel and
axle. The ability to implement this structure at the microscale with no assembly

necessary is an enabling feature for MEMS devices that require mechanisms.
Two methods can be used to produce a rotational hub in the SUMMiT technology:
a cap and post hub and a low-clearance hub, which are discussed next.
A cap and post hub can be implemented in any three-level surface microma-
chine technology, and it is the simplest hub design that can be utilized. Figure
5.17 shows the masks and a cross-section of a cap and post hub implemented in
the SUMMiT technology. The central feature of this type of hub is a central post
with a cap of sufﬁcient diameter so that a rotating wheel will be constrained
vertically. The ﬁgure’s cross-section shows the rotating wheel composed of
MMPOLY1 and MMPOLY2, which are laminated together. Functionally, the
rotating wheel could be only one layer instead of two. An MMPOLY3 cap is
supported by a post of MMPOLY1 and MMPOLY2.
The implementation of the cap and post structure is similar to the anchors
discussed in the previous section. The clearance for the rotating wheel is deﬁned
by the ability of the lithography process to etch layers MMPOLY1 and
MMPOLY2 at the rotating interface. The vertical clearance is deﬁned by the
thickness of the sacriﬁcial oxide layer or the ability to produce structures such
as dimples to constrain the vertical motion. Dimples are small “bumps” under-
neath surface micromachined layers that prevent broad area surface contact when
the layers contact the substrate or each other. Dimples can also be used to
minimize clearances.
The low-clearance hub is a feature that SUMMiT was especially designed to
implement (Figure 5.18). This hub utilizes the ability to deposit and etch thin
ﬁlms of sacriﬁcial material accurately (i.e., silicon dioxide) to control the clear-
ance in the hub. Figure 5.18 shows the layout and cross-section of the low-
clearance hub, and Figure 5.19 shows an FIB cross-section of a low-clearance
hub and pin joint fabrication in SUMMiT. A pin joint is very similar to a hub,
but is not attached to ground. A pin joint enables linkages between rotating
members, as shown in Figure 5.19.
Figure 5.20 shows a cross-section of the SUMMiT fabrication sequence for
the low-clearance hub at several key points in the process:
•
Figure 5.20a shows the fabrication at the point at which SACOX1 has
been deposited and patterned to produce dimples and anchor
MMPOLY1. MMPOLY1 has been deposited and patterned with the
PIN_JOINT_CUT mask. A combination of anisotropic and wet etching
has been performed to form the features beneath MMPOLY1.
•
Figure 5.20b shows the process after the SACOX2 layer has been
deposited, patterned, and etched and the MMPOLY2 layer deposited.
At this stage, SACOX2 can be seen to deﬁne the clearances in the
internals of the low-clearance hub. The low-clearance hub lateral and
vertical clearances in SUMMiT are 0.3 µm.
•
Figure 5.20c shows the cross-section after the MMPOLY2 etch has
been performed. This etch can etch the laminated MMPOLY1 and
MMPOLY2 layers, thus providing an even outside surface for the

rotating wheel and etch release holes through the rotating wheel disc.
Note that the MMPOLY2 etch stops on the SACOX2 layer in the
internal hub features.
•
Figure 5.20d shows the cross-section of the released low-clearance hub
and pin joint structure.
5.2.3 POLY1 BEAM WITH SUBSTRATE CONNECTION
The MMPOLY1 beam with a substrate connection is a simple structure illustrating
the application of two features useful in design of a number of devices in the
SUMMiT technology. The MMPOLY1 layer can be patterned in either of two
ways in SUMMiT:
•
The MMPOLY1 layer can be patterned directly using the
MMPOLY1_cut mask and etch.
•
The MMPOLY1 layer can also be patterned indirectly by using
SACOX2 as a “hard” mask and etching with the MMPOLY2 etch.
In the previous section, Figure 5.20c showed that the MMPOLY2 etch would
etch the MMPOLY1 and MMPOLY2 layers except when the MMPOLY1 layer
is protected by SACOX2. In this case, the SACOX2 layer was used as a “hard”
mask to stop the MMPOLY2 etch. For the MMPOLY1 beam shown in Figure
5.21, the SACOX2 mask is used to deﬁne the MMPOLY1 beam via the
MMPOLY2 etch. The MMPOLY1 beam is attached to the substrate using a
SACOX1_CUT as discussed in Section 5.2.1. If a connection is to be established
to the substrate for electrical grounding purposes, the NITRIDE_CUT mask is
used to deﬁne the etch of the NITRIDE layer.
5.2.4 DISCRETE HINGES
The concept of discrete hinges for MEMS applications was initially proposed by
Pister [8]. Since that time, a number of different variations and types of hinges

have been developed and applied [9]. Figure 5.22 shows SEM images of a “pop-
up” mirror that utilizes two types of discrete hinges:
•
Staple and pin hinge. This allows a plate to be attached to the substrate
and rotate about an axis parallel to the substrate. Figure 5.23 shows
the layout and cross-section for a staple and pin hinge implemented in
SUMMiT. The cross-section shows two posts that go up to the
MMPOLY3 level, which bridges between the posts to form the staple.
The pin is a narrow piece of laminate MMPOLY1 and MMPOLY2 that
connects out of the plane of the cross-section to the movable plate. As
in a cap and post hub, the staple and pin hinge clearances are deﬁned
by the width of the MMPOLY2 etch.
•
Plate-to-plate hinge. This couples two plates and allows them to rotate
about an axis parallel to the plane of the plates and the hinge to deﬂect
off the substrate, as shown in Figure 5.22. The design of the plate-to-
plate hinge is quite complex. Figure 5.24 and Figure 5.25 show the
layout and two cross-sections of the device. Figure 5.24 shows the
individual masks required to fabricate the hinge in SUMMiT technol-
ogy, as well as the composite mask, “stacked” together. To fabricate
this device as well as any other device in SUMMiT requires the masks
be aligned precisely to each other. The A-A cross-section shown in
Figure 5.25c reveals the major parts of this hinge design. An
MMPOLY2 pin is connected out of the plane of the cross-section to
plate 2. The pin is trapped by the staple and ﬂoor and rotates within
these objects. Figure 5.25b shows that the SACOX2 layer separates
MMPOLY1 and MMPOLY2 and stops the MMPOLY2 etch so that an
MMPOLY2 pin is formed. The staple is formed by utilizing
SACOX3_CUTS to attach MMPOLY3 in two places to MMPOLY2.
A subtle feature is the cutting of MMPOLY1 as deﬁned by the
MMPOLY1_CUT mask to separate the pin and the ﬂoor structures as
shown in Figure 5.25d and Figure 5.25e. Without the separation of the
ﬂoor and pin structures via the MMPOLY1_CUT, this hinge would
rigidly attach plate 1 and plate 2 (i.e., not functional).

5.3 DESIGN RULES
The term design rules originally comes from the microelectronics industry. These
rules are a formal communication between the fabrication engineer and the design
engineer. For the microelectronics industry, design rules are the layout rules
required to obtain optimum yield (functional devices vs. nonfunctional devices)
in as small an area as possible without compromising circuit reliability.
Design rules for MEMS fabrication are also a formal communication between
the fabrication and design engineers. MEMS fabrication processes are similar to
microelectronics; however, due to the additional ability of motion MEMS devices
(e.g., inertial sensors, mechanisms, pumps, valves, etc.) they are very different
from microelectronics (i.e., electronic circuitry) and more varied in function and
application. The varied function and application of MEMS devices make the
assessment of yield from the perspective of design rules for a general-use MEMS
fabrication process difﬁcult to deﬁne. Design rules for MEMS fabrication pro-
cesses are the layout rules required to produce MEMS devices with minimal
defect with the smallest feature sizes possible. MEMS device functionality and
reliability are generally very speciﬁc to the device design and cannot be totally
encompassed by MEMS layout design rules alone.
The layouts for microelectronic and MEMS design are very complex and
involve a number of mask layers. The mechanics of automated design rule
checking for VLSI circuitry layout was established during the rise of the micro-
electronics industry [10–12]. Yarberry [4] discusses the implementation of auto-
mated design rule checking for a MEMS fabrication process, SUMMiT™.
Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.2 will discuss the manufacturing issues that are
the basis for the speciﬁcation of design rules and the implementation of design
rules for a MEMS fabrication process.
5.3.1 MANUFACTURING ISSUES
5.3.1.1
Patterning Limits
The deﬁnition of MEMS device features is a function of the patterning and etch
steps of the fabrication processes used. These processes may be utilized for
patterning, such as photolithography and lift-off, and are discussed in Section
2.6. A number of isotropic and anisotropic etch processes (Section 2.5) may be
used to etch the pattern into the MEMS material. The patterning limits will control
the smallest feature that can be realized in a MEMS device. This patterning limit
is frequently called the feature size or CD (critical dimension). The patterning
limits of a fabrication technology are expressed as line width and space design
rules for each layer in the fabrication technology. Figure 5.26 illustrates the
expression of a line width and space design rule for a layer in the SUMMiT™
process. Figure 5.27 illustrates the result of attempting to pattern features in
violation of the design rules for the process. Figure 5.28 shows that lithograph-
ically patterning has a “rounding” effect of the sharp-cornered features due to
the patterning limitations.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
5.3.1.2
Etch Pattern Uniformity
Etch pattern uniformity becomes an issue in many fabrication technologies due
to optical effects of patterning large arrays of similar or varied structures, or
etching an array of structures of varying size. Figure 5.29 illustrates the etching
of a series of trenches in a bulk micromachining process. The ability to remove
the etch products from the trench can inﬂuence the etch rate of the process.
This can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending upon the device to be
produced.
An accelerometer produced in a surface micromachining process generally
has large banks of comb ﬁngers and electrodes. Lithographic optical issues of
patterning a large arrays of repeating structures such as this may cause the
patterning of the electrodes on the edge to become distorted edge effects. This
can be accommodated by adding a few extra “dummy” electrodes to ensure that
the functioning electrodes are fabricated without distortion.
5.3.1.3
Registration Errors
MEM fabrication technologies frequently require masks at different stages in
the fabrication process to be aligned for the fabricated device to be produced
as designed. For example, the SUMMiT utilizes 14 masks that need to aligned
to each other. The alignment is accomplished by the aid of alignment targets
(Figure 2.26), which are etched into each layer to enable the alignment. Posi-
tioning objects on a mask is accomplished to computer precision; however,
aligning masks relative to each other has a ﬁnite precision, called registration
error. Design rules can be expressed that address the registration error issue.
Figure 5.30 illustrates an enclosure design rule that ensures that the
SACOX1_CUT feature is inside the MMPOLY2 feature. One of the things that
determines the amount of enclosure is determined by the registration errors of
the mask alignment.

ences etch rate. (Courtesy of Sandia National Laboratories.)

5.3.1.4
Etch Compatibility
Alignment of masks within a registration tolerance is also necessary for etch com-
patibility reasons (Figure 5.36). Exposure of one material to an etch designed for
another material or etching underlying materials can be an issue for fabrication
technologies, such as surface micromachining, that involve a number of materials
and mask levels. Figure 5.32a shows that an underlying layer of silicon dioxide was
attacked by the release etch in a surface micromachine process because the masks
were not enveloped sufﬁciently to allow for a ﬁnite registration error of the masks. 
5.3.1.5
Stringers
Stringers are manufacturing artifacts produced when performing anisotropic etch-
ing on a surface that has topography. Figure 5.32c shows an example of a ﬂoating
stringer that landed on the gear. Figure 5.33 shows the mask and a cross-section
of how a ﬂoating and attached stringer can be formed in the SUMMiT™ process.
Stringers are troubling when they are ﬂoating particles that can impede the

operation of devices upon which they land. Fixed stringers are generally unde-
sirable artifacts in a design. The stringer is formed because the anisotropic etch
cannot remove all the material in a topographic discontinuity in the surface. The
design rule that would have prevented the stringers shown in Figure 5.33 is “X1C
WITHOUT P2” or “X3C WITHOUT P3.” For example, “X1C WITHOUT P2”
(read literally as SACOX1_CUT polygon without an enveloping MMPOLY2
polygon) would produce a stringer in the topographic discontinuity of the
SACOX1 layer because of the inability of the anisotropic etch of MMPOLY2 to
remove the material in the “corners.”
5.3.1.6
Floaters 
Floaters are just pieces of material that are not fastened to the substrate, another
object attached to the substrate, or contained within another structure. Figure 5.34
shows a piece of MMPOLY2 that is not attached to the substrate with a
SACOX1_CUT. An example of a design rule that would alert the designer to this
problem is “P2 without X1C.” Figure 5.32b shows an occurrence of unattached
pieces of material that have ﬂoated away deposited elsewhere on the die.
5.3.1.7
Litho Depth of Focus
Patterning is generally performed with optical lithography. The depth of focus of
a lithography tool that can pattern a small feature size is generally limited.

Attempting to pattern an object outside the focus of the lithography tool will
generally perform poorly. Figure 5.32d is an example of attempting to pattern
MMPOLY2 within a cut in the sacriﬁcial oxide cut.
5.3.1.8
Stiction (Dimples)
Dimples are small “bumps” on the bottom side of the mechanical layers of a
surface micromachine process for the purpose of preventing broad area surface
contact, which could cause layers to stick together or stick to the substrate.
Dimples are placed at a certain frequency and prevent stiction of the layer. Design
rules that would address this issue are usually informational or advisory because
the designer may intentionally decide not to have dimples because the structure
is sufﬁciently stiff to prevent stiction.
5.3.1.9
Etch Release Holes
Etch release holes are holes placed in a large area of a surface micromachined
layer to allow the release etchant to remove the sacriﬁcial material immediately
below more readily. An example of a SUMMiT design rule that addresses this

issue is “MMPOLY2_CUT_SPACE GREATER THAN 38 µm.” A violation of
this design rule will result in a structure that is not fully released from the
sacriﬁcial layer.
5.3.1.10
Improper Anchor (Area of Anchor)
Anchoring one layer to another is a basic function required in a MEMS design.
Frequently, a design rule specifying the minimum area of the anchor is utilized
to ensure anchor strength.
5.3.2 DESIGN RULE CHECKING
Layouts of devices are frequently large and complex and require an automatic
check of the design rules to ensure compliance. Automated design rule checking
was originated in the microelectronics industry [10–12]. Techniques were devel-
oped to check for design rule violations by automatically and efﬁciently scanning
large microelectronic layouts containing many repeated cells. Microelectronic lay-
outs are generally Manhattan geometries, which do not involve arbitrary angles or
curves. However, MEMS layouts frequently include general geometric shapes that
are non-Manhattan geometry. Most MEMS design tools suites incorporate design
rule checking [3,4]. The design rules are frequently divided into two categories:

•
Design rule errors: a design rule violation that requires mandatory
attention
•
Design rule advisory: a design rule violation that requires the designer
to evaluate the necessity for correction
Figure 5.35 shows the operation of the automatic design rule-checking capa-
bility within the SUMMiT™ design tool suite. The layout is scanned for design
rule errors; these are noted and highlighted in the layout to assist the MEMS
designer in locating and evaluating the design rule violation. The design rule-
checking environment generally contains tools to navigate through the drawing
to assess each violation.
5.4 STANDARD COMPONENTS
Standard components is another concept taken from the microelectronics world
(i.e., standard cells) in which frequently used components are designed, fabri-
cated, tested, and placed into a library for use in further design. Models of the
components will have already been developed and available. Ideally, a designer
would be able to implement a signiﬁcant portion of any design by placing and
coupling the components together and simulating the total system response uti-

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
lizing existing models. This approach greatly reduces the risk and time inherent
in new system design.
The validity of utilizing the standard cell concept for MEMS is challenged by
the breadth of MEMS applications. However, many MEMS foundry technologies
[3,13] utilize the standard cell concept to the degree practical. Figure 5.36 shows
the standard components available in the SUMMiT™ design tool suite and Figure
5.37 is an example of a system made entirely from standard components. However,
in general, it is difﬁcult for standard components to span the breadth encountered
in MEMS; therefore, the standard component library elements generally focus on
the most frequently used components encountered in MEMS design, such as
•
Actuators
•
Electrical elements (bond pads, wiring elements, etc.)
•
Mechanical coupling elements (springs, displacement multiplier, etc.)
•
Optical elements (mirror plates, hinges, etc.)
5.5 MEMS VISUALIZATION
MEMS visualization tools are a signiﬁcant help to the MEMS engineer. Two
categories of tools have been developed and used to aid the visualization of
geometry that MEMS processes produce:
•
Physics-based process modeling tools. These tools can predicatively
model the MEMS processes used to fabricate MEMS devices. They
FIGURE 5.36 Standard components available in the SUMMiT™ design tool suite.

Design Realization Tools for MEMS

can provide detailed information on process parameters and visualiza-
tion for MEMS devices. A number of tools have been developed to
simulate anisotropic etching of silicon [14–21]. Modeling of thin ﬁlm
deposition and etch processes is signiﬁcant in microelectronics and
MEMS manufacture and the effort to create suitable simulators is
ongoing [22–26]. This type of visualization, which is based upon
detailed physical modeling of the processes, is computationally intense
and provides useful information for the MEMS process engineer. How-
ever, it is frequently inappropriate for visualization for the MEMS
design engineer.
•
Geometric emulation of MEMS processes. This approach utilizes a
geometric description of the result of each process step that is concat-
enated to build a geometric model of the complete MEMS device. The
geometric emulation approach [27–31] has become a widely accepted
approach for MEMS visualization applications. Koppelman ﬁrst uti-
lized geometric emulation in the OYSTER program [27], which was
subsequently extended to the MemBuilder [28] and MEMulator™[34]
modules incorporated into the MEMCAD program [32–34]. The geo-
metric emulation approach is capable of modeling the spectrum of
process steps (i.e., conformal depositions, planariziation, etch proﬁles,
gap ﬁlls; Figure 5.38) encountered in MEMS processes [30,31] in a
computationally efﬁcient manner, thus providing the MEMS designer
with meaningful information. Figure 5.39 illustrates how MEMS two-
and three-dimensional visualization tools assist the MEMS designer
from layout to the fabricated device. The three-dimensional visualiza-

tion tools also provide a gateway to MEMS analysis through the solid
model, which can be meshed with ﬁnite elements for detailed analysis
(Figure 5.40).
5.6 MEMS ANALYSIS
MEMS analysis is the computations that enable the engineering of a MEMS
device. The level of detail and effort expended on the analysis [35,36] depends

upon the stage of development and value of the MEMS device. Figure 5.41 shows
a concept of the various levels of complexity of MEMS analysis. A design
synthesis model is the ﬁrst stage of analysis that is appropriate in the transition
from concept to product. This type of model is generally low order, such as a
lumped parameter model with a limited number of degrees of freedom (DOF). A
design synthesis model may be developed by ﬁrst-principle analysis of the MEMS
device. These models may be incorporated into a model of the system into which
the MEMS device will be incorporated. Frequently, the metric of evaluation of a
MEMS device is how the system into which it is incorporated behaves.
At the other end of the scale of complexity is the detailed design model,
which is frequently characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom
utilizing ﬁnite element methods (FEMs) or boundary element methods (BEMs).
The detailed design model may also involve multiple physics domains (i.e.,
structural, electrical, ﬂuidic, etc.). A detailed design model can provide extremely
ﬁne detail on the operation of a MEMS device, but it may be at the expense of
signiﬁcant computation and model development. A system level model may
require the information generated by a detailed design model; however, direct
incorporation of a detailed design model into a system model is generally imprac-
tical. This may be accomplished by a phenomenological or macromodel [37,38],
which may be developed by projecting the results of the detailed design model
onto spaces spanned by a small number of DOF [38].
This book emphasizes the development of design synthesis models because
the conceptual stage MEMS device design, in which modeling provides under-
standing of the physics and the trade-offs between design variables, is paramount.
Chapter 7 will discuss development of design synthesis models utilizing
Lagrange’s equations to formulate the governing equations of the MEMS device.

ratcheting actuator. (Courtesy of Sandia National Laboratories.)

188
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
A low-order nodal modeling technique [39–41] that can provide the governing
equations and simulations will also be used.
The techniques for developing a detailed design model of MEMS devices
have been an active research area for approximately 15 years. The early devel-
opment of techniques for detailed design models of MEMS devices centered on
the development of analysis methods for multiple physics domains encountered
in MEMS devices. The ﬁrst such domain MEMS problem that received signiﬁcant
attention was the structural–electrostatic problem [32,33], which resulted in the
MEMCAD software that has been incorporated in commercial MEMS analysis
packages [34]. Subsequently, many FEM and BEM analysis packages have linked
multiple physics domains for MEMS analysis [34,43,44].
However, MEMS devices research in coupled domain MEMS analysis con-
tinues [38], with signiﬁcant emphasis on the coupling of several domains such
as ﬂuidics, electrical, structural, and thermal. Simulation MEMS devices on the
atomic scale [42] is also an active area of research. Atomic scale modeling
becomes signiﬁcant when the area of interest in a device becomes so small that
continuum mechanics modeling with partial differential equations is no longer
valid. An example of this is high-frequency radio frequency (RF) devices.
5.7 SUMMARY
MEMS design realization tools are essential to the ability of the MEMS design
engineer to produce MEMS devices that meet speciﬁcations in an efﬁcient man-
ner. The MEMS design realization tools include the following capabilities:

capability)
•
Standard components
•
Automated design rule checking
•
MEMS visualization
The MEMS visualization tools that were discussed in Section 5.5 construct
a cross-section or three-dimensional solid model (Figure 5.39) of the MEMS
device given the device layout and a process description. This technique is called
art to part (i.e., layout art to solid model of the part). Recent research [45–47]
has developed the basic algorithms for the part-to-art problem (i.e., solid model
of the part to the layout art). With further development and the use of the part-
to-art algorithms, a new method of design realization for MEMS may be possible.
Instead of the MEMS designer producing two-dimensional layouts to produce
the three-dimensional MEMS device, he or she may in the future develop a three-
dimensional solid model of the MEMS device; the part-to-art algorithm could
produce the two-dimensional layouts of the masks to make the part in a particular
technology. This would enable a MEMS designer to work in the same manner
as a macroworld design engineer, who develops a three-dimensional solid model
of a device to be designed.
MEMS analysis capability is essential to the ability of the MEMS designer
to engineer a device. A range of complexity of MEMS analysis models exists:
•
Design synthesis model: low number of DOF or lumped parameter
models
•
Phenomenological or macromodel: a model that can map complex
phenomena or detailed model data to a low-order space
•
Detailed design model: large number of DOF, FEM, or BEM models
In subsequent chapters, MEMS analysis — in particular methods for developing
the design synthesis model — will be discussed in detail.

6 Electromechanics
MEMS devices invariably involve engineering of multiphysics designs to attain
a design objective. The two physical domains most frequently utilized in MEMS
devices are structural and electrical dynamics. Regardless of the design objec-
tive, a structure invariably needs to be designed to support, contain, or possibly
deﬂect to perform a function. An electrical system is needed to sense the
mechanical motion of the structure. At the microscale, damping due to viscous
losses of the device to the surrounding atmosphere greatly inﬂuences the dynam-
ics of the system.
For example, a MEMS accelerometer requires the suspended seismic mass
to have a preferred mode of vibration in the sensitive axis at a speciﬁc resonant
frequency. This device would also have an electrical sense interface to transduce
the motion of the seismic mass and, possibly, electrical force feedback to maintain
the position of the accelerometer sense mass at a neutral position. The damping
of the accelerometer seismic mass will greatly inﬂuence the dynamics of the
system and needs to be considered in the design.
This chapter will present an overview of the important topics in structural
mechanics, damping, and electrical circuit elements. Due to space limitations, an
in-depth treatment of these topics is not possible; however, the topics relevant to
the design of MEMS devices will be presented. References 1 through 4 provide
a more complete background in structural mechanics.
Structural mechanics necessitates the development of the following concepts
to obtain a basic understanding of the subject for purposes of MEMS design:
•
Structural material models
•
Models of the basic structural elements (bending, torsion, axial rods,
columns)
•
Combining the basic structural elements 
Damping mechanisms for vertical and laterally moving MEMS devices will
be presented. The basic electrical circuit elements and models for them will be
presented along with methods for combining them to form a circuit. The set of
equations that describe the electrical circuit elements will also be developed.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
6.1 STRUCTURAL MECHANICS
6.1.1 MATERIAL MODELS
The atomic structure of materials — broadly classiﬁed as crystalline, polycrys-
talline, and amorphous — is illustrated in Figure 2.2. A crystalline material has
a large-scale, three-dimensional atomic structure in which the atoms occupy
speciﬁc locations within a lattice (e.g., epitaxial silicon, diamond). The atomic
packing may be in one of seven main crystal patterns with orientations measured
via the Miller indices (discussed in Chapter 2). 
A polycrystalline material consists of a matrix of grains, which are small
crystals of material; the interface material between adjacent grains is called the
grain boundary. Most metals, such as aluminum and gold as well as polycrystal-
line silicon, are examples of this material structure. A noncrystalline material that
exhibits no large-scale structure is called amorphous. Silicon dioxide and other
glasses are examples of this material structure.
The material type greatly inﬂuences fundamental structure and completeness
of interatomic bonds. This basic material structure affects a number of material
properties, such as the electrical and thermal conductivities, chemical reactivity,
and mechanical strength. For example, the metallurgical processes of cold work-
ing and annealing greatly affect the material grains and grain boundary and the
resulting material properties of strength, hardness, ductility.
The characteristics of a material that ﬁrst come to mind in connection with
the design of a structure are strength, elasticity, and ductility. These characteristics
relate to the ability of the material to resist mechanical forces and how the material
will fail. In order to establish a meaningful way to design with these consider-
ations, it is necessary ﬁrst to deﬁne some commonly used engineering terms.
Given a bar of material loaded with a uniform force distribution across the
cross-sectional area, A, as shown in Figure 6.1, a quantity, stress σ, is deﬁned as
the total force, F, per unit cross-sectional area A (Equation 6.1). The applied load
will deform the material, which will require the deﬁnition of a metric to describe
the extent of deformation. The metric for localized deformation of a material,
strain, is a dimensionless quantity deﬁned as the change in length, δ, per length,
L (Equation 6.2). 
(6.1)
(6.2)
When an experiment is performed on the specimen of Figure 6.1 in which
the load is increased in a controlled manner, stress vs. strain can be plotted (Figure
6.2). The material shown in this ﬁgure exhibits elastic strain. The material deforms
under load as indicated by strain, but the deformation is not permanent. When
the load is removed, the stress and strain return to zero.

If the load on the material is increased further, the material will plastically
deform or fail abruptly. Figure 6.2 shows a material that deforms elastically until
it abruptly fails. The stress at failure is known as the ultimate strength of the
material, Su. This type of material failure is known as brittle. Figure 6.3 shows
a material that deforms elastically until the material yields at a stress known as
the yield stress, Sy. This is the elastic limit of the material. Increasing the stress
(by increasing the load) beyond the Sy will induce plastic strain, which is a
permanent deformation of the material. Unloading a material that has been
stressed beyond Sy will cause a different path to be followed on the stress–strain
curve upon unloading.
When the material is unloaded, a permanent deformation has been induced
in the material as shown by a nonzero deformation existing at zero load. If the
stress in the material (load on the specimen) is increased past the yield stress
until the material eventually fails, the stress at failure is the ultimate strength of
the material Su. The shape of the stress–strain curve for different ductile materials
stressed beyond the elastic limit can vary due to large changes in the material
cross-section during plastic deformation. Some material will exhibit a distinct

change in slope or distinct plastic deformation at the yield point, but others will
be more subtle. When the yield point is not distinct (Figure 6.4), the yield point
is generally deﬁned as that stress, which induces 0.2% (0.002) plastic strain. 
Most engineering applications will not intentionally stress a material past the
yield strength. The system will be designed to operate within the elastic region
of the material. The slope of the elastic region of the stress–strain curve is a
widely used engineering property of a material known as Young’s modulus, E,
which has units of force per area and is a measure of material stiffness. Appendix
E lists typical values of Young’s modulus for a number of materials frequently
used in MEMS devices.
A frequently used material model for operation within the elastic region of
a material is Hooke’s law, which states that the stress in a material is proportional
to the strain that produced it. This is merely the mathematical relationship for
the material operating within the elastic portion of the stress–strain curve:

The discussion thus far has centered on a material loaded normally to the
cross-section of the bar, as shown in Figure 6.1. The load could be in tension or
compression. Alternatively, a material could be loaded in shear (Figure 6.5). In
this case, the load is in the plane of the loaded cross-section. Shear stress, τ, is
deﬁned as the load divided by the cross-sectional area, which is similar to the
deﬁnition for normal stress, σ. However, shear strain, γ, is deﬁned as the change
in angle of a unit cube of the material shown in Figure 6.5. The development of
shear stress and shear strain is similar to that presented for normal stress loading.
Hooke’s law for shear loading is shown in Equation 6.4. The constant of propor-
tionality, G, is known as the modulus of rigidity or the shear modulus. E and G
represent fundamental properties of a material, and they have units of force per
area squared. E and G are measures of the stiffness or rigidity of a material for
normal and shear loading, respectively.
(6.4)
It has also been observed that a material placed in tension also exhibits lateral
strain in addition to axial strain. Poisson demonstrated that these two strains are
proportional to each other within the elastic region modeled by Hooke’s law. The
proportionality constant is known as Poisson’s ratio, ν (Equation 6.5). The Pois-
son ratio is dimensionless and typically has a value between 0 and 0.5. A solid
with ν = 0.5 does not undergo a change volume when strained uniaxially. For
example, rubber is a material with ν = 0.5. The common situation for most solid

materials is for the volume to expand under uniaxial loading, which corresponds
to ν < 0.5.
(6.5)
The three elastic constants, E, G, and ν, are related to each other as shown in the
following equation:
(6.6)
At this point, stress and strain for a one-dimensional situation have been
discussed. Generalized Hooke’s law for normal and shear stresses and strains in
three dimensions for an isotropic material is shown in Equation 6.7. Isotropic
material properties are not a function of spatial orientation. Figure 6.6 illustrates
the six stresses (three normal stresses and three shear stresses) involved in the
three-dimensional problem. This formulation is frequently appropriate for poly-
crystalline and amorphous materials.
(6.7)
However, for crystalline materials, the material properties will frequently be
a function of the spatial orientation. An orthotropic material has three planes of
material property symmetry. To describe this spatial material property, dependency
for an orthotropic material requires nine independent material properties — an
increase over the three independent material properties required for an isotropic
material. There will be a Young’s modulus for each axis (Ex, Ey, Ez); modulus of
rigidity for the three shear planes (Gxy, Gyz, Gxz); and a Poisson ratio (νxy, νyz, νxz)
for each axis. Equation 6.8 shows the orthotropic stress–strain relations.

An anisotropic material is the most general material that requires 21 material
properties to model its behavior. Equation 6.9 shows the stress–strain relations
that would model an anisotropic material. Isotropic and orthotropic material
models are special cases of an anisotropic material model.

6.1.2 THERMAL STRAINS
When the temperature of an unconstrained elastic member is increased, the
member expands in all directions. The normal strain produced in the material is
called thermal strain and is proportional to the temperature increase, ∆T, shown
in Equation 6.10. The proportionality constant, α, is a material property called
the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion [8]. Appendix E gives representative values
for the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion of a number of commonly used MEMS
materials. If the elastic member is unconstrained, the temperature increase pro-
duces thermal strain; however, no stress is induced in the material.
(6.10)
However, if a uniform rod is constrained at each end so that the material cannot
expand when subjected to a temperature increase, a compressive stress (Equation
6.11) will be induced because of the constraint.
(6.11)
Thermal strains can also be developed in devices incorporating materials with
different coefﬁcients of thermal expansion. For example, a beam with aluminum
deposited on silicon, as shown in Figure 6.7, will ﬂex out of plane when exposed
to a uniform temperature increase due to the different coefﬁcients of thermal
expansion of the materials.
In the discussion thus far, only the case in which a uniform temperature
increase in a material produces a thermal strain has been considered. Another
common and interesting situation is produced when temperature gradients due
to nonuniform temperature distributions in the material exist. Temperature gra-
dients can be due to thermal transients and nonuniform heat generation or heat
deposition within the material. A thermal stress is developed due to a temperature
gradient in a body. 
Figure 6.8 illustrates the thermal stress induced in a MEMS die and device
during transient heat transfer. The heat ﬂux on the bottom surface of the substrate

produces a temperature gradient; the bottom surface is the hottest. The temper-
ature gradient causes the material at different depths and temperature to expand
differently, thus resulting in a thermal strain that causes out-of-plane deﬂections
of the substrate.
The effect of thermally induced stresses on precision MEMS sensors will
have a direct impact on performance and thus needs to be considered in the system
design. Thermal stress is also utilized as a MEMS actuation mechanism (discussed
in Chapter 8).
6.1.3 AXIAL ROD
The axial rod shown in Figure 6.1, which was discussed during the development
of material models, is a fundamental structural element. A rod is an idealized one-
dimensional structural element subjected only to axial forces, which can be tensile
or compressive. Figure 6.9 is a schematic of the displacement of an element of
material in the rod. In this schematic, the element of material, dx, has an applied
force, F. Due to this loading, the material at position x undergoes a displacement

u, and the material at position x + dx undergoes a displacement 
. It
can be seen that the element of material has changed length by the amount
. Therefore, the strain is 
, which is a mathematical partial deriv-
ative expression for strain (i.e., change in length ∂u per length ∂x). Using Hooke’s
law, Equation 6.12 is obtained upon substituting for σ and ε.
(6.12)
Differentiating F with respect to x yields Equation 6.13, which is an expres-
sion for the rate of change of force in the material.
(6.13)
Newton’s law of motion is now applied for the element and the net elastic
force in the material element is equated with the inertial force of the material
element, where ρ is the density of the rod:
(6.14)
Substituting for 
 yields the one-dimensional wave in Equation 6.15,
which is a common governing equation for a number of physical phenomena in
addition to axial vibration of a rod (e.g., string under tension, acoustics):
(6.15)
The quantity c is the velocity of propagation of displacement or stress in a
rod. This metric includes information regarding the stiffness of the material as
well as its density.

The stiffness coefﬁcient, K, is another useful design metric that can be
obtained for the axial rod. Using Equation 6.12 and recognizing that the strain
is the change in length, δ, divided by the original length, L, yields the stiffness
coefﬁcient, K. The stiffness coefﬁcient for the axial rod is the ratio of the force
per unit deﬂection and has units of force divided by length. Whereas E and G
were metrics for stiffness of a particular material, K is a measure of the stiffness
of a particular structural element with a speciﬁed loading situation.
(6.17)
6.1.4 TORSION ROD
Another common structural element involved in structural design, torsion rods
may be used as ﬂexures to couple or suspend structures. The torsion rod is a
length of material loaded with an applied torque that will produce an angular
displacement, θ, and shear stress, τ, in the structural element (Figure 6.10). The
theoretical development for torsion bars involves the following assumptions:
•
The torsion bar is straight and of uniform circular cross-section (solid
or concentrically hollow).
•
The torsion bar is loaded by and opposite torques.
•
The torsion bar is not stressed beyond it elastic limit.
The torsion bar twists as torque is applied where plane cross-sections remain
plane and radii remain straight. Torsion produces a shear stress at any point in
the cross-section, which is a maximum at the outer surface; the shear stress is
proportional to the distance from the center. Equation 6.18 deﬁnes the shear stress
due to torsion as a function of the distance from the center of the torsion bar, r.
J is the area polar moment of inertia. The shear stress is a maximum at the outer
surface, r = R (Equation 6.19). This fact explains why many torsion drive shafts
are annular tubes. The material near the shaft center carries little stress in pure
torsion loading. J for circular cross-sections is given in Appendix G, Table A.G.1.

(6.19)
The development of the governing equation for the torsion rod is similar to
that for the axial rod. Once again, the governing equation is the one-dimensional
wave equation (Equation 6.20) involving a speed of propagation, c, for torsional
displacement and stress (Equation 6.21). A stiffness coefﬁcient for a torsion rod
that relates the applied torque to the angular displacement can also be developed
(Equation 6.22). The stiffness coefﬁcient, K, has units of torque per radian. These
equations involve the coefﬁcient of rigidity, G, and material density, ρ, as well
as the length of the torsion rod, L.
(6.20)
(6.21)
(6.22)
where,
(6.23)
MEMS applications rarely encounter circular cross-sections. Rectangular and
square cross-sections are more common due to the restrictions of MEMS fabri-
cation techniques. When a torsion load is applied to a noncircular cross-section,
some basic assumptions for torsion are violated. The cross-sections become
warped; the greatest stress occurs at a point on the perimeter nearest the axis of
twist and the corners of the rectangular and square cross-sections have no stress.
The analysis of torsion for these cross-sections becomes complex and has been
studied for years [4,5]. Table A.G.1 in Appendix G gives values for the torsional
constant, J, that account for the effects of noncircular cross-sections; these can
be used in calculations for torsional stiffness.

6.1.5 BEAM BENDING
Lateral beam bending is a one-dimensional element in which the loading is
perpendicular to the axis of the beam. The loading may be distributed along the
length of the beam or concentrated at a speciﬁc location; it can also be a com-
bination of these situations. A basic formulation of lateral beam bending is called
the Euler–Bernouli beam. The assumptions involved in the development of the
Euler–Bernouli beam model are:
•
The material is homogenous and isotropic and obeys Hooke’s law.
•
The beam is initially straight with a constant cross-section.
•
The beam is subjected to pure bending (i.e., no torsion or axial loads).
•
Plane cross-sections (y–z plane) remain plane during bending.
•
The beam has an axis of symmetry.
The lateral deﬂection of a Euler–Bernouli beam, shown in Figure 6.11, is
due to a bending moment, M, that bends the beam in a curve with a radius of
curvature, ρ. The radius of curvature is assumed to be related to the bending
moment, as shown in Equation 6.24, where E is Young’s modulus and I is the
area moment of inertia about the axis of bending (z axis in Figure 6.11a). The
EI product is the proportionality constant in Equation 6.24, which is frequently
called the beam cross-section stiffness. The stiffness of the entire beam will
involve other information, such as the beam length and the beam end conditions.
The radius of curvature, ρ, is also shown in Equation 6.24 to be approximately
equal to second derivative of y with respect to x. This approximation used in the
FIGURE 6.11 Beam bending.

formulation of the Euler–Bernouli beam will limit the resulting governing equa-
tion’s validity to small deﬂections. The deﬂection of the beam has a “neutral
axis” that is not stressed during bending deformation. Table A.G.2 and Table
A.G.3 in Appendix G show the calculation of the area moment of inertia for the
common beam cross-sections encountered in MEMS devices.
For the beam shown in Figure 6.11c, the material above the neutral axis is
in compression and below the neutral axis is in tension. Equation 6.25 shows the
mathematical expression for the stress distribution across the beam cross-section
illustrated in Figure 6.11c. As shown in this ﬁgure, the stress is a maximum at
the outer ﬁbers of material (Equation 6.26). Depending on the direction of the
bending moment at a particular cross-section, the stress is compressive on one
side of the neutral axis and tensile on the other side, with the maximum tensile
and compressive stresses occurring at the outer surfaces. 
(6.24)
(6.25)
(6.26)
Figure 6.12 schematically illustrates a beam undergoing lateral bending due
to a distributed load q(x), which is a measure of applied force per length along
the beam. The beam also has a mass per length, m. This ﬁgure also shows the
forces and moments that will exist on a unit length, dx, of beam material, where
M is a moment and V is a shear force. 
The governing equation for a Euler–Bernouli beam can be developed from
this schematic representation. Equation 6.27 shows an application of Newton’s
second law in the lateral direction for the unit length of material. Equation 6.28
can be obtained by summing moments with respect to the right face of the unit
element of material. A limiting process results in the elimination of the dx2 term.

(6.28)
Combining Equation 6.24, Equation 6.27, and Equation 6.28 results in Equa-
tion 6.29, which is the governing partial differential equation for a Euler–Bernouli
beam. 
(6.29)
This formulation can be further simpliﬁed for a beam with a uniform cross-section
vs. length:
(6.30)
Solution of the governing equation for a speciﬁc beam conﬁguration neces-
sitates the deﬁnition of the end conditions of the beam. Because the governing
equation for a beam is higher order than the governing equation for torsion or
an axial rod, the speciﬁcation of the boundary condition at the ends of the beam
requires two variables to be deﬁned. A beam requires the speciﬁcation of any
two of the following: deﬂection (y), slope (θ), moment (M), or shear force (V).
Table 6.1 shows examples of the various classical speciﬁcations of beam end
conditions. The solutions of the Euler–Bernouli beam equation have been studied
extensively and solutions for a great variety of loading and boundary condition
situations are readily available [2–4].

The stiffness coefﬁcient, K, which is the proportionality constant between
displacement and force, is a useful design parameter. For simple beam-bending
situations, the stiffness coefﬁcient, K, has a generic form shown in Equation 6.31,
where EI is the beam cross-section stiffness, L is beam length, and C is a
coefﬁcient that depends on the beam-loading and boundary conditions. Appendix
F gives the stiffness for some simple beam-bending situations as well as some
more complicated ﬂexures that may be used in MEMS design. Compare the
stiffness coefﬁcients listed there for some simple beam-bending situations such
as a ﬁxed–free beam (e.g., C = 3) with Equation 6.31. 
(6.31)
The Euler–Bernouli beam is a very useful formulation for beam bending and
can be used extensively in MEMS design. Seely and Smith [1] have an in-depth
discussion of the assumptions involved in the Euler–Bernouli beam. However,
the designer needs to be aware of the limitations of this theory and have a feel
for when an alternative theory is more appropriate. Euler–Bernouli beam theory
is appropriate for small deﬂections of a beam that, due to the approximation
Equation 6.24, is involved in development of the governing equation. As a result,
the beam response predicted by this theory will become inaccurate when the
deﬂections become large. 
Shear deformation and rotary inertia effects can also affect the accuracy of
Euler–Bernouli beam theory. Shear deformation effects become signiﬁcant when
the beam is short and mode of deformation is due to shear vs. bending. Timoshenko
beam theory [7] is appropriate for situations with shear and rotary inertia effects;
however, the governing equation is more complex. A beam with an initial curvature
is another frequently encountered situation that is addressed in Roark [2]. 
6.1.6 FLAT PLATE BENDING
Flat plate bending (Figure 6.13) is a structural situation that involves bending of
a two-dimensional ﬂat plate due to transverse loading. Many of the same assump-
tions used in the development of the governing equations for one-dimensional
beam bending are also used for ﬂat plate bending; however, the analysis is more

complex because of multiaxis bending. Soedel [6] and Timoshenko and Woi-
nowsky-Krieger [7] provide the detailed governing equation development for the
ﬂat plate (Equation 6.32). The quantity, D, is known as the plate ﬂexural rigidity
(Equation 6.33). Beam bending and ﬂat plate bending are fourth-order partial
differential equations. The boundary conditions for a ﬂat plate are conceptually
the same as those for beam bending except that the boundary conditions are
applied along the length of the plate edges. 
(6.32)
(6.33)
The analysis of ﬂat plate bending is very important to the design of MEMS
devices such as pressure sensors. Plate theory has been studied extensively and
a number of theories have been developed to analyze plates of various conﬁgu-
rations and loadings. For thick plates, transverse shear becomes important and
for thin plates or membranes, the restoring force is primarily due to tension.
Equation 6.32 can be used for the analysis of plates in which ﬂexural stress
dominates and the deﬂections are small relative to the thickness of the plate (e.g.,
y < 0.4 t). Analytical solutions of ﬂat plate bending [6,7] have been developed
for a number of cases, but due to their complexity, they are not generally useful
for design synthesis calculations. Figure 6.14 and Figure 6.15 show simpliﬁed
formulas for pressure loaded circular and rectangular plates with ﬁxed boundary
conditions. These two cases are particularly relevant for MEMS devices.

6.1.7 COLUMNS
Axial loading of a structural member (Figure 6.16) is a frequently encountered
situation. The axial load, F, can be tensile or compressive. A member in tension
would behave as an axial rod (described in a previous section). However, a
structural member under axial compression will have two modes of failure:
•
Material failure. This occurs when a structural member behaves as an
axial rod where the material will fail.
•
Instability failure. If the structural member is sufﬁciently long and
slender, the member will deﬂect laterally even though the loading is
purely axial. At certain critical loads, this will cause a sudden and
catastrophic collapse of the structure.
In structural mechanics, columns generally refer to axial compressive loading of
a member and the analysis of this instability phenomenon.
Using a very similar approach to the development of the governing equations
for a beam, but with axial loads included, the governing equation for a compressive
axial loaded column can be developed (Equation 6.34). The resulting governing
equation is the same as the Euler–Bernouli beam except for an additional term
that accounts for the axial loading effects. The second and third terms on the left-
hand side of the equation model the stiffness of the beam.
The overall stiffness of a beam or column is greatly inﬂuenced by the type
of end condition. Various combinations of idealized end conditions for a column
are illustrated in Figure 6.16. A pinned end condition constrains the lateral deﬂec-
tion of the beam, but the rotation is not constrained. The ﬁxed end condition
constrains both the deﬂection and rotation of the beam end, and conversely the
free end condition constrains neither the deﬂection nor rotation. An idealized ﬁxed

end condition is difﬁcult to realize in practice; therefore, the theoretical results
developed using this idealization are sometimes modiﬁed (see note Table 6.2).
(6.34)
A simple analysis of a compressive axially loaded column (Figure 6.16c) can
be done with Equation 6.34 as the starting point. Assuming the beam in Figure
6.16a is statically loaded, only by the axial force, F, allows neglect of the ﬁrst
term on the left and right sides of Equation 6.34. This would result in the following
equation after some simpliﬁcation:
(6.35)
This second-order differential equation for the column, which is pin supported
at each end, would have the following simple solution:
(6.36)
If the column is about the collapse, the constant, A, in the preceding equation
cannot equal zero because the column will deﬂect laterally. Therefore, the sin
term will need to equal zero. This will be true if 
. Solving for F
will produce the critical load, Fcr, at which the column will collapse.
(6.37)
This analysis of a pinned-pinned column has resulted in the classical theory
of column collapse known as Euler column theory. This basic analysis can be
generalized for beam of various end conditions (Figure 6.16). Table 6.2 show the
various fundamental column loading situations and the end condition constants,
C, that can be used in the generalized form of the Euler column formula (Equation
6.38). This can be used to provide an estimate of the critical load for column
collapse. However, the analysis and prediction of Fcr for a real-world situation is
very difﬁcult. Column instability is very sensitive to small perturbation in the
end conditions and structural imperfections. Also, a ﬁxed boundary condition is
very difﬁcult to achieve in practice. Therefore, use of a value of C of no greater
than 1.2 is recommended to avoid predicting a value too high for Fcr.

One of the difﬁculties in the analysis of column behavior is the imprecise
demarcation between column behavior and an axial rod under compressive loading
and the existence of non-axial-loading situations. This has resulted in a number
of other approaches to improve column behavior prediction, such as Euler–Johnson
column theory, and the secant formula; these are explained in detail in Shigley
and Mitchell [3] and Rothbart [4]. Roark [2] discusses elastic instability for other
structural situations such as plates and shells. Elastic instability can also be used
to advantage. For example, a buckling beam has been used to produce out-of-plane
motion for a MEMS mirror surface [9], as shown in Figure 6.17.

The previous sections have developed the classical structural elements (axial rod,
torsion rod, beam, plate, etc.) that can be used in combination to analyze more
complex structures. A common metric for the analysis of structural elements

separately or in combination is the stiffness coefﬁcient, K, which has units of
force or torque per deﬂection. To combine stiffness elements to access the stiffness
of more complex structures, the methods of combining stiffnesses in series or
parallel are used (Figure 6.18). A series spring combination has the same force
or torque in both spring elements and the deﬂection is the total deﬂection of both
springs. A parallel combination of spring elements has the force split between
the springs and the deﬂection is the same for all the springs in parallel. Note: the
mathematical relationship for combinations of mechanical stiffnesses vs. electri-
cal elements is opposite. The use of simple models and the ability to combine
them to make estimates of the system response are immensely valuable in design.
Example 6.1
Problem: Find the stiffness in the X direction of the crab-leg spring shown in
Figure 6.19. Assume the spring is made of polysilicon with E = 1.6 × 105 µn/µm2.
Solution: The vertical beam has ﬁxed–ﬁxed end conditions and the stiffness
for that element is given in Appendix F. The area moment of inertia, I, can be
calculated using the relationships shown in Appendix G:
The stiffness coefﬁcient of the horizontal rod element (Equation 6.17) at the
top of the crab-leg suspension is:

The rod has a signiﬁcantly higher stiffness than the beam element. The
combination of these two stiffnesses is in series and can be calculated as shown
next. Because Krod is so much stiffer than Kbeam, Ktotal is essentially Kbeam. Stiffness
is a measure of the force per deﬂection; therefore, an axial rod requires signiﬁ-
cantly more force to obtain the same deﬂection as that which can be obtained
via beam bending.
Example 6.2
Problem: An object is supported by two beams with ﬁxed–ﬁxed boundary con-
ditions and deﬂected in the lateral direction as shown in Figure 6.20. Find the
total spring constant for this suspension.
Solution: The support beams in this situation are connected in parallel
because they have the same deﬂection and the force split between them. There-
fore, the total spring constant of this suspension is simply the sum of the two
individual stiffnesses:

6.2 DAMPING
Damping refers to energy dissipation from a mechanical system. The effect of
damping is to remove energy from the system; this can be accomplished by
dissipation into heat energy. The exact mechanism of damping can take many
forms, such as the heating of metal under repeated mechanical deformation; the
radiation of sound when a structural object (a plate) is struck; or the aerodynamic
drag on a moving automobile or airplane. MEMS devices also experience damp-
ing, which is mainly due to two sources:
•
Structural damping. This form of damping or energy dissipation is due
to an energy loss mechanism internal to the material. For large-ampli-
tude, cyclic motion of a structural material, signiﬁcant heat generation
can become apparent. However, for low-amplitude oscillation of a
structural member, such as may occur in a vibratory MEMS gyroscope,
this form of damping is very small.

•
Fluidic damping. For MEMS devices, this form of damping is more
signiﬁcant and frequently needs to be considered in design. This damp-
ing is due to the cyclic motion of a structure with a gaseous and possibly
liquid environment.
6.2.1 OSCILLATORY MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND DAMPING
A dynamic mechanical system such as a spring-mass-damper can be mathe-
matically described by a second-order differential equation (Equation 6.39).
This equation has three force terms plus the external applied force, f(t). The
inertial force, Fm, is the mass–acceleration product related to the kinetic energy
of the system. The stiffness force, Fk, is the stiffness–deﬂection product due to
the elastic deformation. Elastic deformation produces the potential energy of
the system. During oscillatory motion, energy oscillates between kinetic and
potential energy. Energy is input to the system via the external applied force,
f(t). Energy is lost from the system via damping. The damping force, Fd, is the
product of the damping coefﬁcient and velocity, which is a linear viscous model
of the damping. There are other damping models, such as Coulomb damping,
but the linear viscous damping model is frequently used because it is readily
analyzed mathematically. 
(6.39)
The energy dissipated by damping, Wd, during oscillatory motion can be
expressed by the path integral of the damping, Fd, over the displacement path,
x, as shown in Equation 6.40. The force–displacement relationship expressed
by Equation 6.40 can be illustrated by Figure 6.21, which shows a hysteresis
loop. This loop is indicative of a dissipative system. The area of the hysteresis
loop is proportional to the energy lost per cycle by the system. The exact
force–displacement relationship may vary greatly due to the type of damping
mechanism involved.
(6.40)
The mass (m), stiffness (k), and damping (c) coefﬁcients by themselves do
not lend signiﬁcant physical insight to the system response. However, a second-
order system such as Equation 6.39 can be transformed into modal coordinates
(Equation 6.41) by normalizing with respect to the mass and deﬁning two vari-
ables known as the natural frequency, ωn, and damping ratio, ζ (Equation 6.42
and Equation 6.43, respectively) [10,11]. An alternative metric for system damp-
ing is the quality factor, Q, which is related to the damping ratio by Equation 6.44.

The maximum system response, x, will be obtained if the system is excited
with an oscillatory force at the natural frequency (e.g., f sin[wnt]). This condition
is known as resonance. If the system has no damping (c and ζ are zero), the
response at resonance is mathematically inﬁnite; however, every system contains
at least some small amount of damping, which will limit the response. At reso-
nance, the kinetic and potential energy of the system are equal and the system
energy is oscillating in form between kinetic and potential energy.
The damping ratio, ζ, is any positive real number. The damping ratio directly
controls the nature of the system response as illustrated in Figure 6.22. Figure
6.22 shows the response for a spring–mass–damper system that is displaced and
released. For values of the damping ratio 0 ≤ ζ < 1, the system has an oscillatory

response. At ζ = 0, the system is undamped with no dissipation; this allows the
amplitude of oscillation never to decrease. As ζ increases toward 1, the damping
increases, thus causing the oscillations to decay in amplitude; at ζ ≥ 1, the system
response is not oscillatory. ζ = 1 is called critical damping because it is the
transition between oscillatory and decaying non-oscillatory motion.
The system damping also controls the amplitude of the response when excited
at resonance. Figure 6.23 is a plot of the normalized response vs. normalized
frequency for the second-order system (e.g., mass–damper–spring system). The
system response is normalized to the system response at zero frequency (i.e.,
static response), x0. The normalized system response is referred to as the ampli-
ﬁcation factor, M. The excitation frequency is normalized to the system natural
frequency to deﬁne the frequency ratio, r. Resonance occurs when r = ω/ωn = 1.
As can be seen from Figure 6.23, the system damping controls the amplitude at
resonance and the width of the normalized response curve at resonance. The
ampliﬁcation factor, at resonance, Mmax, is Q. 
The width of the normalized response curve at what is known as the half-
power point is also directly correlated to the system damping. Because power is
proportional to the amplitude squared, X2 ∝ M2, the half-power point is deﬁned
as 
. If the system has very little damping, its response peak is very tall
and narrow. For large amounts of damping, the peak is not much greater than
unity and very broad. From this curve, it is evident that Q is the ampliﬁcation of
system response at resonance.

6.2.2 DAMPING MECHANISMS
Many MEMS devices involve an oscillating structure to implement a sensing
methodology. In order to induce the oscillatory response of the MEMS device,
the structure is electrostatically actuated in a controlled atmosphere and pressure
environment. Zook et al. [12] studied the response of polysilicon resonant micro-
beams and showed that the system Q, vs. environmental pressure, P, had three
response regimes (Figure 6.24). Regime I has the maximum Q attainable at very
low pressure. The damping in regime I is extremely low and due primarily to the
resonator material damping. In regime II, the pressure is still low; the gas mol-
ecules are not interacting with each other. Damping occurs by momentum transfer
between gas molecules and the vibrating beam. Q is a function of pressure in
regime II. At the higher pressures attained in regime III, the gas molecules interact
and exert a viscous drag force on the vibrating beam.
The spaces between structures, walls, and substrate for MEMS devices can
be as small as 1 or 2 µm. The development of damping models suitable for such
applications may involve the utilization of ﬂuid mechanics theory developed for
macroscale applications. This will bring into question the appropriateness of
continuum-based ﬂuid theories for use in MEMS applications. Continuum theo-

ries assume that, in any analysis domain, a large number of atoms is present that
use continuous partial differential equations to describe the relevant physics vs.
the discrete dynamic interactions of individual molecules.
An appropriate metric to assess this situation is the mean free path, λ, of the
gas surrounding the MEMS device; this is the distance that a molecule travels
before it collides with another molecule. Collisions are the primary momentum
transfer mechanism of gases. These collisions will give rise to energy dissipation
on the surface of a moving MEMS device. If a molecule of diameter, d, travels
within a distance, d, of another molecule of the same type, a collision will occur.
Therefore, the collision cross-section of the molecule is πd2. For molecules such
as N2 and O2, d ≈ 3 Å is a good estimate. The probability of collision, P, within
a distance, D, of a volume containing a molecular density (molecules/volume),
n, is given by:
(6.45)
If the probability of a collision within a distance λ is 1, an estimate of the
mean free path is approximately given by:

A more statistically accurate estimate of the mean free path, λ, is given by:
(6.47)
The molecular density, n, may be calculated from the ideal gas law:
(6.48)
Combining equations yields the mean free path for an ideal gas equation,
where p is pressure; kB = 1.38 × 10–23 J/K; and T is absolute temperature:
(6.49)
Example 6.3
Problem: (a) Plot the mean free path, λ, for N2 at T = 300°K for pressure, p,
varying from 50 mtorr to 1 atm pressure (760 torr). (b) What is λ at atmospheric
pressure? (c) What is λ at 0.050 torr? (d) At what pressure is λ = 2 µm? 
Solution: (a) Figure 6.25 is a plot of the mean free path vs. pressure obtained
via evaluation of Equation 6.49; d was taken to be approximately 3Å for N2. (b)
At atmospheric pressure (760 torr), the mean free path in N2 is 102 nm. (c) At a
pressure of 50 mtorr, the mean free path in N2 is 1554 µm. (d) The mean free
path is λ = 2 µm in N2 when the pressure is 38.8 torr.
6.2.3 VISCOUS DAMPING
Gas damping is the source of most MEMS damping and it is a strong function
of viscosity. The absolute viscosity µ of a ﬂuid or gas is a measure of the
resistance to ﬂow. The absolute viscosity, µ, is the ratio of the shear stress, τ,
between ﬂow layers to the velocity gradient, dv/dy, through the ﬂuid channel
(Equation 6.50). The ﬂow ﬁeld for this situation has the ﬂuid ﬁxed to the surface
of both plates with a linear velocity proﬁle between the plates as illustrated in
Figure 6.26. The kinematic viscosity, ν, is the absolute viscosity scaled by the
density, ρ, of the ﬂuid. This parameter is called kinematic because the units are
length2 per time.

The nature of viscosity of a liquid and a gas are different. Viscosity in liquid
results from cohesion between adjacent molecules, but viscosity in a gas results
from intermolecular collisions within the gas. Because the molecular collision
rate depends on temperature in a gas, viscosity increases as temperature is
increased; however, it is unaffected by pressure change in most macroscale
engineering problems.

Boltzmann [13] calculated the viscosity coefﬁcient (Equation 6.52), utilizing
the concept of these intermolecular collisions, where 
 is the average velocity
of the gas molecules. In an ideal gas, the density mean free path product, ρλ, is
constant (Equation 6.47); therefore, viscosity is constant with respect to pressure. 
(6.52)
However, when the distance between the plates become comparable to the
mean free path, d ≈ λ, the viscosity becomes sensitive to pressure variation. In
this situation, molecular collisions rarely occur within the gas layer; momentum
is directly transferred between the gas molecules and the MEMS surface, yielding
a pressure-dependent viscosity. For example, Andrews et al. [17] showed that the
effective viscosity of a 2-µm thick nitrogen ﬁlm remained approximately constant
at 1.56 × 10–5 kg/m/s near atmospheric pressure (760 torr) and 20°C, but dropped
as pressure was decreased (e.g., 7.4 × 10–6 kg/m/s at 130 torr decreased to 7.4 ×
10–5 kg/m/s at 13 torr).
At extremely low pressure and very narrow gaps, the viscosity becomes
proportional to pressure and plate separation.
6.2.4 DAMPING MODELS
There are two frequently encountered conﬁgurations of moving MEMS surfaces
interacting with a viscous gas ﬂow that produce energy dissipation, which give
rise to damping (Figure 6.27). Squeeze ﬁlm damping occurs when the relative
motion between two surfaces is perpendicular to the plane of the surfaces. This
situation requires that gas between the plates be pushed (pumped) in and out of
the gap between the plates. The other conﬁguration is slide ﬁlm damping, in
which two surfaces are moving parallel to each other, shearing the ﬂuid between
the surfaces. In a real MEMS application, either or both of these conﬁgurations
can occur. Models of the damping produced in these conﬁgurations are necessary
for dynamic design of the MEMS device and estimation of the Brownian noise
produced by a sensor where these forms of damping appear.
6.2.4.1
Squeeze Film Damping Model
Squeeze ﬁlm damping occurs when the gap between the two closely spaced
parallel surfaces changes, as shown in Figure 6.27. This type of damping occurs
frequently in MEMS devices. For example, a pressure sensor diaphragm that
deﬂects relative to the ﬁxed base is an example of an instance in which squeeze
ﬁlm damping would apply. The motion of the diaphragm will force gas in or
out of the gap. References 14 through 17 model the damping caused by
squeezing the thin ﬁlms of gas using the compressible Reynolds gas-ﬁlm
equations; this means that the gap is assumed to be greater than the mean free
path of the gas.

The squeeze number, σ, shown in the next equation represents the compress-
ibility of the squeeze ﬁlm, where µ is the viscosity; L and W are the plate length
and width, respectively; P is the gas pressure; d is the ﬂuid gap; and ω is the
excitation frequency. For large plates and thin gaps, the squeeze number becomes
large; the gas is trapped between the plates due to viscous effects at the plate
edges. Conversely, a small plate with a large gap will produce a small squeeze
number, which indicates that lateral motion of the gas is easily accomplished.
The squeeze number is also proportional to the excitation frequency, ω, which
indicates that the gas will have greater difﬁculty escaping the plate gap at higher
excitation frequency.

where
(6.55)
Equation 6.42 and Equation 6.44 can be used to put the damping coefﬁcient
in terms of damping ratio or quality factor, which may be more useful metrics
in some cases. Equation 6.54 can accurately describe damping between parallel
plates when the plate dimensions (L, W) are much greater than the gas gap (d),
and the gas gap (d) is greater than the mean free path (λ) of the gas. 
Squeeze ﬁlm damping can be large and affect the dynamics and noise ﬂoor
of sensors; it can be reduced by vacuum packaging or damping holes. However,
vacuum packaging can signiﬁcantly increase the cost and manufacturing com-
plexity and any leakage in the vacuum package will be a source of long-term
drift in the sensor. Damping holes can be incorporated into the device design to
allow the gas to escape from between the plate and substrate. The etch release
holes in a surface micromachine device can also be used as a damping hole. The
damping factor of a perforated plate with damping holes of size a, arrayed with
a pitch, p, can be calculated [18] by modeling the plate as N smaller plates of
length Lp. The effective area of the idealized small plate, Lp
2, is merely the pitch
area, p2, minus the hole area, a2 (Equation 6.56). The total damping factor will
be N times the damping factor of the smaller plate.
(6.56)
For the case of narrow plate widths, edge effects represent a signiﬁcant portion
of the total damping. Hagen–Poiseulle ﬂow [19] may provide a more accurate
estimate of the damping coefﬁcient for narrow widths such as comb ﬁngers in an
electrostatic actuator. The damping coefﬁcient of a narrow width gap is given by:
(6.57)
6.2.4.2
Slide Film Damping Model
Laterally driven MEMS devices that move parallel to the substrate are frequently
encountered in many applications. Two models for viscous slide ﬁlm damping
are useful in modeling the damping of laterally driven MEMS devices: Couette
damping and Stokes damping (Figure 6.28). The differences between these two
models are the gas velocity ﬁelds used to develop the damping model. The
analysis and assumptions involved in the development of the Stokes and Couette
dampers are discussed in detail in Cho et al. [20,21]. 
The Couette damper assumes that the plate instantaneously develops a fully
established linear velocity proﬁle in the ﬂuid medium (Figure 6.28a). The velocity

gradient at the top surface of the plate is assumed to be zero; this means that the
ambient ﬂuid above the plate oscillates with the plate motion, producing a neg-
ligible amount of viscous damping.
The Stokes damper is based upon the steady state solution of the one-dimen-
sional Navier–Stokes and continuity equations that result in a one-dimensional
diffusion equation to model the situation depicted in Figure 6.28b. This results
in the plate motion propagating into the ﬂuid with rapidly diminishing amplitude
and a phase shift in the ﬂuid motion.
The quality factor generated by the Couette damper, Qcd, is given in Equation
6.58 for a plate of area, ﬂuid gap, and viscosity of A,d, µ, respectively, attached
to a spring mass system of k and m.

6.3 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DYNAMICS
The objective of this presentation of electromechanics is to provide the basis for
analysis of actuator and sensor systems, which frequently involve a coupling of
the mechanics of a structure (i.e., membrane, seismic mass, ﬂexural supports)
and an electrical system that senses the motion or provides a force for actuation.
This section will provide an overview of the terminology and key physics nec-
essary for the analysis of an electromechanical system. Table 6.3 is a list of
electrical quantities, symbols, and units discussed in this section.
The mechanics of electrical systems are described by Maxwell’s equations,
which can be written in differential or integral forms and incorporate a number
of assumptions for speciﬁc applications. An in-depth treatment of Maxwell’s
equations is a very complex subject and beyond the scope of this book. However,
a number of references can provide a variety of views on this subject. Johnk [22]
provides an in-depth theoretical treatment of Maxwell’s equations. Moon [23]
provides a link between the theoretical study of Maxwell’s equations and appli-
cations that utilize electromechanics. Smith [24] provides an introductory, very
practical application of electrical systems and electromechanics to engineering
solutions. Crandall et al. [25] present a detailed explanation of the analysis of
electromechanical systems that is very useful for the analysis of transducers such
as those utilized in MEMS applications.

6.3.1 ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS
A fundamental electrical quantity is electrical charge, q. Charge, q, is carried
on particles such as electrons or ions and its unit of measure is the coulomb.
When charge ﬂows along a path such as a metallic wire, one may speak of a
continuous ﬂow of charge called current, i. Current is the rate of ﬂow of charge
(Equation 6.61) measured in units of amperes (i.e., coulomb per second). By
convention, positive current ﬂow results from a ﬂow of positive charge in a
positive direction.
(6.61)
Coulomb’s law (Equation 6.62) describes the relationship of the force between
electrically charged particles (Figure 6.29). The two charged particles, q1 and q2,
are separated by a distance, ρ, along the unit vector, uρ. The permittivity of the
medium between the particles is ε. For free space (i.e., vacuum), the permittivity
is ε0 = 8.85 × 10–12 coulombs per newton-meter squared (farads per meter).
Coulomb’s law can be applied to many particles by a sequential application
of Equation 6.62 to every pair-wise combination and vectorially summing the
forces. This law is similar in form to the relationship for gravitational forces,
which also produce force over distance. The forces act along a line between the
particles, and the magnitude varies inversely with the square of the distance
between particles. However, Coulomb’s law can be attractive or repulsive
depending upon the sign of the charges, q1 and q2 (i.e., like charges repel, unlike
charge attract).

(6.62)
The forces produced by the electrostatic charges described by Coulomb’s
law are a vector ﬁeld, f(R). These forces are a conservative ﬁeld with the
following meaning:
•
The forces are a function of position only (i.e., f[R]).
•
The line integral of the electrostatic force ﬁeld from point RA to point
RB (Equation 6.63) is a function of the end points only and is inde-
pendent of the path taken.
(6.63)
Thus, the electrostatic forces on a reference particle at location R0 among an
array of other charges at ﬁxed locations are a function of reference particle
position only. This is a conservative ﬁeld and the potential energy per unit charge,
e(R), on the reference particle is shown in Equation 6.64. R0 is the datum
(reference point) for the integral of Equation 6.65. The potential energy per unit
charge, e(R), is also known as the electrical potential, which has units of a volt
or, alternatively, a newton-meter per coulomb. 
The change in electrical potential, ∆e or electrical potential difference, due
to moving a charge from point RA to point RB with respect to the array of other
charges is simply the difference in the electric potential at point A and point B
(Equation 6.65) because the electrostatic force ﬁeld is conservative. The choice
of the datum, R0, for the electric potential, e(R), does not inﬂuence the value of
the electrical potential difference, ∆e.
(6.64)
(6.65)
The potential energy, W, of a charge, q, in an electric ﬁeld is given by Equation
6.66 and has units of newton-meters. The datum chosen for the electrical potential
difference, e(R), does not change the potential energy.

If the charge is moving along a path from RA to RB within a time interval, dt,
the potential energy is time varying. The increase in potential energy of the charge
per unit time is power, P, which has a unit of a watt (volt-ampere).
(6.67)
Maxwell’s equations are a set of equations [22] that can be expressed in
differential or integral form involving a number of variables; the magnetic ﬁeld
density, B, and electric ﬁeld intensity, E, predominate. Mathematically, B and E
are vector ﬁelds that have magnitude, direction, and the properties previously
described for the forces produced by charges in Coulomb’s law (i.e., a function
of position, their line integral is not path dependent). 
The electric ﬁeld intensity, E, which is frequently referred to as electric ﬁeld,
is the negative of the gradient of the electric potential e in Equation 6.68. The
gradient, ∇, is a spatial rate of change operation on a scalar that produces a vector.
In the one-dimensional case, the gradient reduces to a simple differentiation.
Therefore, the electric ﬁeld, E, is the spatial rate of change of electric potential, e.
(6.68)
The electric ﬁeld intensity, E, is also the direction and magnitude of the force
on a positive charge in the electric ﬁeld (Equation 6.69), which can be obtained
from Equation 6.64 by differentiation. As illustrated in Figure 6.30, the force
produced on the charge by the electric ﬁeld is in the same direction as the electric
ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld, E, has units of newton per coulomb or volts per meter,
which is consistent with Equation 6.68 and Equation 6.69 deﬁnitions.
(6.69)
Traditionally, magnetic ﬁelds were ﬁrst described in terms of lines of force
or ﬂux. This is due to the familiar experiment that allows these magnetic lines of
force to be visualized by iron ﬁlling sprinkled on a surface in the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld produced by a permanent magnet or electromagnet. Magnetic ﬂux,
φ, is a scalar quantity (i.e., described only by magnitude) with units of webers.
However, the vector ﬁeld magnetic ﬂux density, B, utilized in Maxwell’s equations
is generally considered the primary metric to describe a magnetic ﬁeld. The
magnetic ﬂux density, B, has units of tesla or weber per meter squared and is
related to the magnetic ﬂux, φ, by Equation 6.71, which is the integration of the
magnetic ﬂux density, B, over an area, A:

A magnetic ﬁeld is due to the movement of electric charge or current. Exam-
ples of this magnetic effect are the spinning of electrons around an atom. When
these atoms are aligned, this effect is magniﬁed and produces a permanent magnet
or lodestone. The intensity of the magnetic effect is measured by the magnetic
ﬂux density, B, which is a vector deﬁning the magnitude and direction of the
force on a charge, q, moving with a velocity, v. Equation 6.71 is the mathematical
expression of the magnetic ﬁeld force, which is always perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬂux density, B, due to the cross-product (Figure 6.30):
(6.71)
The Lorentz force law equation is simply the vector sum of the forces on a
charged particle, q, due to the electric ﬁeld, E, and magnetic ﬁeld, B. These forces
are illustrated in Figure 6.30. The force due to the electric ﬁeld, E, is a function
of position of the charge and time; however, the force due to the magnetic ﬁeld,
B, is a function of position and velocity of the charge and time.
(6.72)
Faraday’s law states that voltage (electric potential e) can be induced by
motion of a conductor in a magnetic ﬁeld density or by a time-varying magnetic
ﬁeld density (Equation 6.73). Figure 6.31 shows a schematic of the line segment,

dl, area and line integrals involved in Equation 6.73. The ﬁrst term of the equation
expresses the voltage induced by a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld density, which
occurs within the closed conducting path over which the surface integral is taken.
The second term is the voltage induced in a moving conduction within a magnetic
ﬁeld. The mechanics of Faraday’s law explain the physics involved in common
devices such as electric generators, electric motors, and inductors.
(6.73)
Equation 6.74 states that a small segment of conducting wire of length dl
moving with a velocity, v, in a magnetic ﬁeld will produce an electric potential, de,
across the wire segment induced by the motion of the conductor in a magnetic ﬁeld:
(6.74)
The force generated on the conductor segment, dl, can be obtained from the
second term of the Lorentz force law (Equation 6.72) by utilizing the relationship
i dl = q v. Equation 6.74 shows the right-hand rule relationship among velocity,
magnetic ﬁeld, and electric potential, which is a result of the vector cross-product.
Current–magnetic ﬁeld–force has a similar relationship due to the vector cross-
product in Equation 6.75.

6.3.2 ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS — PASSIVE ELEMENTS
The three passive circuit elements to be discussed are a capacitor, inductor, and
resistor. These elements are considered passive because they do not contain an
energy source. The capacitor and inductor can store energy and subsequently
return that energy to the circuit. The resistor dissipates energy.
6.3.2.1
Capacitor
A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by a dielectric material (Figure
6.32). The dielectric material is an insulator that will keep electric charges apart
and prevent the charge on the two conductors from equalizing. The capacitor
is said to be uncharged when the amount of charge is the same on both con-
ductors; this will result in zero voltage across the capacitor. When the capacitor
is charged, one conductor will have acquired q units of charge and the other
will have lost q units of charge, which will produce a voltage across the terminals
of the capacitor.
The constitutive equation, which describes the relationship between the elec-
trical variables (e, q) of a capacitor, is shown in Equation 6.76. Capacitance, C,
is the proportionality variable between the electric potential across the capacitor
terminals and the charge, q, on the capacitor. The unit of capacitance is the farad
(coulomb per volt). Current ﬂowing into or out of the capacitor will change the
amount of charge on the capacitor. The capacitance, C, may be a constant for a
ﬁxed circuit element or a function of a variable such as conductor spacing or the
dielectric material property change due to an environmental variable such as
temperature, pressure, or humidity. The change in capacitance, C, can be used as
a sensing mechanism in a transducer. 
The electrical energy, W, stored on a capacitor is the work done in charging
the capacitor. The energy stored in a capacitor is stored in the electric ﬁeld. The
electrical energy, W, may be calculated by integrating the area under the electrical
potential, e, curve as a function of charge, q (Equation 6.77).

(6.77)
Alternatively, a complementary energy function, W*, may be calculated by
integrating the area under the charge q curve as a function of electrical potential, e:
(6.78)
Utilizing the constitutive equation for a capacitor (Equation 6.76), the energy
and complementary energy functions can be found:
(6.79)
The energy function, W, and complementary energy function, W*, have a
functional duality that can be seen by Equation 6.81, which differentiates W and
W* with respect to their independent variable and utilizing the capacitor consti-
tutive equation, Equation 6.76. W and W* describe the same constitutive relation
with different independent variables. The relationship (Equation 6.81) between
W and W* can readily be graphically obtained from Figure 6.32 and is called a
Legendre transformation. Dual functions of this nature are utilized frequently in
thermodynamics where enthalpy and internal energy are dual. These energy and
complementary energy functions will be employed in the development of the
governing equations of electromechanical systems, where the use of different
independent variables can be used to advantage.

(6.81)
6.3.2.2
Inductor
An inductor consists of a conducting coil of one or more loops, Figure 6.33.
When current ﬂows through an inductor, a magnetic ﬁeld is produced that sur-
rounds the coils; this is called ﬂux linkage, λ. Assuming that the magnetic ﬂux
density, B, is uniform inside the coil, the ﬂux linkage is the product of the number

of coils, N; the internal area of the coil, A; and the magnetic ﬁeld density produced
by the coil (Equation 6.82). 
The relationship between electric potential, e, and ﬂux linkage,  λ, for an
inductor (Equation 6.83) is developed from the ﬁrst term of Faraday’s law (Equa-
tion 6.73), which involves a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld. The constitutive relation
that relates ﬂux linkage and current for an inductor is shown in Equation 6.84.
The proportionality constant, L, is the inductance, which has a unit of the henry
(weber per ampere or volt-second per ampere).
(6.82)
(6.83)
(6.84)
The energy in an inductor is stored in the magnetic ﬁeld. The energy and
complementary energy for an inductor are given in Equation 6.85 and Table 6.4.
These energies are related by the Legendre transformation (Equation 6.86).

Energy Sources
Two idealizations of electrical energy sources are:
•
The ideal voltage source, which will produce a prescribed voltage, e(t),
regardless of the current requirements
•
The ideal current source, which will produce a prescribed current, i(t),
regardless of the voltage requirements
However, ideal sources cannot be realized due to the inﬁnite power required by their
deﬁnition. An example is an ideal voltage source with a resistor, R, across the
terminals. As the resistance is reduced to zero, the current requirements due to Ohm’s
law will become inﬁnite, which implies inﬁnite power. A real voltage and current
source can be modeled by inclusion of a resistance, RS, as shown in Figure 6.35. 
6.3.2.5
Circuit Interconnection
Combining the circuit elements discussed previously (resistor, capacitor, inductor,
voltage and current sources) is required to produce a working device or transducer.
This section will discuss the method of Kirchhoff’s law to combine these circuit
elements. The development of an analytical model of a transducer often will
require the combination of electrical as well as mechanical components. The
combination of electrical and mechanical components can be accomplished using
Kirchhoff’s laws and the physics of the electromechanical coupling. Chapter 7
will discuss methods for coupling electromechanical transducers utilizing the
methods of analytical mechanics (Lagrange’s equations). The discussion in this
chapter of the energy stored or dissipated in components is a prelude to that.
Two forms of Kirchhoff’s law can be used to combine circuit elements to
form an equation describing the system:
•
Kirchhoff’s current law. The algebraic sum of the currents into a node
at any instant is zero. Figure 6.36 is a circuit with a junction or node
shown in which current 
 can ﬂow in or out.

Substituting Equation 6.92 into Equation 6.91 yields the following system
equation in which es, C, and R are speciﬁed variables and q1 is the unknown
variable to be solved for:
(6.93)
(b) Application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the two loops shown in
Figure 6.36 yields the following two equations:
(6.94)
This method results in two equations and two unknowns (q2,q3) in terms of the
speciﬁed variables es, C, and R.
(c) Kirchhoff’s current law resulted in one ﬁrst-order differential equation in
terms of q1. However, Kirchhoff’s voltage law results in two equations: a ﬁrst-
order differential equation in terms of q3 and an algebraic equation in terms of
q2. The reason for this discrepancy is that only one independent node is in this
circuit, but two independent loops are. For more complex circuits, a judicious
choice of approach (i.e., voltage law vs. current law) can be important to result
in a smaller number of equations to describe the system.

7 Modeling and Design
This chapter will discuss a number of topics relating to modeling and simulation
of MEMS devices. As a design progresses from concept to a fully mature product,
the modeling and simulation needs change. In the early stages of transitioning a
design from a concept in the designer’s imagination to an initial design layout
of the device, the modeling and simulation requirements are different from those
for perfecting the operation of an existing MEMS device design. 
The concept to ﬁrst design phase is design synthesis, which requires informa-
tion of what design parameters are important, how they interact with each other,
and the sensitivity of the device performance metric to the design variables. This
type of information can most easily be obtained from an analytical model or low-
order lumped parameter models of the device. In these types of models, the design
variables of interest are frequently explicit and a large number of calculations to
determine variable relationships and sensitivities can be easily performed.
The detailed design analysis of existing MEMS design to further optimize
performance may require high-order numerical analysis calculations. For exam-
ple, the analysis of a MEMS support anchor to determine dissipation losses to
the substrate, which is important for a resonant device, will require a detailed
solid model of the anchor–substrate region. This type of modeling is not feasible
with design synthesis approaches and requires a large-order solid model of
detailed effects such as material damping and hysteresis. 
7.1 DESIGN SYNTHESIS MODELING
The challenge of design synthesis modeling is to capture as succinctly as possible
the fundamental physics of a device. The method most frequently taught in
undergraduate engineering courses is the use of Newtonian mechanics, free-body
diagrams to develop the governing equations of a device, and lumped parameter
circuit models. As anyone who has survived these courses knows, there is plenty
of room for error. The main roadblock is maintaining correct signs for variables
and dealing with multiple interacting bodies and systems.
Analytical mechanics [1–6] is an alternative approach for the development
of the equations of motion for a system based on the minimization of the energy
functions of the system. Hamilton’s and Lagrange’s equations are two alternative
formulations of this approach. Lagrange’s equations will be presented here as
well as MATLAB-based functions [7] (Sections H.1 and H.2 in Appendix H)

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
to aid in the required computations. These functions require MATLAB and the
Symbolic Math Toolbox.
7.2 LAGRANGE’S EQUATIONS
Lagrange’s equations are the differential equations of motions of a device
expressed in terms of generalized coordinates, which are a set of coordinates that
completely describes the system dynamics. Generalized coordinates are not
unique for a system and can be deﬁned in several ways. They can be quantities
such as angles, linear displacements, voltages, or electric charges, depending on
the physical system that is to be modeled. Generalized coordinates will be denoted
by qk (k = 1,2,…n), where n is the number of generalized coordinates. The
minimum number of independent generalized coordinates required to describe
the dynamics of a system fully is referred to as the system degree of freedom
(DOF), N. 
Figure 7.1 shows a diagram of a simple pendulum that has 1 DOF, with
alternative expressions for the generalized coordinates that could be used to
describe the system. The most direct and simple choice for the system generalized
coordinate is θ. X could be used for the generalized coordinate, but the resulting
equation would be not as meaningful. X and Y can be used as generalized
coordinates, but they are not independent and a method for dealing with the
constraint equation relating them (r2 = X2 + Y2) needs to be developed.
A basic version of Lagrange’s equations can be derived from the principle that
the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a conservative system is constant:
d(T + U) = 0
(7.1)
FIGURE 7.1 Pendulum with alternative choices of generalized coordinates.

Modeling and Design
245
The kinetic energy, T, is a function of the generalized coordinates, qi, and the
generalized velocities, 
The potential energy, U, is a function only of the gen-
eralized coordinates, qi. Table 7.1 provides a deﬁnition of the kinetic and potential
energy functions for lumped parameter mechanical and electrical systems.
Taking the differential of T and U, the invariance of the sum of the kinetic
and potential energies becomes 
(7.2)
If the N generalized coordinates are independent of one another, dqi is arbi-
trary and the preceding equation will be satisﬁed only if the term in brackets
equals 0. Equation 7.3 is Lagrange’s equation for a conservative system with no
nonpotential forces or constraints expressed with the generalized coordinates.
Friction forces and externally applied forces are examples of nonpotential forces.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
Nonpotential forces can be included in the formulation of Lagrange’s equa-
tions by the addition of the work of the nonpotential forces into the system total
energy expression of Equation 7.1. This results in Equation 7.4, where Qi is a
generalized force or moment acting over an inﬁnitesimal displacement of the
generalized coordinate, qi:
(7.4)
Mathematically proceeding as before to ﬁnd an expression of Lagrange’s
equations that includes the nonpotential forces results in:
(7.5)
7.2.1 LAGRANGE’S EQUATIONS WITH NONPOTENTIAL FORCES
Viscous damping is a nonconservative force frequently arising in system modeling
of devices that deserves special attention. If the damping forces are proportional
to the generalized velocities, it is possible to devise a function, the Raleigh
dissipation function, D (Equation 7.6), where the proportionality constant, crs, is
the viscous damping coefﬁcient. 
(7.6)
From this deﬁnition of D, it is obvious that the viscous damping force is
merely a constant viscous damping coefﬁcient multiplied by the generalized
velocity:
(7.7)
If the nonpotential forces, Qi, in Equation 7.5 are separated into externally
applied nonpotential forces and dissipative forces, Lagrange’s equations can be
rewritten as

At this point, a form of Lagrange’s equations, Equation 7.8, can be used to
model a device for which a kinetic energy function (T); a potential energy function
(U); a Raleigh dissipation function (D); and the nonpotential applied forces, Qi,
can be written in terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities
 This
is a frequently used form of Lagrange’s equations.
7.2.2 LAGRANGE’S EQUATIONS WITH EQUATIONS
OF CONSTRAINT
One additional modiﬁcation of Lagrange’s equations may be useful in situations
when deﬁning the number of generalized coordinates, n, to be equal to the system
degree of freedom, N, cannot be easily accomplished, or it is deemed advanta-
geous to deal with an excess of generalized coordinates (n > N > M). To utilize
this approach, M number of constraint equations (Equation 7.9) need to be deﬁned
and Lagrange’s equations modiﬁed to account for the additional variables neces-
sary to satisfy the constraints. 
(7.9)
To have a uniquely solvable set of equations deﬁning the system, the number
of generalized coordinates, constraint equations, and system degrees of freedom
will have the following relationship:
n – M = N
(7.10)
If N + M generalized coordinates are identiﬁed for use with the Lagrange
equation formulation of a system with N degrees of freedom, this means that M
equations of constraint must be involved in the formulation so that all of the N
+ M variables can be uniquely found. The result of having constraints between
the generalized coordinates of the equations modeling any physical system will
result in M constraint forces, 
which are needed to enforce the constraint
conditions (Equation 7.9) upon the system.
(7.11)
This additional constraint force term in Lagrange’s equations is developed
via the Lagrange multiplier method, which results in new variables, Lagrange
multipliers, λl 1 = 1,…,M.

The new formulation of Lagrange’s equations contains all the capabilities
previously developed plus the ability to handle constraints among the generalized
coordinates. The resulting system of equations that model the system dynamics
are the n Lagrange equations, Equation 7.13, and the m constraint equations,
Equation 7.14. The variables to be solved to determine system dynamics are the
n generalized coordinates, qi, and the m Lagrange multipliers, λl.

7.2.3 USE OF LAGRANGE’S EQUATIONS TO OBTAIN LUMPED
PARAMETER GOVERNING EQUATIONS OF SYSTEMS
This section will provide several examples using Lagrange’s equations to obtain
the governing equations. This approach is quite useful in obtaining design syn-
thesis models. The examples include electrical and mechanical systems by them-
selves as well as coupled electromechanical systems involving electrostatics or
electromagnetics.
Example 7.1: One Degree of Freedom Mechanical and 
Electrical System Modeling
Problem: (a) Figure 7.2 shows an idealization of a one DOF mechanical system.
This description could describe MEMS devices such as a mechanical accelerom-
eters or resonators. Find the equations of motion for this system using Lagrange’s
equations. (b) Figure 7.3 shows a schematic of an RLC circuit. Find the equations
of motion for this system using Lagrange’s equations. 
Solution: (a) The obvious generalized coordinate that will describe this one
DOF system is the displacement of the mass, M, which is designated as x. The
mechanical elements in this model are the mass, M, stiffness of the suspension,

K, damping, C, and an applied force, F, which could be generated by electrostatics,
inertia effects, or electromagnetics depending on the speciﬁcs of the application.
For this simple system, the equations of motion could be easily generated by
application of Newton’s laws, but to illustrate the use of Lagrange’s equations,
the following function can be deﬁned. (Table 7.1 provides the energy functions
for a translational mechanical system.)
Kinetic energy: 
Potential energy: 
Raleigh dissipation function: 
Virtual work function: W = F δx
Applying Lagrange’s equations (Equation 7.13) will result in the classic
second-order oscillator differential equation, shown in Equation 7.15. Section
H.3 in Appendix H shows the MATLAB commands that will call the function
LagEqn.m to perform the computations to obtain the equations of motion. The
ﬁle xcel1.m deﬁnes the symbolic variables, generalized coordinates, and energy
functions (T, U, D, W) that will obtain the lumped parameter equations of motion
for this system. (Note: in the context of the data for the function LagEqn.m, if x
is the generalized coordinate, Dx is
Because this is a one DOF system and
one generalized coordinate, x, is deﬁned, no constraint equations are involved in
this application of Lagrange’s equations.

(b) Lagrange’s equations can also be used to obtain the equations of motion
of an electrical system as well as combinations of mechanical and electrical
systems. To obtain the equations of motion of the simple RLC (resistance, induc-

Once again, there are no equations of constraint because this is a one degree
of freedom system and one generalized coordinate (Q) is deﬁned. This electrical
analogy of the mechanical system also produces a governing equation that is a
second-order oscillator. 
(7.16)
The governing equations of either of these systems could have been just as
easily obtained by application of Newton’s laws for the mechanical system or
Kirchoff’s laws for the electrical system. However, Lagrange’s equation excels
in situations with multiple degrees of freedom, combined physical domains, or
constraints. In subsequent examples, it will be shown that, in general, it is easier
to obtain the energy functions necessary for application of Lagrange’s equations
than for other approaches.
Example 7.2: Multibody Mechanical Resonator
Problem: Figure 7.4 shows a schematic of a two-body mechanical oscillator. A
device such as this could be used in applications for MEMS actuation, inertial
sensing, or mechanical ﬁlters. Figure 7.5 shows a surface micromachine (SUM-
MiT™ [Sandia ultraplanar multilevel MEMS technology]) realization of a two-
body MEMS device designed as a secondary mass drive for use in inertial sensing
applications [8]. The mass, Mx, has bidirectional parallel-plate actuators. Because
the mass, Mx, will move very little due to parallel-plate actuation and the method
of operation [8], ignore damping on Mx, but include damping effects on mass,
My. Find the equations of motion for this system using Lagrange’s equations.

Solution: This example involves the motion of two masses supported and
coupled by a number of springs with stiffness speciﬁed by Kx and Ky. The
generalized coordinates for this two DOF problem are speciﬁed by x and y. Once
again, the energy functions for this application need to be speciﬁed. The speci-
ﬁcation of the energy functions requires only that the total potential kinetic energy

of the system be deﬁned, rather than the explicit deﬁnition of the interconnection
forces required for use of Newton laws. For example, the deﬁnition of the potential
energy, U, of the four springs with spring constant, Ky, that connect Mx and My
requires recognition of the fact that the potential energy for these elements is a
function of the difference in displacement of each end of the spring. The difference
in displacement may be expressed as (x – y) or (y – x) because this term is squared
and has no effect on the potential energy. Also, the total potential energy of the
four Kx or Ky springs is represented by the appropriate multiplier in the potential
energy term.

Application of Lagrange’s equations to these functions results in the following
equations of motion for this device. These equations can be solved to ﬁnd the
two natural frequencies of the system. The form of these equations of motion
can be seen to be of the form of the classic dynamic or vibration absorber [9]
frequently presented in introductory controls, dynamics, and vibrations courses.

Example 7.3: Constrained Motion of a Linkage
Problem: Figure 7.6 shows a schematic of the constrained motion of a linkage
with an applied force. For this analysis, only the static deﬂection of the link due
to the applied force (i.e., kinetic energy = T = 0) is considered. One end of the
linkage bar is constrained to move in the horizontal direction. The other end is
constrained to move in the vertical direction and is connected to a spring, K.

Assume that the constrained motion of the link ends are frictionless and damping
and that gravity effects are ignored. The linkage is rigid and of length L. This
system has only one degree of freedom; however, the speciﬁcation of a general-
ized coordinate for that one degree for freedom is challenging. The options include
the rotation angle of the linkage or the linear displacement of either end of the
rigid link.
Solution: Sometimes it is desirable to develop a set of governing equations
that contain extra degrees of freedom because they are important for the system
design, easy to measure, or make the deﬁnition of the energy functions easier.
For this situation, the deﬂections at either end of the link, x and y, will be deﬁned
as the generalized coordinates. The energy functions for this example are:
(7.18)
Because the system has one DOF and two generalized coordinates are spec-
iﬁed, one constraint equation is to be deﬁned. The constraint equation, Equation
7.19, is developed from the fact that the link is rigid and this must be accounted
for as the link moves to various positions deﬁned by the generalized coordinates,
x and y. The constraint equation is an expression of the Pythagorean theorem
because the link moves in the positive directions of the generalized coordinates.

Applying Lagrange’s equations for constrained motion (Equation 7.13) results
in the governing equation for the link, Equation 7.20. The system is fully
described by Equation 7.19 and Equation 7.20 and the variables x, y, and λ1. The
solution for the system deﬂections will involve the solution of constraint equation
and the two governing equations for the variables x, y, and λ1. The Lagrange
multiplier used in the formulation is λ1. The terms in the governing equation that
involve λ1 can be physically interpreted as the forces of constraint required to
enforce the constraint.
(7.20)
Equation 7.20 can be solved for the Lagrange multiplier, λ1, to yield a
relationship with the generalized coordinates, x or y. 
(7.21)
This equation can be used in conjunction with the link length constraint equa-
tion, Equation 7.19, to form an equation in terms of either generalized coordinate.
For example, Equation 7.22 is the equation that relates y to the given constants of
K, L, Ly, and F. This is a nonlinear equation that could be solved numerically for
y. A solution for the generalized coordinate, x, can be similarly obtained.
(7.22)
Equation 7.23 is a relationship between x and y and another possibility for
a generalized coordinate, θ, which can be obtained from Equation 7.21. Equa-
tion 7.23 provides a relationship between the applied force, F, and the spring
force, Ky. This shows the force multiplication advantage of this mechanism at
various angles.

Solution: The circuit in Figure 7.7 has an ideal current source and a resistor,
capacitor, and inductor in parallel. Using Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the voltage
across each circuit element will be the same. Also, noting the relationship
between voltage and ﬂux linkage, Equation 6.84, the energy functions for each
of the circuit elements can be written in terms of ﬂux linkage. This system has
one degree of freedom and the generalized coordinate will be ﬂux linkage λ.
There are no equations of constraint. The energy functions for this system are
deﬁned as:
Kinetic energy: 
Potential energy: 
Raleigh dissipation function: 
Virtual work function: W = Iδλ
Applying Lagrange’s equations produces a governing equation that is a sec-
ond-order oscillator in terms of the ﬂux linkage generalized coordinate. This is
another analogy to the translational mechanical system, Equation 7.15, and the
RLC circuit with circuit elements in series with charge as a generalized coordi-
nate, Equation 7.16.

tromechanical device, a solenoid, shown in Figure 7.8.
Solution: A solenoid is a linear electromechanical device that produces linear
motion of the mass, M, when an AC voltage, E, is applied to the circuit. The
mass is a ferromagnetic material that will change the inductance as it moves into

the coil of the inductor. Thus, the inductance, L(x), is a function of the displace-
ment of x. The inductance is a minimum when the mass is at either edge of the
coil and a maximum when the mass is fully inserted. Assume that the variation
of inductance vs. displacement of the mass into the coil is deﬁned by Equation
7.25. This deﬁnition of L(x) will have a maximum, L(x) = L0 at x = x0, and a
lower value when the mass is at either edge of the coil, x = 0 = x0. 
This system has two degrees of freedom, which can be described by the
generalized coordinates of motion of the mass, x, and charge, Q, in the electrical
circuit. An alternative choice for the electrical circuit generalized coordinate could
have been ﬂux linkage, but an equation of constraint (Kirchhoff’s voltage law to
deﬁne the voltage across the resistor) would have been necessary. The energy
functions for this system are

Using Lagrange’s equations and the energy preceding functions yields the
governing equations for the solenoid system. The solenoid is described by a pair
of coupled second-order differential equations. 
(7.26)
Using the preceding deﬁnition of L(x), the equation can be put in terms of
the inductor, L, and its derivative, 
Equation 7.27 shows that the force applied
to the mass is a function of the change in inductance and the current,

7.2.4 ANALYTICAL MECHANICS METHODS FOR
CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS
The Lagrange equation methods discussed thus far have developed lumped param-
eter governing equations for devices. A lumped parameter model is a type of
representation in which the electrical or mechanical parameter values are consid-
ered to be represented by a quantity concentrated at a location in space. The
parameters for a continuous system can vary with location. For example, a con-
tinuous model of a beam will have its displacement (y) and parameters (E, I)
varying with position within the domain of the beam. 
Analytical mechanics or energy methods can still be used to analyze these
situations. The energy functions must now be integrated over the domain to

include the parameter variations in space. Table 7.2 provides the elastic strain
energy integrals for a beam, axial rod, and torsion rod. Table 7.2 shows the energy,
U, and complementary energy, U*, formulations discussed in Chapter 6. 
A valuable technique in analytical mechanics that operates on the comple-
mentary energy function to obtain displacement of an elastic system is Cas-
tigliano’s theorem. This theorem states that if an external force, F, acts on a
member, the deﬂection in the direction the force, δF, at the point of application
is equal to the partial derivative of the strain energy with respect to the force
(Equation 7.28). Because the derivative is with respect to force, the complemen-
tary energy, U* is used. This method was used to calculate the stiffness of various
conﬁgurations of MEMS suspensions (Appendix F). This type of compact solu-
tion for elastic members is very valuable in design calculations. The following
example illustrates the use of Castigliano’s theorem.
(7.28)
Example 7.6: Application of Castigliano’s Theorem
Problem: The simply supported beam shown in Figure 7.9 has a constant cross-
section (E and I are constant). A force, F, is applied at the center of the beam.
(a) Find the deﬂection, δF, at the point of force application. (b) Find the stiffness
of the beam at the point of force application. 
Solution: (a) The moment is a function of the distance, x, along the beam as
shown in the following equations. Starting at the point x = 0 and moving to the
right, the moment is the reaction force at the left support, F/2 times the distance

now be included in the moment equation. Thus, moment is a function of distance
along the beam for two sections of the beam.

The Raleigh–Ritz method approximates the solution of a continuous system
through the use of a summation of assumed solutions. If the system variable of
interest, u(x,t), is a function of space and time, assume the solution can be
approximated by a summation of functions that are products of separate functions
of space, Φi(x) and time ai(t) as shown in Equation 7.35. Equation 7.36 shows
this summation written in matrix notation. The function Φi(x) is generally referred
to as a basis or shape function. The basis function, Φi(x), which approximates
the solution, u, within the domain of the system, must satisfy two requirements:
•
Φi(x) must satisfy the geometric boundary conditions of the system.
•
Φi(x) must be differentiable at least to the order appearing in the energy
functions.
For most situations, a number of possible basis functions can satisfy these
requirements. The number of functions that will approximate the solution to a
desired level of accuracy depends on the function selected as well as the loading
applied in the domain of the system. The Raleigh–Ritz method has transformed
the problem from an exact continuous representation of the system to an approx-
imate discrete system representation in terms of the coefﬁcient, ai. The use of
the Raleigh–Ritz method is best illustrated in the following example.
(7.35)

Example 7.7: Raleigh–Ritz Solution for a Beam
Problem: Find the deﬂection at the center of a ﬁxed–ﬁxed beam with a distributed
load, w, across the length of the beam.
Solution: Choose the basis functions as shown next. This series of basis
functions has zero deﬂection and slope at the beam ends (x= 0 and x = L), which
satisfy the geometric boundary conditions. They can be twice differentiated as
required by the beam strain energy function (see Table 7.2).

The beam displacement is approximated by the following series:

Lagrange’s equations can be used to ﬁnd the governing equations. Because
this is a static problem, the kinetic energy and Raleigh dissipation function are
zero. The Raleigh–Ritz approach has discretized the problem, and the generalized
coordinates for this problem are the basis function coefﬁcients, ai. The energy
functions for this situation are:
Potential energy: 
Virtual work function: W = wΦiδai
MATLAB and the function LagEqn were used to assist in the calculations.

equation yields the following series of equations in terms of the generalized
coordinates, ai.

This system of equations can be solved for the generalized coordinates, ai.

A comparison error of the preceding solution vs. the number of terms included
can be seen in Figure 7.10. This is a plot of the error of the displacement at the
center of the beam (x = L/2) vs. the number of terms, n, included in the
Raleigh–Ritz solution. The exact solution for this conﬁguration is shown in
Equation 7.42. The Raleigh–Ritz solution improves only on every second term
because the basis function is zero at x = L/2. As shown in Figure 7.10, the
Raleigh–Ritz solution always converges from below (i.e., exact solution displace-
ment > Raleigh–Ritz solution) because of the minimization of the system potential
energy involved in the formulation. 
The concept of approximating the solution of a continuous system with a
basis or shape function used in the Raleigh–Ritz method is an essential concept
utilized in the ﬁnite element method for numerical modeling of systems.
(7.42)
7.3 NUMERICAL MODELING
The three major categories of numerical approaches to solving engineering
mechanics problems are ﬁnite difference (FDM); ﬁnite element (FEM); and
boundary element (BEM) methods. All three of these methods utilize the follow-
ing steps:
•
They replace differential or partial differential equations with approx-
imate algebraic relationships.

•
They deﬁne a computational grid or mesh that describes the geometry
of the solution domain. The boundary conditions and responses are
calculated at these grid positions.
•
They solve the set of simultaneous algebraic equations to determine
the response at the grid points.
Figure 7.11 shows examples of the FDM, FEM, and BEM meshes. The inter-
section of the grid lines is called nodes. The FDM approach [10] approximates the
governing equation within the domain of the mesh with a ﬁnite difference approx-
imation at each node. The FDM mesh size is chosen to achieve an accurate solution.
Generally, the ﬁner the mesh is, the more accurate the solution is. An FDM mesh
is generally uniform due to the nature of the ﬁnite difference approximations.
The BEM [11] approach transforms the governing differential equations into
equivalent integral equations using calculus relationships (e.g., Gauss–Green
theorem) that contain no volume integrals involving the unknown response. This
transformation utilizes fundamental known solutions (Green’s functions).
The FEM [12] approach utilizes a subdomain or “element” in which the
governing differential equation is transformed into an equivalent integral equa-
tion. The integral equation is discretized by an interpolation function that inter-
polates the response inside the element to the nodes on the periphery of the
element. The elements are assembled to form the entire domain by ensuring that
the responses of adjacent elements at their nodes are equivalent.
Each of these approaches to numerical modeling has advantages and disad-
vantages. Issues such as the ability of model boundary conditions of complex
shapes; nonlinearities; inﬁnite boundary conditions; calculation complexity; and
user interaction to set up the problem will tend to make one approach more
frequently used in one application over another. Table 7.3 is a comparison of the
different approaches. MEMS analysis frequently requires the analysis of different
physical phenomena such as structure, electrostatics, and ﬂuidics. The FEM
approach is most frequently used, except that electrostatics that encounter inﬁnite
boundary conditions are sometime best modeled with the BEM approach. The
BEM and FEM methods can be coupled to model these multiphysics problems.
Due to space limitation, the details of the FDM and BEM methods will not be
discussed in detail. However, an example of the use of a simple, easy-to-use FEM
software that has been developed for MEMS analysis will be discussed. 
SUGAR is an open source simulation tool for MEMS [13] that has been
under development at the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC) at the
University of California for several years [14,15].The SUGAR software is built
upon MATLAB, which is frequently used for engineering analysis of various
types. SUGAR was developed for MEMS with the same philosophy that has
made simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) an essential
tool for microelectronic designers. SUGAR is not an acronym but was named
because of its duality with SPICE. SUGAR provides an environment for the
development of low-order models (design synthesis) of a MEMS device, thus
enabling the designer to explore the design space quickly.

SUGAR describes the device in a SPICE netlist type of format with the
capability to model beams, electrostatic gaps, circuit elements, and other elements
modeled by small, coupled systems of differential equations. It is capable of static
and dynamics analyses. SUGAR has been used to model a number of prototype
MEMS devices [16]. A design analysis model to examine the subtle, second-
order effects of the MEMS design is often developed as well to complement the
design synthesis model. These higher order models are generally developed using
one of a multitude of commercial packages developed for multiphysics MEMS
devices [17–19].

two elastic beam elements. The polysilicon beams have a Young’s modulus of
160 GPa and are actuated by applying voltage, Vactuate, between the beam and the
electrodes positioned at each end of the beam. The electrode length is Le. The
gap between the electrodes and the beam is 2.0 µm in the undeﬂected position. 
Solution: The displacement of node c must be able to be positioned at any
deﬂection in the range of 0 to –2 µm. If an electrode is positioned beneath node
c, the beam can only be deﬂected a fraction of the gap before the elastic-
electrostatic system would become unstable and collapse. The electrostatic insta-
bility phenomenon experienced in parallel-plate electrostatic actuation is dis-
cussed in detail in Section 8.1.1.1. Leveraged bending [20] is a technique for
amplifying the displacement of an electrostatically actuated elastic member before
the system becomes unstable and collapses. A greater range of deﬂection at the
expense of higher voltage can be obtained by actuating the beam at the outer
edges of the beam as shown in Figure 7.12.
Calculate the voltage vs. displacement at node c for the leveraged bending
beam for an electrode lengths of Le = 80, 100, 200 µm.
Section H.8 through Section H.10 in Appendix H show the three ﬁles used
to implement this SUGAR analysis. Detailed deﬁnition of the SUGAR program
and functions are contained in Bindel and Garmire [21], which can be obtained
from the Web site listed in Reference 13.

Lev_bend.m (Section H.10, Appendix H): MATLAB ﬁle that loads the
netlist, deﬁnes the parameters, loops through a voltages to be applied,
and calculates the beam deﬂections
The SUGAR netlist is the starting point for most analyses. The ﬁrst line calls
summit.net, which deﬁnes the fabrication technology parameters such as material
properties, layer names, and thicknesses. This particular ﬁle has been specialized
for the SUMMiT surface micromachine technology. The SUGAR Web site proves
a few other frequently used technology ﬁles. The next statement calls stdlib.net,
which is a SUGAR-speciﬁc ﬁle that deﬁnes the functions for SUGAR. The param
statement deﬁnes the parameters, which can be changed from outside this netlist
(i.e., these parameters can be deﬁned by the MATLAB ﬁle, which runs SUGAR
and controls the program ﬂow). The beams, beam-gap, anchors, electrical
grounds, and voltage source parameters are deﬁned in the Lev_bend.net ﬁle.
Lev_bend.m is the MATLAB ﬁle that executes SUGAR. This ﬁle deﬁnes the
problem parameters and performs a loop from 0 to 200 V applied to the beam.
The solution is checked for convergence. Nonconvergence indicates that the
system has become unstable at a particular voltage and the solution loop should
be terminated.
Figure 7.13 is a node c displacement vs. voltage for three different electrode
lengths, Le. The deﬂection of a system with Le = 200 µm becomes electrostatically
unstable at approximately 35 V and 0.65 µm displacement, which does not achieve
the stated objective. As the electrode length is shortened, the stable deﬂection
range and the required voltage increase.
7.4 DESIGN UNCERTAINTY
Many MEMS devices must attain speciﬁed design metrics accurately to achieve
proper performance. For example, inertial sensors such as an accelerometer may
require the natural frequency of the suspension that deﬁnes the mechanical sen-
sitivity to be within a speciﬁed range or have a speciﬁed value as accurately as
possible. A gyroscope may require the drive mode natural frequency to be higher
and within a speciﬁed ratio of the sense mode natural frequency [22]. These are
examples of absolute and relative design metrics, respectively. For many MEMS
fabrication technologies, it is easier to attain a relative design metric (e.g.,
matched devices such as transistors in microelectronics) than an absolute design
metric. Many MEMS processes are starting to obtain process uncertainty infor-
mation [23,24]; however, the MEMS designer may need to design speciﬁc test
structures (Section 3.5) to quantify process uncertainty relevant to a particular
design. The ability of a design to meet a design metric is a function of the
tolerances of the fabrication process and the device design. 
MEMS fabrication techniques utilize a combination of deposition, patterning,
and etching techniques (Chapter 2), which can make devices with feature sizes
of ~1 µm; however, these process do not have a high relative tolerance as
compared to traditional machining processes (see Section 4.3). Relative tolerance

is deﬁned as the feature size divided by part size; this provides a measure of the
precision so that a fabrication process can produce a part of any given size. This
means that the MEMS design will need to consider and accommodate these
fabrication uncertainties to a much larger degree than macroscale design will.

tionship to the beam parameters of width, length, thickness, and Young’s modulus
(Section 6.1.5):

For the nominal parameters, the beam stiffness K = 0.2 N/m. Assume that the
RIE etch can narrow the line width up to a maximum of 0.2 µm from the nominal
line width drawn on the mask used to photolithographically pattern the material.
Solution: (a) If the RIE fabrication variation is applied to the width, w, of a
spring, what is the effect on the spring constant? 
, a stiffness variation of 10%.
(b) What is the effect on stiffness of this fabrication variation applied to the
spring length?
, a stiffness variation of 0.5%.
A variation in an aspect of fabrication, such as discussed earlier, will produce
an effect on several parameters (e.g., length, width) that will affect the design
metric (K in this case) unequally. In most real design situations, multiple uncer-
tainties are present, such as line width variations, thickness variations, and mate-
rial property variations, that will affect multiple parameters in a design (spring
width, length, thickness, material) to produce various effects in a design metric, K.
Heuristically, the preceding example would illustrate that increasing the width
of the beam to reduce the percentage of uncertainty in the width and increasing
the beam length to maintain the desired spring constant is a viable approach.
The estimation of the effects of uncertainty is a stochastic problem that may
be approximated using the partial derivative rule, Equation 7.43. This method of
uncertainty prediction is very useful when an analytical model of the design
metric, f, which can be used to calculate the partial derivative of the design metric
with respect to the design parameter, pi, is available. If the standard deviation of
the design parameters is available, Equation 7.43 will allow the prediction of the
standard deviation of the design metric.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
An alternative approach to obtain the effect on the design metric due to
parameter variations is to perform a direct statistical study. This could be accom-
plished with a detailed numerical model of the design in which a selection of
design parameter perturbations is used to propagate and obtain their effect on the
design metrics of interest. This may also be done by building the design with a
number of design parameter perturbations. These approaches are generally com-
putationally intensive and very costly in time and money; however, they are used
when analytical models of sufﬁcient complexity or accuracy cannot be obtained
and uncertainty quantiﬁcation is deemed necessary.
The implementation of these approaches to uncertainty quantiﬁcation will
require sampling of the design parameter perturbations that will be propagated
through the model or built for testing. A number of sampling techniques that will
ensure that a spectrum of variations is available for assessment exist [26,27].
Sampling technique examples include pure random, Monte Carlo, and Latin
hypercube methods of sampling. Pure random sampling consists of choosing the
samples without regard for how they are distributed. The Monte Carlo technique
will consider the distribution of the input parameters to select the samples. The
Latin hypercube uses a stratiﬁcation method to ensure full coverage of the range
of the input variables, which is often a problem with Monte Carlo sampling.
Although the quantiﬁcation of uncertainty of MEMS designs has been addressed
in a few instances [25], much more needs to be done.

8 MEMS Sensors 
and Actuators
Sensors and actuators are forms of transducers, which are devices that transform
energy from one form to another. Table 8.1 lists a number of transduction schemes,
mostly centered about mechanical and electrical transduction methods. A sensor
is an input transducer that senses an input form of energy (i.e., mechanical, thermal,
chemical, etc.) and, in most cases, transforms it to electrical energy, which facil-
itates integration into systems. Alternatively, an actuator is an output transducer
that, in most cases, transforms one form of energy into a mechanical output.
8.1 MEMS ACTUATORS
8.1.1 ELECTROSTATIC ACTUATION
Electrostatic actuation is produced by the electric ﬁeld of a capacitor. Figure 8.1
illustrates the two basic conﬁgurations of a capacitor for electrostatic actuation
of a MEMS device: the parallel plate and the interdigitated comb capacitor
conﬁgurations. The interdigitated comb capacitor is dominated by the fringe
electrostatic ﬁeld, and the parallel plate capacitor is dominated by the direct
electrostatic ﬁeld.
8.1.1.1
Parallel Plate Capacitor
The capacitance of a ﬁxed parallel plate capacitor is shown in Equation 8.1. The
parameters for a ﬁxed capacitor are constant.

For a variable parallel plate capacitor, the movable plate moves normally to
the ﬁxed plate as deﬁned by the coordinate, z (Figure 8.1). The capacitance for
the movable capacitor is

The energy, W, of a capacitor with a voltage, V, across the plates is given by
Equation 6.80; this results in Equation 8.3 for this conﬁguration:

The electrostatic force between the plates can be determined by differentiating
the energy function, W with respect to the coordinate in the direction of the force.
In essence, this is the potential energy term of Lagrange’s equation. 
(8.4)
For a parallel plate capacitor, the capacitance, Equation 8.2, is inversely
proportional to the gap between the capacitors plates and the force, Equation 8.4,
is inversely proportional to the gap between the capacitor plates squared. The
capacitance and the force of the parallel plate capacitor are highly nonlinear. As
z increases and the distance between the plates goes to zero, the electrostatic
force becomes very large. Figure 8.2 shows the nonlinear parallel plate electro-
static force as the voltage is increased. If the movable parallel plate is attached
to a spring, k, the equilibrium point for a capacitor-spring system for each voltage
can be plotted at the intersection of the spring constant and force curve, which
are marked with an “o.” However, at the point at which the electrostatic force

curve and the spring constant curve are tangent, the electrostatic instability point,
known as pull-in, occurs. At pull-in, the movable plate of the capacitor is unstable
and moves to close the gap to zero. There is no stable intermediate point.
By analyzing the pull-in phenomena more closely, it can be seen that Equa-
tion 8.5 is the force balance between the spring and the electrostatic forces
(Figure 8.3):
(8.5)
Solve Equation 8.5 for the voltage squared, V2:
(8.6)
The pull-in phenomenon will occur when the derivative of voltage with
respect to position is zero. The deﬂection, z, at which the derivative of voltage
with respect to position is zero is the deﬂection at pull-in, ZPI. This deﬂection at
pull-in is shown in Equation 8.7 and illustrated in Figure 8.2. The corresponding
voltage at which pull-in occurs, VPI, is shown in Equation 8.8. Figure 8.4 shows
the voltage vs. deﬂection curve for the parallel plate capacitor and the instability
at pull-in. Note that the deﬂection at pull-in is a function of only geometric
quantities (i.e., not a function of spring constant, area, etc.). The limited deﬂection
before electrostatic instability (pull-in) occurs is a signiﬁcant design constraint
that must be considered in the design of sensors and actuators.

Another signiﬁcant effect in design involving a variable parallel plate capac-
itor is electrostatic spring softening. This effect can be explained by using a two-
term Taylor series approximation for the electrostatic force term in Equation 8.9.
The linear term of the Taylor series is the slope of the electrostatic force vs.
deﬂection curve (Figure 8.2). The linear term, Equation 8.10, can also be viewed
as a negative electrostatic stiffness, Kes, that will cancel the elastic stiffness at
pull-in. The electrostatic spring softening can be used to soften or tune the spring
stiffness electrostatically (Equation 8.11) or the resulting natural frequency of a
design where this is critical.

uration and others are summarized in Table 8.2.

8.1.1.2
Interdigitated Comb Capacitor
The interdigitated comb variable capacitor conﬁguration is shown in Figure 8.1.
This conﬁguration consists of a movable plate inserted between two ﬁxed plates.
The direct parallel plate electrostatic force and the fringe ﬁeld force are the two
types of electrostatic forces acting upon the movable plate. The motion of the
movable plate is constrained so that motion can only be in the direction that
inserts the movable plate between the two ﬁxed plates and maintains the gaps
between them. The width of the combs is w. The capacitance of this set of
interdigitated combs is given in Equation 8.13. The “2” in Equation 8.13 is due
to the capacitance of the ﬁxed plates on either side of the movable plate.
The electrostatic force, Equation 8.14, is obtained as before by differentiating
the electrostatic energy with respect to the displacement, x. It should be noted
that because the force is not a function of displacement, this is a more controllable
force. Figure 8.5 shows a plot of the electrostatic force vs. a normalized displace-
ment for the interdigitated comb variable capacitor. The constant force contour
lines are horizontal, indicating that they are not a function of displacement. If
this variable capacitor is connected to an elastic spring, the spring and electrostatic
force lines uniquely intersect for each voltage applied. There are no electrostatic
instability phenomena for this conﬁguration.

Electrostatic Actuators
The variable capacitors discussed earlier can be used for actuation or for sensing.
Figure 8.6 shows an actuator implemented with interdigitated combs. Because
electrostatics is only attractive, there are combs to actuate in both directions (i.e.,
positive and negative). The interdigitated comb actuator shown has a stroke of
17 µM in both directions with approximately a 25-µN force. The folded spring
suspension allows motion in the comb meshing direction, but prevents the combs
from moving laterally due to the parallel plate force of the comb ﬁngers. The

parallel plate electrostatic forces are more powerful than the fringe ﬁeld electro-
static forces of the combs. The actuation speed capabilities of electrostatic actu-
ators are very high and limited only by the natural frequency of the suspension
and the electrical time constant of the system. 
In addition, the electrostatic force that will cause the combs to mesh and
unmesh — the electrostatic ﬁeld in the normal to the substrate direction — should
be considered (Figure 8.7). The surface underneath the ﬁxed and suspended combs
acts as a ground plane that produces an asymmetric electrostatic ﬁeld. The
asymmetric ﬁeld has more lines terminating on the upper surface of the suspended
comb than the bottom surface, thus resulting in a levitation force pulling the
suspended combs in the vertical direction [1,2]. For actuation that needs to be
very precise, such as a vibratory gyroscope, this results in a wobble that must be
minimized. For sensing, this will result in an offset requiring calibration.
The fundamental design trade-off for electrostatic actuation is the choice
between parallel plate vs. interdigitated comb approaches. Parallel plate actuation
can provide very high forces (~100 µN) with small stroke (~3 µm), but the force
is highly nonlinear with instability within the displacement range. Interdigitated
comb actuation provides a moderate level of force (~10 µN) with large strokes
(~20 µm) with a very controllable force (i.e., no instabilities). In reality, both of
these two types of electrostatic actuation are present in some degree in all
realizable actuators.

A number of very innovative approaches to electrostatic actuator design have
been and will continue to be developed in order to attain speciﬁc performance
metrics for various applications. For example, Figure 8.8 [3] shows an array of
parallel plate electrodes utilized to attain high force, coupled with a compliant
mechanism consisting of ﬂexures to implement a leverage system to attain the

concept of using an electrostatic actuator with limited stroke coupled with a
displacement multiplying mechanism [4]. The displacement multiplying mecha-
nisms illustrated by these two examples are compliant mechanisms, which avoid
the use of discrete joints with rubbing surface through the use of ﬂexures. These

mechanisms can be designed via the use of structural and topology optimization
methods [4] or via approximation methods that enable the use of traditional
mechanism design techniques [5].
Another approach to actuator development is through the use of an inchworm
type of electrostatically actuated mechanism [6,7] that couples the electrostatic
forces and incremental motion via elastic ﬂexing of a large electrostatic area
plate. Different embodiments of this class of actuator are known as the shufﬂe
motor [6] and the scratch drive actuator [7]. They are capable of high-force and
large-scale motion with small step sizes within a very compact form factor. Figure
8.10 schematically shows the operation of a scratch drive actuator capable of
small step sizes (~30 nm). This actuator operates by electrostatically ﬂexing a
plate that rotates a bushing, enabling the plate to move forward when the elec-
trostatic force is released. Figure 8.11 shows several scratch drive actuators
fabricated in a surface micromachine process. 
The pull-in instability of parallel plate electrostatics is a signiﬁcant constraint
limiting the stable actuation range that electrostatic actuator designers have
attempted to overcome. Stable repeatable actuation (positioning) throughout the
operational range is required for devices such as analog optical mirrors. Several
approaches have been explored to alleviate this situation, including: 
•
Passive circuit components. The inclusion of a ﬁxed capacitor in series
with the variable capacitor has been proposed [8]. The additional capac-
itor has the effect of extending the effective gap of the actuator and its
stable range of operation. Parasitic capacitance is an issue, but the
stable range of actuation can be extended [9]. The size of the additional
capacitor is a complicating factor in actuator design. The use of an
inductor to create a tuned LC circuit has also been proposed [10];
however, the practical use of an inductor severely limits this approach.
•
Closed loop control. The use of closed loop control has been proposed
and a switched capacitor implementation has been simulated [11] but

not demonstrated. This approach required an integrated electronics and
MEMS fabrication process to implement. The utilization of this
approach is very complicated and difﬁcult.
•
Leveraged bending. Leveraged bending [12] (Figure 8.12) is a simple
technique to implement and has been demonstrated. This technique
electrostatically actuates a beam close to its anchor and utilizes the
leverage of the beam length to obtain the actuation deﬂection at another
position on the beam. The stable deﬂection is obtained at the expense
of greater beam length and actuation voltage.

8.1.2 THERMAL ACTUATION
Thermal actuation uses the thermal expansion of materials (solid, liquid, gas) to
achieve mechanical actuation. The thermal expansion of a solid material is charac-
terized by coefﬁcient of thermal expansion (CTE), αT. Equation 8.15 states that the
mechanical strain, ε, of a material is directly proportional to the temperature change,
∆T, where the proportionality constant αT is the CTE. The CTE for a material has
units of strain per change in temperature (1/°C). The CTE of a material is frequently
a function of temperature, generally increasing with required temperature.
(8.15)
Example 8.1
Problem: A 100-µm long beam is anchored to the substrate at both ends. The
temperature of the beam is raised by 300°C. The beam is 2.5 µm thick by 4 µm
wide and is made of polysilicon (assume E = 160 GPa and αT = 2.5 micro-
strain/°C). (a) Calculate the stress and strain in the beam. (b) Calculate the force
and displacement produced in the beam. (c) Is buckling a concern for this beam?
Solution: (a) ε = αT ∆T = (2.5 × 10–6 °C–1) (300°C) = 750 µ-strain
σ = E αT ∆T = (1.6 × 1011 Pa) (2.5 × 10–6 °C–1) (300°C) = 120 × 106 Pa
(b) F = A E αT ∆T
= (2.5 × 10–6 µm)(4 × 10–6 µm)(1.6 × 1011 Pa) (2.5 × 10–6 °C–1) (300°C)
= 1200 µN
∆L = L ε = (100 µm) (0.000750) = 0.075 µm
The thermal expansion of a solid produced high forces if constrained but a
low amount of stroke. Thermal actuator design based on thermal expansion must
be careful of “parasitic strains” in such things as anchors, which may easily negate
the thermal strain. To achieve more change in length (stroke), a longer length
beam is necessary, but as length is increased, buckling may occur. 
(c) The Euler column formula for the buckling of a beam is given by Equation
6.38. The beam can deﬂect laterally in two directions, but will fail due to buckling
in the direction with the minimum area moment of inertia, I.
I = w t3/12 = (4 × 10–6 µm) (2.5 × 10–6 µm)3/12 = 5.21 × 10–24 µm4
The force at which buckling can occur is calculated by the following Euler
column formula. Buckling is very sensitive to the end conditions of the column.
Table 6.2 lists the end condition constants for various column end conditions.
The end condition constant, C, for a clamped–clamped beam is chosen to be 1.2.
C = 4 would generally be too high because a clamped–clamped boundary con-

dition is very difﬁcult to achieve in practice. The low end condition constant in
effect simulates the ﬁxed–ﬁxed boundary condition as slightly stiffer than a
pinned–pinned boundary condition. Because the force produced by thermal
expansion is greater than the critical buckling force, buckling will occur.
Fcr = C*π2*E*I/L2 = 1.2*π2*(1.6 × 1011 Pa)*(5.21 × 10–24 µm4)/
(100 × 106µm)2 = 987 µN
Mechanical actuation due to the thermal expansion of a solid material can be
accomplished by a device with two or more materials with different CTE, or by
the thermal gradients within a device made of the one material.
A bimorph utilizes the CTE mismatch of materials to achieve mechanical
deﬂection. Utilization of multiple layers of materials has also been used. The
literature contains many examples of bimorph and multilayer cantilever beam
thermal actuators [13–15]. Bimorph actuators are generally long thin beams with
layers of materials with different CTE as illustrated in Figure 6.8. The CTE
mismatch of the materials will produce a moment, M, in the beam when the
temperature of the beam is changed, ∆T. The moment in the beam is calculated
by integrating the thermal expansion forces through the thickness of the beam.
Although this type of thermal actuator has limited stroke, it has been used in
ﬂuidic control valve applications.
Figure 8.13 shows two widely used thermal actuator approaches that utilize
thermal gradients within a material to achieve mechanical actuation. The lateral
thermal actuator [16] consists of a thin hot leg and a wide cold leg; these will
create a difference in temperature due the differing current densities and ability
to transfer heat. The actuator is heated by Joule heating due to current ﬂow. The
hot leg is heated to 400 to 600°C, and the actuator will deﬂect laterally. Figure
8.14 shows an SEM image of several of the lateral thermal actuators in parallel
being used to close a latch. The hot leg–cold leg concept can be extended to
vertical actuation by stacking the hot and cold legs atop each other. The actuator
shown in Figure 8.14 is actuated by 7 to 10 V and achieves 8 µm of horizontal
motion. These actuators can only move in one direction and are not reversible
(i.e., positive vs. negative direction). 
The bent beam thermal actuator [17] utilizes a different concept to achieve
thermal actuation that is a reapplication of a structure for residual stress mea-
surement [18,19] (discussed in Section 3.5.1). The bent beam thermal actuator
is a symmetric structure consisting of a long thin beam canted at a small angle.
When Joule heating is applied to the device, the bent beam expands and produces
lateral motion. This beam is a mechanical ampliﬁer of the small deﬂection
produced by thermal expansion. The bent beam devices may be cascaded by
running in parallel as well as by using additional bent beam structures for mechan-
ical ampliﬁcation (Figure 8.15).
A thermal actuator can produce high force (>100 µN) and a displacement of
10 µm or greater utilizing only low voltage ~ 10 V. However, these actuators can
require signiﬁcant power (~100 mW). Techniques have developed to minimize

the impact of these power requirements [20]. The design of thermal actuators is
a multiphysics problem [21] requiring thermal, structural, and electrical analysis.
The heat transfer involved in a thermal analysis includes conduction and convec-
tion. Radiation heat transfer is generally not signiﬁcant. The upper practical limit
for temperature in the thermal actuator is approximately 600°C, above which
material property changes such as localized plastic yielding and material grain

growth become an issue. Thermal actuators are also generally limited to a fre-
quency response less than 1000 Hz because of the time constants associated with
heat transfer.
Thermal actuation may also be used in a ﬂuid medium. Figure 8.16 shows a
schematic of thermal actuation used to vaporize ink that will eject an ink drop.
Also, thermal actuation can be used for direct mechanical motion by thermal
expansion of a ﬂuid or change of phase of the ﬂuid.
8.1.3 LORENTZ FORCE ACTUATION
The Lorentz force is generated by a magnetic ﬁeld, B, and current, i, in a conductor
of length, L (see Figure 6.32 and Section 6.3.1). The Lorentz force, FL, is given
by Equation 8.16, where the FL, i, and B are at right angles according to the right-
hand rule implied by the cross-product. Lorentz force actuation may be applied
to MEMS devices in a number of ways, as shown in Figure 8.17.
(8.16)
Figure 8.17a shows a microvalve application [22] that is actuated by the
Lorentz force produced by the interaction of a DC current, i, and a magnetic
ﬁeld, B, created by a permanent magnet mounted adjacent to the valve. Alterna-
tively, Figure 8.17b shows the generation of a cyclic Lorentz force that utilizes
an AC current, i, interaction with a permanent magnet to produce the necessary
AC actuation for a MEMS magnetometer [23]. This AC Lorentz force actuation
scheme may also be used for a ﬂexural plate wave device [24]. The Lorentz force
in this case is used to produce a cyclic excitation force at the natural frequency
of a bar packaged in a vacuum suspended at the nodes of the ﬁrst mode of
vibration. An AC current, i, is passed through the beam and will interact with the
ambient magnetic ﬁeld to produce a cyclic Lorentz force that stimulates the beam
into resonance, which is detected, and a measure of the magnetic ﬁeld.

8.2 MEMS SENSING
8.2.1 CAPACITATIVE SENSING
Electrostatic capacitance sensing is a frequently used transduction method for
MEMS devices. MEMS fabrication techniques can readily produce parallel plate
or interdigitated comb ﬁnger capacitors in a MEMS device that can move as a
result of a physical variable (acceleration, pressure) excitation. Figure 8.18
shows schematically some variations of parallel plate and interdigitated capac-
itance structures. The relative motion of the plates can be in any direction
(vertical or horizontal).
Differential capacitors are two capacitors that share a common electrode.
Figure 8.19 shows a schematic of some differential capacitor structures, and
Figure 8.20 shows some MEMS devices that employ a differential capacitor.
Differential capacitors can be fabricated in such a manner that the two capacitors
have nearly equal capacitance in the unperturbed position and change by equal
and opposite amounts as the structure is deﬂected. The differential capacitor
structure enables differential sensing, which can cancel many adverse or common
mode effects to ﬁrst order. Changing two capacitors by the same amount is a
common mode effect to which a differential capacitor structure does not respond.
The size of the capacitors utilized in MEMS devices is small — generally a
fraction of a picofarad. The variation of the nominal capacitance to be sensed to
provide the dynamic signal of interest is in the femtofarad range or less. Also,
undesirable stray capacitances called parasitic capacitances can interfere with
capacitance sensing. Examples of parasitic capacitances may include the capac-
itance between a sense line and the substrate or the capacitance between two
sense lines. Figure 8.21 illustrates the capacitances in a MEMS accelerometer,
which include the direct capacitance, Cpp, as well as the fringe ﬁeld, Cf1, Cf2, and
parasitic capacitances, Cpl, Cpu, that exist between the upper plate, lower plate,
and the substrate.
Frequently, the magnitudes of the parasitic capacitances are greater than the
nominal and dynamic capacitance of the device, and the parasitic capacitances

may cause errors in sensing. The parasitic capacitances can be minimized by
good layout practices, shielding, and direct on-chip integration of electronics.
The parasitic capacitances will increase the overall electrical time constant of the
device and limit the frequency at which it can be electrically charged and dis-
charged; this will have an adverse effect on the sensor interface.
All of the various capacitance detection methods involve AC electrical exci-
tation of a capacitance network, which will produce a voltage or frequency shift
in the circuit that will be detected as a measure of capacitance change. In the case
of a sensor, this is a measure of a physical variable such as acceleration or pressure.
For example, a bridge circuit (Figure 8.22) can be excited by an AC voltage at a

frequency, ωc, and the output voltage of the bridge measured. The excitation
frequency or carrier frequency, ωc, is much higher than the frequency ω of the
change in capacitance caused by physical excitation. The AC excitation, Equation
8.17, combines with the capacitance change, Equation 8.18, to produce an AM
modulated signal at the output containing terms of the form of Equation 8.19.

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a multiplication of the carrier signal and the
sensor signal in which the amplitude of the AC excitation (carrier frequency) is
modiﬁed by the amplitude of a modulating signal (sensor signal). The sensor
signal can be seen as the low-frequency envelope of the high-frequency excitation
or carrier signal. A sensor that would use this type of excitation technique would
also need to demodulate the signal to obtain the sensor signal. Demodulation
methods will be discussed shortly.
(8.17)
(8.18)
(8.19)
The AC bridge shown in Figure 8.22 is not generally used by itself in MEMS
applications due to the small gain and the size of the components required.
However, two sense ampliﬁer conﬁgurations are useful for capacitance measure-
ments: a voltage buffer and the integrator. Both of these circuits use operational
ampliﬁers as part of their circuitry.
An operational ampliﬁer (Figure 8.23) is a circuit component that ampliﬁes
the difference between two input voltages to produce a single output, Equation
8.20. A few characteristics of an ideal operational ampliﬁer should be known to
facilitate circuit analysis:
•
The differential gain is very high (>105).
•
Input impedance is inﬁnite (i.e., input current is zero).
•
Output impedance is zero (i.e., acts like the output of an ideal voltage
source).
•
An operational ampliﬁer has common-mode rejection (i.e., only the
difference of V1 and V2 is ampliﬁed).

Figure 8.24 is a schematic of a voltage buffer that is sensing a differential
capacitor, CS1 and CS2. CP is a parasitic capacitance, which models capacitance
terms other than the sense capacitances. The sense capacitors have a high-fre-
quency excitation signal (carrier signal) applied to them. The frequency of the
excitation signal is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the expected
frequency content of the variable capacitances induced by the physical variable
being sensed. Because V0 is feedback to the negative or inverting input of the
operational ampliﬁer, both ampliﬁer inputs are at V0.
Equation 8.21 is an expression of the conservation of charge at the negative
operational ampliﬁer input. Rearranging terms, the voltage transfer function is
given by Equation 8.22. As can be seen from the transfer function, the gain is
limited and cannot exceed unity. Because the excitation signal, VS is multiplied
by changing capacitances, CS1, CS2, in the transfer function, the output voltage,
V0 will be amplitude modulated. The parasitic capacitance also has a direct impact
on the gain of the system. The sense capacitances are a nonlinear function of the
displacement and the parasitic capacitance is a nonlinear function of voltage,
which contributes to the distortion of the output voltage signal. 
(8.21)
(8.22)
The charge integrator is shown in Figure 8.25 and the transfer function in
Equation 8.23. The charge integrator has better linearity and distortion perfor-
mance than the voltage buffer. The parasitic capacitance does not directly appear
in the transfer function of the charge integrator or affect its gain. V0 is once again
an amplitude-modulated signal. In practical implementations of the charge inte-

to prevent leakage current buildup on CI.
(8.23)
The output voltage, V0, of the voltage buffer or the charge integrator is an
amplitude-modulated signal that needs to be demodulated to obtain the sensor
signal of interest (the capacitance change due to physical variable). A conceptually
simple method of demodulation is an envelope detector, which consists of two
components: a rectiﬁer and a low-pass ﬁlter (Figure 8.26). The rectiﬁer, which
may be implemented with a diode, will remove the positive or the negative portion
of the low-frequency envelope of the carrier signal. The low-pass ﬁlter, whose
frequency cutoff is set by the R1C1 time constant, will remove the carrier signal
and retain the analog signal of interest (Figure 8.27). The envelope detector is

simply implemented and is limited by the nonlinear effects of diode rectiﬁcation,
which may lead to distortion. Other methods of demodulation such as synchro-
nous demodulation are available, but they require more complex circuitry. Syn-
chronous demodulation involves the multiplication of the AM signal with a phase-
shifted signal at the same frequency as the carrier. The additional circuitry is
involved with obtaining the carrier signal and mixing it with the AM signal.
With the advent of switched capacitor techniques, a new method of capaci-
tance detection has arisen. Switched capacitor methods have two important advan-
tages over the conventional voltage buffer or integrator described previously. A
switched capacitor implementation depends upon the ratio of two capacitors, not
their individual values. In microelectronic fabrication methods, it is possible to
make a matched pair of anything on silicon, but it is very hard to make a
component with a precise value. Also, the frequency of a ﬁlter implemented with
the switched capacitor method can be tuned by merely changing the “clock”
frequency of the switched capacitor circuit.
A classic example of the switched capacitor technique is the implementation
of a resistor shown in Figure 8.28. A high-value resistor is expensive to implement
in microelectronics because it is large. A resistor can be implemented very simply
with two MOS switches and a capacitor using switched capacitor methods. The
switches, S1 and S2, are controlled by nonoverlapping clocks so that when S1
closes, S2 is open. With S1 closed and S2 open, the capacitor is charged. When
the switches reverse (i.e., S1 open and S2 closed), a charge, ∆q, is transferred from
V1 to V2. As this process is repeated by the cycling of the switches N times a
current ﬂow, i is established between the voltages V1 and V2 (Equation 8.24).

Recognizing that the left side of the equation is current, i, and the number
of cycles, N, per time is the clock frequency, fclk, the equation can be written as
shown in Equation 8.25. The resistance, R, simulated by the switched capacitor
technique is inversely proportional to the capacitor value, C1, and the clock
frequency, fclk. The value of the resistance can be controlled externally just by
adjusting the clock frequency. In essence, the switched capacitor resistor is a
“bucket brigade” transferring charge from V1 to V2 as dictated by the clock.
(8.24)
(8.25)
Transferring and quantifying charge is necessary for capacitative sensing.
Figure 8.29 is a schematic of an implementation of a switched capacitor integrator.
The basic topology of the circuit is the same as for the integrator discussed
previously; however, the voltage, VS, is DC and four switches operate synchro-
nously with the two nonoverlapping clocks, φ1 and φ2. The switches are imple-
mented by CMOS transistors that are turned on or off by the clock, φ1 and φ2.
The clock signals typically are externally supplied and are approximately 100
times faster than the analog signals from the sense capacitors, CS1 and CS2.
The sequence of operation of the circuit is described as follows:
•
φ1 is high and φ2 is low: S1, S2, and S4 are closed and S3 is open. V0 is
at 0 V and capacitor CI is discharged. Capacitors CS1 and CS2 are
charged by the voltage sources +VS and –VS.
•
φ1 is low and φ2 is high: S1, S 2, and S 4 are open and S 3 is closed. The
capacitors CS1 and CS2 are disconnected from the voltage sources +VS
and –VS and connected to the operational ampliﬁer. Because the oper-
ational ampliﬁer cannot input current, the charge on CS1 and CS2 are
transferred to capacitor CI
The transfer function for the operation of the switched capacitor integrator
is shown in Equation 8.26. The switched capacitor charge integrator operates by

8.2.2 PIEZORESISTIVE SENSING
8.2.2.1
Piezoresistivity
Piezoresistivity is a widely utilized phenomenon for MEMS sensors. The piezore-
sistive effect was ﬁrst discovered by Lord Kelvin [27] in 1856 when he reported
that certain metallic (iron, copper) conductors under mechanical strain exhibited
a corresponding change in electrical resistance. This is the basic operating prin-
ciple for the metal and foil strain gauges used for engineering measurements for
many years. The piezoresistive effect in single-crystal silicon and germanium was
ﬁrst reported in 1954 [28]. The discovery of the piezoresistive effect in silicon
had signiﬁcant impact in the development of MEMS for the following reasons:
•
Integration with MEMS devices and microelectronics is possible due
to material compatibility.
•
Integration of the piezoresistive material and the MEMS device allows
good transmission of strain without hysteresis or creep.

•
The piezoresistive effect in silicon is over an order of magnitude greater
than in metals.
•
MEMS fabrication processes allow good matching of resistors utilized
in the Wheatstone bridge-sensing circuits.
The resistivity, ρ, of a semiconductor expressed by the Equation 8.27 is a
function of the number of charge carriers, N, and their mobility, µ. The resistivity
of a semiconductor such as silicon can be controlled by the concentration of an
impurity that directly controls the number of charge carriers N. The addition of
boron to silicon produces a p-type semiconductor material (positive charge holes
are the majority carrier). An n-type semiconductor material (electrons are the
majority carriers) can be created by the addition of arsenic or phosphorus as the
impurities. For doping concentrations (charge carrier) varying from 1013 cm–3 to
1019 cm–3, the resistivity of silicon varies over a wide range of approximately 500
Ω-cm to 5 mΩ-cm. The carrier mobility, µ, is a function of temperature and
doping concentration. Mobility decreases with increasing temperature because
lattice vibrations caused by increased temperature scatter the electrons. In silicon,
hole mobilities are less than electron mobilities. For example, with a dopant
concentration of 2.5 × 10–16 cm–3, the electron mobility is µe ≈ 1000 cm2/Vs
compared to the hole mobility of µp ≈ 500 cm2/Vs.
(8.27)
where
ρ = resistivity (Ω-cm)
q = electron charge (1.6 × 10–19 C) 
N = number of charge carriers (cm–3)
µ = carrier (electron or hole) mobility (cm2/Vs)
The piezoresistive effect is present in single-crystal and polycrystalline semi-
conductor materials. The analysis of piezoresistive single-crystal material will be
discussed ﬁrst, followed by a discussion of piezoresistivity in polycrystalline
materials.
8.2.2.2
Piezoresistance in Single-Crystal Silicon
For single crystal silicon that has an anisotropic crystal structure of the cubic
family, the electric ﬁeld vector, {E}, is related to the current density vector, {J},
by a 3 × 3 resistivity matrix, [ρρρρ] (Equation 8.28). (Note: boldface indicate matrix
variables; {} column or row matrices; and [] square or rectangular matrices.) The
{E}, {J}, and [ρρρρ] matrix variables are direction dependent due to the anisotropic
crystal structure.

For an unstressed crystal in the cubic family such as silicon, the resistivities
along the <100> axis are identical and the off-diagonal terms of the resistivity
matrix are zero:
(8.29)
The resistivity of a piezoresistive material is a function of stress that is also
direction dependent due to the anisotropic crystal structure. Figure 8.30 shows a
unit cell of material with the deﬁnition of the direction-dependent stress, electric
ﬁeld, and current density variables. The resistivity components of a stressed
crystal can be written as the sum of the unstressed resistivity and the change in
resistivity due to stress (Equation 8.30). The stresses applied to a unit cube of
the crystal are the three normal stresses σxx, σyy, and σzz, and three shear stresses
τxy, τyz, and τxz, as illustrated in Figure 8.30. The changes in resistivity, ∆ρij, due
to stress in Equation 8.30 can be quantiﬁed by associating piezoelectric coefﬁ-
cients, πij, with every stress component (Equation 8.31). This approach produces
a large number of coefﬁcients; however, due to the symmetry of a cubic lattice,
the number of piezoelectric coefﬁcients reduces to three: π11, π12, and π44. Equa-
tion 8.32 is the relationship between the change in resistivity, ∆ρ, and stress, σ,
modeled with the coefﬁcients πij.

The piezoresistive coefﬁcients for <100> oriented silicon are shown in Table
8.3. The largest piezoresistance coefﬁcients are π11 = –102.2 × 10–11 Pa–1 for n-
type silicon and π44 = +138.1 × 10–11 Pa–1 for p-type silicon. The coefﬁcients
indicate the magnitude of the piezoresistive effect for a material. These coefﬁ-
cients are properties of a material and are affected by the temperature and doping
of the material. The coefﬁcients decrease with increasing temperature. The tem-
perature sensitivity of the piezoelectric coefﬁcients is a major concern for piezo-
electric sensors. The piezoelectric coefﬁcients will also decrease with increasing
impurity (dopant) concentrations.

Equation 8.28, Equation 8.30, and Equation 8.32 can be combined to form
Equation 8.33, which is an expression for the electric ﬁeld in a stressed cubic
crystal lattice such as silicon or germanium in the <100> orientation. The ﬁrst
term in this equation is the unstressed conduction term through the lattice; the
second is the stressed conduction (piezoelectric effect) through the lattice. The
second term is the same as the piezoelectric effect in metals such as wire or foil
strain gauges. The last two terms are the piezoelectric effect associated with a
stressed semiconductor lattice.
(8.33)
For generality, it is useful to express the piezoresistivity coefﬁcients for
arbitrary orientations. This is accomplished by deﬁning longitudinal and trans-
verse piezoresistivity coefﬁcients, πL and πT, respectively. The longitudinal coef-
ﬁcient, πL, is the case in which the stress and electric ﬁeld are applied in the same
direction. The stress and electric ﬁeld are perpendicular for the transverse piezore-
sistivity coefﬁcient, πT. Figure 8.31 illustrates the concept of longitudinal and
transverse directions for a bar of piezoelectric material that may possibly be used
as a sensor.
If a transformation can be found to rotate the axes from the <100> orientation
where the piezoelectric coefﬁcients are known (Table 8.3) to the longitudi-
nal–transverse axes, then the change in resistivity relationships, Equation 8.32,
may be written as shown in Equation 8.34. It is also noted in Equation 8.34 that

the factional changes in resistivity and resistance are the same. Equation 8.34 is
useful in calculations for piezoelectric sensor resistance changes.
(8.34)
The geometrical transformation necessary to rotate the piezoelectric coefﬁ-
cients from any orientation to the longitudinal–transverse directions is shown in
Equation 8.35. The vector (x, y, z) is the initial orientation and (L, T, z) are the
longitudinal–transverse axes. The ﬁrst two rows of the transformation matrix are
the direction cosines of the longitudinal (l1,m1,n1) and transverse (l2,m2,n2) axes
with respect to the original axes. This transformation information can be used in
Equation 8.36 and Equation 8.37 to calculate the longitudinal and transverse piezo-
electric coefﬁcients. Table 8.4 contains the longitudinal and transverse coefﬁcients
for several frequently used orientations of the longitudinal and transverse axes.

Gauge factor, G, is a term frequently used to describe the sensitivity of a
piezoresistive sensor. The gauge factor is the ratio of the fractional change in
resistance, ∆R/R and the strain, ε. The gauge factor for single-crystal silicon is
approximately 100 and the gauge factor for a metal strain gauge is around 2.
(8.38)
8.2.2.3
Piezoresistivity of Polycrystalline and 
Amorphous Silicon
Polycrystalline silicon is composed of small silicon crystals separated by grain
boundaries. Polycrystalline materials may show texture, which is a statistical
measure of the crystal orientations within the polycrystalline material. Amorphous
silicon has no crystalline structure at all. Deposition and patterning methods for
polycrystalline and amorphous silicon are well developed, and their resistivity
can be controlled by ion implantation with boron or phosphorus. The piezoelectric
properties of polysilicon have been studied and found to be a promising piezore-
sistive material for sensors [32–34]. The total resistance in a polycrystalline
material is a combination of the resistance of the grains and the resistance of the
grain boundaries. This combination of effects can have signiﬁcant impact on the
resistivity and temperature-sensitivity properties of the material.
Polysilicon and amorphous silicon have an advantage of a high gauge factor
compared to metal foil sensors; however, their gauge factors are signiﬁcantly
lower than that of single-crystal silicon and they strongly depend upon processing
parameters. Table 8.5 is a comparison of the gauge factors for various piezoelectric
materials. Piezoresistance coefﬁcients for large-grained polysilicon can approach
60 to 70% of single-crystal silicon; however, for ﬁne-grained (micromechanical)
polysilicon, πL is about seven times less than that of single-crystal silicon.
8.2.2.4
Signal Detection
A signiﬁcant advantage of piezoresistive devices is that they generally do not
require on-chip detection circuitry. Half- or full-bridge resistor bridges can pro-

vide high sensitivity and ﬁrst-order temperature compensation. Figure 8.32 shows
a schematic of a half-bridge (i.e., voltage divider) circuit that could be used for
piezoresistive signal detection. The variable resistance piezoresistor is denoted
by the resistance R(1 + δR) indicated in the ﬁgure, where δR is the fractional
change in the resistance due to strain (Equation 8.39). The output voltage for this
circuit is given in Table 8.6 as well as a two-term Taylor series expansion around
the small resistance change, δR. This equation indicates that the output voltage
will have a DC offset of Vin/2 and a small nonlinearity due to the deleted terms
from the Taylor series expansion. Neither of these attributes is desirable, but the
half-bridge circuit is discussed for comparison to the Wheatstone bridge circuits,
which can be visualized as a combination of two half-bridges.
(8.39)
Three conﬁgurations of Wheatstone bridge circuits are presented in Figure
8.33 and the output voltages of these circuits are listed in Table 8.6. The three
conﬁgurations, known as a single-active bridge, half-active bridge, and fully
active bridge, utilize one, two, and four variable resistances, respectively.

conﬁgurations have a small nonlinearity in their response. The output voltage
gain for the single active-bridge is the same as the voltage divider, but the single
active-bridge does not have an offset voltage. The half-active bridge circuit has
an improved output voltage gain, but the two variable resistors must be matched.
MEMS fabrication processes will tend to minimize the variations in the resistors.
The fully active bridge utilizes four variable resistors. Two resistors increase
resistance with increasing strain, and the other two decrease resistance with
increasing strain. By careful design in placement and orientation of the resistors,
these criteria can be met with a single-crystal silicon piezoelectric approach. The
fully active bridge has the largest output voltage gain and has a linear response.
8.2.3 ELECTRON TUNNELING
An extensive literature base exists on tunneling tip methods of transduction. The
method was initially used in the scanning tunneling microscope [38] (STM),
which has been used in material science research such as the study of atomic

scale surface structure. This method of transduction has also been used for infrared
(IR) [39–41], magnetometer [42], and accelerometer [39,43] sensors. Electron
tunneling can provide an extremely sensitive method of position transduction.
Electron tunneling is a phenomenon in which a current is passed across a
narrow gap (Figure 8.34). Classically, a gap of ﬁnite size would pose a barrier
to current ﬂow. However, for sufﬁciently small gaps (~10Å), the probabilistic
nature of quantum mechanics becomes apparent. In quantum mechanics, when
a particle comes to a barrier that it does not have enough energy to penetrate,
the wave function dies off exponentially. However, if the gap is small enough,
the wave function will predict a signiﬁcant probability of ﬁnding the particle on
the other side of the gap. Therefore, if the gap is small enough, a tunneling
current will exist even though a break has occurred in the circuit. The electron
tunneling current is described by:

where
I = tunneling current
s = gap 
Φ = height of the tunneling barrier
V = bias voltage (V << Φ)
α = conversion factor (1.025 Å–1 ev–1/2)
Typical values of Φ and s are 1 eV and 10 Å. A typical tip bias voltage, V,
is only a few 100 mV and a typical tunneling current, I, is 1 nA. Electron tunneling
is an extremely sensitive method of position transduction in which the current
can vary by a factor of three for each Å change in gap separation, s. Tass et al.
[6] reported that a change of electrode displacement of 0.003 nm resulted in a
1% change in tunneling current for a tunneling gap of 1 nm with gold electrodes
in air.
Figure 8.34 is a schematic of an electron tunneling tip transducer. The tun-
neling tip and opposing surface must be metalized with a thin layer of metal such
as 100 Å of gold, which is adequate for this purpose. The tunnel effect is not
extremely sensitive to tip geometry. One reported tunneling tip was a 50-µm
pyramid with a 1 to 5-µm radius of curvature; even a 5-µm mesa will sufﬁce.
This makes the fabrication of the tunneling tip more tractable.
Because the tunneling tip is so close to the surface of a moving mass or
membrane to be measured, the gap must be controlled by feedback during
operation. This can be accomplished by measuring the tunneling current and
applying correction signals an actuator to control the position of the tunneling
tip or the moving mass. Because the tunneling tip is small, it can be controlled
with minimal effort. 
8.2.4 SENSOR NOISE
Noise represents a fundamental limit to the performance of a sensor or a control
system. Therefore, noise is a signiﬁcant aspect of the design of MEMS sensors.

Noise in a sensor can arise from many sources, ranging from very small temper-
ature-induced vibrations of the sensor atoms to electronic noise produced by the
discrete nature of electrons. 
Noise is a random signal that requires some preliminary deﬁnitions and
metrics to facilitate further discussion. A noise signal can be described in the
time domain via plots of amplitude vs. time or in the frequency domain via plots
of amplitude or phase vs. frequency (Figure 8.35). For this discussion of noise,
frequency will be expressed in units of hertz (Hz). An important function for
noise analysis is the power spectral density function (PSD), S(f), which is a
function of frequency and has units of amplitude squared per hertz. For example,
the PSD function can be describing a voltage signal that would be a plot of V2/Hz
vs. hertz.
Alternatively, for an acceleration signal, the plot would be acceleration
squared per hertz (i.e., g2/Hz). The PSD provides an indication of how the
“power” of the signal is distributed over frequency. The term “power” is used
because the function can have units of voltage squared or displacement squared
(indicative of power) per hertz. Figure 8.35 shows the relationship between a
signal represented in time domain vs. the frequency domain via a PSD. The
detailed mathematical signal-processing techniques [44] required to make this
transition between the time domain and frequency domain are beyond the scope
of this book. 
The difference in the frequency content in the time domain signals of Figure
8.35 is apparent. A noise signal that has equal frequency content over all fre-
quencies is known as white noise; otherwise, a signal that has limited frequency
content is called band limited. As signals pass through different instruments such
as ampliﬁers, ﬁlters, actuators, or sensors, the frequency content of the signal
is altered.

The mean square of the signal, 
 can be obtained from the PSD by
integrating over frequency (Equation 8.41). The mean square of a signal is a
scalar, which is a useful metric indicative of the magnitude of the signal.
(8.41)
In noise analysis, it is often necessary to evaluate the magnitude of a noise
signal, which is a combination of several other signals. Noise signals are fre-
quently uncorrelated; this allows the sum of the mean square amplitude of the
uncorrelated signals to be added to obtain the mean square amplitude of the total:
(8.42)
In sensors, a desired sensor signal, vs, is proportional to a quantity to be
measured, and sensor noise, vn, is an unwanted signal produced by the noise
sources of the system. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a metric of the relative
amount of signal and noise present in a sensor output. SNR is deﬁned as the ratio
of the mean square signal, vs
2
, to the mean square noise, vn
2 (Equation 8.43). Due
to the typical magnitude of SNR, the magnitude is often expressed in decibels
(dB) as:
(8.43)
When signals and noises are applied to systems (Figure 8.36), it is frequently
desired to calculate the response of the system. For linear systems, a frequency
response function, FRF, which can be calculated from the basic principles or
measured, deﬁnes the response of the system vs. frequency due to inputs. 
The PSD of the system output can be calculated by the product of the
magnitude of the FRF squared and the PSD of the input (Equation 8.44). Because
these are functions of frequency, the product is performed at each frequency. The
mean square system response is calculated by integrating Equation 8.44 over
frequency similar to Equation 8.41.

8.2.4.1
Noise Sources
Noise in a sensor can arise from a number of mechanical and electrical effects.
Several of the most frequently encountered types of sensor noise are discussed
next. Table 8.7 summarizes the types of noise, noise models, and mechanisms.
Shot noise is associated with direct current ﬂow across potential barriers
present in devices such as p–n diodes and bipolar transistors. The passage of each
current carrier (electrons or holes) across the p–n junction in diodes and transistors
is a random event dependent upon the carrier having sufﬁcient energy. What
appears as a continuous external current is actually a large number of discrete
pulses. The time constant associated with the passage of carriers across the
potential barrier is extremely small; therefore, the PSD of the shot noise current
can be modeled as white, which is valid well beyond the range of practical
electronic circuits. Equation 8.46 is the amplitude of the shot noise current PSD,
where q is an electron charge and IDC is the direct current ﬂow.

Flicker noise is a low-frequency noise component arising from the capture
and release of charge carriers by trap sites produced by crystal defects or con-

tamination in semiconductors. The trap sites capture and release carriers randomly
with time constants that are primarily low frequency. The ﬂicker noise current
PSD is modeled by Equation 8.47, which shows a 1/f dependency in amplitude
vs. frequency; this is why this type of noise is frequently called 1/f noise. The
constants a, b, and K1 in Equation 8.47 are primarily fabrication process and
device dependent. Once these parameters are determined for a particular process
and type device, they may be used for prediction of noise in other similar devices
made in that process.

Another type of low-frequency noise, termed burst or popcorn noise, is
sometimes found in integrated circuits and discrete transistors. The mechanism
is not fully understood, but is believed to be related to heavy metal contamination.
Equation 8.48 is a model of burst noise that contains constants that need to be
determined for the speciﬁc application. Burst noise can also occur with multiple
frequency components (fc), which can be seen in an experimentally obtained PSD
of the noise.

Thermal noise is noise that can be generated in electrical and mechanical
components; it arises from a completely unique mechanism — the random
motion of electrons and atoms, which is directly proportional to the absolute
temperature, T. Thermal noise is generated in these systems through their energy
dissipation mechanisms (i.e., resistance for electrical or damping for mechanical).
Because dissipation mechanisms provide a way for energy to leave an electrical
or mechanical system, they also provide a way for energy to enter. The energy
entering the system is the thermal vibration of electrons and molecules. The
association linking the paths for energy dissipation and entrance is expressed by
the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem [47,48]. Thermal noise is also known as
Johnson noise in electrical systems and Brownian noise in mechanical systems.
The PSD for thermal noise is white. This is the most fundamental noise limitation
for a sensor.

8.2.5 MEMS PHYSICAL SENSORS
Physical sensors are one of the biggest application areas for MEMS technology.
In this section, an overview of three of the most widely used types of physical
sensors and their implementation in MEMS technology will be presented. 
Accelerometers and gyroscopes are inertial sensors that measure acceleration
and rotation rate, respectively. The performance grades of these types of sensors
are found in Table 8.8 [50], which presents the bias stability and cost range for
the four performance grades. The performance ranges from strategic grade inertial
instruments used on strategic missiles and submarines to instrument grade instru-
ments used in automotive and commercial applications. Currently, MEMS inertial
sensors are available in the tactical and instrument grade inertial sensors.
One of the ﬁrst commercial application areas of MEMS technology was
pressure sensing. Today, pressure sensing is one the largest commercial applica-
tions of MEMS technology. The implementation of pressure sensors with MEMS
technology for different pressure/vacuum regimes will be presented.
8.2.5.1
Accelerometer
Accelerometers are one of the most frequently utilized physical sensors for detect-
ing and measuring motion. Accelerometers have found applications ranging from
measurement and control to inertial navigation. MEMS implementations of accel-
erometers have found a large commercial market in automotive airbag deployment

systems [52]. The basic conﬁguration of an accelerometer is the same for all of
these applications. Three items are the basic components of an accelerometer:
•
Inertial mass
•
Suspension
•
Sensing element
The suspension supporting the inertial mass will deﬂect under acceleration
due to D’Alembert’s principle [53]. A sensing element will transduce the deﬂec-
tion of the suspension to an electrical signal. The transduction can be accom-
plished by a number of means, but the most common utilize piezoresistive,
piezoelectric, or capacitance means. Piezoresistive and capacitance sensing are
discussed in this chapter. 
Figure 8.37 schematically depicts an accelerometer. The motions of the hous-
ing and inertial mass are denoted by the coordinates Y and X, respectively, which
are absolute displacements. The coordinate Z is the relative displacement of the
inertial mass relative to the housing, which is related by Equation 8.50. Z is the
variable that could be transduced to an electrical signal. Equation 8.51 is a force
balance on the inertial mass including spring, K, and damper, C, forces.
Using Equation 8.50 and rearranging Equation 8.51 results in Equation 8.52.
This shows that the acceleration input to the housing, 
is related to the dynamics
of the relative displacement of the housing and inertial mass, Z. The relative
displacement, Z, is a quantity that can be measured within the case through means
such as the displacement of a beam, deﬂection of a piezoelectric crystal, or
capacitance change of the mass relative to the housing.

Equation 8.52 is a second-order differential equation, which was discussed
in Section 6.2.1. This type of equation will have a resonance at the system’s
natural frequency, ωn. Resonance is a condition in which the spring forces balance
the inertia forces and the damping force controls the amplitude. With no damping,
the amplitude of the system would theoretically become inﬁnite. Figure 6.24
shows the frequency response function of a second-order system with the max-
imum response occurring at resonance. Figure 6.23 shows the time response of
the second-order system for various amounts of damping. The response varies
from oscillatory for ζ < 1 to nonoscillatory for ζ ≥ 1.
The design of an accelerometer depends upon the system damping. The
amount of damping will determine the dynamic response and the Brownian noise
and thus the noise ﬂoor of the sensor. Macroscale accelerometers are designed
to have a damping ratio of ζ ≅ 0.7. 
This type of system will have a fast response with very small overshoot. The
accelerometer needs to sense signals that contain a combination of many frequen-
cies. Two important metrics for accelerometer design are amplitude distortion
and phase distortion. To prevent amplitude distortion, the accelerometer transfer
function must amplify the signals of different frequencies equally. This means
that the magnitude of the frequency response function must be ﬂat in the operating
range, which occurs in the low-frequency range of the frequency response func-
tion (Figure 8.38). For no phase distortion, the phase of the harmonic components
of the signal must increase linearly with frequency (Equation 8.53). This will
shift the harmonic components in time equally [54]. A damping ratio of ζ ≅ 0.7
almost perfectly eliminates phase distortion, and restricting the operating range
to approximately 0 < ω/ωn ≤ 0.2 also minimizes amplitude distortion. For most
MEMS accelerometer designs, the natural frequency of the inertial mass-suspen-
sion system is at least an order of magnitude higher than the highest frequency
signal to be sensed.
(8.53)
The mechanical sensitivity of an accelerometer, SM, is the relationship
between the relative deﬂection of the inertial mass and case, Z, and the input
acceleration,
Because the operating range of the accelerometer is at low fre-
quency, where ω ≈ 0, an acceleration input to the system may be approximated
by a constant acceleration balanced by the suspension (Equation 8.54). Thus, the
mechanical sensitivity, SM, of an accelerometer is shown in Equation 8.55.

The accelerometer described thus far is an open-loop sensor consisting of
the inertial mass-suspension system, position sensing, and ampliﬁcation signal-
conditioning elements. Figure 8.39a is a block diagram of an open-loop acceler-
ometer for which, the greater the acceleration 
input is, the greater the relative
displacement, Z, which will be transduced into an electrical signal. Linearity is
an important sensor quality because of calibration and signal-conditioning issues.
However, some of the transduction means such as capacitance sensing are non-
linear with increasing displacement. This can be mitigated by limiting the accel-
eration input range of the sensor, but also has the adverse effect of limiting the
sensor dynamic range. Generally, an open-loop accelerometer is satisfactory for
applications in which the dynamic range is less than 5000:1 and the scale factor
error can be 0.1% or greater. This is generally the case for instrument-grade
accelerometers; however, for accelerometers used in inertial navigation, this is
not sufﬁcient.
An alternative approach is to maintain the inertial mass in the undeﬂected or
zero position during acceleration. This will require a control loop with a force

actuator to maintain the inertial mass position. Figure 8.39b shows a block
diagram for a closed-loop accelerometer. A closed-loop sensor involves some
additional items compared to an open-loop sensor. The former will need an
actuator to apply force to the inertial mass to maintain its position, as well as a
control compensator to maintain the closed-loop stability of the system. The
additional electronics involved in a closed-loop sensor may be implemented
digitally or by analog. Analog control electronics will continuously vary the
feedback signal to maintain the inertial mass position; however, this will require
the scale factors of the position sensing, ampliﬁers, and force feedback system
to be known precisely over the entire operating range, which is challenging. 
A digital implementation of a closed-loop accelerometer utilizing a method
such as a Σ∆ modulator [55] can alleviate many of the concerns of a purely analog
implementation. For example, the nonlinear relationship between voltage and
force in electrostatic actuators is eliminated by quantizing the feedback signal to
1 bit and encoding only the sign of the proof mass displacement from the unde-
ﬂected (nominal) position. This is the function of the comparator in Figure 8.39b.
Linearity is assured because only two displacement/force levels are sensed or
generated. Due to the time delay involved in position sensing, comparator, and
force actuation, the closed-loop system must contain a compensator, Hc, to main-
tain stability [56]. This digital control loop will operate at a frequency much higher
(~ two to three orders of magnitude) than the inertial mass-suspension natural
frequency or the frequency content of the signal to be measured. An example of
an implementation of this approach is presented in Lemkin and Boser [57].
A number of trade-offs are associated with open-loop vs. closed-loop or
analog vs. digital implementation of an accelerometer. The sensitivity and
bandwidth of the open-loop accelerometer are related to the natural frequency,

ωn, of the suspension. The closed-loop accelerometer implementation can make
the sensitivity–bandwidth trade-off somewhat independently. Digital implemen-
tations can also reduce the impact of nonlinearities (e.g., electrostatics) on the
sensor. However, a closed-loop accelerometer implementation will be limited
by the capacity of the force actuation to balance the inertial mass for high-
input accelerations. 
8.2.5.2
Gyroscope
A gyroscope is an inertial instrument capable of sensing rotation that can be
implemented in a number of ways. Invented by Leon Foucault in 1852, the ﬁrst
gyroscope was based on the angular momentum of a spinning wheel. The angular
momentum, H, is the product of the mass moment of inertia, I, and the angular
velocity, ω, of the wheel (Equation 8.56). Due to Newton’s laws of motion, the
angular momentum of a body will remain unchanged unless acted on by a torque,
T (Equation 8.57). If a torque is applied in the same axis as the angular velocity,
the effect is to accelerate or decelerate the rotating body, which is denoted by
the ﬁrst term of Equation 8.57.
However, if the torque is applied orthogonal to the spin axis, the rotating
body will precess, Ω, denoted by the second term of Equation 8.57. These effects
are illustrated in Figure 8.40. The cross-product in the second term generates the
interesting gyroscopic effects (i.e., Ω, H, and T are related by the right-hand rule).
Precession or the moments generated by precession are the effect utilized by this
form of gyroscope as a measure of angular rate.
The spinning wheel gyroscope is used to implement a class of high-perfor-
mance gyroscopes for inertial navigation as well as other lower performance
applications. Because the fabrication of this type of gyroscope requires precision
bearings, machining, drive motors, and electronics, it is very costly. However, in
the 1950s inertial navigation for missiles, aircraft, and submarines came to rely
on this type of gyroscope.

In the 1980s and 1990s when MEMS technology was reaching the stage of
maturity sufﬁcient for application to gyroscopic sensing, several avenues were
pursued. The development of a MEMS spinning mass gyroscope was initially
inhibited due to the lack of low-friction bearings and the signiﬁcant stiction and
adhesion forces at the microscale. However, promising research on the develop-
ment of an electrostatic levitated spinning mass MEMS gyroscope is proceeding
[58,59]. This is an ambitious approach because of the necessity of closed-loop
control to stabilize the levitation, in addition to driving the spinning mass and
sensing its deﬂections due to precession. This approach is currently in the research
stages and no MEMS spinning mass gyroscope commercial products are available.
Optical rotation rate sensors based upon the Sagnac effect have also been
developed [60]. Georges Sagnac discovered this effect in 1913 while performing
a modiﬁcation of the Michelson–Morley experiment [61]. An optical gyroscope
utilizing the Sagnac effect can be implemented with two counter-rotating light
beams circulating around an optical path of radius, R, where the optical path is
rotating with angular velocity, Ω (Figure 8.41). The Sagnac effect can be observed
by the time difference, ∆t, between the clockwise and counterclockwise beams
striking a detector that is in and rotating with the optical path. If the optical path
is not rotating, the optical signal traveling in either direction will complete the
path at the same time. However, if the optical path is rotating clockwise, as shown
in Figure 8.41b, the optical signal traveling in the same direction as the rotation
will have a slightly longer distance to travel than the optical signal traveling in
the opposite direction.

The tangential speed of the rotating optical path is v = ΩR. The initial
separation of the start and end points of the optical signals is 2πR or, if one allows
the signal to circulate N times around the path, N2πR. The time difference in the
arrival of the signals due to the Sagnac effect can be calculated as shown in
Equation 8.58, where c is the speed of light in the optical path medium. The
Sagnac effect time interval is very small. For example, the measurement the
Earth’s rotation rate (i.e., 15°/h) with a 1-km long optical path will produce a
Sagnac effect of only ∆t = 3.3 × 10–9 sec. A short time interval such as this can
be resolved by phase shift effects of the optical signals.
(8.58)
The basic conﬁguration schematically described in Figure 8.41 can be imple-
mented with ﬁber optics with multiple turns (N) to increase path length and the
∆t or phase shift measured as an indication of rotation rate, Ω. The Sagnac effect
is the basis of a number of optical rotation rate sensors such as the interferometric
ﬁber-optic gyro (IFOG). 
In 1982, a micro-optical-gyro (MOG) concept utilizing MEMS and micro-
electronic fabrication techniques was patented [60] and initial development pur-
sued by Northrup [60]. MOGs utilize wave guides etched into the substrate by
MEMS etching techniques. This initial effort by Northrup to produce an MOG
was discontinued. However, other organizations [63] are still pursuing this concept,
but this approach does not currently have an MOG commercial product available.
Another approach for rotation rate sensing lies in the dynamics of vibrating
mechanical systems. The fact that vibrating objects are sensitive to rotation has
been known since 1890. The initial concept for an implementable vibratory
gyroscope was based on the vibration of a metal tuning fork [64,65]. By the
1960s, engineers were seeking alternatives to the spinning mass gyroscope due
to its size, fragility, and expense. Subsequent technology developments enabled
the realization of a functioning vibratory gyroscope [66–68]. The vibratory gyro-
scope was also later discovered to be the mechanism utilized by biological
systems such as a ﬂy’s ability to sense angular rotation [69].
Vibratory gyroscopes are based on Coriolis acceleration, which is an accel-
eration produced due to the changing direction in space of the velocity of the
body relative to the moving system. For example, Figure 8.42 shows the Coriolis
acceleration, Acoriolis, produced on a body moving around an axis with a ﬁxed
angular velocity, Ω, and moving radially with a velocity V as well. The Coriolis
acceleration is deﬁned by Equation 8.59. The detection of the deﬂection of an
object due to Coriolis acceleration is the basis for a vibratory gyroscope.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
A vibratory gyroscope is composed of a resonator that will oscillate a body
along one axis and measure the orthogonal movement or force on the body due
to Coriolis acceleration. Figure 8.43 is a schematic of a plate being driven along
the x axis, the rotation rate to be measured; Ω is along the z axis and the Coriolis
acceleration response is sensed along the y axis. Equation 8.60 and Equation
8.61 are the equations of motion (force balance) for the body in the drive (x)
and sense (y) axes, respectively. These are a system of coupled second-order
equations coupled via Coriolis acceleration terms. The physical mechanism for
a vibratory gyroscope is the transfer of energy from one resonator axis to another
via the Coriolis acceleration coupling. The suspension for this device can have
a unique natural frequency, ωx, ωy and a unique damping ratio for ζx, ζy for each
axis (Equation 8.62).

The relative positioning of the suspension natural frequencies is a gyroscope
design decision. Frequently, the sense direction natural frequency, ωy, is approx-
imately 10% less than the drive direction natural frequency, ωx. This will provide
a modest mechanical gain without signiﬁcant bandwidth or phase shift reductions.
The damping ratio of the mass in the x and y axes depends on the orientation of
the mass relative to the substrate, which will determine the damping mechanism
involved (e.g., squeeze ﬁlm vs. lateral shear damping).
The implementation of the gyroscope will require the mass to be driven in
the x axis by the force Fx. For many MEMS designs, Fx is electrostatic, such as
an interdigitated electrostatic comb drive. The drive amplitude, x, must be main-
tained very accurately because any variation will directly contribute an error into
the sense direction amplitude (Equation 8.60) and the gyroscope output. For this
reason, the drive axis amplitude is controlled by an automatic gain control feed-
back loop.
Because the oscillatory drive portion of the gyroscope (Equation 8.60) is
ﬁxed to a high degree of accuracy by the gain control loop, Equation 8.61 governs
the dynamics of the gyroscope response. Because the x axis (drive axis) is an
oscillator, the response of the y axis (sense axis) will also be oscillatory (Equation
8.63). The Coriolis term that is the input to Equation 8.61 is twice the product
of the angular rate and the velocity of the x axis oscillator, which produces a
modulated signal. Therefore, the gyroscope output will need to be demodulated
to extract the rotation rate signal. Section 8.2.1 contains a discussion of modu-
lation and demodulation of signals. 
The velocity,
of the drive signal that is the input to the Coriolis term of
Equation 8.61 is simple harmonic motion, which will be zero at the extremes of
motion of the driven mass and a maximum as the mass passes through the
undeﬂected position. The mass x displacement and the Coriolis force, which
contains an x velocity term, have a 90° phase difference; therefore, the y dis-
placement due to the Coriolis force will also have a 90° phase difference. These
signals are said to be in quadrature. This will lead to an oval deﬂection path
(symmetric about the x axis) of the mass shown in Figure 8.44a when the
gyroscope is subject to a constant rotation rate. With a zero rotation rate, the
mass deﬂection pattern will not deﬂect in the y direction and oscillate entirely
along the x axis as shown in Figure 8.44b.

However, if mass or stiffness imbalances exist in the system dynamics as
indicated in Equation 8.64, the mass deﬂection pattern will be as shown in Figure
8.44c. These subtle imbalances in the vibration of the sense mass produce a
deﬂection in the y direction known as quadrature error, which contaminates the
Coriolis signal, which is the measure of rotation rate. The effects of quadrature
error can be negated by a quadrature error cancellation [70,71] scheme involving
the use of electrostatic actuators with properly phased signals to cancel the
imbalance, or by synchronous detection methods, which take advantage of the
quadrature relationship to extract the Coriolis signal.
(8.63)
(8.64)
The ﬁrst silicon integrated micromachined vibratory gyroscope was described
by O’Connor and Shupe in 1981 [72]. In the ensuing years, development of a
MEMS gyroscope was spurred by the lure of a low-cost instrument that could
be mass produced. Efforts to produce single resonator gyroscopes schematically
are shown in Figure 8.43. However, the one conﬁguration that has been employed
for macroscale and MEMS vibratory gyroscopes is the tuning fork gyro (TFG)
(Figure 8.45). The TFG consists of two plates that are driven in an antiphase
manner (i.e., both plates move outward and inward relative to the center axis).
The rotational ﬁeld will cause the plates to move perpendicular to the substrate
in opposite directions. This conﬁguration enables differential sensing, which will
allow common mode signals such as external accelerations to be rejected. The
use of two masses vibrating in antiphase also causes momenta to cancel locally
and make the gyroscope less sensitive to mounting. The two masses may have
coupled or separate suspensions.
Two MEMS TFGs have been successfully developed for commercial appli-
cations by Draper Laboratories [73,74] and Analog Device [75]. These are exam-
ples of tactical and instrument grade MEMS gyroscopes. The applications for a
gyroscope such as these include tactical grade navigation, platform stabilization,
automobile skid control, and stabilization.
8.2.5.3
Pressure Sensors
The method of pressure sensor implementation differs depending on whether the
pressure to be sensed is greater than atmospheric or less than atmospheric (vac-
uum). Currently, the greatest commercial application for a MEMS pressure sensor
is for the greater than atmospheric regime, which is the focus here. However,
methods of implementing a vacuum sensor will ﬁrst be brieﬂy discussed.
The method of implementation of a vacuum sensor depends on the operating
range. In the 1 to 2000 mtorr range, vacuum may be sensed by measuring the

thermal conductivity of the ambient gas. However, at vacuums of 1 mtorr to 10–8
torr, ionization of the gas may be used as a measure of vacuum.
A Pirani gauge, which measures vacuum, can be implemented by measuring
the thermal conductivity of the ambient gas. Thermal conductivity absolute pres-
sure gauges are widely used in vacuum systems [77]. Thermal conductivity pro-
portional to pressure can be implemented by a heated ﬁlament suspended in a gas
(Figure 8.46). The resistance of the suspended ﬁlament is a function of temper-
ature, which is related to the surrounding pressure and thermal conductivity. The
mechanism for this relationship has been studied in detail [78]. The MEMS
implementation of a Pirani gauge is presented in Mastrangelo and Muller [79].
At very low pressures (1 mtorr to 10–8 torr), gas ionization may be used as
a measure of vacuum. An Ionization gauge emits electrons from a cathode; these
are accelerated toward an anode plate. Positive ions are created by the elec-

tron–gas collisions. The current on the anode is proportional to the absolute
pressure (vacuum) of the gas.
Most pressure sensors for greater than atmospheric pressure utilize a deform-
able diaphragm. The deﬂection of the diaphragm is the measure of pressure,
which can be sensed by capacitative, piezoresistive, or optical means. Figure 8.47
is a schematic of typical pressure sensors. The pressure sensor may measure
absolute pressure that has a vacuum or a reference pressure on one side of the
diaphragm. Alternatively, a gauge pressure or differential pressure sensor would
have one side of the diaphragm vented to atmosphere or to another pressure that
would be a reference for the measurement.
The pressure diaphragm is generally rectangular or circular in shape. Pressure
sensors fabricated with bulk micromachining methods are generally rectangular,
due to the anisotropic etching techniques utilized. The fabrication sequence of
the bulk micromachined Motorola MPX200 pressure sensor is shown in Figure
8.48. This sensor has a square, single-crystal diaphragm that is 1448 µm in length
and 26.5 µm thick. A four-terminal X-ducer [81] shear strain gauge technology
is used to read pressure.
The shape of surface micromachined pressure sensors is not restricted because
they are photolithograhically deﬁned. Figure 8.49 shows a surface micromachined
pressure sensor that has a 2-µm thick diaphragm and is 200 µm in diameter.
Circular diaphragms may have an advantage over square or rectangular ones due
to the absence of stress concentrations at the corners. 
The applied pressure for the diaphragm-based pressure sensors is determined
by the deﬂection of the diaphragm. Section 6.1.6 discusses the relationships for
small deformations of a ﬂat plate in bending with no initial built-in stresses due
to residual stress. Figure 6.15 and Figure 6.1.6 provide the maximum deﬂection
and stress for a rectangular and circular diaphragm with ﬁxed boundary conditions
(i.e., no deﬂection or rotation) at the boundary. The pressure on the diaphragm
is directly proportional to the applied pressure for rectangular and circular dia-
phragms. For the case of a diaphragm with large built-in stress or large deﬂections,
the direct proportionality is no longer true. In general, it is desirable to use a
diaphragm with a linear relationship with pressure because calibration and mea-
surement are simpler. Deﬂection of the diaphragm may be sensed via capacitance
or piezoresistive sensing (discussed in this chapter).

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
Pressure sensors are generally used for low-frequency pressure measurement.
Microphones are similar to pressure sensors, but microphones sense a dynamic
pressure signal. The frequency response and mechanical sensitivity of ordinary
pressure sensors are typically inadequate for use as a microphone due to the
acoustic resistance and squeeze ﬁlm damping between the diaphragm and sta-
tionary cavity of the sensor. The damping effects can be mitigated by perforating
a stationary plate or venting so that the air can escape to a larger chamber [82]
(Figure 8.50). These modiﬁcations will allow a ﬂat frequency response over a
broader range. Piezoresistive [84] and piezoelectric [85] microphones have been
reported. A micromachined hydrophone with a frequency response of 2 kHz has
also been reported [86,87]; it is based on a capacitance-sensed microphone ﬁlled
with a compressible ﬂuid.
8.2.6 CHEMICAL SENSORS
Types of chemical sensors vary widely. Figure 8.51 is a schematic of the basic
elements of a chemical sensor. The chemical to be sensed, analyte, interacts with
a chemically sensitive layer, which will produce an effect that can be transduced
to an electrical signal. The chemically sensitive layer and the method of trans-
duction to an electrical signal are application speciﬁc and must be tailored to the
analyte of interest. The chemical reaction that occurs between the analyte and
the chemically sensitive layer may be reversible or irreversible. Some reversible
chemical reactions may be reversed simply by removing the chemical to be
sensed, thus causing it to dissociate from the sensitive layer. Others may be
reversed through the addition of heat, which will cause the analyte to detach with
no net change in the chemically sensitive layer. An irreversible reaction will cause
the sensitive layer to be consumed, which limits the sensor lifetime. Biological
sensors are similar in approach to chemical sensors except that the sensitive
coating may include biological materials such as an antigen. A detailed review
of chemical and biological sensors may be obtained in Taylor et al. [88], Cass
[89], and Ko [90].
The effect produced by the chemical reaction between the analyte and the
chemically sensitive layer is varied and application speciﬁc; these include:

Electrochemical. These effects include changes in charge, electric
potential, or current; they can be directly transduced to an electrical
output. Examples of chemical sensors that measure the electrochemical
effect are chemically sensitive resistors, FETs, and capacitors.
•
Heat. Calorimetric chemical sensors are based upon the measurement
of the heat produced by the analyte reacting with the chemically sen-
sitive layer. The heat produced by the reaction is directly related to the
analyte concentration. Calorimetric sensors for the detection of glu-
cose, gases, etc. are documented in the literature.
•
Optical. Optical chemical sensors utilize optical absorption, transmis-
sion, or luminescence resulting from the analyte interacting with the
chemically sensitive layer. These chemical sensors can be highly sen-
sitive but can be limited by the optical properties at the wavelength of
interest. Optical sensors can be used to sense pH, oxygen, glucose,
etc., depending on an appropriate choice of the chemically sensitive
material.
•
Mass change. The mass change resulting from the chemical reaction
of the analyte and the chemically sensitive layer may be detected by
highly sensitive acoustic wave devices [91]. These devices generate a
high-frequency wave on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal, which
is coated with the chemically sensitive material. As the wave passes
through the material with adsorbed analyte molecules, their effect on
the velocity of the acoustic wave is detected. The acoustic wave devices
are split into two categories: bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface
acoustic wave (SAW). SAW devices generally operate at frequencies
above 50 MHz. A well-known member of the BAW device category
is the quartz microbalance (QMB), which is generally 10 to 15 mm in
size, operates between 10 and 30 MHz, and can detect mass changes
as low as 10–9 to 10–10 g/cm2. Chemical sensing can also be imple-
mented with resonating beams [92,93].
A unique application of chemical sensing is the electronic nose [94]. This is
a combination of multiple chemical sensor detection and pattern recognition to

recognition of food freshness, beverages, and perfumes.
8.2.6.1
Taguchi Gas Sensor
The Taguchi gas sensor (TGS), a very successful commercially available [95]
sensor for a wide variety of gases, was ﬁrst developed by N. Taguchi in 1971.
Applications include alcohol breath analyzers; automatic cooking controls; com-
bustible gases (methane, propane, CO, hydrogen, etc.); volatile organic vapors
(alcohol, ketone, esters, benzols, etc.); and others. This sensor is a solid-state
sensor composed of a sintered metal oxide (SnO2), which detects gases through
an increase in electrical conductivity when reducing gases are adsorbed on the
sensor’s surface. The sensing material, tin dioxide (SnO2), is a polycrystalline
material consisting of crystals (grains) embedded in an amorphous matrix of the
material. The sensors operate as follows (illustrated in Figure 8.52):
•
The metal oxide is heated to 300 to 400°C in air.
•
Oxygen is adsorbed on the crystal surface with a negative charge.
Donor electrons in the crystal are transferred to the adsorbed oxygen,
which results in positive charges in a space charge layer in the crystal.
A surface potential that is a potential barrier to electron ﬂow (i.e.,
resistance increases) is produced.

(8.65)
•
An analyte molecule reacts with the adsorbed oxygen to release elec-
trons; this decreases the resistance. Equation 8.66 shows this reaction
for CO. This is a reversible reaction that is subsequently repeated.
(8.66)
A schematic of the TGS is shown in Figure 8.53. The sensor incorporates a
heater to heat the metal oxide to 300 to 400°C, which consumes a few hundred
milliwatts. The temperature increases the chemical reaction rate and speeds the
sensor response time. The metal oxide can be doped to improve the sensitivity
and selectivity of the sensor to speciﬁc gases [97]. In addition to tin dioxide
(SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) has been used for chemical sensing [98].
8.2.6.2
Combustible Gas Sensor
A number of combustible gas-sensing devices have been implemented with ﬁeld
effect transistors, capacitors, resistors, and diodes. These devices are based on
the adsorption of hydrogen in catalytic metal ﬁlms [99–102]. For example, a
Pd–Ni alloy will adsorb hydrogen molecules on the surface, where the atoms
are dissociated and free to diffuse into the bulk. The dissolved hydrogen atoms,
which are typically located at octahedral interstices in the face-centered cubic
crystal, act as additional impurity scattering sites. This results in an increase in
the resistance [103,104] or a change in threshold voltage of a transistor whose
gate is coated with the catalytic material.
Figure 8.54 shows an example of a hydrogen combustible gas detector
that is implemented with this type of technology and developed at Sandia
National Laboratories. This sensor used a differential measurement of resis-
tance, which required a passivated ﬁlament and a ﬁlament coated with a
catalytic material (Pt).

9 Packaging
Once the fabrication of the MEMS device has been completed, parts are obtained
and assembled, protected, and tested. These parts can consist of one or more die
resulting from a surface micromachined or bulk micromachined process or, alter-
natively, an object such as a gear, rotor, or seismic mass resulting from a bulk
micromachined or LIGA process. The parts obtained from a MEMS fabrication
process are rarely the end product. A number of steps need to be accomplished
once the MEMS fabrication is done in order to produce a MEMS product such
as a sensing device (e.g., accelerometer, pressure sensor); an optical device (e.g.,
the TI DLP); or a switch. The major issues for packaging of MEMS devices
include handling, thermal budget, mechanical stress, encapsulation, and device
motion requirements.
9.1 PACKAGING PROCESS STEPS
The objective of packaging is multifaceted. Packaging operations may consist of
some postfabrication processes required for a device to function properly as well
as assembly of the MEMS device into a next level assembly or ﬁnal product that
provides a function for the end user. The package containing the MEMS device
needs to provide the following functions:
•
Mechanical support. The package must mechanically support or con-
tain the MEMS device so that it can function alone or within another
system. The package will physically protect the MEMS device.
•
Interconnection. The package must provide for communication
between the microscale connection of a MEMS device and the mac-
roscale connection that will be used to function or interface with the
device. The connections may encompass a variety of physical phenom-
ena such as electrical, optical, ﬂuidic, biologic, etc.
•
Environment control. The package must control the environment nec-
essary for the MEMS device to function properly throughout its life-
time. The necessary environmental controls may include thermal
management, particulate contamination, or ambient atmosphere control
(i.e., humidity, atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure).
Similar to MEMS fabrication processing, packaging has its roots in and
leverages the microelectronics infrastructure; however, MEMS packaging fre-

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
quently has different requirements from those of microelectronics. The packaging
processing sequence will be broken down into the following steps, which will be
discussed in detail in this section:
•
Postfabrication processing. Additional processing must occur to enable
the functionality of the basic MEMS device or part. These processes
may include dicing, releasing, and coating the device. Exactly which
of these postfabrication processes is performed and its sequence is very
application speciﬁc. This process sequence is frequently called the back
end of the line (BEOL).
•
Package selection and design. The package provides the functions of
mechanical support, interconnection, and environmental control for the
MEMS device that it contains. Depending upon the application or the
point in the MEMS device development cycle (i.e., prototype, product
development, or product), the package that may be utilized could be a
simple IC package or a speciﬁcally designed package for the intended
product. Basic options and considerations will be discussed.
•
Die attach. The MEMS die is ﬁxed in the package to provide support
and interconnection.
•
Wire bond and sealing. This section will discuss the connection from
the MEMS die to the package to provide interconnect between the
micro- and macrosize regimes. The package will be sealed to protect
the MEMS die from handling or contamination. The sealed package
can provide an inert environment for the MEMS die to prevent corro-
sion or humidity, which can affect device performance. Alternatively,
the package may also provide a vacuum that may be required for some
MEMS devices.
9.1.1 POSTFABRICATION PROCESSING
Postfabrication or back end of the line (BEOL) processing consists of a variety
of processes required to enable the MEMS device to be fully useful. The selection
of the processes to be used is very application speciﬁc and inﬂuenced by the
fabrication technology utilized (surface micromachining, bulk micromachining,
LIGA). The following processes will be discussed in this section:
•
Release: the removal of the sacriﬁcial layers at the end of fabrication
of a surface micromachined device.
•
Drying: the removal of the etchant and rinsing solutions utilized in the
release process to yield a dry MEMS device.
•
Coating: a coating applied to the MEMS device to further enable or
enhance its functionality — for example, a thin coating applied to
lubricate or reduce friction in the MEMS device. Alternatively, a bio-
logical coating could be applied to enable a biological sensor, or a
coating could be applied to enhance reﬂectivity of an optical device.

•
Assembly: assembly of MEMS die or parts to form the next level of
assembly.
•
Encapsulation: a MEMS die may be encapsulated to enhance its
protection.
9.1.1.1
Release Process
The release process of surface micromachining is discussed in Chapter 3. The
exact nature of the release process will depend upon the material system used in
the surface micromachine process. It is generally desired to have a release process
that will remove the sacriﬁcial layer as quickly as possible with minimal impact
on the structural layer material that remains. For example, the SUMMiTprocess
utilizes polysilicon as the structural material and silicon dioxide as the sacriﬁcial
material with hydroﬂuoric acid release chemistry. Alternatively, the Texas Instru-
ments DMDdevice utilizes aluminum as the structural material and photoresist
as the sacriﬁcial material released with oxygen plasma etch. The release etch
would ideally produce no particles that would inhibit the MEMS device function
and produce a free-standing structure.
9.1.1.2
Drying Process
For release processes that involve liquid etchants, drying is a critical process in
the BEOL sequence. The drying of a MEMS device is crucial because the
fabrication processes typically involve thin layers (e.g., ~2 to 4 µm) and small
gaps, which give rise to a stiction phenomenon in which the layers can be adhered
to each other or to the substrate. Dyck et al. [1] provide a review and discussion
of the stiction literature. Stiction is chieﬂy due to the surface–volume ratio scaling
of MEMS devices (Chapter 4), which magnify the effects of surface forces [2,3]
such as surface tension in liquid–vapor interfaces. In the ordinary drying process
after the release etch, liquid evaporates and capillary forces due to surface tension
arise as a result of the liquid–vapor interface. The surface forces at this interface
can be avoided by using processes that avoid the liquid–vapor transition, such as
supercritical drying or freeze drying. 
The supercritical drying process proposed by Mulhern [4] avoids the liq-
uid–vapor interface by transferring the liquid via the supercritical phase. Carbon
dioxide is used because of its low critical temperature and pressure (i.e., Tc =
31.1°C, pc = 72.8 atm). During the drying process, no liquid–vapor interface
exists, thus, no capillary forces are present.
Freeze drying removes the liquid by freezing it using evaporation cooling in
a vacuum chamber. The solid (frozen) material is then removed by sublimation.
Freeze drying was ﬁrst applied by Guckel [5,6] in a surface micromachined device
released with a hydroﬂuoric (HF) acid etch. The wafer is immersed in a
water–methanol mixture after the liquid release etch. The liquid is then frozen
by evaporative cooling in a vacuum chamber. The methanol is added to avoid
supercooling the water and thus causing it to freeze too rapidly. Then the solid
water–methanol is removed by sublimation at 0.15 mbar.

9.1.1.3
Coating Processes
Coating a MEMS device may be required to enable its functionality for a partic-
ular application or to enhance the yield of the device. The types of coatings that
may be used are as wide ranging as applications for MEMS are. Examples of
coatings include surface passivation; antistiction coatings [7,8]; optical coatings
[9–12]; biocompatibility [13]; and biologically sensitive [14] or chemically sen-
sitive [15–17] coatings. Selected examples are discussed next.
•
Antifriction/antistiction coatings. Self assembled monolayer (SAM)
coatings have been developed to aid in the reduction of stiction and
friction in MEMS devices. Stiction is the adhesion of compliant MEMS
surfaces when the restoring forces are unable to overcome the interface
forces (e.g., van der Waals, capillary forces, electrostatic forces). The
SAM coatings frequently consist of long chain molecules of various
chemistries that can produce oriented hydrophobic monolayers on a
MEMS surface; this aids stiction reduction.
•
Optical coatings. MEMS optical devices frequently require a highly
reﬂective surface for the optical wavelength of interest. Gold (Au) is
a useful optical reﬂective coating in the infrared and visible spec-
trums. Depending upon the surface to be coated, an adhesion layer
may be required to ensure good adherence to the surface. For example,
Picard et al. [9] investigated the use of chromium (Cr) and titanium
(Ti) as an adhesion layer for gold deposition. However, for other
wavelengths, alternative coatings may be necessary. For example, a
molybdenum–polysilicon (Mo/Si) multilayer coating [10–12] is nec-
essary in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum (λ = 13.4 nm). The
Au/Ti, Au/Cr, and Mo/Si coatings are generally deposited by evapo-
ration or sputtering.
•
Biologically and chemically compatible coatings. MEMS-based ﬂuid
systems may handle biological and chemical materials. For the MEMS
system to function properly, the surfaces of the MEMS devices must
not chemically or biologically react with the sample materials because
that would produce materials that may foul the system [13] with reacted
chemicals or biological elements.
•
Biologically or chemically sensitive coatings. Biological and chemi-
cal sensors require portions of the MEMS device to be coated with
sensitive materials that are used to produce an effect that can be
measured. For example, the effect to be measured may be a mass
change on the treated portion of a vibrating beam. The biologically
sensitive coating may be an antigen applied to a vibrating sensor [14].
A chemically sensitive coating [15–17] may be applied to a structure,
which will adsorb a particular chemical that will change the resistance
of the material.

Coatings are very application speciﬁc, but the MEMS designer must be aware
of the possible impact these coatings may have on the device and its fabrication.
The effects that a coating may have are quite varied; several of these effects are
discussed next.
•
Electrical shorts. Many optical coatings are electrically conductive
and are deposited by evaporation or sputtering. It is desirable to apply
the optical coating to the optical surface; it may be patterned via a
lift-off process (see Section 2.6.2). Alternatively, the deposition of the
optical coating may be controlled via a shadow mask utilized in the
evaporation or sputtering deposition (Figure 9.1). The shadow mask
forms a barrier that permits deposition only in selected areas. Also,
the optical device design may be self-shadowing, as illustrated in
Figure 9.2. A self-shadowing design uses an overhanging structure to
cause breaks in the conductive coating so that the device is not elec-
trically shorted. This device is difﬁcult to design, but can prevent ﬁne
features from being electrically shorted. The shadow mask approach

is limited by the precision with which the mask can be aligned, whereas
the self-shadowing approach is only limited by the precision of the
lithography process utilized and the amount of underspray in the
deposition process.
•
Residual stress. The coating residual stress is a very important concern
especially for optical coatings. Signiﬁcant engineering effort is involved
in the process development of a low-stress coating process [9]. A metric
for the performance of optical devices is ﬂatness of the coated optical
surface. The process parameters of deposition rates and material alloys
are signiﬁcant in engineering the coating processes. The MEMS optical
design and fabrication process is frequently inﬂuenced by the necessity
to produce mirror surfaces that can withstand the residual stresses
inherent in the MEMS fabrication process and the applied coatings.
Frequently, this pushes the MEMS design to have thicker, reinforced,
or smaller mirror surfaces to accommodate the residual stress effects.
•
Particulate. Particles may be generated by a coating that may interfere
with the device operation by shorting or jamming. If this is a possibility,
the MEMS designer may be able to shield the critical portions of the
design from these effects.
•
Coating out-gassing. Coatings may produce gases when exposed to an
elevated temperature. These gases may impede device operation by
adverse chemical reactions or changing the pressure or vacuum in the
package. These problems may be circumvented by a change of coating
material or use of chemical getters [18] to remove the offending gases.
The use of a chemical getter may be needed due to outgasing of the
applied coatings; also, package leakage and outgasing of the die attach
material may also be a signiﬁcant source of undesirable internal pack-
age gases. Getters are selective chemical scavengers designed to cap-
ture undesirable substances. They are available for hydrogen, oxygen,
moisture, and particulate materials [19]. An early use of chemical
getters was the removal of oxygen from triode vacuum tubes, which
caused the ﬁlaments to oxidize and fail. A solution to this problem was
the use of active metals that reacted more quickly with the oxygen than
the tungsten ﬁlament of the triode.
•
Coating thermal environment. The thermal environment involved in
the deposition of the coating may have an impact on the MEMS
material properties used if the temperature is sufﬁciently high. If the
coating is applied to a MEMS device that contains microelectronic
properties, the thermal environment may affect the electronic properties
or melt the interconnect layers.
•
Coating stability. Some coatings may degrade at elevated temperature.
This could be the chemistry of the coating changes that makes a SAMS
coating for stiction ineffective or the corrosion of a mirror coating.
Many times these effects will impose a limit on subsequent temperature
processing that the MEMS device can withstand.

Assembly
A number of items fall under the umbrella of assembly. Assembly can include
assembly of MEMS or microelectronic die for a next level of assembly; assembly
of MEMS parts; or erection of MEMS structures. As with most things in the area
of MEMS, the technologies that will be discussed under this topic are in various
stages of development and maturity.
•
Assembly of die. MEMS or microelectronic die can be assembled
together to form a greater assembly [20]. Interconnection between die
can be made via a number of methods, such as wire bonding between
die mounted on a common substrate; however, ﬂip-chip bonding has
signiﬁcant advantages (Figure 9.3). In ﬂip-chip bonding, the die are
bonded together via small solder balls (<200 µm) without the use of
bond wires. This approach enables a small package with intimate
electrical contact, which mitigates the electrical parasitic of bond wire
resistance and capacitance. This method enables a multichip module
(MCM) in which multiple chips are stacked using ﬂip-chip bonding
and connections through the wafer to enable the vertical connections
[21]. This approach allows improved system performance and small
geometric form factor.
The range of capabilities enabled by MEMS devices has prompted
research in techniques in which MEMS components fabricated in dif-
ferent technologies can be combined via a packaging method such as
ﬂip-chip bonding to enable a viable solution or higher performance.
For example, Michalicek et. al. [22] demonstrated the transfer of a
surface micromachined device assembly to another substrate (Figure
9.4) to increase functionality; this allowed electronic control of the
MEMS devices. This approach could also be utilized to create RF
devices (e.g., switches, ﬁlters, variable capacitors) utilizing silicon
surface micromachined devices removed from the host silicon wafer;
that is not suited to RF applications to a better suited substrate.

•
Erecting structures. The erection of MEMS structures is still a research
topic, but the development of technology and devices to produce truly
three-dimensional structures may be enabling to systems in the future.
The actual assembly may be performed by on-chip actuators or residual
stress devices on the chip, or manually assembled via a probe. Figure
9.5 shows erected vertical mirrors, which have been manually erected
via an assisting truss structure, and a mirror erected at an angle via
residual stressed beams. The erection of MEMS structures may also
be enabled by surface tension of solder [23] or ﬂuids [24,25], which
would eliminate the need for manual assembly, actuators, or aiding
truss structures. The use of properly arranged and designed receiving
sites with surface tension forces may enable automated assembly.
•
Assembly of MEMS parts. Some MEMS fabrication technologies will
produce parts (e.g., bulk micromachining, LIGA) that will require
assembly to form a functioning MEMS device. Figure 9.6 shows a
LIGA mechanism that required the manual assembly of the various
FIGURE 9.4 Method for transferring MEMS devices via ﬂip-chip assembly. (Modiﬁed

parts (e.g., gears, linkages). Manual assembly is usually not an accept-
able method except for the very small lot sizes typically encountered
for research and development prototypes. The area of microassembly
is currently in the very early stages of development; thus, no standard
procedures, standards, or tools are readily available. However, research
has been conducted in parallel and serial methods of microassembly
[26–31,33]. Serial microassembly utilizes robotic visual servoing
(RVS) [30] to locate and manipulate parts. The RVS approach to serial
microassembly is ideal for small lot sizes and diverse parts to assemble.
As the lot sizes become larger, ﬁxtures for the parts become a viable
alternative. Also, parallel assembly of the parts is the path that would
be needed for large lot sizes. Figure 9.7 shows the equipment utilized
for parallel assembly of a shaft and gear at the wafer scale. Serial and
parallel assembly utilized the available techniques of robotic assembly;
however, much of the equipment is unique to this size scale.

Encapsulation
Packaging can represent as much as 70% of the cost of a MEMS product.
Manufacturability, which is the result of batch fabrication of hundreds to thou-
sands of devices at a time on a single wafer, is one of the reasons that integrated
circuits are so successful. One of the reasons that packaging can represent such
a signiﬁcant fraction of the total cost is the need to handle individual die. MEMS
packaging can achieve greater manufacturability by avoiding the handling of
individual die in the release, dry, and coat processes; this can be achieved by
performing wafer level release, dry, and coat processes and encapsulation to
protect the MEMS device through the rest of the packaging process.
The encapsulation will provide a protective shell over the sensitive MEMS
parts while feed-throughs are passed through the package to connect to other
components or to pass an electrical signal (Figure 9.8). The feed-throughs are
needed to transfer signals to or from sensors, actuators, and circuitry. The feed-
throughs must have low parasitics (e.g., resistance, capacitance) and they must
be sealed to avoid any leakage. The encapsulation illustrated in Figure 9.8a is
achieved by bonding an encapsulating substrate to the MEMS wafer. A reliable
bonding process is essential to achieving a good seal. A variety of bonding

processes (e.g., silicon-glass bonding, glass frit bonding, eutectic or solder bond-
ing) has been utilized [34]. 
To achieve a wafer-scale encapsulation, the processes of release, dry, coat,
and encapsulation must be compatible. A signiﬁcant concern will be the impact
of the temperature of the encapsulation process upon the MEMS coatings. Sandia
National Laboratories [32] has developed a wafer-scale encapsulation that utilizes
anodic bonding to join the encapsulating wafer to the MEMS wafer (Figure 9.9).
The temperature of the bonding process is the most important parameter in
determining if the SAM coatings survive. The SAM coatings utilized in this
process require a temperature of less than 320°C to survive functionally. These
glass-capped wafers can then be run through a standard wafer saw. The result of
the Sandia research indicates that anodic bonding is sufﬁciently strong for micro-
system packaging applications.
An alternative approach to encapsulation utilizing wafer bonding is a thin-
ﬁlm shell package (Figure 9.8b). Thin-ﬁlm shell encapsulation is attractive due
to the small area encapsulation that can be achieved. A variety of techniques is
available for thin-ﬁlm encapsulation, which is compatible with wafer-level pro-
cessing. However, thin-ﬁlm materials can be physically fragile. The thin-ﬁlm
encapsulation can be accomplished with organic materials (i.e., epoxies, silicones,

or polymers such as polyamides or Parylene) or inorganic materials (i.e., silicon
nitride or silicon carbide). The organic materials are a challenge due to the
possibility of moisture penetration and attack by harsh environments. The inor-
ganic materials are a challenge for use in encapsulation because of the temperature
required for deposition and the nonconformal nature of the ﬁlm. 
9.1.2 PACKAGE SELECTION/DESIGN
Once the postfabrication processing is accomplished, a selection of a suitable
package, based upon the intended use of the MEMS device, must be made. For
a prototype research and development application requiring only electrical con-
nectivity, a microelectronic package may be used. Figure 9.10 shows a schematic
of the basic features of an electronic package. Figure 9.11 shows a few examples
of frequently utilized IC packages. More detailed compilations of IC packages
available may be obtained from Web sites listed in References 35 through 38.

The two basic types of connections are the through-hole device (THD) and
surface mount device (SMD) packages. The THD package interfaces with a
printed circuit board with pins inserted in the plated through-holes of the circuit
board and soldered in place. The SMD package connections are more varied.
Surface mount technology packages enable tight spacing of connections out of
the package, which will allow more I/O (input–output) per unit area of the
package. Figure 9.12 illustrates the gull-wing, J-lead, and solder-ball grid types
of connection utilized in surface mount technology to facilitate a dense package
connection interface. The ball grid array (BGA) package is a relatively new style
of package that enables a smaller parasitic (i.e., capacitance, resistance) than the
traditional lead frame and bond wire approach to packaging. The BGA style of
package facilitates high connection density (e.g., 100s to 2000 connections in
some cases) and high-frequency packaging interconnection.
The most advanced methods of packaging involve use of the microsolder ball
for attaching chips to each other, a package, or a circuit board. The use of a solder
ball eliminates the traditional wire bond that provides a low parasitic connection.
The following will brieﬂy touch on the packaging technologies that utilize solder
ball attachment.
Flip-chip or bump bonding uses small solder balls (e.g., 0.1 to 0.2 mm) that
are directly attached to metallized pads on the bottom of a chip or die. The solder

used is typically a 97% Pb/3% Sn. The common ﬂip-chip process is called C4
(controlled collapse chip connection) and was patented by IBM in 1969 [39]. 
Chip scale packaging (CSP) belongs to the BGA family of packages. The
chip die bonding is no longer done by wire bonding, but is accomplished by using
gold bump bonding between the chip die and the package base substrate. The
package base consists of multilayers, which provide signal and ground planes of
copper. A ﬁller material or glue is between the chip die and the package base to
provide additional attachment and stress relief. The solder ball count for this type
of package is 40 to 200 balls. The CSP package area is 80% occupied by the die.
The multichip module (MCM) is the ability to integrate several chip die into one
package. This approach to packaging facilitates small size and short interconnec-
tion paths between die. The solder ball is utilized once again for chip–chip
connection. Figure 9.13 illustrates the CSP and MCM package concepts.
9.1.3 DIE ATTACH
Die attach is the traditional method for attaching a die to a package. The goal of
a die attach process is to provide a 100% void-free attachment between the die
and package, which would minimize heat resistance, and a die attach material
that has no outgas, which may contaminate a MEMS device.
Two approaches for die attach are epoxy adhesive and eutectic die attach.
The epoxy die attach utilizes epoxies with different ﬁllers depending upon the
desired conductivity (silica ﬁller for insulating, silver for conducting) and cure

temperature (typically, <150°C). An issue with epoxy die attach may be outgas
during and after curing; this may contaminate a MEMS device. This contamina-
tion can affect MEMS devices by causing stiction and have an impact on device
reliability. Research has developed a low outgas epoxy [40] that may meet the
requirements for MEMS devices. The epoxy may be automatically dispensed in
a pattern in the package; the die handled by a vacuum pick-up will insert the die
onto the epoxy pattern in the package die attachment area in the package well.
Appropriate space on the device layout will need to be provided to facilitate the
automated vacuum pickup.
The eutectic die attach layer, such as gold-silicon (AuSi) or tin-lead (SnPb),
is reﬂowed to provide a mechanically strong bond that conducts heat and elec-
tricity well. The consideration for use of a eutectic die attach is the high-temper-
ature processing (183°C for SnPb or 379°C for AuSi). The eutectic die attach
does not have the outgas concerns of the epoxy die attach.
9.1.4 WIRE BOND AND SEALING
Wire bonding is the oldest method for connecting a chip or die to the inner lead
frame of the package. Gold wires with 25 to 50 µm diameter or aluminum wires
with 25 µm diameter are commonly used. The bonding of the wires occurs by
application of heat and ultrasonic energy to form a thermosonic bond; application
of ultrasonic energy alone to form an ultrasonic bond (e.g., a type of cold weld);
or application of heat alone and compression to form a thermocompression bond.
A ball bond tool implements a thermocompression bond by pressing heated
gold balls onto metallized pads. A torch heats a gold wire tip above the melting
point (~400°C), which allows surface tension to form a ball on the end of the
wire. The tool with a mold on the end presses the ball onto the metallized bond
pad. The bond is formed by mechanical pressure and diffusion of the bonding
material (i.e., gold ball–metallized bond pad).
A wedge bond tool implements an ultrasonic bond by feeding a gold or alumi-
num wire, which is pressed onto the metallized bond pad and ultrasonic energy
(~50 kHz) applied. Figure 9.14 is a schematic the operation of a ball and wedge
bond tool. Figure 9.15 shows a wire bond performed by a ball and a wedge bond tool. 
Sealing the package well is the ﬁnal step in packaging a microsystem. Sealing
the package cavity can be accomplished by use of a eutectic solder. The use of
eutectic solder such as AuSn requires high temperature to braze the package lid.
Alternatively, epoxy can be used to attach the package lid; this requires a much
lower temperature, but it produces a nonhermetic seal and has the issue of out-
gassing discussed earlier. Glass frit seals are often used to attach a ceramic lid
to a ceramic package, but this requires temperatures higher than brazing.

R&D prototype packaging. R&D prototype packaging is a brief dis-
cussion of the packaging required for a preliminary prototype that will
facilitate initial test and evaluation of a device. This example will utilize
commercial microelectronic packaging for the test and evaluation of a
MEMS device that require electrical signals only. This approach will
generally not be the ﬁnal product package required, but the use of
commercial electrical packages facilitates research and development
of a prototype. The initial considerations necessary for this type of
packaging will be discussed.
•
DMD packaging. This will review some of the packaging consider-
ations for the Texas Instruments digital mirror device (DMD), which
is one of the premier MEMS success stories. This is an example of a
package for a commercial product that needs electrical and optical
feed-throughs in the package.
•
Sandia electrical-ﬂuidic packaging (EMDIP). The section will
review the packaging considerations for MEMS ﬂuidic research
devices. These devices require electrical as well as ﬂuidic package
feed-throughs. This was a packaging development effort to achieve an
in-house standard electrical-microﬂuidic package that would facilitate
ongoing research efforts.
9.2.1 R&D PROTOTYPE PACKAGING
This section will discuss packaging issues for packaging a MEMS device in a
standard electrical package for preliminary test and evaluation of a MEMS pro-
totype device. A list of some simple common-sense rules that will greatly aid the
ability to package a device is developed. These MEMS packaging layout rules,
which are also applicable for more advanced packages and applications, follow:
•
Adequately sized bond pads. Utilize adequately sized bond pads on
the MEMS layout. A typical size is 120 × 120 micron bond pads.
Figure 9.16 shows the size of a bond pad and a wedge bond tool that
illustrates the need for adequately sized bond pads.
•
Provide space for vacuum pickup. Manual manipulation of die with
tweezers is not a manufacturable process due to the possibility of
particle generation. Vacuum pickup or collets are used to pickup a die.
The pick-up must be separated from MEMS structures to prevent the
possibility of damage. A 300-µm space from any structure is a typical
recommendation, but this depends upon the tools used.
•
Adequate bond pad spacing. The bond pad should be spaced around
the outsize periphery of the die. A standard layout, which may facil-
itate testing and multiple uses of probe cards, is recommended. Figure
9.17 shows a standard layout of bond pads for a 24-pin DIP for a
SUMMiT™ module.

356
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
•
No MEMS devices or conducting traces outside the bond pad perim-
eter. This will minimize electrical parasitics or damage during the wire-
bonding process.
•
Minimize length of bond wires. This will prevent sagging or sensitivity
of the package to acceleration. Keep the length of the bond wires less
than 0.1 in. (2.5 mm).
•
No crossed bond wires. This will preclude shorting of the bond wires
due to handling.
•
Obtain speciﬁc packaging speciﬁcation and rules from the packaging
engineer. For exact speciﬁcations of the packaging issues that apply to
a speciﬁc device, consult the packaging engineer, who is knowledge-
able about the tools and processes available at the facility.

Figure 9.18 illustrates two types of layouts that may be problematic for
packaging. In Figure 9.18a, the bond pads are bunched in a corner; this will
produce difﬁculties for the wire bonding tool. The wire bond lengths shown in
Figure 9.18b are long, closely spaced, and cross over the MEMS device.
9.2.2 DMD PACKAGING
The digital mirror device (DMD) developed by Texas Instruments, Inc. has been
accepted by the data projector market and is making signiﬁcant inroads into the
high-deﬁnition home entertainment market as well. The DMD is a large arrayed
MOEMS device (shown in Figure 9.19). This section will discuss the packaging
requirements for the DMD [41,42] — an application of a MEMS device that
requires electrical and optical feed-throughs in the package for functionality. The
packaging design drivers are cost, image quality, and product life.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
The ﬁrst production versions employed the hermetic packaging approach [41]
shown in Figure 9.20a. For the hermetic package, the device is packaged on a
ceramic substrate with an optical quality window seam welded to the substrate;
this requires a glass–metal fusing process. The window–substrate seam weld and
the glass–metal fusing process are cost drivers.
To address the cost issues during the design for the product HD1 (Figure
9.21) for the high-deﬁnition home entertainment market, a nonhermetic package
approach was used (Figure 9.20b). The device is still packaged on a ceramic
substrate and the window lid is directly bonded to the substrate; however, this
eliminated the window–substrate seam weld and the glass–metal fusing, which
greatly reduced the cost. The seam weld process was replaced with an adhesive
dispense and curing process.
The window qualities are very important for the image quality of the device.
The qualities of number of window defects, DMD array placement accuracy, and
parallelism with respect to the system optics are the leading factors impacting
image quality, with number of window defects most signiﬁcant. Because the array
of mirrors, DMD, is the image plane, the gap height, h, between the mirror array
and the window has a great impact on the effect of window defects on image
quality (i.e., the defects are out of the focus). Studies performed by Texas Instru-

and T. Kocian, Tex. Instrum. Tech. J., 15(3), 87–94, 1998, and A. Kunzman et al., Proc.

ments have shown that “at a gap height of 1.0 mm, all window defects smaller
than 24 µm are undetectable by the human eye” [42]. For the HD1 package, the
gap height was set at 1.5 mm, which is greater than that in previous designs. The
increased gap height does not have an impact on other parameters such as mirror
lubrication. The nonhermetic package uses Boroﬂoat glass vs. the more expensive
Corning 7056 previously used. 
The DMD array is sensitive to contamination and moisture, which are affected
by a nonhermetic package permeation rate. The permeation rate into the package
is controlled by the window adhesive layer, which depends upon adhesive type,
temperature, bond line width, bond line thickness, and uniformity. The permeation
rate is also affected by the internal package pressure as well as the external
environment pressure, temperature, and humidity. The decision to use a nonher-
metic package was based upon empirically based models and veriﬁed by accel-
erated package tests. A 20-year lifetime is achieved under nominal conditions.
The new package design further consists of a one-piece heatsink and stud
with a compliant thermal pad and a spring clip, which increases the manufactur-
ability of the package. 
9.2.3 ELECTRICAL-FLUIDIC PACKAGING
A group of researchers at Sandia National Laboratories has developed a two-level
packaging scheme for electromicroﬂuidic applications [44,45]. The motivation
for this work was to develop a standardized electromicroﬂuidic packaging method
that would interface to and enhance research in surface micromachined micro-
ﬂuidic devices. The researchers were striving to achieve the following attributes
with their packaging technology:
•
Adaptable to a variety of electromicroﬂuidic applications
•
Producible and inexpensive in quantity
•
Layered assembly
•

The EMDIP (electromicroﬂuidic dual in-line package) was developed as
a ﬁrst-level package for electromicroﬂuidic devices fabricated in silicon (Figure
9.22). The EMDIP is constructed in layers. The base has the same electrical leads
as a standard 24-pin DIP package and will plug into a standard socket. The base
has eight 1-mm diameter holes that provide the ﬂuidic interface to the second-

level package (discussed later). The lead frame provides electrical connection to
the DIP package pins and also provides metal pads along the periphery of the
DIP package well that can be wire bonded to the top side of the electromicroﬂuidic
die. The ﬂuidic manifold is formed by a double-sided adhesive tape, which forms
the ﬂow channel that transitions from a 200-µm Bosch etched hole through the
electromicroﬂuidic die to a 1-mm through-hole in the DIP package. The meso-
scale manifold forms the top of the ﬂuidic channel and provides holes that mate
with the 200-µm Bosch holes in the die. Another piece of double-sided adhesive
tape adheres the die to the mesoscale manifold.
The use of adhesive tape prevents adhesive ﬂowing into the ﬂuidic channels and
forming a blockage. The curved transition from 200 µm to 1 mm eliminates sharp
corners and prevents the formation of stagnant ﬂuid pockets. The layered construc-
tion is amenable to methods other than adhesive tape, such as thermoplastics. The
adhesive tape is the application-speciﬁc portion of the EMDIP that can be specialized
to accommodate the number of ﬂuidic channels up to a maximum of eight. 
The ﬂuidic printed wiring board (FPWD) is the second-level package
designed to interface to multiple EMDIP modules as well as standard electronic

components. Figure 9.23 is an exploded view of the FPWB, electrical connector,
and ﬂuidic connector. The materials used to construct the FPWB are high-
temperature thermoplastics or glass. The FPWB consists of two parts: the channel
board and the cover board. The channel board contains the ﬂuidic channel and
the cover board forms the channel lid. The ﬂuidic connector, which was devel-
oped by Peter Krulevitch and Willam Benett [43] and patented by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratories, connects to the channel board with a 3.4-mm
channel. The 1-mm holes in the cover board are designed to mate with the ﬂuidic
connections of the EMDIP. The cover board also contains electrical traces, which
route electrical connections from the EMDIP to the electrical connector. The
interface between the EMDIP and FPWB make electrical as well as ﬂuidic
connections.
9.3 SUMMARY
Packaging is a signiﬁcant fraction of the cost of any MEMS product and requires
consideration concurrently with the device design and fabrication. Packaging
provides the basic functions of mechanical support, interconnection, and envi-
ronmental control for the MEMS device. Although the exact processes required
for packaging a device are application speciﬁc, they may span a wide range,
which may include any or all the following:
•
Die separation
•
Release
•
Drying
•
Coating
•
Assembly
•
Encapsulation
•
Die attachment
•
Wire bond and sealing

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
The requirement for the development of a packaging process is in many ways
the same as fabrication process development. The interaction of the packaging
processes with each other and with the fabricated MEMS device is a major issue
for consideration. For example, the temperature proﬁle required for a packaging
process step, such as die attach or outgassing of the die attach material, can affect
the integrity of a previously applied coating or the MEMS device.

10 Reliability
10.1 RELIABILITY THEORY AND TERMINOLOGY
Reliability is the ability of a device or system to perform a required function for
a speciﬁed amount of time. The function and level of reliability required of a
device are obviously application speciﬁc. A sensor vital to an aircraft ﬂight control
system whose failure can mean loss of life is an example of a high-reliability
application. Alternatively, a switch in a piece of commercial electronics may fail
and be an annoyance, but it is hardly a tragedy. Since World War II, reliability
techniques have been widely applied to military and commercial devices and
systems; this has led to the development of the ﬁeld of reliability. Examples of
the reliability literature can be found in the journals listed in Table 10.1.
The reliability of a system may depend upon many things, such as the
subsystems (e.g., individual electrical, mechanical, or MEMS devices); packag-
ing; power supply; software; or cooling systems. The overall reliability of a
system is complex because the interrelations between the different subsystems
can combine in complex ways to cause a system failure. Alternatively, the system
could be designed so that subsystems can compensate for failures in other aspects
of the system. For example, software could be designed to monitor the system
and avoid a system failure by utilizing other subsystems to perform a function.
However, this chapter focuses on reliability at the device level — speciﬁcally,
the reliability of MEMS devices. Data to access the reliability of a device are
obtained by operating a large number of devices under normal operating condi-
tions and noting when failure occurs. Three items need to be deﬁned unambig-
uously to formulate the reliability experiment properly:
•
Method of operation: a detailed deﬁnition of the method of device
operation — for example, a switch is the device to be tested for
reliability. An application of voltage (10 V/0 V) to close or open a
switch at 100-Hz frequency using a square wave signal. 
•
Deﬁnition of failure: deﬁnition of what constitutes failure of this device
— for example, resistance of the switch contact > 1 kΩwhen the 10-
V operate signal is applied or the resistance < 1 MΩwhen the 0-V
signal to open the switch is applied. This statement of failure denotes
that contacts are fouled so that adequate continuity when closed is not
present or sufﬁcient isolation is not present when the switch is open.
This condition may be present when the switch mechanism has failed

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
so that the contacts do not open or close when the appropriate signal
is applied.
•
Sample size: a large enough sample size utilized in the reliability test
so that a statistically meaningful result can be obtained. Reliability
data are by their nature nondeterministic because numerous factors can
affect the outcome of the reliability experiment. The nondeterministic
factors include manufacturing variations (e.g., deposition, etch, pat-
terning); material variations; and environmental variations (e.g.,
humidity, particulate, material interactions, shock, vibration, thermal).
These variations cannot be predicted; therefore, the reliability data must
be considered random and analyzed with statistical methods.
These three items deﬁne how to operate the device, what constitutes failure,
and the number of items to test. The number of cycles that have elapsed when
the failure occurs deﬁnes when the failure occurs, which can have units of time
or cycles of operation. In the example discussed earlier, the cycles of operation
were open–close switch operation cycles. For other devices, this could possibly
be cycles of force, voltage, or pressure application. 
Figure 10.1 shows an example of how reliability data may be recorded and
analyzed. Figure 10.1a graphically shows the record of the raw data (i.e., device
designation number vs. the time of failure of that device). In this case, the time
of failure is denoted in units of 106 h of operation. This plot by itself is not
unduly meaningful. Distribution plots of when the failures occur can provide
more insight. 
Figure 10.1b is a cumulative failure distribution plot, which plots the total
number of failures that occurred up to a speciﬁed operation time. The cumulative
failure distribution plot can be derived from the raw data plot (Figure 10.1a). For
example, if the ﬁrst failure occurred at ~0.02 × 106 h of operation, the total number
of devices that failed up to that time is one. Proceeding along the time-to-failure
axis of Figure 10.1a and denoting the total number of devices that have failed up
to that time is then plotted on the ordinate (i.e., total number of device failures)
of Figure 10.1b. For example, a total of ﬁve devices have failed by 0.5 × 106 h
of operation. The last device in the sample set failed at ~0.95 × 106 h of operation;
therefore, the total number of device failures at that time is ten (the sample size).

The total number of device failures in a cumulative distribution is always 0
at t = 0, and the cumulative distribution is equal to the sample size as t ⇒∞.
Instead of dealing with numbers of devices for the cumulative distribution, the
plot can be put on a probability basis by normalizing by the total number of
devices tested. In this case, the plots would be known as the cumulative probability
distribution function (CPDF). It is assumed that there are no inoperative devices
at t = 0 (i.e., no samples dead on arrival). For purposes of this discussion, the
initially inoperative devices would factor into the fabrication yield instead of the
reliability of the device. The cumulative failure distribution shows the minimum
time to failure of a device, the maximum time of failure of all the devices, and
how device failures were distributed between those limits. The slope of the
cumulative failure distribution shows the device failure rate over the duration of
the test data.
A frequently used unit in reliability test data is the FIT (failure in time). A
FIT is deﬁned as one failure per billion (109) device hours or operations. This
deﬁnition of the FIT unit was chosen because failure rates are typically very small
for most devices in production.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
Figure 10.1c is the failure frequency distribution plot, which is a measure of
the failure rate of the device at a point in time. This plot can be obtained from
the cumulative failure distribution plot (Figure 10.1b). By specifying a time bin
size (e.g., 0.1 × 106 h of operation for this example) and noting the number of
failures within the time bin as the bin is moved in time across the cumulative
distribution plot (Figure 10.1b), the failure frequency distribution plot (Figure
10.1c) is obtained. This method is in essence obtaining a numerical derivative of
the cumulative distribution plot to produce the failure frequency distribution plot.
This plot shows how the failure rate varies over time.
The distribution plots obtained in Figure 10.1 appear to be somewhat discon-
tinuous and may be indicative of a small sample size. If the sample size is
increased from 10 to 100 and the experiments are run again (Figure 10.2), the
data trends become more apparent. These data will require computer analysis,
which implements the methods discussed for Figure 10.1. The cumulative distri-
bution (Figure 10.1b) appears to be monotonically increasing, and the failure
frequency distribution (Figure 10.1c) is approximately constant. These example
reliability experiments appear to have a uniform failure frequency distribution.
The plots in Figure 10.1 and Figure 10.2 can be put on a probability basis by
normalizing the ordinate of the cumulative distribution and frequency distribution
plots by the sample size.
These examples have shown that random reliability data need to be analyzed
with statistical tools, which will be discussed in the next section. Before delving
into statistics, look at the failure rate typically observed for a large class of
machinery [1], electronic [2], and MEMS [3] devices. Figure 10.3 is a plot of a
failure rate vs. time (i.e., failure frequency distribution) curve called the bathtub
curve. This curve is composed of three principal regions:
•
Infant mortality: 0 < t ≤tinfant. The failure rate is initially very high but
decreases as the latent defects cause devices to fail.
•
Constant failure rate: tinfant < t < toperation. The failure rate for a reliable
device is small and constant. Failures in the region are random.
•
Wear-out: toperation ≤t ≤twear-out. The failure rate is increasing rapidly
due to wear-out.
In some cases, a fourth region, called the depletion region, occurs beyond
the wear-out region. Few operational devices remain in the depletion region,
and the failure rate again decreases. The region is of little practical importance
because the remaining devices are well beyond the wear-out region.
10.2 ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF PROBABILITY AND 
STATISTICS FOR RELIABILITY
The study of reliability is deeply involved with probability and is extremely
important to the design of engineered systems. The time at which a speciﬁc device

will fail is unknown, but it is often possible to determine the probability of failure
of that device. In order to be able to quantify the reliability of a device, it is
necessary to rely on the framework of probability and statistics. To establish a
framework suitable to quantify reliability, a few key concepts of probability theory
need to be discussed. It is not possible to provide an in-depth explanation of
probability within the scope of this chapter, but several good references [5,6] can
provide a more complete background.
An elementary deﬁnition of probability involves the relative frequency that
particular events will occur. For example, an experiment performed N times had
an outcome of event A, NA times. Therefore, the probability of event A, Pr (A),
is deﬁned as the ratio of NA and N (Equation10.1). For example, rolling a die has
six possible outcomes. The probability that a 2 will be rolled is no different from
that for any of the other ﬁve numbers. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2
is Pr (2) =1/6.

The probability of an impossible event, A, is 0:
Pr (A) = 0
(10.4)
•
The probability of a complete set of mutually exclusive events is 1.
For example, the probability of a complete set of events A, B, C, D,
E, F is Pr(A) + Pr(B) + Pr(C) + Pr(D) + Pr(E) +Pr(F) = 1.
Probability can be used to describe ﬁnite events (e.g., rolling a die) or
continuous events (e.g., voltages that vary between 0 and 5 V). A ﬁnite event has
a countable number of possible outcomes, whereas a continuous event has an
inﬁnite number of possible outcomes. In many tests or measurements, the number

of possible outcomes is not ﬁnite. Consider the test of selecting a bolt from a bin
with speciﬁed failure strength. The actual value is expected to be close to the
labeled value, but strength of the bolt will vary by some unknown amount. The
variances from the labeled value are due to manufacturing variations, which can
assume any value within a speciﬁed range. The actual value of the bolt strength
is unknown in advance.
Even if the bolt is taken from a bin labeled “70 kpsi,” the actual failure
strength will vary over a range. The actual probability of selecting a bolt with
strength of exactly 70 kpsi is zero. In this example, the bolt strength is a random
variable. To study distribution of values of random variables such as bolt strength
or the lifetime of a MEMS device, the concept of distributions must be introduced. 
A random variable is a function whose values are real numbers that depend
upon chance. In the preceding discussion, the values of a rolled die, voltage, or
bolt strength are examples of a random variable. If a random variable, X, can
assume any value within a speciﬁed range, or possibly an inﬁnite range (e.g.,
voltage, bolt strength), it is called a continuous random variable. Discrete random
variables describe events (e.g., value of a rolled die) that can assume only certain
discrete values. Continuous and discrete random variables can be treated with
the same concepts of distributions.
Given that X is a random variable and x is any allowed value of the random
variable, the cumulative probability distribution function (CPDF), F, is the prob-
ability that the event described by the random variable, X, is less than or equal
to a speciﬁed value, x:
FX(x) = Pr(X ≤x)
(10.5)
A CPDF function, such as the functions in Figure 10.4, must obey the
following axioms, which are imposed by the deﬁnition of probability on their
functional nature:
•
The CPDF must range between 0 and 1 because the CPDF is a prob-
ability that the random variable, X, is less than a value x:
0 ≤FX(x) ≤1 – ∞< x < ∞
(10.6)
•
It is an impossibility for anything to be less than –∞and a certainty
that all values are less than ∞:
FX(–∞) = 0
FX(∞) = 1
(10.7)
•
By deﬁnition of a CPDF (i.e., the probability that X is less than a value
x), the CPDF probability increases as x increases. Therefore, FX(x) is
monotonically increasing.

•
The probability that X lies between the values x1 and x2 can be obtained
by subtracting FX(x1) from FX(x2), which is graphically illustrated in
Figure 10.5.
Pr(x1 < X ≤x2) = FX(x2) – FX(x1)
(10.8)
•
The probability that the observed random variable X is greater than but
not equal to x can be calculated by Equation 10.9 because this is simply
the complement of the CPDF. Figure 10.6 illustrates the complement
of the CPDF. The complement of a set of values contains all the values

that are not in the original set, thus yielding the “>” sign in Equation
10.9 because the deﬁnition of Fx (Equation 10.5) contains a “≤” sign:
Pr(X > x1) = 1 – FX(x)
(10.9)
The cumulative probability distribution function, F(x), is a complete distri-
bution of a probability model for a single random variable of interest. Note that
the example CPDF functions shown in Figure 10.4 obey the axioms listed pre-
viously. The value of the CPDF varies between zero and one and is a monoton-
ically increasing function. However, the rate (i.e., slope) at which the function
increases varies.
If the random variable of interest is the number of failures of a device, the
failure rate and how it varies over the independent variable x may be of signiﬁcant
interest. For this reason and other useful calculations, it may be preferable to use
the derivative of FX(x), fX(x) (known as the probability density function, PDF),
rather than FX(x). Equation 10.10 is the mathematical expression of the relation-
ship between the CPDF, FX(x), and the PDF, fX(x). Equation 10.11 is the converse
statement of the relationship between the CPDF, FX(x), and the PDF, fX(x).
(10.10)
(10.11)
Figure 10.7 illustrates the relationship between the CPDF and the PDF for a
uniformly distributed random variable. On the interval x1 < x < x2, the CPDF has
a constant slope, and the slope is zero for x < x1 and x > x2. Because the PDF
is the derivative of the CPDF, this results in a region on the interval x1< x <x2 of
the PDF with uniform magnitude 1/(x1 – x2), which is the slope of the CPDF in
the corresponding interval. The PDF function has zero slope and magnitude for

the regions x < x1 and x > x2. These results are consistent with the relationships
expressed in Equation 10.10 and Equation 10.11.
The physical signiﬁcance of the probability density function can be described
by the probability element, fX(x)dx, which is illustrated in Figure 10.8. The
probability that the random variable X lies in the range x to x + dx is the area
under the PDF between x to x + dx (i.e., the probability element, fX(x)dx). The
properties of the PDF as summarized follow:

The PDF, which is based on probability, is a non-negative function:

The most signiﬁcant metrics associated with statistical methods and, in par-
ticular, the PDF functions are measures of the “central value” and the “spread”
of the distribution. The deﬁnitions and signiﬁcance of the mean value and vari-
ance of a distribution will be discussed. 
The mean, µ, and variance, σ2, of a continuous PDF function are given by
Equation 10.15 and Equation 10.16, respectively. For discrete representations,
the mean and variance are given by Equation 10.17 and Equation 10.18. The
mean, µ, is also known as the expectation of X and is denoted by E[X], which is
read “the expected value of X.” If the random variable, X, is time or number of
cycles of a reliability test of a device, the mean, µ, is the average time of failure
of the devices. The variance, σ2, is a measure of the spread or dispersion about
the mean. The positive square root of the variance is called the standard deviation,
which is denoted by σ. Figure 10.9 shows the relationship of the mean and
variance for a Gaussian distribution. Example 10.1 illustrates the calculation of
the mean and variance for a given CDPF and PDF.

simulated, a uniform distribution model was used. A mathematical model provides
enhanced ability for analysis and exploration of the different types of models that
may be relevant. The next section will discuss several of the frequently used
reliability models. Given the functional formulation for the CPDF and PDF

Solution: (a) X(t) is the random variable for the failures that is a function of
time. Utilizing Equation 10.15, the mean can be calculated as follows:
(b) Utilizing Equation 10.16, the variance is calculated as follows:
(c) Utilizing the deﬁnition of standard deviation,
Another important reliability measure is the instantaneous failure rate or
hazard rate, hX(t). In other words, the hazard rate is the failure rate of the survivors
at time t. The hazard rate is deﬁned as the failure rate, fX(t) (i.e., PDF of failure),
normalized by the probability of devices surviving, RX(t). The probability of
devices surviving, RX(t), is the complement of the probability of device failures,
FX(t), occurring up to time t. This can be expressed as shown in Equation 10.19.
The hazard rate, hX(t), can be deﬁned in terms of the CPDF and PDF functions
previously discussed, as shown in Equation 10.20. The hazard rate is expressed
in the FIT units (i.e., failures per billion cycles of operation) previously discussed.
The bathtub curve discussed in Section 10.1 is a plot of the hazard rate vs. time
or cycles of operation.

10.3 RELIABILITY MODELS
Three distribution functions deﬁned and discussed in Section 10.2 are highly
relevant to the modeling of reliability:
•
Cumulative probability distribution function (CPDF), FX(t)
•
Probability density function, fX(t)
•
Hazard function or instantaneous failure rate, hX(t)
Reliability can be measured via a well deﬁned experimental program involv-
ing a rigorous deﬁnition of the method of operation, a deﬁnition of failure, and
a statistically signiﬁcant sample set. As in Section 10.1, the data from these
reliability experiments can be used empirically to produce the distributions (i.e.,
CPDF, PDF, hazard function) signiﬁcant to the study of reliability. These empir-
ical distributions can then be mathematically analyzed [8]. The data from reli-
ability experiments can be approximated by continuous functions [7] whose
properties can then be analyzed mathematically to provide insight to device
reliability. Three reliability models and their applications to reliability (summa-
rized in Table 10.2) will be discussed:
•
Weibull model
•
Lognormal model
•
Exponential model
10.3.1 WEIBULL MODEL
The Weibull model is widely used in reliability modeling, largely because of its
ability to characterize the various regions of the reliability lifetime curve (i.e.,
bathtub curve) with two parameters, β and λ. The CPDF and PDF and hazard
distributions for the Weibull model are given in Equation 10.21 through Equation
10.23, and the mean and variance of the Weibull distribution are shown in
Equation 10.24 and Equation 10.25. The two parameters of the Weibull model are:
•
λ — Characteristic lifetime parameter (λ > 0)
•
β — shape parameter (β > 0)
The characteristic lifetime, λ, for the Weibull distribution is the point before
which 63.2% of failures occur. This can be seen from Equation 10.22 when t =
λ and F (λ) = (1 – 1/e) = 0.632. Different values of λ change the scale of the
time axis without affecting the shape. The shape parameter, β, describes how the
failure rate is distributed about the characteristic lifetime:

•
0 < β < 1: h decreases with time
•
β = 1: reduces to the exponential model; h is constant
•
β > 1: h increases with time
Figure 10.11 is a plot of the CPDF, PDF, and hazard functions for the Weibull
model with a characteristic lifetime, λ = 2, and shape parameters, β = 0.5, 1.0,
and 2.0. All of the CPDF functions have a value of 0.632 at λ = 2. This is
consistent with the deﬁnition of characteristic lifetime in the context of the
Weibull model. The hazard function varies signiﬁcantly with the three values of
the shape parameter β. For β = 1, the Weibull reduces to the exponential model,
which yields a constant hazard function. For a shape parameter of β = 0.5 and β
= 2.0, the hazard function is decreasing and increasing, respectively. This ability
to model this range of hazard functions allows the Weibull distribution to model
the three regions of the bathtub curve (i.e., infant mortality, useful life, and wear-
out). The Weibull model describes infant mortality very well but does not model
wear-out as well.
Figure 10.12 is a plot of the Weibull distribution for several characteristic
lifetimes, λ = 2, 5, and 8, for a common shape parameter, β = 2.0. The CPDF
function has a value of 0.632 at the various characteristic lifetimes, and the hazard
function is increasing for each curve. However, the slope of the hazard function
curve varies depending upon λ (Equation 10.23).

of the distribution. Equation 10.28 through Equation 10.30 deﬁne the CPDF, PDF,
and hazard functions for the lognormal model.
The lognormal model arises from a relationship between a random variable,
Y, which is Gaussian distributed and deﬁned as a logarithm of another random
variable, X (Equation 10.27). This situation physically arises in communication
systems in which the attenuation of a signal, Y, in the transmission path is Gaussian
distributed and it is logarithmically related to the ratio of the input and output
signal powers, X. The situation also occurs in reliability lifetime data in which
the logarithm of the time to fail has a Gaussian distribution.

Figure 10.13 and Figure 10.14 are examples of lognormal distributions that
illustrate the effect of the model parameters, t50 and σ. The lognormal CPDF
function has a value of 0.5 at the median life, t50. The failure rate for the lognormal
distribution is neither always increasing nor always decreasing. Lognormal dis-

however, there is little physical justiﬁcation. The CPDF, PDF, and hazard func-
tions for the exponential model are deﬁned in Equation 10.32 through Equation
10.34. Equation 10.35 and Equation 10.36 deﬁne the mean, µ, and variation, σ2,
of the distribution. Note that the mean, variance, and hazard function for the
exponential model are all uniquely deﬁned by the parameter λ.
Because the hazard function for the exponential model is a constant, this
model is appropriate for systems involving truly random events such as occur in
the useful life portion of the bathtub curve. The model cannot model infant
mortality or wear-out. Figure 10.15 is a plot of the CPDF, PDF, and hazard
functions for the exponential model with λ = 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0. The CPDF
function has a value of 0.632 at the appropriate characteristic lifetime for each
curve plotted. Because this is a one-parameter model, the characteristic lifetime
parameter, λ, also deﬁnes the hazard function.

devices has been extensively studied and their failure mechanisms are well under-
stood. Microelectronics share a common set of failure mechanisms, which include
hot carriers, oxide breakdown, stress voiding, and electromigration. These failure
mechanisms have been physically and statistically studied extensively, thus
enabling the prediction of performance in various environments. 
MEMS applications cover a very wide spectrum and a large number of device
designs have been implemented to address these applications. As a result of the
breadth of application, the reliability of MEMS devices is not dominated by the
behavior of a “typical” device. The failure mechanisms that may be experienced
by MEMS devices are quite broad, especially in comparison to microelectronics.
As a result, these failure mechanisms are more varied than those of microelectronics. 
Currently, MEMS failure mechanisms are not well characterized or under-
stood; it is not wise to use a macroscale failure mechanism or reliability data
directly for a MEMS device because this would require an assumption of simi-
larity that is generally not valid.
The area of understanding the failure mechanisms of MEMS devices in a
reliability context is just in its formative stages. However, some published works
have documented the ﬁrst steps of understanding failure mechanisms of MEMS

devices [1,4,11]. MEMS failure mechanisms that have been identiﬁed are listed
in Table 10.3. The failure mechanisms may be categorized as operational, envi-
ronmental, and degradation failure mechanisms. Operational failure mechanisms
are failures due primarily to the device operation. The environmental failure
mechanisms are failures due primarily to a physical environment that the device
may experience. Degradation failure mechanisms are subtle failures arising from
operational or environmental means that would alter the device performance
sufﬁciently to cause it to fall out of speciﬁcation.
10.4.1 OPERATIONAL FAILURE MECHANISMS
10.4.1.1
Wear
Wear is the removal of material from a solid surface due to mechanical action.
Although the laws of friction are well established, there is no generally accepted
theory of wear. A very complex phenomenon involving the mechanics and chem-
istry of the bodies in contact, wear depends upon a number of variables, such as
hardness of materials, contact area, loading, surface speed, etc. (Figure 10.16).
Four processes cause wear: adhesion, abrasion, corrosion, and surface fatigue.
Adhesive wear is caused by one surface pulling material off another as they
are sliding. This has been shown to be a primary wear mechanism for polysilicon
MEMS devices [12,13]. Figure 10.17 shows wear effects in a rotating MEMS

device. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard, rough surface moves relative to a
softer surface. Abrasive wear can occur in MEMS [14] when wear particulate is
entrained in the motion of moving surfaces. Corrosive wear occurs when surfaces
chemically interact and the relative motion removes the reaction products. Cor-
rosive wear may be a wear mechanism involved in biological or ﬂuidic MEMS
applications. Surface fatigue wear will occur in rolling applications and will
produce surface fatigue cracks in the materials. Friction and wear in MEMS
devices is a signiﬁcant issue because lubrication and bearing systems typical in

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
macrosystems are not feasible in MEMS devices. The self assembled monolayer
(SAM) coatings discussed in the packaging chapter (Chapter 9) are methods
utilized in MEMS devices to mitigate friction and wear.
10.4.1.2
Fracture
Fracture is a material failure mechanism that results in the structure breaking into
separate pieces. The two types of fracture are ductile and brittle. A ductile material
(such as many metals) will deform plastically and permanently before ultimate
failure when the material fractures. Brittle materials will not plastically deform
before failure. Silicon is an example of a brittle material.
The force levels of all but a few MEMS actuators will not be able to fracture
MEMS materials directly unaided. Therefore, the fracture failure mechanism will
be initiated by an environmental force (e.g., shock or vibration), possibly in
combination with a chemical–material interaction to weaken the material. For
example, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a mechanism observed in polysilicon
and single-crystal silicon [15] (Figure 10.18). Silicon and polysilicon have a thin
layer of native silicon dioxide covering the surface. If the material is sufﬁciently
stressed to crack the layer of silicon dioxide, it will expose new polysilicon or
silicon, which will oxidize to form more silicon dioxide. As this process continues,
the material will eventually weaken sufﬁciently enough for fracture to occur.

Reliability
391
10.4.1.3
Fatigue
Fatigue is a failure mechanism caused by the cyclic load of a structure. Vibrating
structures such as resonators or a vibratory gyroscope are examples of structures
that may be susceptible to fatigue failure. Fatigue material failure occurs by the
formation and growth of surface cracks in the material; these grow as the
material is cyclically loaded. Fatigue can also affect the internal material damp-
ing and electrical resistance of the material, which can also affect device per-
formance. The research on fatigue of MEMS materials to date has shown that
fatigue has typically not been observed with silicon materials [19], and the
fatigue issues observed with aluminum may be overcome with the appropriate
alloy and annealing [20].
10.4.1.4
Charging
Charging is an issue for MEMS devices that contain dielectric layers. Charging
effects include sensor drift over time and changes in actuation voltage. Charging
may be due to ionizing radiation or the high ﬁeld strengths required for electro-
static actuation of MEMS devices [16,17]. Charge build-up can be mitigated by
utilizing low electric ﬁelds or trap-free dielectrics. Another approach is to make
the dielectric material leaky so that charge ﬂows away immediately [18].
10.4.1.5
Creep
Creep is a plastic strain of a material that occurs over time (i.e., a slow movement
of atoms under mechanical stress). This may be an important issue for MEMS
that use metal layers [20]. Creep on the macroscopic scale is generally inﬂuenced
by operating temperature. A general rule for macroscopic design is that if the
operating temperature is less than 0.3 of the melting temperature of the material
and the stress is moderate, creep is not an issue [11]. Direct utilization of mac-
roscopic rules of thumb for microscale phenomena and materials is not generally
recommended, but the use of higher melting point materials or lower operating
temperature will generally result in greater creep resistance.
10.4.1.6
Stiction and Adhesion
Stiction is one of the most important failure mechanisms in MEMS, particularly
for surface micromachine fabricated devices. Stiction refers to surfaces coming
into contact due to surface forces such as capillary, van der Waals, and electrostatic
forces. Due to the scaling effects of MEMS, surface forces become dominant at
the microscale level. Some of the initial modeling of capillary forces that occur
during the release and drying process of surface micromachining was done by
Mastrangelo and Hsu [21]. It has subsequently become very apparent that stiction
is a major issue [22,24]. Signiﬁcant efforts have been undertaken [25] to under-
stand stiction and how its effects may be mitigated. Research has also been
undertaken to develop surface coating, which mitigates stiction effects [26,27].
© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

392
Micro Electro Mechanical System Design
MEMS device design can also inﬂuence the effect of stiction by the use of dimples
(“bumpers”) to minimize broad area surface contact; increased structure stiffness
to prevent collapse; and the minimization of electrostatic surface areas that can
interact to cause stiction. 
10.4.2 DEGRADATION MECHANISMS
A number of material degradation mechanisms can cause device performance to
degrade slowly to the point of inoperability. These mechanisms include thermal,
optical, and other environmental degradation mechanisms. The stress corrosion
cracking [15] discussed earlier is a type of environmental degradation that can
possibly occur. Others include degradation of optical coatings or surface due to
interaction with the environment. Thermal degradation can occur to the MEMS
device or to the MEMS packaging materials. Anodic oxidation of silicon [23]
(Figure 10.19) under a high electric ﬁeld is another long-term material degradation
mechanism. Other similar mechanisms occur on MEMS optical coatings.
10.4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURE MECHANISMS
10.4.3.1
Shock and Vibration
Vibration is a deterministic or stochastic continuous force or displacement exci-
tation of a device that may be due to the environment in which it must function.
Shock is a single event or pulse applied to a device that may be due to the
environment in which it must function. Typically, vibration and shock are mea-
sured in acceleration (g). Shock and vibration environments are generally spec-
iﬁed [28] by the power spectral density (PSD) of the vibration environment or
the shock response spectra (SRS) of the shock environments.

Reliability
393
Vibration and shock environments could be an issue to MEMS devices by
material damage or stiction due to the MEMS surfaces being damaged or forced
together. A number of shock and vibration studies for MEMS devices have been
performed [29–32]; these show minimal effects on the microscale MEMS device.
It has been reported [33] that MEMS inertial sensors have survived shock envi-
ronments as high as 120,000 g. The type of damage observed has been packaging
damage and the movement of particulate.
10.4.3.2
Thermal Cycling
Depending upon the application, thermal environments may be a signiﬁcant
concern for MEMS devices. Space applications may involve temperature envi-
ronments in the range of –100 to 150°C. Thermal cycling may affect a device
through thermal strains between materials that have signiﬁcantly different coef-
ﬁcients of thermal expansion. For example, metals and silicon may have signif-
icantly different coefﬁcients of thermal expansion. The thermal environment may
also cause damage of materials used in the MEMS device or its packaging.
10.4.3.3
Humidity
Humidity has been shown to have signiﬁcant effect on MEMS. Condensation on
MEMS surfaces can cause the development of capillary forces that will lead to
increased adhesion and stiction effects. Humidity in a cold temperature can cause
the formation of ice, which is detrimental to a MEMS device. Wear in MEMS
devices has also been shown to be a function of humidity [25,34]. Humidity in
MEMS packaging can be controlled through the use of chemical getter technology. 
10.4.3.4
Radiation
Radiation can interact with MEMS devices in two ways that will affect device
performance. Ionizing radiation can introduce the charging effects discussed pre-
viously, which will affect sensor drift, or actuation voltages. Higher levels of
radiation can actually cause material damage that can alter material properties.
Space application of MEMS devices will encounter radiation environments. Lim-
ited work on the radiation effects on MEMS devices [35–37] has been done to
date, but indications are that radiation environments will signiﬁcantly affect MEMS
device performance. This is a nontrivial issue that has not been fully addressed.
10.4.3.5
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage, shown in Figure 10.20, will occur when
a microelectronic or MEMS device is improperly handled. Large voltages can
build up on personnel who are not properly grounded; this can result in signiﬁcant
damage to MEMS devices. Proper handling procedures for packaging and testing
personnel are necessary to prevent device damage.

10.5 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES FOR MEMS 
OPERATIONAL, RELIABILITY, AND FAILURE 
ANALYSIS TESTING
Like any other device at any scale, a MEMS device requires quantitative exper-
imental data on various aspects of device operation. These data provide necessary
information for design or process modiﬁcation, reliability, and diagnosis of device
failure. Providing quantitative data on device operation has a unique set of
challenges at the microscale. Macroworld devices can be manipulated, disassem-
bled, and reassembled, and separate discrete instrumentation can be attached to
acquire a wide array of data. Due to their scale, MEMS devices are relatively
inaccessible via many macroworld test methods. The test methods utilized for
MEMS utilize optical noncontact test methods to a large degree. However, a few
simple methods for amplitude measurement of dynamic motion (i.e., stroboscopy,
blur envelope) or examination of inaccessible portions of a device (i.e., lift-off)
are simple, common-sense applications of macroworld methods. An overview of
some of the MEMS measurement techniques and their strengths and weaknesses
is presented next.
10.5.1 OPTICAL MICROSCOPY
An optical microscope is an easy, cost-effective method for initial examination
of a MEMS device. This method can be used for quick examination of defects,
debris, textures, stains, fractures, or abnormal displacements of a device. Use of
high magniﬁcation objectives (e.g., 50×) is good for detection of small deﬂections
(i.e., ~1 µm) of a device. Video taping of device operation is useful for tracking
device performance over a long test or off-line detailed image analysis. Figure
10.21 shows a probe station with an optical microscope. The probes are mounted
on a three-dimensional micrometer stage and are useful for manual manipulation
and applying signals to the MEMS device.

395
A limitation of optical microscopy is the depth of focus, particularly at high
magniﬁcation. Figure 10.22 shows an out-of-focus image of a MEMS gear. The
optical microscope image gives no quantiﬁable information on the movement
perpendicular to the plane of focus. 
Typical optical microscopy utilizes bright ﬁeld illumination, which illumi-
nates the specimen parallel with the optical axis of the microscope; thus, objects
in the plane of the specimen are bright and inclined objects are dark. Optical
microscopy enhancements have been developed that provide enhanced image
contrast. These enhancements include dark ﬁeld illumination and oblique illumi-
nation. Dark ﬁeld illumination is achieved by insertion of a round patch to block
the central rays of the image; therefore, the rays reﬂected at an angle to the
microscope axis are collected to form the image. Oblique illumination is achieved
by illuminating the specimen at an angle to the microscope axis that will accen-
tuate any edges on the specimen surface.

structures within the depth of focus clearly. (Courtesy of Sandia National Laboratories.)

Nomarski differential interference contrast is an optical microscopy method
that will provide image contrast for surface gradients (i.e., edges and lines) on
the sample. Nomarski differential interference contrast is implemented by split-
ting light into two rays with a Wollaston prism. One of the rays illuminates the
sample and both rays are recombined where they can interfere to provide the
desired image contrast.
10.5.2 SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is an extremely useful tool for obtaining
information on a MEMS device. The SEM will provide greater magniﬁcation
and depth of focus than an optical microscope. Also, the MEMS device can be
tilted and rotated to obtain unique viewing angles. An SEM can resolve features
down to the nanometer (e.g., ~3 nm) scale. An SEM image of a MEMS part will
require the part to be placed in a vacuum chamber and possibly ﬂash coated with
a thin conductive ﬁlm to increase image quality (note: the thin conductive ﬁlm
coating may cause the device to become inoperable). The SEM can also be used
to assess the electrical continuity of a MEMS device using voltage contrast or
resistive contrast imaging [38]. The SEM can image very ﬁne wear debris on a
MEMS device and, in conjunction with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) [39] or an electron energy loss spectroscopy system (EELS) [40], the
material composition can be determined.
10.5.3 FOCUSED ION BEAM
Focused ion beam (FIB) systems are extremely valuable tools for experimental
evaluation of MEMS devices. FIB systems use a focused beam of ions such as
Ga+ at 25 to 50 keV for precise material removal (i.e., sputtering); material
deposition (i.e., ion-assisted chemical vapor deposition); and imaging (i.e., detec-
tion of secondary electrons or ions generated by the beam exposure). Figure 10.23
shows a cross-section of a SUMMiThub structure, which shows the internal

layers that would not be otherwise visible. The FIB can be used to free, remove,
or connect portions of a device to enable its experimental evaluation [41].
10.5.4 ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE
The atomic force microscope provides a very detailed topographic image of a
sample surface (Figure 10.24). The AFM data on surface topography can provide
important information for MEMS surfaces for optical applications as well as
diagnosis of wear marks due to device operation.
10.5.5 LIFT-OFF
Lift-off involves removal of MEMS device elements with a nonconductive lab-
oratory adhesive tape and microsectioning of the structure with a focused ion
beam (FIB) to allow examination of the underside of MEMS surfaces (Figure
10.25). This technique can provide information on such things as wear debris,
wear marks, and damage to areas that would otherwise be inaccessible.
10.5.6 STROBOSCOPY
Due to the high frequency of operation enabled by the size scaling of MEMS,
the dynamic motion of many MEMS devices is hard to capture and analyze.
Stroboscopy is a method from traditional optical measurement [43] that can be

adapted for MEMS devices. This method utilizes a ﬂash from a stroboscopic light
source to freeze the device motion in time. Coordinating the stroboscope ﬂash
with the device excitation allows the device motion to be frozen in time or swept
through the device operation phase to observe the device dynamic motion. Stro-
boscopic imaging of a dynamic MEMS system is only applicable to periodic
excitation and motion. The maximum detectable frequency is limited by the pulse
time of the stroboscopic light source. Stroboscopy can be combined with other
optical techniques such as interferometry [44] to obtain out-of-plane dynamic
motion as well as full three-dimensional motion analysis [45]. 
10.5.7 BLUR ENVELOPE
A blur envelope is a simple way to determine the dynamic amplitude of a MEMS
device utilizing an optical microscope. The MEMS device is excited to produce
cyclic motion and the blurred image is used to determine the resulting dynamic
amplitude (Figure 10.26). This technique can be a quick though inaccurate method
for determining the amplitude response as the excitation is swept through a range
of frequencies.

10.5.8 VIDEO IMAGING
Video imaging of optical microscope images via data captured by a CCD (charge
coupled device) camera may be useful [42] for examination of tests over long
periods of time for comparison, documentation, and off-line image analysis.
10.5.9 INTERFEROMETRY
Interferometry [43] precisely measures distance by comparison of the optical path
length between two beams of monochromatic light. The comparison is made by
recombining the light beams. If they are in phase, a bright fringe appears; if the
beams are out of phase, a dark fringe is observed. Figure 10.27 is a schematic
of a Michelson interferometer, and Figure 10.28 is an interferometric image of
a MEMS surface. Interferometry will provide a wide ﬁeld of view topographic
image of a MEMS device. Interferometry can be combined with stroboscopy [44]
to obtain out-of-plane dynamic motion. 
An alternative technique is electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI)
[46], which measures surface position relative to a reference position instead of
using a ﬂat plane as the reference (used in Micelson interferometry).

10.5.10 LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETER (LDV)
A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) [47] or velocimeter is based on the detection
of the Doppler shift of coherent laser light scattered from a small area of a test
object. For a MEMS device, some additional optical elements are necessary to
produce a sufﬁciently small laser beam. The object reﬂects the laser beam and
the Doppler frequency shift is used to measure the component of velocity along
the axis of the laser beam. The Doppler frequency shift is caused by the motion
of the surface off which the measurement beam is reﬂected. Because the laser
light is very high frequency, a direct demodulator of the light is not possible;
however, an interferometer similar to that in Figure 10.27 can be used to mix the
reﬂected laser light and a reference beam. A photodetector can be used to measure
the intensity of mixed light whose beat frequency is equal to the difference in
frequency between the reference and measurement beams. 
10.6 MEMS RELIABILITY AND DESIGN
There is a wide spectrum of MEMS applications and designs to address those
applications. An aid in the classiﬁcation of the various MEMS device with respect
to their reliability implications is the MEMS Device Taxonomy [48] (Figure 10.29)
developed by Sandia National Laboratories. The taxonomy consists of four classes
of devices:
•
Class 1 devices have no moving parts (e.g., accelerometers, pressure
sensors, ink-jet print heads, strain gauges, etc.); parts may ﬂex during
the course of their operation, but there is no excited displacement or
vibrations inherent to their operation.
•
Class 2 devices have moving parts but with no rubbing or impacting
surfaces (e.g., vibratory gyroscopes, resonators, mechanical ﬁlters,
electrostatic comb drives).
•
Class 3 devices have moving parts with impacting surfaces (e.g., relays,
switches, ﬂuidic valves).
•
Class 4 devices have moving parts that contain rubbing and/or impact-
ing surfaces (e.g., gears, slides, rotary hubs).
FIGURE 10.28 Interferometric image.

Reliability
401
A further method to correlate MEMS reliability issues with a particular
MEMS device is the product–reliability issue matrix [48] shown in Figure 10.30.
This matrix correlates the reliability issues for a particular device. It is advanta-
geous for a MEMS designer to consider these issues as the design is conceptually
developed so that reliability problems can be dealt with in the early stages of
design. The devices in each category of the taxonomy have different reliability
issues, with devices from category 4 having the most signiﬁcant reliability issues.
To avoid some of the many issues inherent in category 4 MEMS devices, the
designer should give consideration to alternative devices that avoid rubbing and

impacting surfaces. The use of a compliant mechanism [49] is a design alternative
and philosophy of utilizing devices that ﬂex in order to perform a function vs.
surfaces rubbing, impacting, or sliding.
Reliability-based MEMS design can be accomplished by a disciplined
approach to design and consideration of the reliability aspects of the design. The
reliability of the design can be aided signiﬁcantly by considering the following
items early in the design process:
•
The MEMS device taxonomy and the product–reliability issue matrix
should be considered in the conceptual design of the MEMS device.
•
Design simplicity should be a prime consideration in the device design.
This will generally lead to a reduction in the number of failure modes
of the device (i.e., with fewer parts, less can go wrong).
•
Standard components (i.e., Chapter 4) will reduce time, cost, and the
number of reliability issues. Because a standard component will have
been analyzed, fabricated, and tested, the design is starting from a
known point.
•
Packaging should be given due consideration in the early stages of
design. Packaging can address some of the environmental failure modes
of the device.
•
Failure prevention during design. This is accomplished by performing
thorough failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) and
a fault-tree analysis (FTA) of the MEMS device.
•
Design with the expected manufacture variability in mind. This
involves consideration of the expected range of fabrication tolerances
and operational environments. Use a probabilistic design approach [51]
when the design variables are considered as random variables and the
spectrum of design evaluated.
The main purpose of the FMECA and FTA is to identify and eliminate failure
modes early in the design cycle when they can be most economically dealt with.
The procedure for FMECA is documented in detail and can be found in MIL-
STD-1629A (1980) [50]. The FMECA is a bottom-up procedure that enables
each failure mode of a device to be traced to the effect on the system. The
FMECA takes a pessimistic point of view and assumes design weaknesses exist.
The FMECA worksheet [50] will record the following information for the
analysis:
•
Function: deﬁnition of the function that the device must perform
•
Failure mode: deﬁnition of how the device fails to perform the required
function
•
Failure mechanism: the physical process that causes the failure mode
•
Failure cause: how the failure mechanism is activated

•
Identiﬁcation of effects of higher level systems: whether the failure
model is localized or causes higher level damage
•
Criticality rating: a measure of the severity, probability of failure
occurrence, and detectability used to assign a priority for the subse-
quent actions
Fault-tree analysis (FTA) is a widely used technique for system safety and
reliability analysis. The analysis is a top-down approach that proceeds from a top
level or system event to basic device or component failure causes called primary
events. The fault tree is a graphical model that portrays the combination of events
leading to the top event.
Figure 10.31 is a short example contrasting the application of the FMECA
and FTA approaches to a MEMS accelerometer. The top level events relate to
the accelerometer device performance or lifetime. The primary events are the
root causes of the occurrence of the top level events, possibly through some
intermediate events.

to become one of the prime MEMS commercial success stories. The DMD is a
bistable mirror (Figure 10.32) used in large arrays (Figure 10.33) as the basis of
the TI digital light processing (DLP) technology utilized in optical projection
displays. In order to achieve this commercial success, device performance and
reliability are paramount. 
From the invention of the DMD in 1987 through production development in
1992 to the design enhancement in 2000 when the mirror size was reduced from
a 17- to 14-µm pitch, reliability methods and testing were necessary to achieve

the performance and reliability results enjoyed by the DMD today. The test and
modeling results [52] conclude that the DMD is reliable and robust, with the
following qualities:
•
DMD mean time between failure (MTBF) > 650,000 h
•
DMD lifetime > 100,000 h
•
Hinge lifetime > 3 × 1012 mirror cycles (equivalent to >120,000 oper-
ating h)
•
Environmentally robust
This section will highlight the methods followed to achieve the impressive results
attained.
Texas Instruments chose to utilize a FEMA approach for reliability of the
DMD. (Many times the acronyms FEMA and FEMCA are used interchangeably;
the “C” denotes a criticality analysis of the failure modes identiﬁed.) A compre-
hensive FEMA is a very sizable task, but the results that TI has shown justify its
use. The company considered process techniques, design constraints, packaging
concerns, test issues, and other failure mode contributors. For each failure mode
identiﬁed, failure mechanisms and risk to DMD lifetime and failure were
assessed. TI rigidly adhered to performing the FEMA process on all new DMD
designs, such as the mirror size reduction in 2000.
To perform the testing that was required and identiﬁed from the FEMA analysis,
TI developed a DMD test capability. At the time during which the DMD was under
development, commercially available test equipment was not available. However,
a DMD test system was developed that included an X/Y/theta stage, CCD camera,
optics, and a computer for interpreting the vision data. The DMD test system is
computer controlled to provide ﬂexibility in the test performed and data acquired.
Two examples of tests developed for the DMD are the bias/adhesion mirror
mapping (BAMM) sweep and a solution space characterization technique [54].
The BAMM test is a parametric test utilizing a parameter referred to as the DMD
landing voltage. A typical BAMM curve is a plot of the number of landed mirrors
(i.e., mirrors are tipped as shown in Figure 10.32) vs. mirror bias voltage. For
example, for a mirror bias voltage up to 15 V, no mirrors are landed. Increasing
the bias voltage above 15 V causes an increasing number of mirrors to land to
17 V, where all mirrors are landed. The landing voltage is a function of numerous
process and design parameters and is currently used as a metric of the device
performance measured on every DMD lot. 
The solution space characterization technique [52] is a method of graphical
correlation of multiple parameters that are varied over a signiﬁcant operating range
to show the operating space of the DMD. Performing the solution space character-
ization technique before and after exposing the DMD to an environment or opera-
tional test will provide an indication of how the DMD solution space may have varied.
With the DMD test station and a suite of parametric tests such as the BAMM
and solution space characterization technique developed, a number of possible
failure mechanisms were investigated:

•
Hinge fatigue. The DMD is routinely tested by high-temperature rapid
(i.e., much faster than normal operation) mirror cycling tests. The hinge
is the ﬂexural element ﬂexed during mirror operation (Figure 10.34).
DMDs have demonstrated 3 × 1012 mirror cycles with no hinge fatigue
failures. The conclusion has been that hinge fatigue is not a failure
mode of concern.
•
Hinge memory. Hinge memory occurs when the DMD is operated at
high temperature and high duty cycles (i.e., the amount of time the
mirror is directed to land on one side vs. the other). This mechanism
behaves like metal creep, but surface effects [52] may also contribute.
It has been also noted that hinge memory is not permanent, but revers-
ible in nature. The reversal of the hinge memory is accomplished by
reversing the mirror duty cycle. Hinge memory is the only known life-
limiting failure mode [52] exhibited by the DMD.
•
Metal creep [11,55]. This is the underlying mechanism associated with
the hinge memory failure mode of the DMD. The solution to these
issues involved the development of other Al compounds that were com-
patible with the Al etch processes already characterized and in place.
The new Al compound also needed to have fewer material slip systems
than the existing Al and a higher melting point, which is generally
related to metal creep. This work resulted in a patent [56] for the Al
compounds (e.g., Al3Ti, AlTi, AlN) with etch in the Al etch process.
•
Stiction. The BAMM testing method was also utilized in the stiction
studies for the DMD. For stiction characterization, the mirror release
voltage was the important metric. The stiction forces on the landed

mirror would produce variability in the mirror release voltage; thus,
the BAMM release curves are an indirect measure of mirror-to-surface
adhesion or stiction. Stiction was shown to be not as predictable as
hinge memory. A design modiﬁcation of the spring tips on the DMD
design [53] producing positive force to push the mirror off the substrate
during operation virtually eliminated stiction failures.
•
Environmental testing. Subjected to a full range of shock, vibration,
thermal, ESD, and optical environment tests, the DMD proved to be
quite robust. It proved to be virtually impervious to shock and vibration
due to the mirror size and the high natural frequencies (i.e., >100 kHz).
The only observable damage was the movement of a few particles. 
10.7.2 SANDIA MICROENGINE
Sandia National Laboratories has been involved in the development of MEMS
technology for over 15 years. During that time, they have developed a ﬁve-level
surface micromachined fabrication process, SUMMiT (Sandia ultraplanar,
multilevel MEMS technology) [57] and pursued the development of an array of
mechanical MEMS devices [59–62]. This section provides an overview of the
initial reliability tests of the Sandia microengine and brieﬂy discusses some of
the ongoing work with other MEMS devices and the impact of reliability data
on MEMS device design. 
The Sandia microengine (Figure 10.35) was the primary actuator in some of
the initial Sandia MEMS designs and thus was an appropriate focus for the initial
reliability studies [3]. The microengine consists of two orthogonally oriented
reciprocating electrostatic comb drive actuators and a linkage connecting the
comb drive actuators to a rotating pinion gear, as shown in Figure 10.35. 
The ability to acquire reliability data on a statistically signiﬁcant number of
devices is essential to a reliability program. The creation of the SHiMMeR (Sandia
high-volume measurement of micromachine reliability) system (Figure 10.36)
has allowed acquision of reliability data from a large number of packaged parts
[58,63]. The SHiMMeR system consists of an X–Y gantry table with a travel area
of 500 ×x 540 mm; a video zoom microscope equipped with motorized computer
control; and an electrical stimulus system capable of providing arbitrary wave-
forms of up to 200 V at 10 kHz to 64 24-pin DIP sockets. The optical subsystem
and device packages are contained within a humidity-controlled Plexiglas enclo-
sure. The humidity range can be controlled between 2 to 90% RH. The entire
system is mounted on a vibration isolation table.
The initial reliability test was performed on 41 microengines and was deﬁned
as follows. The engines were operated at 36,000 rpm (chosen to be below the
resonance of the comb drives) for a deﬁned number of revolutions and then
functionality was observed at 60 rpm. The transition was accomplished by decel-
erating in one revolution, momentarily stopping for 1 sec, then accelerating in
one revolution to the observation speed. An assumption in this deﬁnition of
operation is that the deceleration, acceleration, and brief stop of the microengine

do not inﬂuence the ultimate failure and lifetime of the microengine. The failure
criteria were deﬁned as the inability of the microengine to complete a revolution
during the observation period
During the observation period, a pass–fail decision was made; comments on
the motion of functioning engines were made; and video was recorded for post
test analysis. The test lasted for 28 days with a total of 32 separate stress periods.

The initial duration used of high-speed operation was deemed as too short and
the high-speed periods were subsequently increased. 
The progression to failure was similar in most of the microengines observed
[2]. The pinion gear went from rotating smoothly to sticking momentarily but
completing the revolution. These behaviors ultimately led to the pinion gear
oscillating or freezing in one position. All 41 microengines that started the test
eventually failed. The long-term reliability test resulted in over a billion revolu-
tions for the longest running engines with the longest running one operating to
7 billion revolutions. The data showed a decreasing failure rate with no sign of
wear-out (i.e., increasing failure rate) evident. 
Figure 10.37 shows two plots of the instantaneous failure rate (i.e., hazard
function) vs. accumulated cycles curve. Figure 10.37A uses a linear scale, which
shows a decreasing failure rate consistent with the ﬁrst portion of the bathtub
curve. Figure 10.37B, which is plotted on a log–log scale, shows the decreasing

axes. Curve A shows the infant mortality region and curve B shows a more detailed
representation of the decreasing failure rate throughout the life test. (M.S. Rodgers and

tendency in failure rate throughout the test. A straight line can ﬁt through the
data of Figure 10.37B, indicating that a Weibull distribution that can model
decreasing failure rates would be an appropriate model for these data.
Figure 10.37A clearly shows the decreasing failure rate indicative of infant
mortality in which a “weeding out” process occurs. This phenomenon will enable
a burn-in schedule to be developed in which defective parts can be eliminated
from the population. Long-term life tests would need to be performed to assure
that wear-out failures do not occur unacceptably soon.
Figure 10.38 shows the ﬁt of the microengine CDF failure data to the Weibull
distribution model. The resulting ﬁt shows that this is an appropriate model for
the data. The Weibull ﬁt utilized a characteristic life, λ = 66 million cycles, and
a shape parameter, β = 0.22. The characteristic life parameter, λ, is deﬁned as
the point at which 63.2% of the part will have failed. The shape parameter, β, is
an indication of dispersion, with lower values indicating greater dispersion in the
lifetime. “Typical values of β for production-ready electronic and mechanical
products fall in the range of 0.5 to 5” [3,58]. The study summarized here [3,58]
is from a very early design of the microengine, which may be indicative of the
spread in the data. A value of the shape parameter β < 1 corresponds to a
decreasing failure rate.
Figure 10.39 shows the ﬁt of the microengine CDF failure data to the log-
normal distribution model. The resulting ﬁt shows that the lognormal as well as
the Weibull distribution are reasonable models for the data. The lognormal ﬁt
using the two parameters of the lognormal model results in the median lifetime
parameter, t50 = 7.8 million cycles and the standard distribution parameter, σ =
5.2. Once again, a spread is indicated in the data by the high value of the standard
distribution parameter. Also, the lognormal shows an immature design as a result
of the lognormal standard deviation parameter value; this is similar to the result
with the Weibull model. “Typical semiconductor products show lognormal stan-

dard deviations in the range of 0.1 to 1.0” [3,58]. Increasing and decreasing failure
rates cannot be easily discriminated on a lognormal CDF distribution plot such
as shown in Figure 10.39. However, varying failure rate over the lifetime of a
device as conceptually modeled by the bathtub curve are to be expected. 
Upon further examination of the data and replotting (note the semilog scale)
the data, as shown in Figure 10.40, a bimodality of the data can be observed.
The bimodality of the data indicates the presence of two populations within the
data. In fact, two variations of microengines were utilized in the test. The differ-

ence was in the thickness of ﬂexures (i.e., 1 µm wide by 25 µm long vs. 2 µm
wide by 50 µm long) used in the connecting linkage, which correlated with the
population of failures in the bimodal distribution. The lognormal parameters
utilized to ﬁt the two modes are t50 = 2.5 × 108 cycles, σ = 0.8 for the thin ﬂexure
population and t50 = 1.4 × 105 cycles, σ = 1.0 for the thick ﬂexure population.
Upon completion of the reliability studies, failure analysis [3,41] of the failed
devices was performed. Two failure modes were shown to occur. The primary
failure mode was lateral clamping of the comb drive, which occurs where the
moving combs move transverse to the intended direction of motion and short
with the stator combs. The secondary failure mode was the rotating gear sticking
to the hub or substrate. This failure was characterized by the presence of motion
in the comb drives, but no motion in the gear.
10.8 SUMMARY
This chapter has presented an overview of MEMS reliability and issues that
should be considered by the MEMS designer. A brief review of probability theory
and distributions relevant to the analysis of reliability data was also presented.
The three distributions used to analyze and correlate reliability data are the
cumulative probability distribution function (CPDF); probability density function
(PDF); and instantaneous failure rate (hazard function). The bathtub curve is a
plot of the hazard function vs. time and has been shown to be highly relevant to
mechanical and electrical components. Three types of reliability models (i.e.,
Weibull, lognormal, exponential) that can be used to model reliability data were
also discussed. This chapter also presented a review of MEMS failure mechanisms
and measurement methods that can be used to assess the device.
The most important concept that the MEMS design engineer should take
away from this chapter is that reliability must be designed into the device. The
most extensive reliability test program will not improve reliability without a
device redesign to incorporate any information that is learned. The most efﬁcient
(i.e., time, cost) approach is to develop a reliability-based design from the begin-
ning. The steps to achieving a reliability-based design include the following:
•
MEMS device taxonomy
•
Design simplicity
•
Utilize standard components when possible
•
Packaging consideration in the design phase
•
Failure prevention during design via FMECA–FTA analysis 
•
Design with expected manufacturing variability in mind

NOTES
1. Youngs Modulus, E, should be obtained from the speciﬁc fabrication process
utilized. Appendix E and its references can provide approximate values.
2. The area moment of inertia, I, is calculated for the bending axis perpendicular to
the plane of the page.
3. Tables G.2 and G.3 provide methods to calculate I in terms of beam dimensions.
4. These equations were developed [1,2] with Castigliano’s Theorem which included
bending and torsion strain energy terms only. Due to the neglected axial strain
energy terms, the Ky stiffness may be signiﬁcantly underestimated. This will occur
when bending is not the dominant contributor to deﬂection in some truss members.

Appendix H
Appendix H shows the functions and ﬁles to perform Lagrange’s equation and
the SUGAR simulations discussed in Chapter 7. Appendix H.1 and H.2 are the
MATLABfunctions that perform the computations for Lagrange’s equations
(Equation 7.13 and Equation 7.14). LagEqn.m (Appendix H.1) is the main func-
tion, which calls maxderiv.m (Appendix H.2) as necessary. These functions require
MATLAB and the Symbolic Math Toolbox. Appendix sections H.3 through H.7
are the MATLAB ﬁles used for Example 7.1 through Example 7.5. Sections H.8
through H.10 are ﬁles used for the SUGAR simulation in Example 7.6.
