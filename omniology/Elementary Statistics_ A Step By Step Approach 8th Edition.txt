Approach
Elementary Statistics: A Step by Step Approach was written as an aid in the beginning
statistics course to students whose mathematical background is limited to basic algebra.
The book follows a nontheoretical approach without formal proofs, explaining concepts
intuitively and supporting them with abundant examples. The applications span a broad
range of topics certain to appeal to the interests of students of diverse backgrounds
and include problems in business, sports, health, architecture, education, entertainment,
political science, psychology, history, criminal justice, the environment, transportation,
physical sciences, demographics, eating habits, and travel and leisure.
About This
Book
While a number of important changes have been made in the eighth edition, the learning
system remains untouched and provides students with a useful framework in which to
learn and apply concepts. Some of the retained features include the following:
‚Ä¢ Over 1800 exercises are located at the end of major sections within each chapter.
‚Ä¢ Hypothesis-Testing Summaries are found at the end of Chapter 9 (z, t, x2, and
F tests for testing means, proportions, and variances), Chapter 12 (correlation,
chi-square, and ANOVA), and Chapter 13 (nonparametric tests) to show students
the different types of hypotheses and the types of tests to use.
‚Ä¢ A Data Bank listing various attributes (educational level, cholesterol level, gender,
etc.) for 100 people and several additional data sets using real data are included
and referenced in various exercises and projects throughout the book.
‚Ä¢ An updated reference card containing the formulas and the z, t, x2, and PPMC
tables is included with this textbook.
‚Ä¢ End-of-chapter Summaries, Important Terms, and Important Formulas give
students a concise summary of the chapter topics and provide a good source for
quiz or test preparation.
‚Ä¢ Review Exercises are found at the end of each chapter.
‚Ä¢ Special sections called Data Analysis require students to work with a data set to
perform various statistical tests or procedures and then summarize the results. The
data are included in the Data Bank in Appendix D and can be downloaded from
the book‚Äôs website at www.mhhe.com/bluman.
‚Ä¢ Chapter Quizzes, found at the end of each chapter, include multiple-choice,
true/false, and completion questions along with exercises to test students‚Äô
knowledge and comprehension of chapter content.
‚Ä¢ The Appendixes provide students with an essential algebra review, an outline for
report writing, Bayes‚Äô theorem, extensive reference tables, a glossary, and answers
to all quiz questions, all odd-numbered exercises, selected even-numbered
exercises, and an alternate method for using the standard normal distribution.
‚Ä¢ The Applying the Concepts feature is included in all sections and gives students
an opportunity to think about the new concepts and apply them to hypothetical
examples and scenarios similar to those found in newspapers, magazines, and radio
and television news programs.

Preface

Guided Tour: Features 
and Supplements
Each chapter begins with an outline
and a list of learning objectives. The
objectives are repeated at the
beginning of each section to help
students focus on the concepts
presented within that section.
The outline and learning objectives are followed by a
feature titled Statistics Today, in which a real-life
problem shows students the relevance of the
material in the chapter. This problem is subsequently
solved near the end of the chapter by using the
statistical techniques presented in the chapter.
xv
Over 300 examples with detailed solutions
serve as models to help students solve
problems on their own. Examples are solved
by using a step by step explanation, and
illustrations provide a clear display of results
for students.

Statistics and Heredity
An Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel (1822‚Äì1884), studied genetics, and his principles are
the foundation for modern genetics. Mendel used his spare time to grow a variety of peas
at the monastery. One of his many experiments involved crossbreeding peas that had
smooth yellow seeds with peas that had wrinkled green seeds. He noticed that the results
occurred with regularity. That is, some of the offspring had smooth yellow seeds, some
had smooth green seeds, some had wrinkled yellow seeds, and some had wrinkled green
seeds. Furthermore, after several experiments, the percentages of each type seemed to
remain approximately the same. Mendel formulated his theory based on the assumption
of dominant and recessive traits and tried to predict the results. He then crossbred his
peas and examined 556 seeds over the next generation.
Finally, he compared the actual results with the theoretical results to see if his theory
was correct. To do this, he used a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù chi-square test, which is explained in this
chapter. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of this chapter.

Two types of frequency distributions that are most often used are the categorical
frequency distribution and the grouped frequency distribution  The procedures for con
structing these distributions are shown now
Categorical Frequency Distributions
The categorical frequency distribution is used for data that can be placed in speciÔ¨Åc cate
gories, such as nominal or ordinal level data For example, data such as political afÔ¨Åliation,
religious afÔ¨Åliation, or major Ô¨Åeld of study would use categorical frequency distributions

The Speaking of Statistics sections invite
students to think about poll results and other
statistics-related news stories in another
connection between statistics and the real
world.
Historical Notes, Unusual Stats, and
Interesting Facts, located in the margins,
make statistics come alive for the reader.
Rules and deÔ¨Ånitions are set off for easy referencing
by the student.

For Exercises 1 through 13, perform each of the
following steps.
a.
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
b.
Find the critical value(s).
c.
Compute the test value.
d.
Make the decision.
e.
Summarize the results.
Use diagrams to show the critical region (or regions),
and use the traditional method of hypothesis testing
unless otherwise speciÔ¨Åed.
1. Warming and Ice Melt The average depth of the
Hudson Bay is 305 feet. Climatologists were interested
in seeing if the effects of warming and ice melt were
affecting the water level. Fifty-Ô¨Åve measurements over
a period of weeks yielded a sample mean of 306.2 feet.
The population variance is known to be 3.57. Can it be
concluded at the 0.05 level of signiÔ¨Åcance that the
average depth has increased? Is there evidence of what
caused this to happen?
Source: World Almanac and Book of Facts 2010
2. Credit Card Debt It has been reported that the average
credit card debt for college seniors at the college book
store for a speciÔ¨Åc college is $3262. The student senate
at a large university feels that their seniors have a debt
much less than this, so it conducts a study of 50
randomly selected seniors and Ô¨Ånds that the average debt
is $2995, and the population standard deviation is $1100.
With a  0.05, is the student senate correct?
3. RevenueofLargeBusinesses Aresearcherestimates
that the average revenue of the largest businesses in the
United States is greater than $24 billion.Asample of
50 companies is selected, and the revenues (in billions of
dollars) are shown. At a  0.05, is there enough evidence
to support the researcher‚Äôs claim? Assume s  28.7.

4. Moviegoers The average ‚Äúmoviegoer‚Äù sees 8.5 movies
a year. A moviegoer is deÔ¨Åned as a person who sees at
least one movie in a theater in a 12-month period.
A random sample of 40 moviegoers from a large
university revealed that the average number of movies
seen per person was 9.6. The population standard
deviation is 3.2 movies. At the 0.05 level of
signiÔ¨Åcance, can it be concluded that this represents a
difference from the national average?
Source: MPAA Study
5. Nonparental Care According to the Digest of
Educational Statistics, a certain group of preschool
children under the age of one year each spends an
average of 30.9 hours per week in nonparental care. A
study of state university center-based programs indicated
that a random sample of 32 infants spent an average of
32.1 hours per week in their care. The standard deviation
of the population is 3.6 hours. At a  0.01 is there
sufÔ¨Åcient evidence to conclude that the sample mean
differs from the national mean?

Speaking of 
Statistics
Should We Be Afraid of Lightning?
The National Weather Service collects
various types of data about the weather
For example, each year in the United
States about 400 million lightning strikes
occur  On average, 400 people are struck
by lightning, and 85% of those struck
are men  About 100 of these people die
The cause of most of these deaths is not
burns, even though temperatures as

Step 2
Represent the frequency on the y axis and the class boundaries on the x axis
Step 3
Using the frequencies as the heights, draw vertical bars for each class  See
Figure 2 2
As the histogram shows, the class with the greatest number of data values (18) is
109 5 114 5, followed by 13 for 114 5 119 5  The graph also has one peak with the data
clustering around it
The Frequency Polygon
Another way to represent the same data set is by using a frequency polygon
The frequency polygon is a graph that displays the data by using lines that connect
points plotted for the frequencies at the midpoints of the classes  The frequencies are
represented by the heights of the points
Example 2 5 shows the procedure for constructing a frequency polygon

Chapter 8 Hypothesis Testing
Again, remember that nothing is being proved true or false. The statistician is only
stating that there is or is not enough evidence to say that a claim is probably true or false.
As noted previously, the only way to prove something would be to use the entire
population under study, and usually this cannot be done, especially when the population
is large.
P-Value Method for Hypothesis Testing
Statisticians usually test hypotheses at the common a levels of 0.05 or 0.01 and some-
times at 0.10. Recall that the choice of the level depends on the seriousness of the
type I error. Besides listing an a value, many computer statistical packages give a
P-value for hypothesis tests.
The P-value (or probabil ty value) is the probability of getting a sample statistic (such as
the mean) or a more extreme sample statistic in the direction of the alternative hypothesis
when the null hypothesis is true.

Critical Thinking sections at the end of each
chapter challenge students to apply what they have
learned to new situations. The problems presented
are designed to deepen conceptual understanding
and/or to extend topical coverage.
At the end of appropriate sections, Technology Step
by Step boxes show students how to use MINITAB,
the TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus graphing calculators, and
Excel to solve the types of problems covered in the
section. Instructions are presented in numbered steps,
usually in the context of examples‚Äîincluding examples
from the main part of the section. Numerous computer
or calculator screens are displayed, showing
intermediate steps as well as the Ô¨Ånal answer.
Applying the Concepts are exercises found at the
end of each section to reinforce the concepts
explained in the section. They give the student an
opportunity to think about the concepts and apply
them to hypothetical examples similar to real-life
ones found in newspapers, magazines, and
professional journals. Most contain open-ended
questions‚Äîquestions that require interpretation
and may have more than one correct answer. These
exercises can also be used as classroom discussion
topics for instructors who like to use this type of
teaching technique.
Data Projects, which appear at the end of each chapter, further challenge students‚Äô understanding and application of
the material presented in the chapter. Many of these require the student to gather, analyze, and report on real data.

Chapter 4 Probabi ity and Counting Rules
Critical Thinking Challenges
1. Con Man Game Consider this problem: A con man has
3 coins. One coin has been specially made and has a head
on each side. A second coin has been specially made, and
on each side it has a tail. Finally, a third coin has a head
and a tail on it. All coins are of the same denomination.
The con man places the 3 coins in his pocket, selects one,
and shows you one side. It is heads. He is willing to bet
you even money that it is the two-headed coin. His
reasoning is that it can‚Äôt be the two-tailed coin since a
head is showing; therefore, there is a 50-50 chance of it
being the two-headed coin. Would you take the bet? 
(Hint: See Exercise 1 in Data Projects.)
2. de M√©r√© Dice Game Chevalier de M√©r√© won money
when he bet unsuspecting patrons that in 4 rolls of 1 die,
he could get at least one 6; but he lost money when he
bet that in 24 rolls of 2 dice, he could get at least a
double 6. Using the probability rules, Ô¨Ånd the
probability of each event and explain why he won the
majority of the time on the Ô¨Årst game but lost the
majority of the time when playing the second game.
(Hint: Find the probabilities of losing each game and
subtract from 1.)

Determining Normality
There are several ways in which statisticians test a data set for normality. Four are shown here.
Construct a Histogram
Inspect the histogram for
shape.
1. Enter the data in the Ô¨Årst
column of a new
worksheet. Name the
column Inventory.
2. Use Stat>Basic
Statistics>Graphical
Summary presented in
Section 3‚Äì3 to create
the histogram. Is it
symmetric? Is there a
single peak?
Check for Outliers
Inspect the boxplot for outliers. There are no outliers in this graph. Furthermore, the box is in
the middle of the range, and the median is in the middle of the box. Most likely this is not a
skewed distribution either.
Calculate The Pearson CoefÔ¨Åcient of Skewness
The measure of skewness in the graphical summary is not the same as the Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient.
Use the calculator and the formula.
3. Select Calc>Calculator, then type PC in the text box for Store resu t in:.
4. Enter the expression: 3*(MEAN(C1)MEDI(C1))/(STDEV(C1)). Make sure you get all
the parentheses in the right place!
5. Click [OK]. The result, 0.148318, will be stored in the Ô¨Årst row of C2 named PC. Since it
is smaller than 1, the distribution is not skewed.

Applying the Concepts 10‚Äì4
More Math Means More Money
In a study to determine a person‚Äôs yearly income 10 years after high school, it was found that
the two biggest predictors are number of math courses taken and number of hours worked per
week during a person‚Äôs senior year of high school. The multiple regression equation generated
from a sample of 20 individuals is
Let 
represent the number of mathematics courses taken and 
represent hours worked. The
correlation between income and mathematics courses is 0.63. The correlation between income
and hours worked is 0.84, and the correlation between mathematics courses and hours worked
is 0.31. Use this information to answer the following questions.
1. What is the dependent variable?
2. What are the independent variables?
3. What are the multiple regression assumptions?
4. Explain what 4540 and 1290 in the equation tell us.
5. What is the predicted income if a person took 8 math classes and worked 20 hours per
week during her or his senior year in high school?
6. What does a multiple correlation coefÔ¨Åcient of 0.77 mean?
7. Compute R2.
8. Compute the adjusted R2.
9. Would the equation be considered a good predictor of income?
10. What are your conclusions about the relationship among courses taken, hours worked, and
yearly income?
See page 590 for the answers.

1. Business and Finance Use 30 stocks classiÔ¨Åed as the
Dow Jones industrials as the sample. Note the amount
each stock has gained or lost in the last quarter.
Compute the mean and standard deviation for the data
set. Compute the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean
and the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the standard
deviation. Compute the percentage of stocks that had a
gain in the last quarter. Find a 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval
for the percentage of stocks with a gain.
2. Sports and Leisure Use the top home run hitter from
each major league baseball team as the data set. Find
the mean and the standard deviation for the number of
home runs hit by the top hitter on each team. Find a
95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean number of home
runs hit.
3. Technology Use the data collected in data project 3 of
Chapter 2 regarding song lengths. Select a speciÔ¨Åc
genre, and compute the percentage of songs in the
sample that are of that genre. Create a 95% conÔ¨Ådence
interval for the true percentage. Use the entire music
library, and Ô¨Ånd the population percentage of the library
with that genre. Does the population percentage fall
within the conÔ¨Ådence interval?
4. Health and Wellness Use your class as the sample.
Have each student take her or his temperature on a
healthy day. Compute the mean and standard deviation
for the sample. Create a 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for
the mean temperature. Does the conÔ¨Ådence interval
obtained support the long-held belief that the average
body temperature is 98.6	F?
5. Politics and Economics Select Ô¨Åve political polls and
note the margin of error, sample size, and percent
favoring the candidate for each. For each poll,
determine the level of conÔ¨Ådence that must have been
used to obtain the margin of error given, knowing the
percent favoring the candidate and number of
participants. Is there a pattern that emerges?
6. Your Class Have each student compute his or her body
mass index (BMI) (703 times weight in pounds, divided
by the quantity height in inches squared). Find the mean
and standard deviation for the data set. Compute a 95%
conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean BMI of a student. A
BMI score over 30 is considered obese. Does the
conÔ¨Ådence interval indicate that the mean for BMI
could be in the obese range?

Are We Improving Our Diet?
It has been determined that diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower
risk of chronic diseases such as cancer. Nutritionists recommend that Americans consume
Ô¨Åve or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Several researchers from the
Division of Nutrition, the National Center for Chronic Disease Control and Prevention,
the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institutes of Health decided to use statis-
tical procedures to see how much progress is being made toward this goal.
The procedures they used and the results of the study will be explained in this
chapter. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of this chapter.
Introduction
You may be familiar with probability and statistics through radio, television, newspapers,
and magazines. For example, you may have read statements like the following found in
newspapers.
‚Ä¢ Nearly one in seven U.S. families are struggling with bills from medical expenses
even though they have health insurance. (Source: Psychology Today.)
‚Ä¢ Eating 10 grams of Ô¨Åber a day reduces the risk of heart attack by 14%.
(Source: Archives of Internal Medicine, Reader‚Äôs Digest.)
‚Ä¢ Thirty minutes of exercise two or three times each week can raise HDLs by 10% to
15%. (Source: Prevention.)
‚Ä¢ In 2008, the average credit card debt for college students was $3173.
(Source: Newser.com.)
‚Ä¢ About 15% of men in the United States are left-handed and 9% of women are left-
handed. (Source: Scripps Survey Research Center.)
‚Ä¢ The median age of people who watch the Tonight Show with Jay Leno is 48.1.
(Source: Nielsen Media Research.)
Statistics is used in almost all Ô¨Åelds of human endeavor. In sports, for example, a sta-
tistician may keep records of the number of yards a running back gains during a football

game, or the number of hits a baseball player gets in a season. In other areas, such as pub-
lic health, an administrator might be concerned with the number of residents who con-
tract a new strain of Ô¨Çu virus during a certain year. In education, a researcher might want
to know if new methods of teaching are better than old ones. These are only a few exam-
ples of how statistics can be used in various occupations.
Furthermore, statistics is used to analyze the results of surveys and as a tool in sci-
entiÔ¨Åc research to make decisions based on controlled experiments. Other uses of statis-
tics include operations research, quality control, estimation, and prediction.
Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, summarize, analyze,
and draw conclusions from data.
Students study statistics for several reasons:
1. Like professional people, you must be able to read and understand the various
statistical studies performed in your Ô¨Åelds. To have this understanding, you must be
knowledgeable about the vocabulary, symbols, concepts, and statistical procedures
used in these studies.
2. You may be called on to conduct research in your Ô¨Åeld, since statistical procedures
are basic to research. To accomplish this, you must be able to design experiments;
collect, organize, analyze, and summarize data; and possibly make reliable
predictions or forecasts for future use. You must also be able to communicate the
results of the study in your own words.
3. You can also use the knowledge gained from studying statistics to become better
consumers and citizens. For example, you can make intelligent decisions about
what products to purchase based on consumer studies, about government spending
based on utilization studies, and so on.
These reasons can be considered some of the goals for studying statistics.
It is the purpose of this chapter to introduce the goals for studying statistics by
answering questions such as the following:
What are the branches of statistics?
What are data?
How are samples selected?

Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
Objective 
Demonstrate
knowledge of
statistical terms.

To gain knowledge about seemingly haphazard situations, statisticians collect informa-
tion for variables, which describe the situation.
A variable is a characteristic or attribute that can assume different values.
Data are the values (measurements or observations) that the variables can assume.
Variables whose values are determined by chance are called random variables.
Suppose that an insurance company studies its records over the past several years
and determines that, on average, 3 out of every 100 automobiles the company insured
were involved in accidents during a 1-year period. Although there is no way to predict
the speciÔ¨Åc automobiles that will be involved in an accident (random occurrence), the
company can adjust its rates accordingly, since the company knows the general pattern
over the long run. (That is, on average, 3% of the insured automobiles will be involved
in an accident each year.)
A collection of data values forms a data set. Each value in the data set is called a
data value or a datum.
Historical Note
A Scottish landowner
and president of the
Board of Agriculture,
Sir John Sinclair
introduced the word
statistics into the
English language in the
1798 publication of his
book on a statistical
account of Scotland.
The word statistics is
derived from the Latin
word status, which is
loosely deÔ¨Åned as a
statesman. 

Data can be used in different ways. The body of knowledge called statistics is some-
times divided into two main areas, depending on how data are used. The two areas are
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Inferential statistics
Descriptive statistics consists of the collection, organization, summarization, and
presentation of data.
In descriptive statistics the statistician tries to describe a situation. Consider the national
census conducted by the U.S. government every 10 years. Results of this census give you
the average age, income, and other characteristics of the U.S. population. To obtain this
information, the Census Bureau must have some means to collect relevant data. Once data
are collected, the bureau must organize and summarize them. Finally, the bureau needs a
means of presenting the data in some meaningful form, such as charts, graphs, or tables.
The second area of statistics is called inferential statistics.
Inferential statistics consists of generalizing from samples to populations, performing
estimations and hypothesis tests, determining relationships among variables, and making
predictions.
Here, the statistician tries to make inferences from samples to populations. Inferential
statistics uses probability, i.e., the chance of an event occurring. You may be familiar
with the concepts of probability through various forms of gambling. If you play cards,
dice, bingo, or lotteries, you win or lose according to the laws of probability. Probability
theory is also used in the insurance industry and other areas.
It is important to distinguish between a sample and a population.
A population consists of all subjects (human or otherwise) that are being studied.
Most of the time, due to the expense, time, size of population, medical concerns, etc.,
it is not possible to use the entire population for a statistical study; therefore, researchers
use samples.
A sample is a group of subjects selected from a population.
If the subjects of a sample are properly selected, most of the time they should pos-
sess the same or similar characteristics as the subjects in the population. The techniques
used to properly select a sample will be explained in Section 1‚Äì3.
An area of inferential statistics called hypothesis testing is a decision-making
process for evaluating claims about a population, based on information obtained from
samples. For example, a researcher may wish to know if a new drug will reduce the num-
ber of heart attacks in men over 70 years of age. For this study, two groups of men over
70 would be selected. One group would be given the drug, and the other would be given
a placebo (a substance with no medical beneÔ¨Åts or harm). Later, the number of heart
attacks occurring in each group of men would be counted, a statistical test would be run,
and a decision would be made about the effectiveness of the drug.
Statisticians also use statistics to determine relationships among variables. For
example, relationships were the focus of the most noted study in the 20th century,
‚ÄúSmoking and Health,‚Äù published by the Surgeon General of the United States in 1964.
He stated that after reviewing and evaluating the data, his group found a deÔ¨Ånite rela-
tionship between smoking and lung cancer. He did not say that cigarette smoking
actually causes lung cancer, but that there is a relationship between smoking and lung
cancer. This conclusion was based on a study done in 1958 by Hammond and Horn. In
this study, 187,783 men were observed over a period of 45 months. The death rate from

Historical Note
The origin of
descriptive statistics
can be traced to data
collection methods
used in censuses taken
by the Babylonians and
Egyptians between
4500 and 3000 B.C.
In addition, the Roman
Emperor Augustus
(27 B.C.‚ÄîA.D. 17)
conducted surveys
on births and deaths
of the citizens of the
empire, as well as the
number of livestock
each owned and the
crops each citizen
harvested yearly.
Historical Note
Inferential statistics
originated in the
1600s, when John
Graunt published his
book on population
growth, Natural and
Political Observations
Made upon the Bills
of Mortality. About the
same time, another
mathematician/
astronomer, Edmund
Halley, published the
Ô¨Årst complete mortality
tables. (Insurance
companies use
mortality tables to
determine life
insurance rates.)

lung cancer in this group of volunteers was 10 times as great for smokers as for
nonsmokers.
Finally, by studying past and present data and conditions, statisticians try to make
predictions based on this information. For example, a car dealer may look at past sales
records for a speciÔ¨Åc month to decide what types of automobiles and how many of each
type to order for that month next year.

Statistics and the New Planet
In the summer of 2005, astronomers
announced the discovery of a new planet
in our solar system. Astronomers have
dubbed it Xena. They also discovered that
it has a moon that is larger than Pluto.1
Xena is about 9 billion miles from the
Sun. (Some sources say 10 billion.)
Its diameter is about 4200 miles. Its
surface temperature has been estimated
at 400F, and it takes 560 years to circle
the Sun.
How does Xena compare to the other 
planets? Let‚Äôs look at the statistics.

1Some astronomers no longer consider Pluto a planet.
With these statistics, we can make some comparisons. For example, Xena is about the size of the planet Mars, but it
is over 21 times the size of Pluto. (Compare the volumes.) It takes about twice as long to circle the Sun as Pluto. What 
other comparisons can you make?

80 to 90% of the time usually received a B or C in the class. Students who attended class less
than 80% of the time usually received a D or an F or eventually withdrew from the class.
Based on this information, attendance and grades are related. The more you attend class,
the more likely it is you will receive a higher grade. If you improve your attendance, your
grades will probably improve. Many factors affect your grade in a course. One factor that you
have considerable control over is attendance. You can increase your opportunities for learning
by attending class more often.

Variables and Types of Data
As stated in Section 1‚Äì1, statisticians gain information about a particular situation by col-
lecting data for random variables. This section will explore in greater detail the nature of
variables and types of data.
Variables can be classiÔ¨Åed as qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative variables are
variables that can be placed into distinct categories, according to some characteristic or
attribute. For example, if subjects are classiÔ¨Åed according to gender (male or female),
then the variable gender is qualitative. Other examples of qualitative variables are reli-
gious preference and geographic locations.
Quantitative variables are numerical and can be ordered or ranked. For example, the
variable age is numerical, and people can be ranked in order according to the value of their
ages. Other examples of quantitative variables are heights, weights, and body temperatures.
Quantitative variables can be further classiÔ¨Åed into two groups: discrete and contin-
uous. Discrete variables can be assigned values such as 0, 1, 2, 3 and are said to be count-
able. Examples of discrete variables are the number of children in a family, the number
of students in a classroom, and the number of calls received by a switchboard operator
each day for a month.
Discrete variables assume values that can be counted.
Continuous variables, by comparison, can assume an inÔ¨Ånite number of values in an
interval between any two speciÔ¨Åc values. Temperature, for example, is a continuous vari-
able, since the variable can assume an inÔ¨Ånite number of values between any two given
temperatures.
Continuous variables can assume an inÔ¨Ånite number of values between any two speciÔ¨Åc
values. They are obtained by measuring. They often include fractions and decimals.
The classiÔ¨Åcation of variables can be summarized as follows:
Objective 
Identify types of data.

Data
Qualitative
Quantitative
Discrete
Continuous

Since continuous data must be measured, answers must be rounded because of the
limits of the measuring device. Usually, answers are rounded to the nearest given unit.
For example, heights might be rounded to the nearest inch, weights to the nearest ounce,
etc. Hence, a recorded height of 73 inches could mean any measure from 72.5 inches up
to but not including 73.5 inches. Thus, the boundary of this measure is given as 72.5‚Äì73.5
inches. Boundaries are written for convenience as 72.5‚Äì73.5 but are understood to mean
all values up to but not including 73.5. Actual data values of 73.5 would be rounded to
74 and would be included in a class with boundaries of 73.5 up to but not including 74.5,
written as 73.5‚Äì74.5. As another example, if a recorded weight is 86 pounds, the exact
boundaries are 85.5 up to but not including 86.5, written as 85.5‚Äì86.5 pounds. Table 1‚Äì1
helps to clarify this concept. The boundaries of a continuous variable are given in one
additional decimal place and always end with the digit 5.

In addition to being classiÔ¨Åed as qualitative or quantitative, variables can be classiÔ¨Åed
by how they are categorized, counted, or measured. For example, can the data be orga-
nized into speciÔ¨Åc categories, such as area of residence (rural, suburban, or urban)? Can
the data values be ranked, such as Ô¨Årst place, second place, etc.? Or are the values obtained
from measurement, such as heights, IQs, or temperature? This type of classiÔ¨Åcation‚Äîi.e.,
how variables are categorized, counted, or measured‚Äîuses measurement scales, and
four common types of scales are used: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
The Ô¨Årst level of measurement is called the nominal level of measurement. A sample
of college instructors classiÔ¨Åed according to subject taught (e.g., English, history, psy-
chology, or mathematics) is an example of nominal-level measurement. Classifying
survey subjects as male or female is another example of nominal-level measurement.
No ranking or order can be placed on the data. Classifying residents according to zip
codes is also an example of the nominal level of measurement. Even though numbers
are assigned as zip codes, there is no meaningful order or ranking. Other examples of
nominal-level data are political party (Democratic, Republican, Independent, etc.), reli-
gion (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc.), and marital status (single, married, divorced,
widowed, separated).
The nominal level of measurement classiÔ¨Åes data into mutually exclusive (nonover-
lapping) categories in which no order or ranking can be imposed on the data.
The next level of measurement is called the ordinal level. Data measured at this level
can be placed into categories, and these categories can be ordered, or ranked. For exam-
ple, from student evaluations, guest speakers might be ranked as superior, average, or
poor. Floats in a homecoming parade might be ranked as Ô¨Årst place, second place, etc.
Note that precise measurement of differences in the ordinal level of measurement does not
exist. For instance, when people are classiÔ¨Åed according to their build (small, medium, or
large), a large variation exists among the individuals in each class.

Other examples of ordinal data are letter grades (A, B, C, D, F).
The ordinal level of measurement classiÔ¨Åes data into categories that can be ranked;
however, precise differences between the ranks do not exist.
The third level of measurement is called the interval level. This level differs from
the ordinal level in that precise differences do exist between units. For example, many
standardized psychological tests yield values measured on an interval scale. IQ is an
example of such a variable. There is a meaningful difference of 1 point between an IQ
of 109 and an IQ of 110. Temperature is another example of interval measurement, since
there is a meaningful difference of 1F between each unit, such as 72 and 73F. One
property is lacking in the interval scale: There is no true zero. For example, IQ tests do
not measure people who have no intelligence. For temperature, 0F does not mean no
heat at all.
The interval level of measurement ranks data, and precise differences between units
of measure do exist; however, there is no meaningful zero.
The Ô¨Ånal level of measurement is called the ratio level. Examples of ratio scales are
those used to measure height, weight, area, and number of phone calls received. Ratio
scales have differences between units (1 inch, 1 pound, etc.) and a true zero. In addition,
the ratio scale contains a true ratio between values. For example, if one person can lift
200 pounds and another can lift 100 pounds, then the ratio between them is 2 to 1. Put
another way, the Ô¨Årst person can lift twice as much as the second person.
The ratio level of measurement possesses all the characteristics of interval
measurement, and there exists a true zero. In addition, true ratios exist when the same
variable is measured on two different members of the population.
There is not complete agreement among statisticians about the classiÔ¨Åcation of data
into one of the four categories. For example, some researchers classify IQ data as ratio
data rather than interval. Also, data can be altered so that they Ô¨Åt into a different category.
For instance, if the incomes of all professors of a college are classiÔ¨Åed into the three
categories of low, average, and high, then a ratio variable becomes an ordinal variable.
Table 1‚Äì2 gives some examples of each type of data.

When data were Ô¨Årst

by Karl Pearson and

all were continuous
data. In 1899, Pearson
began to analyze
discrete data. Pearson
found that some data,
such as eye color,
could not be
measured, so he
termed such data
nominal data. Ordinal
data were introduced
by a German
numerologist Frederich
Mohs in 1822 when he
introduced a hardness
scale for minerals. For
example, the hardest
stone is the diamond,
which he assigned a
hardness value of
1500. Quartz was
assigned a hardness
value of 100. This does
not mean that a
diamond is 15 times
harder than quartz. It
only means that a
diamond is harder than
quartz. In 1947, a
psychologist named
Stanley Smith Stevens
made a further division
of continuous data into
two categories, namely,
interval and ratio.

Data Collection and Sampling Techniques
In research, statisticians use data in many different ways. As stated previously, data can
be used to describe situations or events. For example, a manufacturer might want to know
something about the consumers who will be purchasing his product so he can plan an
effective marketing strategy. In another situation, the management of a company might
survey its employees to assess their needs in order to negotiate a new contract with the
employees‚Äô union. Data can be used to determine whether the educational goals of a
school district are being met. Finally, trends in various areas, such as the stock market,
can be analyzed, enabling prospective buyers to make more intelligent decisions con-
cerning what stocks to purchase. These examples illustrate a few situations where col-
lecting data will help people make better decisions on courses of action.
Data can be collected in a variety of ways. One of the most common methods is
through the use of surveys. Surveys can be done by using a variety of methods. Three of
the most common methods are the telephone survey, the mailed questionnaire, and the
personal interview.
Telephone surveys have an advantage over personal interview surveys in that they
are less costly. Also, people may be more candid in their opinions since there is no face-
to-face contact. A major drawback to the telephone survey is that some people in the pop-
ulation will not have phones or will not answer when the calls are made; hence, not all
people have a chance of being surveyed. Also, many people now have unlisted numbers
and cell phones, so they cannot be surveyed. Finally, even the tone of the voice of the
interviewer might inÔ¨Çuence the response of the person who is being interviewed.
Mailed questionnaire surveys can be used to cover a wider geographic area than tele-
phone surveys or personal interviews since mailed questionnaire surveys are less expen-
sive to conduct. Also, respondents can remain anonymous if they desire. Disadvantages
Objective

of mailed questionnaire surveys include a low number of responses and inappropriate
answers to questions. Another drawback is that some people may have difÔ¨Åculty reading
or understanding the questions.
Personal interview surveys have the advantage of obtaining in-depth responses to
questions from the person being interviewed. One disadvantage is that interviewers must
be trained in asking questions and recording responses, which makes the personal inter-
view survey more costly than the other two survey methods. Another disadvantage is that
the interviewer may be biased in his or her selection of respondents.
Data can also be collected in other ways, such as surveying records or direct obser-
vation of situations.
As stated in Section 1‚Äì1, researchers use samples to collect data and information
about a particular variable from a large population. Using samples saves time and money
and in some cases enables the researcher to get more detailed information about a par-
ticular subject. Samples cannot be selected in haphazard ways because the information
obtained might be biased. For example, interviewing people on a street corner during the
day would not include responses from people working in ofÔ¨Åces at that time or from
people attending school; hence, not all subjects in a particular population would have
a chance of being selected.
To obtain samples that are unbiased‚Äîi.e., that give each subject in the population
an equally likely chance of being selected‚Äîstatisticians use four basic methods of
sampling: random, systematic, stratiÔ¨Åed, and cluster sampling.
Random Sampling
Random samples are selected by using chance methods or random numbers. One such
method is to number each subject in the population. Then place numbered cards in
a bowl, mix them thoroughly, and select as many cards as needed. The subjects
whose numbers are selected constitute the sample. Since it is difÔ¨Åcult to mix the cards

Historical Note
A pioneer in census
taking was Pierre-
Simon de Laplace. In
1780, he developed
the Laplace method
of estimating the
population of a
country. The principle
behind his method
was to take a census
of a few selected
communities and to
determine the ratio of
the population to the
number of births in
these communities.
(Good birth records
were kept.) This ratio
would be used to
multiply the number
of births in the entire
country to estimate the
number of citizens in
the country.

The Ô¨Årst census in the
United States was
conducted in 1790. Its
purpose was to insure
proper Congressional
representation.

thoroughly, there is a chance of obtaining a biased sample. For this reason, statisticians
use another method of obtaining numbers. They generate random numbers with a com-
puter or calculator. Before the invention of computers, random numbers were obtained
from tables.
Some two-digit random numbers are shown in Table 1‚Äì3. To select a random sample
of, say, 15 subjects out of 85 subjects, it is necessary to number each subject from 01 to 85.
Then select a starting number by closing your eyes and placing your Ô¨Ånger on a number
in the table. (Although this may sound somewhat unusual, it enables us to Ô¨Ånd a starting
number at random.) In this case suppose your Ô¨Ånger landed on the number 12 in the sec-
ond column. (It is the sixth number down from the top.) Then proceed downward until
you have selected 15 different numbers between 01 and 85. When you reach the bottom
of the column, go to the top of the next column. If you select a number greater than 85
or the number 00 or a duplicate number, just omit it. In our example, we will use the
subjects numbered 12, 27, 75, 62, 57, 13, 31, 06, 16, 49, 46, 71, 53, 41, and 02. A more
detailed procedure for selecting a random sample using a table of random numbers is
given in Chapter 14, using Table D in Appendix C.
Systematic Sampling
Researchers obtain systematic samples by numbering each subject of the population and
then selecting every kth subject. For example, suppose there were 2000 subjects in the
population and a sample of 50 subjects were needed. Since 2000  50  40, then k  40,
and every 40th subject would be selected; however, the Ô¨Årst subject (numbered between
1 and 40) would be selected at random. Suppose subject 12 were the Ô¨Årst subject selected;
then the sample would consist of the subjects whose numbers were 12, 52, 92, etc., until
50 subjects were obtained. When using systematic sampling, you must be careful about
how the subjects in the population are numbered. If subjects were arranged in a manner

reported that researchers from Washington
University of Medicine studied the diets
of 48 adult weight loss participants. They
used food diaries, exercise monitors,
and weigh-ins. They found that the
participants ate an average of 236 more
calories on Saturdays than they did on the
other weekdays. This would amount to a
weight gain of 9 pounds per year. So if
you are watching your diet, be careful on
Saturdays.

What type of variables are used here?

such as wife, husband, wife, husband, and every 40th subject were selected, the sample
would consist of all husbands. Numbering is not always necessary. For example, a
researcher may select every tenth item from an assembly line to test for defects.
StratiÔ¨Åed Sampling
Researchers obtain stratiÔ¨Åed samples by dividing the population into groups (called
strata) according to some characteristic that is important to the study, then sampling from
each group. Samples within the strata should be randomly selected. For example, sup-
pose the president of a two-year college wants to learn how students feel about a certain
issue. Furthermore, the president wishes to see if the opinions of the Ô¨Årst-year students
differ from those of the second-year students. The president will randomly select students
from each group to use in the sample.
Cluster Sampling
Researchers also use cluster samples. Here the population is divided into groups called
clusters by some means such as geographic area or schools in a large school district, etc.
Then the researcher randomly selects some of these clusters and uses all members of the
selected clusters as the subjects of the samples. Suppose a researcher wishes to survey
apartment dwellers in a large city. If there are 10 apartment buildings in the city, the
researcher can select at random 2 buildings from the 10 and interview all the residents of
these buildings. Cluster sampling is used when the population is large or when it involves
subjects residing in a large geographic area. For example, if one wanted to do a study
involving the patients in the hospitals in New York City, it would be very costly and
time-consuming to try to obtain a random sample of patients since they would be spread
over a large area. Instead, a few hospitals could be selected at random, and the patients
in these hospitals would be interviewed in a cluster.
The four basic sampling methods are summarized in Table 1‚Äì4.
Other Sampling Methods
In addition to the four basic sampling methods, researchers use other methods to obtain
samples. One such method is called a convenience sample. Here a researcher uses

subjects that are convenient. For example, the researcher may interview subjects enter-
ing a local mall to determine the nature of their visit or perhaps what stores they will be
patronizing. This sample is probably not representative of the general customers for
several reasons. For one thing, it was probably taken at a speciÔ¨Åc time of day, so not all
customers entering the mall have an equal chance of being selected since they were not
there when the survey was being conducted. But convenience samples can be represen-
tative of the population. If the researcher investigates the characteristics of the popula-
tion and determines that the sample is representative, then it can be used.
Other sampling techniques, such as sequential sampling, double sampling, and multi-
stage sampling, are explained in Chapter 14, along with a more detailed explanation of the
four basic sampling techniques.

Summary of Sampling Methods
Random
Subjects are selected by random numbers.
Systematic
Subjects are selected by using every kth number after the Ô¨Årst subject is
randomly selected from 1 through k.
StratiÔ¨Åed
Subjects are selected by dividing up the population into groups (strata), and
subjects are randomly selected within groups.
Cluster
Subjects are selected by using an intact group that is representative of the
population.

For example, data from the Motorcycle Industry Council (USA TODAY) stated that
‚ÄúMotorcycle owners are getting older and richer.‚Äù Data were collected on the ages and
incomes of motorcycle owners for the years 1980 and 1998 and then compared. The Ô¨Ånd-
ings showed considerable differences in the ages and incomes of motorcycle owners for
the two years.
In this study, the researcher merely observed what had happened to the motorcycle
owners over a period of time. There was no type of research intervention.
In an experimental study, the researcher manipulates one of the variables and tries to
determine how the manipulation inÔ¨Çuences other variables.
For example, a study conducted at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and presented in
Psychology Today divided female undergraduate students into two groups and had the
students perform as many sit-ups as possible in 90 sec. The Ô¨Årst group was told only to
‚ÄúDo your best,‚Äù while the second group was told to try to increase the actual number of
sit-ups done each day by 10%. After four days, the subjects in the group who were given
the vague instructions to ‚ÄúDo your best‚Äù averaged 43 sit-ups, while the group that was
given the more speciÔ¨Åc instructions to increase the number of sit-ups by 10% averaged
56 sit-ups by the last day‚Äôs session. The conclusion then was that athletes who were given
speciÔ¨Åc goals performed better than those who were not given speciÔ¨Åc goals.
This study is an example of a statistical experiment since the researchers intervened
in the study by manipulating one of the variables, namely, the type of instructions given
to each group.
In a true experimental study, the subjects should be assigned to groups randomly.
Also, the treatments should be assigned to the groups at random. In the sit-up study, the
article did not mention whether the subjects were randomly assigned to the groups.
Sometimes when random assignment is not possible, researchers use intact groups.
These types of studies are done quite often in education where already intact groups are
available in the form of existing classrooms. When these groups are used, the study is said
to be a quasi-experimental study. The treatments, though, should be assigned at random.
Most articles do not state whether random assignment of subjects was used.
Statistical studies usually include one or more independent variables and one depen-
dent variable.
The independent variable in an experimental study is the one that is being manipulated
by the researcher. The independent variable is also called the explanatory variable.
The resultant variable is called the dependent variable or the outcome variable.
The outcome variable is the variable that is studied to see if it has changed signiÔ¨Åcantly
due to the manipulation of the independent variable. For example, in the sit-up study, the
researchers gave the groups two different types of instructions, general and speciÔ¨Åc. Hence,
the independent variable is the type of instruction. The dependent variable, then, is the
resultant variable, that is, the number of sit-ups each group was able to perform after four
days of exercise. If the differences in the dependent or outcome variable are large and other
factors are equal, these differences can be attributed to the manipulation of the independent
variable. In this case, speciÔ¨Åc instructions were shown to increase athletic performance.
In the sit-up study, there were two groups. The group that received the special
instruction is called the treatment group while the other is called the control group. The
treatment group receives a speciÔ¨Åc treatment (in this case, instructions for improvement)
while the control group does not.
Both types of statistical studies have advantages and disadvantages. Experimental
studies have the advantage that the researcher can decide how to select subjects and how
to assign them to speciÔ¨Åc groups. The researcher can also control or manipulate the

independent variable. For example, in studies that require the subjects to consume a certain
amount of medicine each day, the researcher can determine the precise dosages and, if
necessary, vary the dosage for the groups.
There are several disadvantages to experimental studies. First, they may occur in
unnatural settings, such as laboratories and special classrooms. This can lead to several
problems. One such problem is that the results might not apply to the natural setting. The
age-old question then is, ‚ÄúThis mouthwash may kill 10,000 germs in a test tube, but how
many germs will it kill in my mouth?‚Äù
Another disadvantage with an experimental study is the Hawthorne effect. This
effect was discovered in 1924 in a study of workers at the Hawthorne plant of the Western
Electric Company. In this study, researchers found that the subjects who knew they were
participating in an experiment actually changed their behavior in ways that affected the
results of the study.
Another problem is called confounding of variables.
A confounding variable is one that inÔ¨Çuences the dependent or outcome variable but
was not separated from the independent variable.
Researchers try to control most variables in a study, but this is not possible in some
studies. For example, subjects who are put on an exercise program might also improve
their diet unbeknownst to the researcher and perhaps improve their health in other ways
not due to exercise alone. Then diet becomes a confounding variable.
Observational studies also have advantages and disadvantages. One advantage of an
observational study is that it usually occurs in a natural setting. For example, researchers
can observe people‚Äôs driving patterns on streets and highways in large cities. Another
advantage of an observational study is that it can be done in situations where it would be
unethical or downright dangerous to conduct an experiment. Using observational studies,
researchers can study suicides, rapes, murders, etc. In addition, observational studies can
be done using variables that cannot be manipulated by the researcher, such as drug users
versus nondrug users and right-handedness versus left-handedness.
Observational studies have disadvantages, too. As mentioned previously, since the
variables are not controlled by the researcher, a deÔ¨Ånite cause-and-effect situation cannot
be shown since other factors may have had an effect on the results. Observational studies
can be expensive and time-consuming. For example, if one wanted to study the habitat of
lions in Africa, one would need a lot of time and money, and there would be a certain
amount of danger involved. Finally, since the researcher may not be using his or her own
measurements, the results could be subject to the inaccuracies of those who collected the
data. For example, if the researchers were doing a study of events that occurred in
the 1800s, they would have to rely on information and records obtained by others from a
previous era. There is no way to ensure the accuracy of these records.
When you read the results of statistical studies, decide if the study was observational
or experimental. Then see if the conclusion follows logically, based on the nature of these
studies.
No matter what type of study is conducted, two studies on the same subject some-
times have conÔ¨Çicting conclusions. Why might this occur? An article entitled ‚ÄúBottom
Line: Is It Good for You?‚Äù (USA TODAY Weekend ) states that in the 1960s studies sug-
gested that margarine was better for the heart than butter since margarine contains less
saturated fat and users had lower cholesterol levels. In a 1980 study, researchers found
that butter was better than margarine since margarine contained trans-fatty acids, which
are worse for the heart than butter‚Äôs saturated fat. Then in a 1998 study, researchers found
that margarine was better for a person‚Äôs health. Now, what is to be believed? Should one
use butter or margarine?

The answer here is that you must take a closer look at these studies. Actually, it is
not a choice between butter or margarine that counts, but the type of margarine used. In
the 1980s, studies showed that solid margarine contains trans-fatty acids, and scientists
believe that they are worse for the heart than butter‚Äôs saturated fat. In the 1998 study, liq-
uid margarine was used. It is very low in trans-fatty acids, and hence it is more healthful
than butter because trans-fatty acids have been shown to raise cholesterol. Hence, the
conclusion is to use liquid margarine instead of solid margarine or butter.
Before decisions based on research studies are made, it is important to get all the
facts and examine them in light of the particular situation.
Applying the Concepts 1‚Äì4
Just a Pinch Between Your Cheek and Gum
As the evidence on the adverse effects of cigarette smoke grew, people tried many different
ways to quit smoking. Some people tried chewing tobacco or, as it was called, smokeless
tobacco. A small amount of tobacco was placed between the cheek and gum. Certain
chemicals from the tobacco were absorbed into the bloodstream and gave the sensation of
smoking cigarettes. This prompted studies on the adverse effects of smokeless tobacco.
One study in particular used 40 university students as subjects. Twenty were given smokeless
tobacco to chew, and twenty given a substance that looked and tasted like smokeless tobacco,
but did not contain any of the harmful substances. The students were randomly assigned to
one of the groups. The students‚Äô blood pressure and heart rate were measured before they
started chewing and 20 minutes after they had been chewing. A signiÔ¨Åcant increase in heart
rate occurred in the group that chewed the smokeless tobacco. Answer the following 
questions.
1. What type of study was this (observational, quasi-experimental, or experimental)?
2. What are the independent and dependent variables?
3. Which was the treatment group?
4. Could the students‚Äô blood pressures be affected by knowing that they are part of 
a study?
5. List some possible confounding variables.
6. Do you think this is a good way to study the effect of smokeless tobacco?

Uses and Misuses of Statistics
As explained previously, statistical techniques can be used to describe data, compare two
or more data sets, determine if a relationship exists between variables, test hypotheses,
and make estimates about population characteristics. However, there is another aspect of
statistics, and that is the misuse of statistical techniques to sell products that don‚Äôt work
properly, to attempt to prove something true that is really not true, or to get our attention
by using statistics to evoke fear, shock, and outrage.
There are two sayings that have been around for a long time that illustrate this point:
‚ÄúThere are three types of lies‚Äîlies, damn lies, and statistics.‚Äù
‚ÄúFigures don‚Äôt lie, but liars Ô¨Ågure.‚Äù
Objective 
Explain how statistics
can be used and
misused.

Just because we read or hear the results of a research study or an opinion poll in the
media, this does not mean that these results are reliable or that they can be applied to any
and all situations. For example, reporters sometimes leave out critical details such as the
size of the sample used or how the research subjects were selected. Without this infor-
mation, you cannot properly evaluate the research and properly interpret the conclusions
of the study or survey.
It is the purpose of this section to show some ways that statistics can be misused. You
should not infer that all research studies and surveys are suspect, but that there are many
factors to consider when making decisions based on the results of research studies and
surveys. Here are some ways that statistics can be misrepresented.
Suspect Samples
The Ô¨Årst thing to consider is the sample that was used in the research study. Sometimes
researchers use very small samples to obtain information. Several years ago, advertise-
ments contained such statements as ‚ÄúThree out of four doctors surveyed recommend
brand such and such.‚Äù If only 4 doctors were surveyed, the results could have been
obtained by chance alone; however, if 100 doctors were surveyed, the results might be
quite different.
Not only is it important to have a sample size that is large enough, but also it is
necessary to see how the subjects in the sample were selected. Studies using volunteers
sometimes have a built-in bias. Volunteers generally do not represent the population at
large. Sometimes they are recruited from a particular socioeconomic background, and
sometimes unemployed people volunteer for research studies to get a stipend. Studies
that require the subjects to spend several days or weeks in an environment other than
their home or workplace automatically exclude people who are employed and cannot
take time away from work. Sometimes only college students or retirees are used in
studies. In the past, many studies have used only men, but have attempted to general-
ize the results to both men and women. Opinion polls that require a person to phone
or mail in a response most often are not representative of the population in general,
since only those with strong feelings for or against the issue usually call or respond
by mail.
Another type of sample that may not be representative is the convenience sample.
Educational studies sometimes use students in intact classrooms since it is convenient.
Quite often, the students in these classrooms do not represent the student population of
the entire school district.
When results are interpreted from studies using small samples, convenience sam-
ples, or volunteer samples, care should be used in generalizing the results to the entire
population.
Ambiguous Averages
In Chapter 3, you will learn that there are four commonly used measures that are loosely
called averages. They are the mean, median, mode, and midrange. For the same data set,
these averages can differ markedly. People who know this can, without lying, select the
one measure of average that lends the most evidence to support their position.
Changing the Subject
Another type of statistical distortion can occur when different values are used to repre-
sent the same data. For example, one political candidate who is running for reelection
Section 1‚Äì5 Uses and Misuses of Statistics
17
1‚Äì17

might say, ‚ÄúDuring my administration, expenditures increased a mere 3%.‚Äù His oppo-
nent, who is trying to unseat him, might say, ‚ÄúDuring my opponent‚Äôs administration,
expenditures have increased a whopping $6,000,000.‚Äù Here both Ô¨Ågures are correct;
however, expressing a 3% increase as $6,000,000 makes it sound like a very large
increase. Here again, ask yourself, Which measure better represents the data?
Detached Statistics
A claim that uses a detached statistic is one in which no comparison is made. For exam-
ple, you may hear a claim such as ‚ÄúOur brand of crackers has one-third fewer calories.‚Äù
Here, no comparison is made. One-third fewer calories than what? Another example is a
claim that uses a detached statistic such as ‚ÄúBrand A aspirin works four times faster.‚Äù
Four times faster than what? When you see statements such as this, always ask yourself,
Compared to what?
Implied Connections
Many claims attempt to imply connections between variables that may not actually exist.
For example, consider the following statement: ‚ÄúEating Ô¨Åsh may help to reduce your
cholesterol.‚Äù Notice the words may help. There is no guarantee that eating Ô¨Åsh will def-
initely help you reduce your cholesterol.
‚ÄúStudies suggest that using our exercise machine will reduce your weight.‚Äù Here the
word suggest is used; and again, there is no guarantee that you will lose weight by using
the exercise machine advertised.
Another claim might say, ‚ÄúTaking calcium will lower blood pressure in some
people.‚Äù Note the word some is used. You may not be included in the group of ‚Äúsome‚Äù
people. Be careful when you draw conclusions from claims that use words such as may,
in some people, and might help.
Misleading Graphs
Statistical graphs give a visual representation of data that enables viewers to analyze and
interpret data more easily than by simply looking at numbers. In Chapter 2, you will see
how some graphs are used to represent data. However, if graphs are drawn inappropri-
ately, they can misrepresent the data and lead the reader to draw false conclusions. The
misuse of graphs is also explained in Chapter 2.
Faulty Survey Questions
When analyzing the results of a survey using questionnaires, you should be sure that
the questions are properly written since the way questions are phrased can often inÔ¨Çu-
ence the way people answer them. For example, the responses to a question such as
‚ÄúDo you feel that the North Huntingdon School District should build a new football
stadium?‚Äù might be answered differently than a question such as ‚ÄúDo you favor increas-
ing school taxes so that the North Huntingdon School District can build a new football
stadium?‚Äù Each question asks something a little different, and the responses could be
radically different. When you read and interpret the results obtained from question-
naire surveys, watch out for some of these common mistakes made in the writing of the
survey questions.
In Chapter 14, you will Ô¨Ånd some common ways that survey questions could be
misinterpreted by those responding and could therefore result in incorrect conclusions.

In the past, statistical calculations were done with pencil and paper. However, with the
advent of calculators, numerical computations became much easier. Computers do all
the numerical calculation. All one does is to enter the data into the computer and use
the appropriate command; the computer will print the answer or display it on the screen.
Now the TI-83 Plus or TI-84 Plus graphing calculator accomplishes the same thing.
There are many statistical packages available; this book uses MINITAB and Microsoft
Excel. Instructions for using MINITAB, the TI-83 Plus or TI-84 Plus graphing calculator,
and Excel have been placed at the end of each relevant section, in subsections entitled
Technology Step by Step.
You should realize that the computer and calculator merely give numerical answers
and save the time and effort of doing calculations by hand. You are still responsible for
understanding and interpreting each statistical concept. In addition, you should realize
that the results come from the data and do not appear magically on the computer. Doing
calculations using the procedure tables will help you reinforce this idea.
The author has left it up to instructors to choose how much technology they will
incorporate into the course.

To restate the premise of this section, statistics, when used properly, can be beneÔ¨Åcial
in obtaining much information, but when used improperly, can lead to much misinfor-
mation. It is like your automobile. If you use your automobile to get to school or work or
to go on a vacation, that‚Äôs good. But if you use it to run over your neighbor‚Äôs dog because
it barks all night long and tears up your Ô¨Çower garden, that‚Äôs not so good!

Summary*
‚Ä¢ The two major areas of statistics are descriptive and inferential. Descriptive
statistics includes the collection, organization, summarization, and presentation of
data. Inferential statistics includes making inferences from samples to populations,
estimations and hypothesis testing, determining relationships, and making
predictions. Inferential statistics is based on probability theory. (1‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Data can be classiÔ¨Åed as qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative data can be either
discrete or continuous, depending on the values they can assume. Data can also be
measured by various scales. The four basic levels of measurement are nominal,
ordinal, interval, and ratio. (1‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ Since in most cases the populations under study are large, statisticians use subgroups
called samples to get the necessary data for their studies. There are four basic
methods used to obtain samples: random, systematic, stratiÔ¨Åed, and cluster. (1‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ There are two basic types of statistical studies: observational studies and
experimental studies. When conducting observational studies, researchers observe
what is happening or what has happened and then draw conclusions based on these
observations. They do not attempt to manipulate the variables in any way. (1‚Äì4)
‚Ä¢ When conducting an experimental study, researchers manipulate one or more of the
independent or explanatory variables and see how this manipulation inÔ¨Çuences the
dependent or outcome variable. (1‚Äì4)
‚Ä¢ Finally, the applications of statistics are
many and varied. People encounter
them in everyday life, such as in
reading newspapers or magazines,
listening to the radio, or watching
television. Since statistics is used in
almost every Ô¨Åeld of endeavor, the
educated individual should be
knowledgeable about the vocabulary,
concepts, and procedures of statistics.
Also, everyone should be aware that
statistics can be misused. (1‚Äì5)
‚Ä¢ Today, computers and calculators are
used extensively in statistics to facilitate
the computations. (1‚Äì6)

smoking during pregnancy is responsible for criminal
behavior in people? (1‚Äì5) No. There are many other factors
that contribute to criminal behavior.
29. Caffeine and Health In the 1980s, a study linked
coffee to a higher risk of heart disease and pancreatic
cancer. In the early 1990s, studies showed that drinking
coffee posed minimal health threats. However, in 1994,
a study showed that pregnant women who drank 3 or
more cups of tea daily may be at risk for spontaneous
abortion. In 1998, a study claimed that women who
drank more than a half-cup of caffeinated tea every day
may actually increase their fertility. In 1998, a study
showed that over a lifetime, a few extra cups of coffee
a day can raise blood pressure, heart rate, and stress
(Source: ‚ÄúBottom Line: Is It Good for You? Or Bad?‚Äù
by Monika Guttman, USA TODAY Weekend ). Suggest
some reasons why these studies appear to be conÔ¨Çicting.
(1‚Äì5) Possible answer: It could be the amount of caffeine in the
coffee or tea. It could have been the brewing method.

Are We Improving Our Diet?‚ÄîRevisited
Researchers selected a sample of 23,699 adults in the United States, using phone numbers 
selected at random, and conducted a telephone survey. All respondents were asked six questions:
1. How often do you drink juices such as orange, grapefruit, or tomato?
2. Not counting juice, how often do you eat fruit?
3. How often do you eat green salad?
4. How often do you eat potatoes (not including french fries, fried potatoes, or potato chips)?
5. How often do you eat carrots?
6. Not counting carrots, potatoes, or salad, how many servings of vegetables do you
usually eat?
Researchers found that men consumed fewer servings of fruits and vegetables per day
(3.3) than women (3.7). Only 20% of the population consumed the recommended 5 or more
daily servings. In addition, they found that youths and less-educated people consumed an even
lower amount than the average.
Based on this study, they recommend that greater educational efforts be undertaken to
improve fruit and vegetable consumption by Americans and to provide environmental and
institutional support to encourage increased consumption.

 Assistant psychology professors 
David 
DeSteno 
at 
Northeastern 
University in Boston and Nilanjana 
Dasgupta 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Massachusetts, Amherst, randomly 
divided 81 study participants into two 
groups and assigned them a writing 
task designed to induce angry, sad or 
neutral feelings. In a subsequent test 
to uncover nonconscious associations, 
angry subjects were quicker to connect 
negatively charged words‚Äîlike war, 
death and vomit‚Äîwith members of the 
opposite group‚Äîeven though the 
groupings were completely arbitrary.
 ‚ÄúThese automatic responses guide        
our behavior when we‚Äôre not paying 
attention,‚Äù says DeSteno, and they can 
lead to discriminatory acts when there 
is pressure to make a quick decision. 
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre aware that your emotions

he says, ‚Äúyou should take time to

ggressive 
children 
may 
be     
destined for later long-term 
unemployment. In a study that began     
in 1968, researchers at the University     
of Jyvaskyla in Finland examined     
about 300 participants at ages              
8, 14, 27, and 36. They looked for 
aggressive behaviors like hurting       
other children, kicking objects when 
angry, or attacking others without 
reason.
  Their results, published recently in 
the International Journal of Behavioral 
Development, suggest that children     
with low self-control of emotion 
‚Äîespecially 
aggression‚Äîwere 
significantly more prone to long-term 
unemployment. 
Children 
with 
behavioral 
inhibitions‚Äîsuch 
as 
passive  and anxious behaviors‚Äîwere
also indirectly linked to unemployment 
as they lacked the preliminary initiative 
needed for school success. And while 
unemployment rates were high in 
Finland during the last data collection, 
jobless 
participants 
who 
were 
aggressive as children were less likely 
to have a job two years later than their 
nonaggressive counterparts.
 Ongoing unemployment can have 
serious psychological consequences, 
including depression, anxiety and 
stress. But lead researcher Lea 
Pulkkinen, 
Ph.D., 
a 
Jyvaskyla 
psychology professor, does have 
encouraging 
news 
for 
parents: 
Aggressive children with good social 
skills and child-centered parents were 
significantly 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
unemployed for more than two years 
as adults.

Data Projects
1. Business and Finance Investigate the types of data
that are collected regarding stock and bonds, for
example, price, earnings ratios, and bond ratings. Find
as many types of data as possible. For each, identify the
level of measure as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.
For any quantitative data, also note if they are discrete
or continuous.
2. Sports and Leisure Select a professional sport.
Investigate the types of data that are collected about that
sport, for example, in baseball, the level of play (A, AA,
AAA, Major League), batting average, and home-run
hits. For each, identify the level of measure as nominal,
ordinal, interval, or ratio. For any quantitative data, also
note if they are discrete or continuous.
3. Technology Music organization programs on
computers and music players maintain information
about a song, such as the writer, song length, genre, and
your personal rating. Investigate the types of data
collected about a song. For each, identify the level of
measure as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. For any
quantitative data, also note if they are discrete or
continuous.
4. Health and Wellness Think about the types of data
that can be collected about your health and wellness,
things such as blood type, cholesterol level, smoking
status, and BMI. Find as many data items as you can.
For each, identify the level of measure as nominal,
ordinal, interval, or ratio. For any quantitative data, also
note if they are discrete or continuous.
5. Politics and Economics Every 10 years since 1790, the
federal government has conducted a census of U.S.
residents. Investigate the types of data that were
collected in the 2010 census. For each, identify the level
of measure as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. For
any quantitative data, also note if they are discrete or
continuous. Use the library or a genealogy website to
Ô¨Ånd a census form from 1860. What types of data were
collected? How do the types of data differ?
6. Your Class Your school probably has a database that
contains information about each student, such as age,
county of residence, credits earned, and ethnicity.
Investigate the types of student data that your college
collects and reports. For each, identify the level of
measure as nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. For any
quantitative data, also note if they are discrete or
continuous.

what I got with my telephone survey. Interviewing
would have allowed me to use follow-up questions and
to clarify any questions of the respondents at the time of
the interview. However, interviewing is very labor- and
cost-intensive.
3. I used ordinal data on a scale of 1 to 5. The scores
were 1  strongly disagree, 2  disagree, 3  neutral,
4  agree, 5  strongly agree.
4. The random method that I used was a random dialing
method.
5. To include people from each state, I used a stratiÔ¨Åed
random sample, collecting data randomly from 
each of the area codes and telephone exchanges
available.
6. This method allowed me to make sure that I had
representation from each area of the United States.
7. Convenience samples may not be representative of the
population, and a convenience sample of adolescents
would probably differ greatly from the general

Just a Pinch Between Your
Cheek and Gum
1. This was an experiment, since the researchers imposed
a treatment on each of the two groups involved in the
study.
2. The independent variable is whether the participant
chewed tobacco or not. The dependent variables are the
students‚Äô blood pressures and heart rates.
3. The treatment group is the tobacco group‚Äîthe other
group was used as a control.
4. A student‚Äôs blood pressure might not be affected by
knowing that he or she was part of a study. However,
if the student‚Äôs blood pressure were affected by this
knowledge, all the students (in both groups) would be
affected similarly. This might be an example of the
placebo effect.
5. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that
confounding variables might include the way that the
students chewed the tobacco, whether or not the
students smoked (although this would hopefully have
been evened out with the randomization), and that all
the participants were university students.
6. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that the study
design was Ô¨Åne, but that it cannot be generalized
beyond the population of university students (or people
around that age).

Attendance and Grades
1. The variables are grades and attendance.
2. The data consist of speciÔ¨Åc grades and attendance
numbers.
3. These are descriptive statistics; however, if an inference
were made to all students, then that would be inferential
statistics.
4. The population under study is students at Manatee
Community College (MCC).
5. While not speciÔ¨Åed, we probably have data from a
sample of MCC students.
6. Based on the data, it appears that, in general, the better
your attendance, the higher your grade.
Section 1‚Äì2
Safe Travel
1. The variables are industry and number of job-related
injuries.
2. The type of industry is a qualitative variable, while the
number of job-related injuries is quantitative.
3. The number of job-related injuries is discrete.
4. Type of industry is nominal, and the number of job-
related injuries is ratio.
5. The railroads do show fewer job-related injuries;
however, there may be other things to consider. For
example, railroads employ fewer people than the other
transportation industries in the study.
6. A person‚Äôs choice of transportation might also be
affected by convenience issues, cost, service, etc.
7. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that the
railroads have the fewest job-related injuries, while the
airline industry has the most job-related injuries (more
than twice those of the railroad industry). The numbers
of job-related injuries in the subway and trucking
industries are fairly comparable.

Answers will vary, so this is one possible answer.
1. I used a telephone survey. The advantage to my survey
method is that this was a relatively inexpensive survey
method (although more expensive than using the mail)
that could get a fairly sizable response. The disadvan-
tage to my survey method is that I have not included
anyone without a telephone. (Note: My survey used a
random dialing method to include unlisted numbers
and cell phone exchanges.)
2. A mail survey also would have been fairly inexpensive,

Introduction
When conducting a statistical study, the researcher must gather data for the particular vari-
able under study. For example, if a researcher wishes to study the number of people who
were bitten by poisonous snakes in a speciÔ¨Åc geographic area over the past several years,
he or she has to gather the data from various doctors, hospitals, or health departments.
To describe situations, draw conclusions, or make inferences about events, the
researcher must organize the data in some meaningful way. The most convenient method
of organizing data is to construct a frequency distribution.
After organizing the data, the researcher must present them so they can be under-
stood by those who will beneÔ¨Åt from reading the study. The most useful method of
presenting the data is by constructing statistical charts and graphs. There are many
different types of charts and graphs, and each one has a speciÔ¨Åc purpose.

Looking at the numbers presented in a table does not have the same impact as pre-
senting numbers in a well-drawn chart or graph. The article did not include any graphs.
This chapter will show you how to construct appropriate graphs to represent data and
help you to get your point across to your audience.
See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of the chapter for some suggestions on
how to represent the data graphically.

This chapter explains how to organize data by constructing frequency distributions
and how to present the data by constructing charts and graphs. The charts and graphs
illustrated here are histograms, frequency polygons, ogives, pie graphs, Pareto charts,
and time series graphs. A graph that combines the characteristics of a frequency distribu-
tion and a histogram, called a stem and leaf plot, is also explained.

Wealthy People
Suppose a researcher wished to do a study on the ages of the top 50 wealthiest
people in the world. The researcher Ô¨Årst would have to get the data on the ages of
the people. In this case, these ages are listed in Forbes Magazine. When the data
are in original form, they are called raw data and are listed next.

Since little information can be obtained from looking at raw data, the researcher
organizes the data into what is called a frequency distribution. A frequency distribution
consists of classes and their corresponding frequencies. Each raw data value is placed
into a quantitative or qualitative category called a class. The frequency of a class then is
the number of data values contained in a speciÔ¨Åc class. A frequency distribution is shown
for the preceding data set.

Now some general observations can be made from looking at the frequency distri-
bution. For example, it can be stated that the majority of the wealthy people in the study
are over 55 years old.
A frequency distribution is the organization of raw data in table form, using classes
and frequencies.
The classes in this distribution are 35‚Äì41, 42‚Äì48, etc. These values are called class
limits. The data values 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 can be tallied in the Ô¨Årst class; 42, 43, 44,
45, 46, 47, 48 in the second class; and so on.

Two types of frequency distributions that are most often used are the categorical
frequency distribution and the grouped frequency distribution. The procedures for con-
structing these distributions are shown now.
Categorical Frequency Distributions
The categorical frequency distribution is used for data that can be placed in speciÔ¨Åc cate-
gories, such as nominal- or ordinal-level data. For example, data such as political afÔ¨Åliation,
religious afÔ¨Åliation, or major Ô¨Åeld of study would use categorical frequency distributions.

The procedure for constructing a frequency distribution for categorical data is

Find the percentage of values in each class by using the formula
where f  frequency of the class and n  total number of values. For
example, in the class of type A blood, the percentage is
Percentages are not normally part of a frequency distribution, but they can
be added since they are used in certain types of graphs such as pie graphs.
Also, the decimal equivalent of a percent is called a relative frequency.

Find the totals for columns C (frequency) and D (percent). The completed
table is shown.

Grouped Frequency Distributions
When the range of the data is large, the data must be grouped into classes that are more
than one unit in width, in what is called a grouped frequency distribution. For exam-
ple, a distribution of the number of hours that boat batteries lasted is the following.

The procedure for constructing the preceding frequency distribution is given in
Example 2‚Äì2; however, several things should be noted. In this distribution, the values 24
and 30 of the Ô¨Årst class are called class limits. The lower class limit is 24; it represents
the smallest data value that can be included in the class. The upper class limit is 30; it
represents the largest data value that can be included in the class. The numbers in the sec-
ond column are called class boundaries. These numbers are used to separate the classes
so that there are no gaps in the frequency distribution. The gaps are due to the limits; for
example, there is a gap between 30 and 31.
Students sometimes have difÔ¨Åculty Ô¨Ånding class boundaries when given the class
limits. The basic rule of thumb is that the class limits should have the same decimal
place value as the data, but the class boundaries should have one additional place value
and end in a 5. For example, if the values in the data set are whole numbers, such as 24,
32, and 18, the limits for a class might be 31‚Äì37, and the boundaries are 30.5‚Äì37.5. Find
the boundaries by subtracting 0.5 from 31 (the lower class limit) and adding 0.5 to 37
(the upper class limit).
Lower limit  0.5  31  0.5  30.5  lower boundary
Upper limit  0.5  37  0.5  37.5  upper boundary
If the data are in tenths, such as 6.2, 7.8, and 12.6, the limits for a class hypotheti-
cally might be 7.8‚Äì8.8, and the boundaries for that class would be 7.75‚Äì8.85. Find these
values by subtracting 0.05 from 7.8 and adding 0.05 to 8.8.
Finally, the class width for a class in a frequency distribution is found by subtract-
ing the lower (or upper) class limit of one class from the lower (or upper) class limit of
the next class. For example, the class width in the preceding distribution on the duration
of boat batteries is 7, found from 31  24  7.

The class width can also be found by subtracting the lower boundary from the upper
boundary for any given class. In this case, 30.5  23.5  7.
Note: Do not subtract the limits of a single class. It will result in an incorrect answer.
The researcher must decide how many classes to use and the width of each class. To
construct a frequency distribution, follow these rules:
1. There should be between 5 and 20 classes. Although there is no hard-and-fast rule
for the number of classes contained in a frequency distribution, it is of the utmost
importance to have enough classes to present a clear description of the collected
data.
2. It is preferable but not absolutely necessary that the class width be an odd number.
This ensures that the midpoint of each class has the same place value as the data.
The class midpoint Xm is obtained by adding the lower and upper boundaries and
dividing by 2, or adding the lower and upper limits and dividing by 2:
or
For example, the midpoint of the Ô¨Årst class in the example with boat batteries is
The midpoint is the numeric location of the center of the class. Midpoints are
necessary for graphing (see Section 2‚Äì2). If the class width is an even number, the
midpoint is in tenths. For example, if the class width is 6 and the boundaries are 5.5
and 11.5, the midpoint is
Rule 2 is only a suggestion, and it is not rigorously followed, especially when a
computer is used to group data.
3. The classes must be mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive classes have
nonoverlapping class limits so that data cannot be placed into two classes. Many
times, frequency distributions such as
Age
10‚Äì20
20‚Äì30
30‚Äì40
40‚Äì50
are found in the literature or in surveys. If a person is 40 years old, into which class
should she or he be placed? A better way to construct a frequency distribution is to
use classes such as
Age
10‚Äì20
21‚Äì31
32‚Äì42
43‚Äì53
4. The classes must be continuous. Even if there are no values in a class, the class
must be included in the frequency distribution. There should be no gaps in a

frequency distribution. The only exception occurs when the class with a zero
frequency is the Ô¨Årst or last class. A class with a zero frequency at either end can be
omitted without affecting the distribution.
5. The classes must be exhaustive. There should be enough classes to accommodate all
the data.
6. The classes must be equal in width. This avoids a distorted view of the data.
One exception occurs when a distribution has a class that is open-ended. That is,
the class has no speciÔ¨Åc beginning value or no speciÔ¨Åc ending value. A frequency
distribution with an open-ended class is called an open-ended distribution. Here
are two examples of distributions with open-ended classes.

The frequency distribution for age is open-ended for the last class, which means
that anybody who is 54 years or older will be tallied in the last class. The
distribution for minutes is open-ended for the Ô¨Årst class, meaning that any minute
values below 110 will be tallied in that class.

i.e., when the classes contain more than one data value.

Determine the classes.
Find the highest value and lowest value: H  134 and L  100.
Find the range: R  highest value  lowest value  H  L, so
R  134  100  34
Select the number of classes desired (usually between 5 and 20). In this case,
7 is arbitrarily chosen.
Find the class width by dividing the range by the number of classes.

Unusual Stats
America‚Äôs most
popular beverages
are soft drinks. It is
estimated that, on
average, each person
drinks about 52 gallons
of soft drinks per year,
compared to 22
gallons of beer.

Round the answer up to the nearest whole number if there is a remainder:
4.9  5. (Rounding up is different from rounding off. A number is rounded up if
there is any decimal remainder when dividing. For example, 85  6  14.167
and is rounded up to 15. Also, 53  4  13.25 and is rounded up to 14. Also,
after dividing, if there is no remainder, you will need to add an extra class to
accommodate all the data.)
Select a starting point for the lowest class limit. This can be the smallest data
value or any convenient number less than the smallest data value. In this case,
100 is used. Add the width to the lowest score taken as the starting point to
get the lower limit of the next class. Keep adding until there are 7 classes, as
shown, 100, 105, 110, etc.
Subtract one unit from the lower limit of the second class to get the upper
limit of the Ô¨Årst class. Then add the width to each upper limit to get all the
upper limits.
105  1  104
The Ô¨Årst class is 100‚Äì104, the second class is 105‚Äì109, etc.
Find the class boundaries by subtracting 0.5 from each lower class limit and
adding 0.5 to each upper class limit:
99.5‚Äì104.5, 104.5‚Äì109.5, etc.
Step 2
Tally the data.
Step 3
Find the numerical frequencies from the tallies.

The frequency distribution shows that the class 109.5‚Äì114.5 contains
the largest number of temperatures (18) followed by the class 114.5‚Äì119.5
with 13 temperatures. Hence, most of the temperatures (31) fall between
109.5 and 119.5F.
Sometimes it is necessary to use a cumulative frequency distribution. A cumulative
frequency distribution is a distribution that shows the number of data values less than
or equal to a speciÔ¨Åc value (usually an upper boundary). The values are found by adding
the frequencies of the classes less than or equal to the upper class boundary of a speciÔ¨Åc
class. This gives an ascending cumulative frequency. In this example, the cumulative fre-
quency for the Ô¨Årst class is 0  2  2; for the second class it is 0  2  8  10; for the
third class it is 0  2  8  18  28. Naturally, a shorter way to do this would be to just
add the cumulative frequency of the class below to the frequency of the given class. For

Historical Note
Florence Nightingale, a
nurse in the Crimean
War in 1854, used
statistics to persuade
government ofÔ¨Åcials to
improve hospital care
of soldiers in order to
reduce the death rate
from unsanitary
conditions in the
military hospitals that
cared for the wounded
soldiers.

example, the cumulative frequency for the number of data values less than 114.5 can be
found by adding 10  18  28. The cumulative frequency distribution for the data in this
example is as follows:
Cumulative frequency
Less than 99.5
0
Less than 104.5
2
Less than 109.5
10
Less than 114.5
28
Less than 119.5
41
Less than 124.5
48
Less than 129.5
49
Less than 134.5
50
Cumulative frequencies are used to show how many data values are accumulated up
to and including a speciÔ¨Åc class. In Example 2‚Äì2, 28 of the total record high tempera-
tures are less than or equal to 114F. Forty-eight of the total record high temperatures are
less than or equal to 124F.
After the raw data have been organized into a frequency distribution, it will be ana-
lyzed by looking for peaks and extreme values. The peaks show which class or classes
have the most data values compared to the other classes. Extreme values, called outliers,
show large or small data values that are relative to other data values.
When the range of the data values is relatively small, a frequency distribution can be
constructed using single data values for each class. This type of distribution is called an
ungrouped frequency distribution and is shown next.

Solution
Step 1
Determine the classes. Since the range of the data set is small (19  12  7),
classes consisting of a single data value can be used. They are 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19.
Note: If the data are continuous, class boundaries can be used. Subtract 0.5
from each class value to get the lower class boundary, and add 0.5 to each
class value to get the upper class boundary.
Step 2
Tally the data.
Step 3
Find the numerical frequencies from the tallies, and Ô¨Ånd the cumulative
frequencies.

The completed ungrouped frequency distribution is

Procedure Table 
Constructing a Grouped Frequency Distribution
Step 1
Determine the classes.
Find the highest and lowest values.
Find the range.
Select the number of classes desired.
Find the width by dividing the range by the number of classes and rounding up.
Select a starting point (usually the lowest value or any convenient number less
than the lowest value); add the width to get the lower limits.
Find the upper class limits.
Find the boundaries.
Step 2
Tally the data.
Step 3
Find the numerical frequencies from the tallies, and Ô¨Ånd the cumulative
frequencies.

When you are constructing a frequency distribution, the guidelines presented in this
section should be followed. However, you can construct several different but correct
frequency distributions for the same data by using a different class width, a different
number of classes, or a different starting point.
Furthermore, the method shown here for constructing a frequency distribution is not
unique, and there are other ways of constructing one. Slight variations exist, especially
in computer packages. But regardless of what methods are used, classes should be mutu-
ally exclusive, continuous, exhaustive, and of equal width.
In summary, the different types of frequency distributions were shown in this sec-
tion. The first type, shown in Example 2‚Äì1, is used when the data are categorical
(nominal), such as blood type or political affiliation. This type is called a categorical
frequency distribution. The second type of distribution is used when the range is large
and classes several units in width are needed. This type is called a grouped frequency
distribution and is shown in Example 2‚Äì2. Another type of distribution is used
for numerical data and when the range of data is small, as shown in Example 2‚Äì3.
Since each class is only one unit, this distribution is called an ungrouped frequency
distribution.
All the different types of distributions are used in statistics and are helpful when one
is organizing and presenting data.
The reasons for constructing a frequency distribution are as follows:
1. To organize the data in a meaningful, intelligible way.
2. To enable the reader to determine the nature or shape of the distribution.
3. To facilitate computational procedures for measures of average and spread (shown
in Sections 3‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì2).
4. To enable the researcher to draw charts and graphs for the presentation of data
(shown in Section 2‚Äì2).
5. To enable the reader to make comparisons among different data sets.
The factors used to analyze a frequency distribution are essentially the same
as those used to analyze histograms and frequency polygons, which are shown in
Section 2‚Äì2.

Histograms, Frequency Polygons, and Ogives
After you have organized the data into a frequency distribution, you can present them in
graphical form. The purpose of graphs in statistics is to convey the data to the viewers
in pictorial form. It is easier for most people to comprehend the meaning of data pre-
sented graphically than data presented numerically in tables or frequency distributions.
This is especially true if the users have little or no statistical knowledge.
Statistical graphs can be used to describe the data set or to analyze it. Graphs are
also useful in getting the audience‚Äôs attention in a publication or a speaking presenta-
tion. They can be used to discuss an issue, reinforce a critical point, or summarize a data
set. They can also be used to discover a trend or pattern in a situation over a period
of time.
The three most commonly used graphs in research are
1. The histogram.
2. The frequency polygon.
3. The cumulative frequency graph, or ogive (pronounced o-jive).
An example of each type of graph is shown in Figure 2‚Äì1. The data for each graph
are the distribution of the miles that 20 randomly selected runners ran during a given
week.
The Histogram
The histogram is a graph that displays the data by using contiguous vertical bars
(unless the frequency of a class is 0) of various heights to represent the frequencies of
the classes.
Objective 
Represent data
in frequency
distributions
graphically using
histograms, frequency
polygons, and ogives.

Step 2
Represent the frequency on the y axis and the class boundaries on the x axis.
Step 3
Using the frequencies as the heights, draw vertical bars for each class. See
Figure 2‚Äì2.
As the histogram shows, the class with the greatest number of data values (18) is
109.5‚Äì114.5, followed by 13 for 114.5‚Äì119.5. The graph also has one peak with the data
clustering around it.
The Frequency Polygon
Another way to represent the same data set is by using a frequency polygon.
The frequency polygon is a graph that displays the data by using lines that connect
points plotted for the frequencies at the midpoints of the classes. The frequencies are
represented by the heights of the points.
Example 2‚Äì5 shows the procedure for constructing a frequency polygon.

Historical Note
Graphs originated
when ancient
astronomers drew the
position of the stars in
the heavens. Roman
surveyors also used
coordinates to locate
landmarks on their
maps.
The development
of statistical graphs
can be traced to
William Playfair
(1748‚Äì1819), an
engineer and drafter
who used graphs to
present economic
data pictorially.
Example 2‚Äì5
Record High Temperatures
Using the frequency distribution given in Example 2‚Äì4, construct a frequency polygon.
Solution
Step 1
Find the midpoints of each class. Recall that midpoints are found by adding
the upper and lower boundaries and dividing by 2:
and so on. The midpoints are

Step 2
Draw the x and y axes. Label the x axis with the midpoint of each class, and
then use a suitable scale on the y axis for the frequencies.
Step 3
Using the midpoints for the x values and the frequencies as the y values, plot
the points.
Step 4
Connect adjacent points with line segments. Draw a line back to the x axis at
the beginning and end of the graph, at the same distance that the previous and
next midpoints would be located, as shown in Figure 2‚Äì3.
The frequency polygon and the histogram are two different ways to represent the
same data set. The choice of which one to use is left to the discretion of the researcher.
The Ogive
The third type of graph that can be used represents the cumulative frequencies for
the classes. This type of graph is called the cumulative frequency graph, or ogive. The
cumulative frequency is the sum of the frequencies accumulated up to the upper bound-
ary of a class in the distribution.
The ogive is a graph that represents the cumulative frequencies for the classes in a
frequency distribution.
Example 2‚Äì6 shows the procedure for constructing an ogive.

Step 2
Draw the x and y axes. Label the x axis with the class boundaries. Use an
appropriate scale for the y axis to represent the cumulative frequencies.
(Depending on the numbers in the cumulative frequency columns, scales such
as 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , or 5, 10, 15, 20, . . . , or 1000, 2000, 3000, . . . can be used.
Do not label the y axis with the numbers in the cumulative frequency
column.) In this example, a scale of 0, 5, 10, 15, . . . will be used.
Step 3
Plot the cumulative frequency at each upper class boundary, as shown in
Figure 2‚Äì4. Upper boundaries are used since the cumulative frequencies
represent the number of data values accumulated up to the upper boundary
of each class.
Step 4
Starting with the Ô¨Årst upper class boundary, 104.5, connect adjacent points
with line segments, as shown in Figure 2‚Äì5. Then extend the graph to the Ô¨Årst
lower class boundary, 99.5, on the x axis.
Cumulative frequency graphs are used to visually represent how many values are
below a certain upper class boundary. For example, to Ô¨Ånd out how many record high
temperatures are less than 114.5F, locate 114.5F on the x axis, draw a vertical line up
until it intersects the graph, and then draw a horizontal line at that point to the y axis. The
y axis value is 28, as shown in Figure 2‚Äì6.

Relative Frequency Graphs
The histogram, the frequency polygon, and the ogive shown previously were constructed
by using frequencies in terms of the raw data. These distributions can be converted to dis-
tributions using proportions instead of raw data as frequencies. These types of graphs are
called relative frequency graphs.
Graphs of relative frequencies instead of frequencies are used when the proportion
of data values that fall into a given class is more important than the actual number of data
values that fall into that class. For example, if you wanted to compare the age distribu-
tion of adults in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with the age distribution of adults of Erie,
Pennsylvania, you would use relative frequency distributions. The reason is that since the
population of Philadelphia is 1,478,002 and the population of Erie is 105,270, the bars
using the actual data values for Philadelphia would be much taller than those for the same
classes for Erie.
To convert a frequency into a proportion or relative frequency, divide the frequency
for each class by the total of the frequencies. The sum of the relative frequencies will
always be 1. These graphs are similar to the ones that use raw data as frequencies, but the
values on the y axis are in terms of proportions. Example 2‚Äì7 shows the three types of
relative frequency graphs.

these values in the column labeled Cumulative relative frequency.
An alternative method would be to Ô¨Ånd the cumulative frequencies and
then convert each one to a relative frequency.

Distribution Shapes
When one is describing data, it is important to be able to recognize the shapes of the dis-
tribution values. In later chapters you will see that the shape of a distribution also deter-
mines the appropriate statistical methods used to analyze the data.
A distribution can have many shapes, and one method of analyzing a distribution is
to draw a histogram or frequency polygon for the distribution. Several of the most com-
mon shapes are shown in Figure 2‚Äì8: the bell-shaped or mound-shaped, the uniform-
shaped, the J-shaped, the reverse J-shaped, the positively or right-skewed shape, the
negatively or left-skewed shape, the bimodal-shaped, and the U-shaped.
Distributions are most often not perfectly shaped, so it is not necessary to have an
exact shape but rather to identify an overall pattern.
A bell-shaped distribution shown in Figure 2‚Äì8(a) has a single peak and tapers off
at either end. It is approximately symmetric; i.e., it is roughly the same on both sides of
a line running through the center.

A uniform distribution is basically Ô¨Çat or rectangular. See Figure 2‚Äì8(b).
A J-shaped distribution is shown in Figure 2‚Äì8(c), and it has a few data values on
the left side and increases as one moves to the right. A reverse J-shaped distribution is
the opposite of the J-shaped distribution. See Figure 2‚Äì8(d).
When the peak of a distribution is to the left and the data values taper off to the
right, a distribution is said to be positively or right-skewed. See Figure 2‚Äì8(e). When
the data values are clustered to the right and taper off to the left, a distribution is said to
be negatively or left-skewed. See Figure 2‚Äì8(f). Skewness will be explained in detail
in Chapter 3. Distributions with one peak, such as those shown in Figure 2‚Äì8(a), (e),
and (f), are said to be unimodal. (The highest peak of a distribution indicates where the
mode of the data values is. The mode is the data value that occurs more often than any
other data value. Modes are explained in Chapter 3.) When a distribution has two peaks
of the same height, it is said to be bimodal. See Figure 2‚Äì8(g). Finally, the graph shown
in Figure 2‚Äì8(h) is a U-shaped distribution.
Distributions can have other shapes in addition to the ones shown here; however,
these are some of the more common ones that you will encounter in analyzing data.
When you are analyzing histograms and frequency polygons, look at the shape of the
curve. For example, does it have one peak or two peaks? Is it relatively Ô¨Çat, or is it
U-shaped? Are the data values spread out on the graph, or are they clustered around
the center? Are there data values in the extreme ends? These may be outliers. (See
Section 3‚Äì3 for an explanation of outliers.) Are there any gaps in the histogram, or does
the frequency polygon touch the x axis somewhere other than at the ends? Finally, are the
data clustered at one end or the other, indicating a skewed distribution?
For example, the histogram for the record high temperatures shown in Figure 2‚Äì2
shows a single peaked distribution, with the class 109.5‚Äì114.5 containing the largest
number of temperatures. The distribution has no gaps, and there are fewer temperatures
in the highest class than in the lowest class.

Pareto Charts
When the variable displayed on the horizontal axis is qualitative or categorical, a Pareto
chart can also be used to represent the data.
Solution
1. Draw and label the x and y axes. For the horizontal bar graph place the frequency
scale on the x axis, and for the vertical bar graph place the frequency scale on the
y axis.
2. Draw the bars corresponding to the frequencies. See Figure 2‚Äì10.

Section 2‚Äì3 Other Types of Graphs
71
2‚Äì37
Suggestions for Drawing Pareto Charts
1. Make the bars the same width.
2. Arrange the data from largest to smallest according to frequency.
3. Make the units that are used for the frequency equal in size.
When you analyze a Pareto chart, make comparisons by looking at the heights of
the bars.
The Time Series Graph
When data are collected over a period of time, they can be represented by a time series
graph.
Historical Note
Vilfredo Pareto
(1848‚Äì1923) was an
Italian scholar who
developed theories in
economics, statistics,
and the social
sciences. His
contributions to
statistics include the
development of a
mathematical function
used in economics.
This function has many
statistical applications
and is called the
Pareto distribution.
In addition, he
researched income
distribution, and his
Ô¨Åndings became
known as Pareto‚Äôs law.

over 1000 years old.
The Ô¨Årst ones were
used to chart the
movements of the
planets and the sun.

Solution
Step 1
Draw and label the x and y axes.
Step 2
Label the x axis for years and the y axis for the number.
Step 3
Plot each point according to the table.
Step 4
Draw line segments connecting adjacent points. Do not try to Ô¨Åt a smooth
curve through the data points. See Figure 2‚Äì12.
There was a slight decrease in the years ‚Äô04, ‚Äô05, and ‚Äô06, compared to ‚Äô03, and again an
increase in ‚Äô07. The largest decrease occurred in ‚Äô08.
A time series graph represents data that occur over a speciÔ¨Åc period of time.
Example 2‚Äì10 shows the procedure for constructing a time series graph.

When you analyze a time series graph, look for a trend or pattern that occurs over
the time period. For example, is the line ascending (indicating an increase over time) or
descending (indicating a decrease over time)? Another thing to look for is the slope, or
steepness, of the line. A line that is steep over a speciÔ¨Åc time period indicates a rapid
increase or decrease over that period.

The Pie Graph
Pie graphs are used extensively in statistics. The purpose of the pie graph is to show the
relationship of the parts to the whole by visually comparing the sizes of the sections.
Percentages or proportions can be used. The variable is nominal or categorical.
A pie graph is a circle that is divided into sections or wedges according to the
percentage of frequencies in each category of the distribution.
Example 2‚Äì11 shows the procedure for constructing a pie graph.
Two or more data sets can be compared on the same graph called a compound time
series graph if two or more lines are used, as shown in Figure 2‚Äì13. This graph shows
the percentage of elderly males and females in the United States labor force from 1960
to 2008. It shows that the percent of elderly men decreased signiÔ¨Åcantly from 1960 to
1990 and then increased slightly after that. For the elderly females, the percent decreased
slightly from 1960 to 1980 and then increased from 1980 to 2008.

Cell Phone Usage
The graph shows the estimated number
(in millions) of cell phone subscribers
since 2000. How do you think the growth
will affect our way of living? For
example, emergencies can be handled
faster since people are using their cell
phones to call 911.

The graph in Figure 2‚Äì15 shows that in this case the most common blood type is
type O.
To analyze the nature of the data shown in the pie graph, look at the size of the
sections in the pie graph. For example, are any sections relatively large compared to
the rest?
Figure 2‚Äì15 shows that among the inductees, type O blood is more prevalent than
any other type. People who have type AB blood are in the minority. More than twice as
many people have type O blood as type AB.
Misleading Graphs
Graphs give a visual representation that enables readers to analyze and interpret data
more easily than they could simply by looking at numbers. However, inappropriately
drawn graphs can misrepresent the data and lead the reader to false conclusions. For
example, a car manufacturer‚Äôs ad stated that 98% of the vehicles it had sold in the past
10 years were still on the road. The ad then showed a graph similar to the one in
Figure 2‚Äì16. The graph shows the percentage of the manufacturer‚Äôs automobiles still on
the road and the percentage of its competitors‚Äô automobiles still on the road. Is there a
large difference? Not necessarily.
Notice the scale on the vertical axis in Figure 2‚Äì16. It has been cut off (or truncated)
and starts at 95%. When the graph is redrawn using a scale that goes from 0 to 100%, as
in Figure 2‚Äì17, there is hardly a noticeable difference in the percentages. Thus, changing
the units at the starting point on the y axis can convey a very different visual representa-
tion of the data.
O
 360  129.6
AB
 360  57.6
Step 2
Find the percentages. (This was already done in Example 2‚Äì1.)
Step 3
Using a protractor, graph each section and write its name and corresponding
percentage, as shown in Figure 2‚Äì15.

It is not wrong to truncate an axis of the graph; many times it is necessary to do so.
However, the reader should be aware of this fact and interpret the graph accordingly. Do
not be misled if an inappropriate impression is given.

to 24 miles per gallon, the graph shows a much larger increase even though the data
remain the same. See Figure 2‚Äì18(b). Again, by changing the units or starting point on
the y axis, one can change the visual representation.
Another misleading graphing technique sometimes used involves exaggerating a
one-dimensional increase by showing it in two dimensions. For example, the average
cost of a 30-second Super Bowl commercial has increased from $42,000 in 1967 to
$3 million in 2010 (Source: USA TODAY).
The increase shown by the graph in Figure 2‚Äì19(a) represents the change by a com-
parison of the heights of the two bars in one dimension. The same data are shown two-
dimensionally with circles in Figure 2‚Äì19(b). Notice that the difference seems much
larger because the eye is comparing the areas of the circles rather than the lengths of the
diameters.
Note that it is not wrong to use the graphing techniques of truncating the scales or
representing data by two-dimensional pictures. But when these techniques are used, the
reader should be cautious of the conclusion drawn on the basis of the graphs.
Another way to misrepresent data on a graph is by omitting labels or units on the
axes of the graph. The graph shown in Figure 2‚Äì20 compares the cost of living, economic
growth, population growth, etc., of four main geographic areas in the United States.
However, since there are no numbers on the y axis, very little information can be gained
from this graph, except a crude ranking of each factor. There is no way to decide the
actual magnitude of the differences.

Stem and Leaf Plots
The stem and leaf plot is a method of organizing data and is a combination of sorting and
graphing. It has the advantage over a grouped frequency distribution of retaining the
actual data while showing them in graphical form.
A stem and leaf plot is a data plot that uses part of the data value as the stem and part
of the data value as the leaf to form groups or classes.
Example 2‚Äì13 shows the procedure for constructing a stem and leaf plot.
Figure 2‚Äì21
Summary of Graphs
and Uses of Each
(a) Histogram; frequency polygon; ogive
Used when the data are contained in a grouped frequency distribution.
(b) Pareto chart
Used to show frequencies for
nominal or qualitative variables.
(c) Time series graph
Used to show a pattern or trend that
occurs over a period of time.
(d) Pie graph
Used to show the relationship
between the parts and the whole.
(Most often uses percentages.)

Finally, all graphs should contain a source for the information presented. The inclu-
sion of a source for the data will enable you to check the reliability of the organization
presenting the data. A summary of the types of graphs and their uses is shown in
Figure 2‚Äì21.

Solution
Step 1
Arrange the data in order:
02, 13, 14, 20, 23, 25, 31, 32, 32, 32,
32, 33, 36, 43, 44, 44, 45, 51, 52, 57
Note: Arranging the data in order is not essential and can be cumbersome
when the data set is large; however, it is helpful in constructing a stem
and leaf plot. The leaves in the Ô¨Ånal stem and leaf plot should be arranged
in order.
Step 2
Separate the data according to the Ô¨Årst digit, as shown.

Step 3
A display can be made by using the leading digit as the stem and the trailing
digit as the leaf. For example, for the value 32, the leading digit, 3, is the stem
and the trailing digit, 2, is the leaf. For the value 14, the 1 is the stem and the
4 is the leaf. Now a plot can be constructed as shown in Figure 2‚Äì22.

How Much Paper Money Is in
Circulation Today?
The Federal Reserve estimated that during
a recent year, there were 22 billion bills
in circulation. About 35% of them were
$1 bills, 3% were $2 bills, 8% were
$5 bills, 7% were $10 bills, 23% were
$20 bills, 5% were $50 bills, and 19%
were $100 bills. It costs about 3¬¢ to print
each $1 bill.
The average life of a $1 bill is
22 months, a $10 bill 3 years, a $20 bill
4 years, a $50 bill 9 years, and a $100 bill
9 years. What type of graph would you
use to represent the average lifetimes of
the bills?

Figure 2‚Äì22 shows that the distribution peaks in the center and that there are no gaps
in the data. For 7 of the 20 days, the number of patients receiving cardiograms was
between 31 and 36. The plot also shows that the testing center treated from a minimum
of 2 patients to a maximum of 57 patients in any one day.
If there are no data values in a class, you should write the stem number and leave the
leaf row blank. Do not put a zero in the leaf row.
Example 2‚Äì14
An insurance company researcher conducted a survey on the number of car
thefts in a large city for a period of 30 days last summer. The raw data are
shown. Construct a stem and leaf plot by using classes 50‚Äì54, 55‚Äì59, 60‚Äì64, 65‚Äì69,

When the data values are in the hundreds, such as 325, the stem is 32 and the leaf

Related distributions can be compared by using a back-to-back stem and leaf plot.
The back-to-back stem and leaf plot uses the same digits for the stems of both distribu-
tions, but the digits that are used for the leaves are arranged in order out from the stems
on both sides. Example 2‚Äì15 shows a back-to-back stem and leaf plot.
Example 2‚Äì15

Solution
Step 1
Arrange the data for both data sets in order.
Step 2
Construct a stem and leaf plot using the same digits as stems. Place the digits
for the leaves for Atlanta on the left side of the stem and the digits for the
leaves for Philadelphia on the right side, as shown. See Figure 2‚Äì24.

Step 3
Compare the distributions. The buildings in Atlanta have a large variation in the
number of stories per building. Although both distributions are peaked in the
30- to 39-story class, Philadelphia has more buildings in this class. Atlanta has
more buildings that have 40 or more stories than Philadelphia does.
Stem and leaf plots are part of the techniques called exploratory data analysis. More

Summary
‚Ä¢ When data are collected, the values are called raw data. Since very little knowledge
can be obtained from raw data, they must be organized in some meaningful way. A
frequency distribution using classes is the common method that is used. (2‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Once a frequency distribution is constructed, graphs can be drawn to give a visual
representation of the data. The most commonly used graphs in statistics are the
histogram, frequency polygon, and ogive. (2‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ Other graphs such as the bar graph, Pareto chart, time series graph, and pie graph
can also be used. Some of these graphs are frequently seen in newspapers,
magazines, and various statistical reports. (2‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ Finally, a stem and leaf plot uses part of the data values as stems and part of the
data values as leaves. This graph has the advantage of a frequency distribution and
a histogram. (2‚Äì3)

How Your Identity Can Be Stolen‚ÄîRevisited
Data presented in numerical form do not convey an easy-to-interpret conclusion; however,
when data are presented in graphical form, readers can see the visual impact of the numbers. In
the case of identity fraud, the reader can see that most of the identity frauds are due to lost or
stolen wallets, checkbooks, or credit cards, and very few identity frauds are caused by online
purchases or transactions.

14 bins instead of 7, then the ages 42, 43, 68, and 69
might appear as outliers.
7. Answers will vary. The data appear to be unimodal and
fairly symmetric, centering on 55 years of age.

Selling Real Estate
1. A histogram of the data gives price ranges and the
counts of homes in each price range. We can also talk
about how the data are distributed by looking at a
histogram.
2. A frequency polygon shows increases or decreases in
the number of home prices around values.
3. A cumulative frequency polygon shows the number of
homes sold at or below a given price.
4. The house that sold for $321,550 is an extreme value in
this data set.
5. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that the
histogram displays the outlier well since there is a gap
in the prices of the homes sold.
6. The distribution of the data is skewed to the right.

Leading Cause of Death
1. The variables in the graph are the year, cause of death,
and rate of death per 100,000 men.
2. The cause of death is qualitative, while the year and
death rates are quantitative.
3. Year is a discrete variable, and death rate is continuous.
Since cause of death is qualitative, it is neither discrete
nor continuous.
4. A line graph was used to display the data.
5. No, a Pareto chart could not be used to display the data,
since we can only have one quantitative variable and
one categorical variable in a Pareto chart.
6. We cannot use a pie chart for the same reasons as given
for the Pareto chart.
7. A Pareto chart is typically used to show a categorical
variable listed from the highest-frequency category to
the category with the lowest frequency.
8. A time series chart is used to see trends in the data. It
can also be used for forecasting and predicting.
Answers to Applying the Concepts

of the distribution of times uniform, skewed, or bell-
shaped? Also note the genre of each song. Create a
Pareto chart showing the frequencies of the various
categories. Finally, note the year each song was
released. Create a pie chart organized by decade to
show the percentage of songs from various time periods.
4. Health and Wellness Use information from the Red
Cross to create a pie chart depicting the percentages of
Americans with various blood types. Also Ô¨Ånd
information about blood donations and the percentage
of each type donated. How do the charts compare? Why
is the collection of type O blood so important?

How Long Are You Delayed by Road Congestion?
No matter where you live, at one time or another, you have been stuck in trafÔ¨Åc. To see
whether there are more trafÔ¨Åc delays in some cities than in others, statisticians make
comparisons using descriptive statistics. A statistical study by the Texas Transportation
Institute found that a driver is delayed by road congestion an average of 36 hours per
year. To see how selected cities compare to this average, see Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited
at the end of the chapter.
This chapter will show you how to obtain and interpret descriptive statistics such as
measures of average, measures of variation, and measures of position.
Introduction
Chapter 2 showed how you can gain useful information from raw data by organizing
them into a frequency distribution and then presenting the data by using various graphs.
This chapter shows the statistical methods that can be used to summarize data. The most
familiar of these methods is the Ô¨Ånding of averages.
For example, you may read that the average speed of a car crossing midtown
Manhattan during the day is 5.3 miles per hour or that the average number of minutes an
American father of a 4-year-old spends alone with his child each day is 42.1
In the book American Averages by Mike Feinsilber and William B. Meed, the
authors state:
‚ÄúAverage‚Äù when you stop to think of it is a funny concept. Although it describes all of us it
describes none of us. . . . While none of us wants to be the average American, we all want to
know about him or her.
The authors go on to give examples of averages:
The average American man is Ô¨Åve feet, nine inches tall; the average woman is Ô¨Åve feet,
3.6 inches.
The average American is sick in bed seven days a year missing Ô¨Åve days of work. 
On the average day, 24 million people receive animal bites. 
By his or her 70th birthday, the average American will have eaten 14 steers, 1050 chickens,
3.5 lambs, and 25.2 hogs.2

Interesting Fact 
A person has on
average 1460 dreams
in 1 year.
2Mike Feinsilber and William B. Meed, American Averages (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell).

In these examples, the word average is ambiguous, since several different methods
can be used to obtain an average. Loosely stated, the average means the center of the
distribution or the most typical case. Measures of average are also called measures of
central tendency and include the mean, median, mode, and midrange.
Knowing the average of a data set is not enough to describe the data set entirely.
Even though a shoe store owner knows that the average size of a man‚Äôs shoe is size 10,
she would not be in business very long if she ordered only size 10 shoes.
As this example shows, in addition to knowing the average, you must know how the
data values are dispersed. That is, do the data values cluster around the mean, or are they
spread more evenly throughout the distribution? The measures that determine the spread
of the data values are called measures of variation, or measures of dispersion. These
measures include the range, variance, and standard deviation.
Finally, another set of measures is necessary to describe data. These measures are
called measures of position. They tell where a speciÔ¨Åc data value falls within the data set
or its relative position in comparison with other data values. The most common position
measures are percentiles, deciles, and quartiles. These measures are used extensively in
psychology and education. Sometimes they are referred to as norms.
The measures of central tendency, variation, and position explained in this chapter
are part of what is called traditional statistics.
Section 3‚Äì4 shows the techniques of what is called exploratory data analysis. These
techniques include the boxplot and the Ô¨Åve-number summary. They can be used to explore
data to see what they show (as opposed to the traditional techniques, which are used to
conÔ¨Årm conjectures about the data).
Section 3‚Äì1 Measures of Central Tendency
105
3‚Äì3
3‚Äì1
Measures of Central Tendency
Chapter 1 stated that statisticians use samples taken from populations; however, when
populations are small, it is not necessary to use samples since the entire population can
be used to gain information. For example, suppose an insurance manager wanted to know
the average weekly sales of all the company‚Äôs representatives. If the company employed
a large number of salespeople, say, nationwide, he would have to use a sample and make

an inference to the entire sales force. But if the company had only a few salespeople, say,
only 87 agents, he would be able to use all representatives‚Äô sales for a randomly chosen
week and thus use the entire population.
Measures found by using all the data values in the population are called parameters.
Measures obtained by using the data values from samples are called statistics; hence, the
average of the sales from a sample of representatives is a statistic, and the average of sales
obtained from the entire population is a parameter.
A statistic is a characteristic or measure obtained by using the data values from a sample.
A parameter is a characteristic or measure obtained by using all the data values from a
speciÔ¨Åc population.
These concepts as well as the symbols used to represent them will be explained in
detail in this chapter.
General Rounding Rule In statistics the basic rounding rule is that when computa-
tions are done in the calculation, rounding should not be done until the Ô¨Ånal answer is
calculated. When rounding is done in the intermediate steps, it tends to increase the dif-
ference between that answer and the exact one. But in the textbook and solutions manual,
it is not practical to show long decimals in the intermediate calculations; hence, the
values in the examples are carried out to enough places (usually three or four) to obtain
the same answer that a calculator would give after rounding on the last step.
The Mean
The mean, also known as the arithmetic average, is found by adding the values of the
data and dividing by the total number of values. For example, the mean of 3, 2, 6, 5, and
4 is found by adding 3  2  6  5  4  20 and dividing by 5; hence, the mean of the
data is 20  5  4. The values of the data are represented by X‚Äôs. In this data set, X1  3,
X2  2, X3  6, X4  5, and X5  4. To show a sum of the total X values, the symbol 
(the capital Greek letter sigma) is used, and X means to Ô¨Ånd the sum of the X values in
the data set. The summation notation is explained in Appendix A.
The mean is the sum of the values, divided by the total number of values. The symbol 
represents the sample mean.
where n represents the total number of values in the sample.
For a population, the Greek letter m (mu) is used for the mean.
where N represents the total number of values in the population.
In statistics, Greek letters are used to denote parameters, and Roman letters are used
to denote statistics. Assume that the data are obtained from samples unless otherwise
speciÔ¨Åed.

Quetelet investigated
the characteristics
(heights, weights, etc.)
of French conscripts
to determine the
‚Äúaverage man.‚Äù
Florence Nightingale
was so inÔ¨Çuenced by
Quetelet‚Äôs work that
she began collecting
and analyzing medical
records in the military
hospitals during the
Crimean War. Based
on her work, hospitals
began keeping
accurate records on
their patients.

Solution
The mean of the number of hospital infections for the six hospitals is 64.8.
The mean, in most cases, is not an actual data value.
Rounding Rule for the Mean The mean should be rounded to one more decimal
place than occurs in the raw data. For example, if the raw data are given in whole num-
bers, the mean should be rounded to the nearest tenth. If the data are given in tenths, the
mean should be rounded to the nearest hundredth, and so on.
The procedure for Ô¨Ånding the mean for grouped data uses the midpoints of the classes.
This procedure is shown next.

The procedure for Ô¨Ånding the mean for grouped data assumes that the mean of all the
raw data values in each class is equal to the midpoint of the class. In reality, this is not true,
since the average of the raw data values in each class usually will not be exactly equal to
the midpoint. However, using this procedure will give an acceptable approximation of the
mean, since some values fall above the midpoint and other values fall below the midpoint
for each class, and the midpoint represents an estimate of all values in the class.

Ages of the Top 50 Wealthiest People
The histogram shows the ages of the top
50 wealthiest individuals according to
Forbes Magazine for a recent year. The
mean age is 66.04 years. The median
age is 68 years. Explain why these two
statistics are not enough to adequately
describe the data.
The Median
An article recently reported that the median income for college professors was $43,250.
This measure of central tendency means that one-half of all the professors surveyed
earned more than $43,250, and one-half earned less than $43,250.
The median is the halfway point in a data set. Before you can Ô¨Ånd this point, the data
must be arranged in order. When the data set is ordered, it is called a data array. The
median either will be a speciÔ¨Åc value in the data set or will fall between two values, as
shown in Examples 3‚Äì4 through 3‚Äì8.
The median is the midpoint of the data array. The symbol for the median is MD.
Steps in computing the median of a data array
Step 1
Arrange the data in order.
Step 2
Select the middle point.
Historical Note
The concept of
median was used
by Gauss at the
beginning of the
19th century and
introduced as a
statistical concept by
Francis Galton around
1874. The mode was
Ô¨Årst used by Karl
Pearson in 1894.

Median
The median cost is $15.
Examples 3‚Äì4 and 3‚Äì5 each had an odd number of values in the data set; hence, the
median was an actual data value. When there are an even number of values in the data set,
the median will fall between two given values, as illustrated in Examples 3‚Äì6, 3‚Äì7, and 3‚Äì8.
Example 3‚Äì6
Tornadoes in the United States

Solution
656, 684, 702, 764, 856, 1132, 1133, 1303

Median
Since the middle point falls halfway between 764 and 856, Ô¨Ånd the median MD by
adding the two values and dividing by 2.
The median number of tornadoes is 810.

The Mode
The third measure of average is called the mode. The mode is the value that occurs most
often in the data set. It is sometimes said to be the most typical case.
The value that occurs most often in a data set is called the mode.
A data set that has only one value that occurs with the greatest frequency is said to
be unimodal.
If a data set has two values that occur with the same greatest frequency, both values
are considered to be the mode and the data set is said to be bimodal. If a data set has more
than two values that occur with the same greatest frequency, each value is used as the
mode, and the data set is said to be multimodal. When no data value occurs more than
once, the data set is said to have no mode. A data set can have more than one mode or no
mode at all. These situations will be shown in some of the examples that follow.

Solution
Since each value occurs only once, there is no mode.
Note: Do not say that the mode is zero. That would be incorrect, because in some
data, such as temperature, zero can be an actual value.

largest frequency.

Since $10 million occurred 3 times‚Äîa frequency larger than any other number‚Äîthe
mode is $10 million.

Solution
Since the category with the highest frequency is Westmoreland, the most typical case is
Westmoreland. Hence the mode is 11,008.
An extremely high or extremely low data value in a data set can have a striking effect
on the mean of the data set. These extreme values are called outliers. This is one reason
why when analyzing a frequency distribution, you should be aware of any of these
values. For the data set shown in Example 3‚Äì14, the mean, median, and mode can be
quite different because of extreme values. A method for identifying outliers is given in
Section 3‚Äì3.
Solution
The modal class is 20.5‚Äì25.5, since it has the largest frequency. Sometimes the
midpoint of the class is used rather than the boundaries; hence, the mode could also be
given as 23 miles per week.
The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used in Ô¨Ånding the
most typical case when the data are nominal or categorical.

The midrange is deÔ¨Åned as the sum of the lowest and highest values in the data set,
divided by 2. The symbol MR is used for the midrange.

numbers of water-line breaks per month. Find the midrange.
2, 3, 6, 8, 4, 1
Solution
Hence, the midrange is 4.5.
If the data set contains one extremely large value or one extremely small value, a
higher or lower midrange value will result and may not be a typical description of the
middle.
MR  1  8

 9
2  4.5
Example 3‚Äì16
NFL Signing Bonuses 
Find the midrange of data for the NFL signing bonuses in Example 3‚Äì9. The bonuses in
millions of dollars are
18.0, 14.0, 34.5, 10, 11.3, 10, 12.4, 10
Solution
The smallest bonus is $10 million and the largest bonus is $34.5 million.
Notice that this amount is larger than seven of the eight amounts and is not typical of
the average of the bonuses. The reason is that there is one very high bonus, namely,
$34.5 million.
MR  10  34.5
2
 44.5
2
 $22.25 million
In Example 3‚Äì14, the mean is much higher than the median or the mode. This is so
because the extremely high salary of the owner tends to raise the value of the mean. In
this and similar situations, the median should be used as the measure of central tendency.
The Midrange
The midrange is a rough estimate of the middle. It is found by adding the lowest and
highest values in the data set and dividing by 2. It is a very rough estimate of the aver-
age and can be affected by one extremely high or low value.

Section 3‚Äì1 Measures of Central Tendency
115
3‚Äì13
In statistics, several measures can be used for an average. The most common mea-
sures are the mean, median, mode, and midrange. Each has its own speciÔ¨Åc purpose and
use. Exercises 39 through 41 show examples of other averages, such as the harmonic
mean, the geometric mean, and the quadratic mean. Their applications are limited to spe-
ciÔ¨Åc areas, as shown in the exercises.
The Weighted Mean
Sometimes, you must Ô¨Ånd the mean of a data set in which not all values are equally repre-
sented. Consider the case of Ô¨Ånding the average cost of a gallon of gasoline for three taxis.
Suppose the drivers buy gasoline at three different service stations at a cost of $3.22, $3.53,
and $3.63 per gallon. You might try to Ô¨Ånd the average by using the formula
But not all drivers purchased the same number of gallons. Hence, to Ô¨Ånd the true aver-
age cost per gallon, you must take into consideration the number of gallons each driver
purchased.
The type of mean that considers an additional factor is called the weighted mean, and
it is used when the values are not all equally represented.
Find the weighted mean of a variable X by multiplying each value by its corresponding
weight and dividing the sum of the products by the sum of the weights.
where w1, w2, . . . , wn are the weights and X1, X2, . . . , Xn are the values.
Example 3‚Äì17 shows how the weighted mean is used to compute a grade point average.
Since courses vary in their credit value, the number of credits must be used as weights.

four measures of central tendency are summarized next.
Unusual Stat
Of people in the
United States, 45%
live within 15 minutes
of their best friend.
Properties and Uses of Central Tendency
The Mean
1. The mean is found by using all the values of the data.
2. The mean varies less than the median or mode when samples are taken from the same
population and all three measures are computed for these samples.
3. The mean is used in computing other statistics, such as the variance.
4. The mean for the data set is unique and not necessarily one of the data values.
5. The mean cannot be computed for the data in a frequency distribution that has an
open-ended class.
6. The mean is affected by extremely high or low values, called outliers, and may not be the
appropriate average to use in these situations.
The Median
1. The median is used to Ô¨Ånd the center or middle value of a data set.
2. The median is used when it is necessary to Ô¨Ånd out whether the data values fall into the
upper half or lower half of the distribution.
3. The median is used for an open-ended distribution.
4. The median is affected less than the mean by extremely high or extremely low values.
The Mode
1. The mode is used when the most typical case is desired.
2. The mode is the easiest average to compute.
3. The mode can be used when the data are nominal or categorical, such as religious
preference, gender, or political afÔ¨Åliation.
4. The mode is not always unique. A data set can have more than one mode, or the mode
may not exist for a data set.
The Midrange
1. The midrange is easy to compute.
2. The midrange gives the midpoint.
3. The midrange is affected by extremely high or low values in a data set.
Table 3‚Äì1 summarizes the measures of central tendency.

Section 3‚Äì1 Measures of Central Tendency

Distribution Shapes
Frequency distributions can assume many shapes. The three most important shapes are pos-
itively skewed, symmetric, and negatively skewed. Figure 3‚Äì1 shows histograms of each.
In a positively skewed or right-skewed distribution, the majority of the data values
fall to the left of the mean and cluster at the lower end of the distribution; the ‚Äútail‚Äù is to the
right. Also, the mean is to the right of the median, and the mode is to the left of the median.
For example, if an instructor gave an examination and most of the students did
poorly, their scores would tend to cluster on the left side of the distribution. A few high
scores would constitute the tail of the distribution, which would be on the right side.
Another example of a positively skewed distribution is the incomes of the population of
the United States. Most of the incomes cluster about the low end of the distribution; those
with high incomes are in the minority and are in the tail at the right of the distribution.
In a symmetric distribution, the data values are evenly distributed on both sides of
the mean. In addition, when the distribution is unimodal, the mean, median, and mode
are the same and are at the center of the distribution. Examples of symmetric distribu-
tions are IQ scores and heights of adult males.
When the majority of the data values fall to the right of the mean and cluster at
the upper end of the distribution, with the tail to the left, the distribution is said to be
negatively skewed or left-skewed. Also, the mean is to the left of the median, and the
mode is to the right of the median. As an example, a negatively skewed distribution
results if the majority of students score very high on an instructor‚Äôs examination. These
scores will tend to cluster to the right of the distribution.
When a distribution is extremely skewed, the value of the mean will be pulled toward
the tail, but the majority of the data values will be greater than the mean or less than the
mean (depending on which way the data are skewed); hence, the median rather than the
mean is a more appropriate measure of central tendency. An extremely skewed distribu-
tion can also affect other statistics.
A measure of skewness for a distribution is discussed in Exercise 48 in Section 3‚Äì2.

to increase salaries. Compute the mean, median, and mode, and decide which one would
best support your position to not raise salaries.
2. Second, assume you work for the teachers‚Äô union and want a raise for the teachers. Use the
best measure of central tendency to support your position.
3. Explain how outliers can be used to support one or the other position.
4. If the salaries represented every teacher in the school district, would the averages be
parameters or statistics?
5. Which measure of central tendency can be misleading when a data set contains outliers?
6. When you are comparing the measures of central tendency, does the distribution display
any skewness? Explain.

Chapter 3 Data Description

For example, the harmonic mean of 1, 4, 5, and 2 is
This mean is useful for Ô¨Ånding the average speed.
Suppose a person drove 100 miles at 40 miles per hour
and returned driving 50 miles per hour. The average
miles per hour is not 45 miles per hour, which is found
by adding 40 and 50 and dividing by 2. The average is
found as shown.
Since
Time  distance  rate
then
Time 
hours to make the trip
Time 
hours to return
Hence, the total time is 4.5 hours, and the total miles
driven are 200. Now, the average speed is
Rate
miles per hour
This value can also be found by using the harmonic
mean formula
HM
Using the harmonic mean, Ô¨Ånd each of these.
a.
A salesperson drives 300 miles round trip at
30 miles per hour going to Chicago and 45 miles
per hour returning home. Find the average miles
per hour. 36 mph

40. The geometric mean (GM) is deÔ¨Åned as the nth root of
the product of n values. The formula is
The geometric mean of 4 and 16 is
The geometric mean of 1, 3, and 9 is
The geometric mean is useful in Ô¨Ånding the
average of percentages, ratios, indexes, or growth
rates. For example, if a person receives a 20% raise
after 1 year of service and a 10% raise after the
second year of service, the average percentage raise
per year is not 15 but 14.89%, as shown.

His salary is 120% at the end of the Ô¨Årst year and 110%

Find the quadratic mean of 8, 6, 3, 5, and 4. 5.48
42. An approximate median can be found for data that have
been grouped into a frequency distribution. First it is
necessary to Ô¨Ånd the median class. This is the class that
contains the median value. That is the 
data value.
Then it is assumed that the data values are evenly
distributed throughout the median class. The formula is
where
n  sum of frequencies

immediately preceding the median class
w  width of median class

Measures of Variation
In statistics, to describe the data set accurately, statisticians must know more than the
measures of central tendency. Consider Example 3‚Äì18.
Example 3‚Äì18
Comparison of Outdoor Paint
A testing lab wishes to test two experimental brands of outdoor paint to see how
long each will last before fading. The testing lab makes 6 gallons of each paint
to test. Since different chemical agents are added to each group and only six cans are
involved, these two groups constitute two small populations. The results (in months) are
shown. Find the mean of each group.
Objective 
Describe data, using
measures of variation,
such as the range,
variance, and
standard deviation.

Since the means are equal in Example 3‚Äì18, you might conclude that both brands of
paint last equally well. However, when the data sets are examined graphically, a some-
what different conclusion might be drawn. See Figure 3‚Äì2.
As Figure 3‚Äì2 shows, even though the means are the same for both brands, the
spread, or variation, is quite different. Figure 3‚Äì2 shows that brand B performs more con-
sistently; it is less variable. For the spread or variability of a data set, three measures are
commonly used: range, variance, and standard deviation. Each measure will be dis-
cussed in this section.
Range
The range is the simplest of the three measures and is deÔ¨Åned now.
The range is the highest value minus the lowest value. The symbol R is used for the range.

Example 3‚Äì19
Comparison of Outdoor Paint
Find the ranges for the paints in Example 3‚Äì18.
Solution
For brand A, the range is
R  60  10  50 months
For brand B, the range is
R  45  25  20 months
Make sure the range is given as a single number.
The range for brand A shows that 50 months separate the largest data value from
the smallest data value. For brand B, 20 months separate the largest data value from the
smallest data value, which is less than one-half of brand A‚Äôs range.
One extremely high or one extremely low data value can affect the range markedly,
as shown in Example 3‚Äì20.
Example 3‚Äì20
Employee Salaries
The salaries for the staff of the XYZ Manufacturing Co. are shown here. Find
the range.

18,000
Solution
The range is R  $100,000  $15,000  $85,000.
Since the owner‚Äôs salary is included in the data for Example 3‚Äì20, the range is a large
number. To have a more meaningful statistic to measure the variability, statisticians use
measures called the variance and standard deviation.
Population Variance and Standard Deviation
Before the variance and standard deviation are deÔ¨Åned formally, the computational
procedure will be shown, since the deÔ¨Ånition is derived from the procedure.
Rounding Rule for the Standard Deviation The rounding rule for the standard
deviation is the same as that for the mean. The Ô¨Ånal answer should be rounded to one
more decimal place than that of the original data.

Column A contains the raw data X. Column B contains the differences X  m obtained
in step 2. Column C contains the squares of the differences obtained in step 3.
The preceding computational procedure reveals several things. First, the square root
of the variance gives the standard deviation; and vice versa, squaring the standard devi-
ation gives the variance. Second, the variance is actually the average of the square of the
distance that each value is from the mean. Therefore, if the values are near the mean, the
variance will be small. In contrast, if the values are far from the mean, the variance will
be large.
You might wonder why the squared distances are used instead of the actual distances.
One reason is that the sum of the distances will always be zero. To verify this result for
a speciÔ¨Åc case, add the values in column B of the table in Example 3‚Äì21. When each
value is squared, the negative signs are eliminated.
Finally, why is it necessary to take the square root? The reason is that since the dis-
tances were squared, the units of the resultant numbers are the squares of the units of the
original raw data. Finding the square root of the variance puts the standard deviation in
the same units as the raw data.
When you are Ô¨Ånding the square root, always use its positive value, since the variance
and standard deviation of a data set can never be negative.

Chapter 3 Data Description
3‚Äì26
Since the standard deviation of brand A is 17.1 (see Example 3‚Äì21) and the standard
deviation of brand B is 6.5, the data are more variable for brand A. In summary, when the
means are equal, the larger the variance or standard deviation is, the more variable the
data are.
Sample Variance and Standard Deviation
When computing the variance for a sample, one might expect the following expression
to be used:
where 
is the sample mean and n is the sample size. This formula is not usually used,
however, since in most cases the purpose of calculating the statistic is to estimate the
corresponding parameter. For example, the sample mean 
is used to estimate the
population mean m. The expression
does not give the best estimate of the population variance because when the population
is large and the sample is small (usually less than 30), the variance computed by this for-
mula usually underestimates the population variance. Therefore, instead of dividing by
n, Ô¨Ånd the variance of the sample by dividing by n  1, giving a slightly larger value and
an unbiased estimate of the population variance.
The formula for the sample variance, denoted by s 2, is
where
To Ô¨Ånd the standard deviation of a sample, you must take the square root of the
sample variance, which was found by using the preceding formula.

Shortcut formulas for computing the variance and standard deviation are presented
next and will be used in the remainder of the chapter and in the exercises. These formu-
las are mathematically equivalent to the preceding formulas and do not involve using
the mean. They save time when repeated subtracting and squaring occur in the original
formulas. They are also more accurate when the mean has been rounded.

CoefÔ¨Åcient of Variation
Whenever two samples have the same units of measure, the variance and standard devia-
tion for each can be compared directly. For example, suppose an automobile dealer wanted
to compare the standard deviation of miles driven for the cars she received as trade-ins
on new cars. She found that for a speciÔ¨Åc year, the standard deviation for Buicks was
422 miles and the standard deviation for Cadillacs was 350 miles. She could say that the
variation in mileage was greater in the Buicks. But what if a manager wanted to compare
the standard deviations of two different variables, such as the number of sales per sales-
person over a 3-month period and the commissions made by these salespeople?
A statistic that allows you to compare standard deviations when the units are differ-
ent, as in this example, is called the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation.
The coefÔ¨Åcient of variation, denoted by CVar, is the standard deviation divided by the
mean. The result is expressed as a percentage.

Uses of the Variance and Standard Deviation
1. As previously stated, variances and standard deviations can be used to determine the
spread of the data. If the variance or standard deviation is large, the data are more
dispersed. This information is useful in comparing two (or more) data sets to determine
which is more (most) variable.
2. The measures of variance and standard deviation are used to determine the consistency
of a variable. For example, in the manufacture of Ô¨Åttings, such as nuts and bolts, the
variation in the diameters must be small, or the parts will not Ô¨Åt together.
3. The variance and standard deviation are used to determine the number of data values that
fall within a speciÔ¨Åed interval in a distribution. For example, Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem
(explained later) shows that, for any distribution, at least 75% of the data values will fall
within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
4. Finally, the variance and standard deviation are used quite often in inferential statistics.
These uses will be shown in later chapters of this textbook.
Example 3‚Äì25
Sales of Automobiles
The mean of the number of sales of cars over a 3-month period is 87, and the standard
deviation is 5. The mean of the commissions is $5225, and the standard deviation is
$773. Compare the variations of the two.
Solution
The coefÔ¨Åcients of variation are
Since the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation is larger for commissions, the commissions are more
variable than the sales.

and women.

women‚Äôs Ô¨Åtness magazines is 182, with a variance of 62. Compare the variations.
Solution
The coefÔ¨Åcients of variation are
The number of advertisements is more variable than the number of pages since the
coefÔ¨Åcient of variation is larger for advertisements.

Range Rule of Thumb
The range can be used to approximate the standard deviation. The approximation is called
the range rule of thumb.
The Range Rule of Thumb
A rough estimate of the standard deviation is
s  range
4
In other words, if the range is divided by 4, an approximate value for the standard
deviation is obtained. For example, the standard deviation for the data set 5, 8, 8, 9, 10,
12, and 13 is 2.7, and the range is 13  5  8. The range rule of thumb is s  2. The
range rule of thumb in this case underestimates the standard deviation somewhat; how-
ever, it is in the ballpark.
A note of caution should be mentioned here. The range rule of thumb is only an
approximation and should be used when the distribution of data values is unimodal and
roughly symmetric.
The range rule of thumb can be used to estimate the largest and smallest data values
of a data set. The smallest data value will be approximately 2 standard deviations below
the mean, and the largest data value will be approximately 2 standard deviations above
the mean of the data set. The mean for the previous data set is 9.3; hence,
Notice that the smallest data value was 5, and the largest data value was 13. Again,
these are rough approximations. For many data sets, almost all data values will fall within
2 standard deviations of the mean. Better approximations can be obtained by using
Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem and the empirical rule. These are explained next.

Chapter 3 Data Description
3‚Äì32
Chebyshev‚Äôs Theorem
As stated previously, the variance and standard deviation of a variable can be used to
determine the spread, or dispersion, of a variable. That is, the larger the variance or stan-
dard deviation, the more the data values are dispersed. For example, if two variables
measured in the same units have the same mean, say, 70, and the Ô¨Årst variable has a stan-
dard deviation of 1.5 while the second variable has a standard deviation of 10, then the
data for the second variable will be more spread out than the data for the Ô¨Årst variable.
Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem, developed by the Russian mathematician Chebyshev (1821‚Äì1894),
speciÔ¨Åes the proportions of the spread in terms of the standard deviation.
Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem
The proportion of values from a data set that will fall within k
standard deviations of the mean will be at least 
, where k is a number greater
than 1 (k is not necessarily an integer).
This theorem states that at least three-fourths, or 75%, of the data values will fall
within 2 standard deviations of the mean of the data set. This result is found by substi-
tuting k  2 in the expression.
For the example in which variable 1 has a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of
1.5, at least three-fourths, or 75%, of the data values fall between 67 and 73. These val-
ues are found by adding 2 standard deviations to the mean and subtracting 2 standard
deviations from the mean, as shown:
70  2(1.5)  70  3  73
and
70  2(1.5)  70  3  67
For variable 2, at least three-fourths, or 75%, of the data values fall between 50 and 90.
Again, these values are found by adding and subtracting, respectively, 2 standard devia-
tions to and from the mean.

Furthermore, the theorem states that at least eight-ninths, or 88.89%, of the data
values will fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This result is found by letting
k  3 and substituting in the expression.
For variable 1, at least eight-ninths, or 88.89%, of the data values fall between 65.5 and
74.5, since

Prices of Homes
The mean price of houses in a certain neighborhood is $50,000, and the standard
deviation is $10,000. Find the price range for which at least 75% of the houses
will sell.
Solution
Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem states that three-fourths, or 75%, of the data values will fall within
2 standard deviations of the mean. Thus,
$50,000  2($10,000)  $50,000  $20,000  $70,000
and
$50,000  2($10,000)  $50,000  $20,000  $30,000
Hence, at least 75% of all homes sold in the area will have a price range from $30,000
to $70,000.
Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem can be used to Ô¨Ånd the minimum percentage of data values that
will fall between any two given values. The procedure is shown in Example 3‚Äì28.
Example 3‚Äì28
Travel Allowances
Asurvey of local companies found that the mean amount of travel allowance for executives
was $0.25 per mile. The standard deviation was $0.02. Using Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem, Ô¨Ånd
the minimum percentage of the data values that will fall between $0.20 and $0.30.
This theorem can be applied to any distribution regardless of its shape (see
Figure 3‚Äì3).
Examples 3‚Äì27 and 3‚Äì28 illustrate the application of Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem.

Chapter 3 Data Description
3‚Äì34
Solution
Step 1
Subtract the mean from the larger value.
$0.30  $0.25  $0.05
Step 2
Divide the difference by the standard deviation to get k.
Step 3
Use Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem to Ô¨Ånd the percentage.
Hence, at least 84% of the data values will fall between $0.20 and $0.30.
The Empirical (Normal) Rule
Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem applies to any distribution regardless of its shape. However, when
a distribution is bell-shaped (or what is called normal), the following statements, which
make up the empirical rule, are true.
Approximately 68% of the data values will fall within 1 standard deviation of
the mean.
Approximately 95% of the data values will fall within 2 standard deviations of
the mean.
Approximately 99.7% of the data values will fall within 3 standard deviations of
the mean.
For example, suppose that the scores on a national achievement exam have a mean of
480 and a standard deviation of 90. If these scores are normally distributed, then approx-
imately 68% will fall between 390 and 570 (480  90  570 and 480  90  390).
Approximately 95% of the scores will fall between 300 and 660 (480  2  90  660
and 480  2  90  300). Approximately 99.7% will fall between 210 and 750 (480 
3  90  750 and 480  3  90  210). See Figure 3‚Äì4. (The empirical rule is explained

1. Apply Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem to the systolic blood pressure of normotensive men. At least
how many of the men in the study fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean?
2. At least how many of those men in the study fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean?
Assume that blood pressure is normally distributed among older adults. Answer the following
questions, using the empirical rule instead of Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem.
3. Give ranges for the diastolic blood pressure (normotensive and hypertensive) of older
women.
4. Do the normotensive, male, systolic blood pressure ranges overlap with the hypertensive,
male, systolic blood pressure ranges?
See page 180 for the answers.
1. What is the relationship between the variance and the
standard deviation? The square root of the variance is the
standard deviation.
2. Why might the range not be the best estimate of
variability? One extremely high or one extremely low data
value will inÔ¨Çuence the range.
3. What are the symbols used to represent the population
variance and standard deviation? s2; s
4. What are the symbols used to represent the sample
variance and standard deviation? s2; s
5. Why is the unbiased estimator of variance used?
6. The three data sets have the same mean and range,
but is the variation the same? Prove your answer by
computing the standard deviation. Assume the data were

c has the biggest variation.
For Exercises 7‚Äì17, Ô¨Ånd the range, variance, and standard
deviation unless the question asks for something different.
Assume the data represent samples, and use the shortcut
formula for the unbiased estimator to compute the
variance and standard deviation.

is called the Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient of skewness (PC). The
formula is
The values of the coefÔ¨Åcient usually range from 3 to
3. When the distribution is symmetric, the coefÔ¨Åcient
is zero; when the distribution is positively skewed, it is
positive; and when the distribution is negatively
skewed, it is negative.
Using the formula, Ô¨Ånd the coefÔ¨Åcient of skewness
for each distribution, and describe the shape of the

Measures of Position
In addition to measures of central tendency and measures of variation, there are measures
of position or location. These measures include standard scores, percentiles, deciles, and
quartiles. They are used to locate the relative position of a data value in the data set. For
example, if a value is located at the 80th percentile, it means that 80% of the values fall
below it in the distribution and 20% of the values fall above it. The median is the value
that corresponds to the 50th percentile, since one-half of the values fall below it and one-
half of the values fall above it. This section discusses these measures of position.
Standard Scores
There is an old saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt compare apples and oranges.‚Äù But with the use of
statistics, it can be done to some extent. Suppose that a student scored 90 on a music test
and 45 on an English exam. Direct comparison of raw scores is impossible, since the
exams might not be equivalent in terms of number of questions, value of each question,
and so on. However, a comparison of a relative standard similar to both can be made.
This comparison uses the mean and standard deviation and is called a standard score or
z score. (We also use z scores in later chapters.)
A standard score or z score tells how many standard deviations a data value is above
or below the mean for a speciÔ¨Åc distribution of values. If a standard score is zero, then
the data value is the same as the mean.
A z score or standard score for a value is obtained by subtracting the mean from the
value and dividing the result by the standard deviation. The symbol for a standard score
is z. The formula is
For samples, the formula is
For populations, the formula is
The z score represents the number of standard deviations that a data value falls above or
below the mean.
For the purpose of this section, it will be assumed that when we Ô¨Ånd z scores, the
data were obtained from samples.

Test Scores
A student scored 65 on a calculus test that had a mean of 50 and a standard deviation
of 10; she scored 30 on a history test with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 5.
Compare her relative positions on the two tests.
Solution

The average number
of faces that a person
learns to recognize and
remember during his or
her lifetime is 10,000.

Section 3‚Äì3 Measures of Position
143
3‚Äì41
For history the z score is
Since the z score for calculus is larger, her relative position in the calculus class is
higher than her relative position in the history class.
Note that if the z score is positive, the score is above the mean. If the z score is 0, the
score is the same as the mean. And if the z score is negative, the score is below the mean.
z  30  25

Test A

Test B
X  94
 100
s  10
Solution
For test A,
For test B,
The score for test A is relatively higher than the score for test B.
When all data for a variable are transformed into z scores, the resulting distribution
will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. A z score, then, is actually the num-
ber of standard deviations each value is from the mean for a speciÔ¨Åc distribution. In
Example 3‚Äì29, the calculus score of 65 was actually 1.5 standard deviations above the
mean of 50. This will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 6.
Percentiles
Percentiles are position measures used in educational and health-related Ô¨Åelds to indicate
the position of an individual in a group.
Percentiles divide the data set into 100 equal groups.
In many situations, the graphs and tables showing the percentiles for various mea-
sures such as test scores, heights, or weights have already been completed. Table 3‚Äì3
shows the percentile ranks for scaled scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Lan-
guage. If a student had a scaled score of 58 for section 1 (listening and comprehension),
that student would have a percentile rank of 81. Hence, that student did better than 81%
of the students who took section 1 of the exam.

Figure 3‚Äì5 shows percentiles in graphical form of weights of girls from ages 2 to 18.
To Ô¨Ånd the percentile rank of an 11-year-old who weighs 82 pounds, start at the 82-pound
weight on the left axis and move horizontally to the right. Find 11 on the horizontal axis
and move up vertically. The two lines meet at the 50th percentile curved line; hence, an
11-year-old girl who weighs 82 pounds is in the 50th percentile for her age group. If the
lines do not meet exactly on one of the curved percentile lines, then the percentile rank
must be approximated.
Percentiles are also used to compare an individual‚Äôs test score with the national
norm. For example, tests such as the National Educational Development Test (NEDT) are
taken by students in ninth or tenth grade. A student‚Äôs scores are compared with those of
other students locally and nationally by using percentile ranks. A similar test for elemen-
tary school students is called the California Achievement Test.
Percentiles are not the same as percentages. That is, if a student gets 72 correct
answers out of a possible 100, she obtains a percentage score of 72. There is no indication
of her position with respect to the rest of the class. She could have scored the highest, the
lowest, or somewhere in between. On the other hand, if a raw score of 72 corresponds to
the 64th percentile, then she did better than 64% of the students in her class.

Once a percentile graph has been constructed, one can Ô¨Ånd the approximate corre-
sponding percentile ranks for given blood pressure values and Ô¨Ånd approximate blood
pressure values for given percentile ranks.
For example, to Ô¨Ånd the percentile rank of a blood pressure reading of 130, Ô¨Ånd
130 on the x axis of Figure 3‚Äì6, and draw a vertical line to the graph. Then move hori-
zontally to the value on the y axis. Note that a blood pressure of 130 corresponds to
approximately the 70th percentile.
If the value that corresponds to the 40th percentile is desired, start on the y axis at
40 and draw a horizontal line to the graph. Then draw a vertical line to the x axis and read

Thus, if a person has a blood pressure of 118, he or she is at the 40th percentile.
Finding values and the corresponding percentile ranks by using a graph yields only
approximate answers. Several mathematical methods exist for computing percentiles for
data. These methods can be used to Ô¨Ånd the approximate percentile rank of a data value
or to Ô¨Ånd a data value corresponding to a given percentile. When the data set is large
(100 or more), these methods yield better results. Examples 3‚Äì32 through 3‚Äì35 show
these methods.
Percentile Formula
The percentile corresponding to a given value X is computed by using the following formula:

Solution
Arrange the data in order from lowest to highest.
2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20
Then substitute into the formula.
Since there are six values below a score of 12, the solution is
Thus, a student whose score was 12 did better than 65% of the class.

In addition to dividing the data set into four groups, quartiles can be used as a rough
measurement of variability. The interquartile range (IQR) is deÔ¨Åned as the difference
between Q1 and Q3 and is the range of the middle 50% of the data.
The interquartile range is used to identify outliers, and it is also used as a measure of
variability in exploratory data analysis, as shown in Section 3‚Äì4.
Deciles divide the distribution into 10 groups, as shown. They are denoted by D1,
D2, etc.
Note that D1 corresponds to P10; D2 corresponds to P20; etc. Deciles can be found by
using the formulas given for percentiles. Taken altogether then, these are the relation-
ships among percentiles, deciles, and quartiles.
Deciles are denoted by D1, D2, D3, . . . , D9, and they correspond to 
P10, P20, P30, . . . , P90.
Quartiles are denoted by Q1, Q2, Q3 and they correspond to P25, P50, P75.
The median is the same as P50 or Q2 or D5.

Outliers
A data set should be checked for extremely high or extremely low values. These values
are called outliers.
An outlier is an extremely high or an extremely low data value when compared with the
rest of the data values.
An outlier can strongly affect the mean and standard deviation of a variable. For
example, suppose a researcher mistakenly recorded an extremely high data value. This
value would then make the mean and standard deviation of the variable much larger than
they really were. Outliers can have an effect on other statistics as well.
There are several ways to check a data set for outliers. One method is shown in this
Procedure Table.

Procedure Table
Procedure for Identifying Outliers
Step 1
Arrange the data in order and Ô¨Ånd Q1 and Q3.
Step 2
Find the interquartile range: IQR  Q3  Q1.
Step 3
Multiply the IQR by 1.5.
Step 4
Subtract the value obtained in step 3 from Q1 and add the value to Q3.
Step 5
Check the data set for any data value that is smaller than Q1  1.5(IQR) 
or larger than Q3  1.5(IQR).
This procedure is shown in Example 3‚Äì37.
Example 3‚Äì37
Check the following data set for outliers.
5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 18, 22, 50
Solution
The data value 50 is extremely suspect. These are the steps in checking for an outlier.
Step 1
Find Q1 and Q3. This was done in Example 3‚Äì36; Q1 is 9 and Q3 is 20.
Step 2
Find the interquartile range (IQR), which is Q3  Q1.
IQR  Q3  Q1  20  9  11
Step 3
Multiply this value by 1.5.
1.5(11)  16.5
Step 4
Subtract the value obtained in step 3 from Q1, and add the value obtained in
step 3 to Q3.
9  16.5  7.5
and
20  16.5  36.5
Step 5
Check the data set for any data values that fall outside the interval from 7.5
to 36.5. The value 50 is outside this interval; hence, it can be considered an
outlier.
There are several reasons why outliers may occur. First, the data value may have
resulted from a measurement or observational error. Perhaps the researcher measured the
variable incorrectly. Second, the data value may have resulted from a recording error.
That is, it may have been written or typed incorrectly. Third, the data value may have
been obtained from a subject that is not in the deÔ¨Åned population. For example, suppose
test scores were obtained from a seventh-grade class, but a student in that class was
actually in the sixth grade and had special permission to attend the class. This student
might have scored extremely low on that particular exam on that day. Fourth, the data
value might be a legitimate value that occurred by chance (although the probability is
extremely small).

Section 3‚Äì3 Measures of Position
153
3‚Äì51
There are no hard-and-fast rules on what to do with outliers, nor is there complete
agreement among statisticians on ways to identify them. Obviously, if they occurred as a
result of an error, an attempt should be made to correct the error or else the data value
should be omitted entirely. When they occur naturally by chance, the statistician must
make a decision about whether to include them in the data set.
When a distribution is normal or bell-shaped, data values that are beyond 3 standard
deviations of the mean can be considered suspected outliers.
Applying the Concepts 3‚Äì3
Determining Dosages
In an attempt to determine necessary dosages of a new drug (HDL) used to control sepsis,
assume you administer varying amounts of HDL to 40 mice. You create four groups and label
them low dosage, moderate dosage, large dosage, and very large dosage. The dosages also
vary within each group. After the mice are injected with the HDL and the sepsis bacteria, the
time until the onset of sepsis is recorded. Your job as a statistician is to effectively
communicate the results of the study.
1. Which measures of position could be used to help describe the data results?
2. If 40% of the mice in the top quartile survived after the injection, how many mice would
that be?
3. What information can be given from using percentiles?
4. What information can be given from using quartiles?
5. What information can be given from using standard scores?
See page 180 for the answers.
1. What is a z score? A z score tells how many standard
deviations the data value is above or below the mean.
2. DeÔ¨Åne percentile rank. A percentile rank indicates the
percentage of data values that fall below the speciÔ¨Åc rank.
3. What is the difference between a percentage and a
percentile? A percentile is a relative measurement of position;
a percentage is an absolute measure of the part to the total.
4. DeÔ¨Åne quartile. A quartile is a relative measure of position
obtained by dividing the data set into quarters.
5. What is the relationship between quartiles and
percentiles? Q1  P25; Q2  P50; Q3  P75
6. What is a decile? A decile is a relative measure of position
obtained by dividing the data set into tenths.
7. How are deciles related to percentiles?
D1  P10; D2  P20; D3  P30; etc.
8. To which percentile, quartile, and decile does the
median correspond? P50; Q2; D5

Exploratory Data Analysis
In traditional statistics, data are organized by using a frequency distribution. From this
distribution various graphs such as the histogram, frequency polygon, and ogive can be
constructed to determine the shape or nature of the distribution. In addition, various sta-
tistics such as the mean and standard deviation can be computed to summarize the data.
The purpose of traditional analysis is to conÔ¨Årm various conjectures about the nature
of the data. For example, from a carefully designed study, a researcher might want to know
if the proportion of Americans who are exercising today has increased from 10 years ago.
This study would contain various assumptions about the population, various deÔ¨Ånitions
such as of exercise, and so on.
In exploratory data analysis (EDA), data can be organized using a stem and leaf
plot. (See Chapter 2.) The measure of central tendency used in EDA is the median. The
measure of variation used in EDA is the interquartile range Q3  Q1. In EDA the data
are represented graphically using a boxplot (sometimes called a box-and-whisker plot).
The purpose of exploratory data analysis is to examine data to Ô¨Ånd out what information
can be discovered about the data such as the center and the spread. Exploratory data
analysis was developed by John Tukey and presented in his book Exploratory Data
Analysis (Addison-Wesley, 1977).
The Five-Number Summary and Boxplots
A boxplot can be used to graphically represent the data set. These plots involve Ô¨Åve
speciÔ¨Åc values:
1. The lowest value of the data set (i.e., minimum)
2. Q1
3. The median
4. Q3
5. The highest value of the data set (i.e., maximum)
These values are called a Ô¨Åve-number summary of the data set.
A boxplot is a graph of a data set obtained by drawing a horizontal line from the
minimum data value to Q1, drawing a horizontal line from Q3 to the maximum data value,
and drawing a box whose vertical sides pass through Q1 and Q3 with a vertical line inside
the box passing through the median or Q2.
Objective 
Use the techniques
of exploratory data
analysis, including
boxplots and Ô¨Åve-
number summaries,
to discover various
aspects of data.

Procedure for constructing a boxplot
1. Find the Ô¨Åve-number summary for the data values, that is, the maximum and
minimum data values, Q1 and Q3, and the median.
2. Draw a horizontal axis with a scale such that it includes the maximum and
minimum data values.
3. Draw a box whose vertical sides go through Q1 and Q3, and draw a vertical line
though the median.
4. Draw a line from the minimum data value to the left side of the box and a line from
the maximum data value to the right side of the box.

Information Obtained from a Boxplot
1. a. If the median is near the center of the box, the distribution is approximately symmetric.
b. If the median falls to the left of the center of the box, the distribution is positively
skewed.
c. If the median falls to the right of the center, the distribution is negatively skewed.
2. a. If the lines are about the same length, the distribution is approximately symmetric.
b. If the right line is larger than the left line, the distribution is positively skewed.
c. If the left line is larger than the right line, the distribution is negatively skewed.
The boxplot in Figure 3‚Äì7 indicates that the distribution is slightly positively skewed.
If the boxplots for two or more data sets are graphed on the same axis, the distribu-
tions can be compared. To compare the averages, use the location of the medians. To com-
pare the variability, use the interquartile range, i.e., the length of the boxes. Example 3‚Äì39
shows this procedure.

Step 4
Compare the plots. It is quite apparent that the distribution for the cheese
substitute data has a higher median than the median for the distribution for
the real cheese data. The variation or spread for the distribution of the real
cheese data is larger than the variation for the distribution of the cheese
substitute data.

A modiÔ¨Åed boxplot can be drawn and used to check for outliers. See Exercise 18 in
Extending the Concepts in this section.
In exploratory data analysis, hinges are used instead of quartiles to construct box-
plots. When the data set consists of an even number of values, hinges are the same as
quartiles. Hinges for a data set with an odd number of values differ somewhat from quar-
tiles. However, since most calculators and computer programs use quartiles, they will be
used in this textbook.
Another important point to remember is that the summary statistics (median and
interquartile range) used in exploratory data analysis are said to be resistant statistics. A
resistant statistic is relatively less affected by outliers than a nonresistant statistic. The
mean and standard deviation are nonresistant statistics. Sometimes when a distribution
is skewed or contains outliers, the median and interquartile range may more accurately
summarize the data than the mean and standard deviation, since the mean and standard
deviation are more affected in this case. 
Table 3‚Äì5 shows the correspondence between the traditional and the exploratory data
analysis approach.

Applying the Concepts 3‚Äì4
The Noisy Workplace
Assume you work for OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and have
complaints about noise levels from some of the workers at a state power plant. You charge the
power plant with taking decibel readings at six different areas of the plant at different times of
the day and week. The results of the data collection are listed. Use boxplots to initially explore
the data and make recommendations about which plant areas workers must be provided with
protective ear wear. The safe hearing level is approximately 120 decibels.

Summary
‚Ä¢ This chapter explains the basic ways to summarize data. These include measures of
central tendency. They are the mean, median, mode, and midrange. The weighted
mean can also be used. (3‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ To summarize the variation of data, statisticians use measures of variation or
dispersion. The three most common measures of variation are the range, variance,
and standard deviation. The coefÔ¨Åcient of variation can be used to compare the
variation of two data sets. The data values are distributed according to Chebyshev‚Äôs
theorem on the empirical rule. (3‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ There are several measures of the position of data values in the set. There are
standard scores, percentiles, quartiles, and deciles. Sometimes a data set contains
an extremely high or extremely low data value, called an outlier. (3‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ Other methods can be used to describe a data set. These methods are the Ô¨Åve-number
summary and boxplots. These methods are called exploratory data analysis. (3‚Äì4)
The techniques explained in Chapter 2 and this chapter are the basic techniques used
in descriptive statistics.

complete the following exercises.
1. Business and Finance Use the data collected in data
project 1 of Chapter 2 regarding earnings per share.
Determine the mean, mode, median, and midrange for
the two data sets. Is one measure of center more
appropriate than the other for these data? Do the
measures of center appear similar? What does this say
about the symmetry of the distribution?
2. Sports and Leisure Use the data collected in data
project 2 of Chapter 2 regarding home runs. Determine

Teacher Salaries
1. The sample mean is $22,921.67, the sample median is
$16,500, and the sample mode is $11,000. If you work
for the school board and do not want to raise salaries, you
could say that the average teacher salary is $22,921.67.
2. If you work for the teachers‚Äô union and want a raise for
the teachers, either the sample median of $16,500 or the
sample mode of $11,000 would be a good measure of
center to report.
3. The outlier is $107,000. With the outlier removed, the
sample mean is $15,278.18, the sample median is
$16,400, and the sample mode is still $11,000. The
mean is greatly affected by the outlier and allows the
school board to report an average teacher salary that is
not representative of a ‚Äútypical‚Äù teacher salary.
4. If the salaries represented every teacher in the school
district, the averages would be parameters, since we
have data from the entire population.
5. The mean can be misleading in the presence of outliers,
since it is greatly affected by these extreme values.
6. Since the mean is greater than both the median and the
mode, the distribution is skewed to the right (positively
skewed).

Blood Pressure
1. Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem does not work for scores within
1 standard deviation of the mean.
2. At least 75% (900) of the normotensive men will fall in
the interval 105‚Äì141 mm Hg.
3. About 95% (1330) of the normotensive women have
diastolic blood pressures between 62 and 90 mm Hg.
About 95% (1235) of the hypertensive women have
diastolic blood pressures between 68 and 108 mm Hg.
4. About 95% (1140) of the normotensive men have
systolic blood pressures between 105 and 141 mm Hg.
About 95% (1045) of the hypertensive men have
systolic blood pressures between 119 and 187 mm Hg.
These two ranges do overlap.
Section 3‚Äì3
Determining Dosages
1. The quartiles could be used to describe the data 
results.
2. Since there are 10 mice in the upper quartile, this would
mean that 4 of them survived.
3. The percentiles would give us the position of a single
mouse with respect to all other mice.
4. The quartiles divide the data into four groups of equal
size.
5. Standard scores would give us the position of a single
mouse with respect to the mean time until the onset of
sepsis.
Section 3‚Äì4
The Noisy Workplace
From this boxplot, we see that about 25% of the readings
in area 5 are above the safe hearing level of 120 decibels.
Those workers in area 5 should deÔ¨Ånitely have protective
ear wear. One of the readings in area 6 is above the safe
hearing level. It might be a good idea to provide protective
ear wear to those workers in area 6 as well. Areas 1‚Äì4
appear to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù with respect to hearing level, with
area 4 being the safest.
Answers to Applying the Concepts
5. Politics and Economics Use the data collected in data
project 5 of Chapter 2 regarding delegates. Use the
formulas for population mean and standard deviation to
compute the parameters for all 50 states. What is the
z score associated with California? Delaware? Ohio?
Which states are more than 2 standard deviations from
the mean?
6. Your Class Use your class as a sample. Determine the
mean, median, and standard deviation for the age of
students in your class. What z score would a 40-year-old
have? Would it be unusual to have an age of 40?
Determine the skew of the data, using the Pearson
coefÔ¨Åcient of skewness. (See Exercise 48, page 141.)

Would You Bet Your Life?
Humans not only bet money when they gamble, but also bet their lives by engaging in
unhealthy activities such as smoking, drinking, using drugs, and exceeding the speed
limit when driving. Many people don‚Äôt care about the risks involved in these activities
since they do not understand the concepts of probability. On the other hand, people may
fear activities that involve little risk to health or life because these activities have been
sensationalized by the press and media.
In his book Probabilities in Everyday Life (Ivy Books, p. 191), John D. McGervey states
When people have been asked to estimate the frequency of death from various causes, the most
overestimated categories are those involving pregnancy, tornadoes, Ô¨Çoods, Ô¨Åre, and homicide.
The most underestimated categories include deaths from diseases such as diabetes, strokes,
tuberculosis, asthma, and stomach cancer (although cancer in general is overestimated).
The question then is, Would you feel safer if you Ô¨Çew across the United States on a
commercial airline or if you drove? How much greater is the risk of one way to travel
over the other? See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of the chapter for the answer.
In this chapter, you will learn about probability‚Äîits meaning, how it is computed,
and how to evaluate it in terms of the likelihood of an event actually happening.
Introduction
A cynical person once said, ‚ÄúThe only two sure things are death and taxes.‚Äù This philos-
ophy no doubt arose because so much in people‚Äôs lives is affected by chance. From the time
you awake until you go to bed, you make decisions regarding the possible events that are
governed at least in part by chance. For example, should you carry an umbrella to work
today? Will your car battery last until spring? Should you accept that new job?
Probability as a general concept can be deÔ¨Åned as the chance of an event occurring.
Many people are familiar with probability from observing or playing games of chance,
such as card games, slot machines, or lotteries. In addition to being used in games of
chance, probability theory is used in the Ô¨Åelds of insurance, investments, and weather fore-
casting and in various other areas. Finally, as stated in Chapter 1, probability is the basis

of inferential statistics. For example, predictions are based on probability, and hypotheses
are tested by using probability.
The basic concepts of probability are explained in this chapter. These concepts
include probability experiments, sample spaces, the addition and multiplication rules,
and the probabilities of complementary events. Also in this chapter, you will learn the rule
for counting, the differences between permutations and combinations, and how to Ô¨Ågure
out how many different combinations for speciÔ¨Åc situations exist. Finally, Section 4‚Äì5
explains how the counting rules and the probability rules can be used together to solve a
wide variety of problems.

Sample Spaces and Probability
The theory of probability grew out of the study of various games of chance using coins,
dice, and cards. Since these devices lend themselves well to the application of concepts
of probability, they will be used in this chapter as examples. This section begins by
explaining some basic concepts of probability. Then the types of probability and proba-
bility rules are discussed.
Basic Concepts
Processes such as Ô¨Çipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card from a deck are called
probability experiments.
A probability experiment is a chance process that leads to well-deÔ¨Åned results called
outcomes.
An outcome is the result of a single trial of a probability experiment.
A trial means Ô¨Çipping a coin once, rolling one die once, or the like. When a coin is
tossed, there are two possible outcomes: head or tail. (Note: We exclude the possibility
of a coin landing on its edge.) In the roll of a single die, there are six possible outcomes:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In any experiment, the set of all possible outcomes is called the
sample space.
A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a probability experiment.
Some sample spaces for various probability experiments are shown here.

Head, tail
Roll a die
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Answer a true/false question
True, false
Toss two coins
Head-head, tail-tail, head-tail, tail-head
It is important to realize that when two coins are tossed, there are four possible out-
comes, as shown in the fourth experiment above. Both coins could fall heads up. Both
coins could fall tails up. Coin 1 could fall heads up and coin 2 tails up. Or coin 1 could
fall tails up and coin 2 heads up. Heads and tails will be abbreviated as H and T through-
out this chapter.

Drawing Cards
Find the sample space for drawing one card from an ordinary deck of cards.
Solution
Since there are 4 suits (hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades) and 13 cards for each suit
(ace through king), there are 52 outcomes in the sample space. See Figure 4‚Äì2.
Example 4‚Äì3
Gender of Children
Find the sample space for the gender of the children if a family has three children. Use
B for boy and G for girl.
Solution
There are two genders, male and female, and each child could be either gender. Hence,
there are eight possibilities, as shown here.
BBB
BBG
BGB

BGG
In Examples 4‚Äì1 through 4‚Äì3, the sample spaces were found by observation and rea-
soning; however, another way to Ô¨Ånd all possible outcomes of a probability experiment
is to use a tree diagram.
Solution
Since each die can land in six different ways, and two dice are rolled, the sample space
can be presented by a rectangular array, as shown in Figure 4‚Äì1. The sample space is the
list of pairs of numbers in the chart.

A tree diagram is a device consisting of line segments emanating from a starting point
and also from the outcome point. It is used to determine all possible outcomes of a
probability experiment.

Historical Note
The famous Italian
astronomer Galileo
(1564‚Äì1642) found
that a sum of 10
occurs more often than
any other sum when
three dice are tossed.
Previously, it was
thought that a sum of 9
occurred more often
than any other sum.

Example 4‚Äì4
Gender of Children
Use a tree diagram to Ô¨Ånd the sample space for the gender of three children in a family,
as in Example 4‚Äì3.
Solution
Since there are two possibilities (boy or girl) for the Ô¨Årst child, draw two branches from
a starting point and label one B and the other G. Then if the Ô¨Årst child is a boy, there are
two possibilities for the second child (boy or girl), so draw two branches from B and
label one B and the other G. Do the same if the Ô¨Årst child is a girl. Follow the same
procedure for the third child. The completed tree diagram is shown in Figure 4‚Äì3. To
Ô¨Ånd the outcomes for the sample space, trace through all the possible branches,
beginning at the starting point for each one.
Historical Note
A mathematician
named Jerome Cardan
(1501‚Äì1576) used his
talents in mathematics
and probability theory
to make his living as a
gambler. He is thought
to be the Ô¨Årst person to
formulate the deÔ¨Ånition
of classical probability.
An outcome was deÔ¨Åned previously as the result of a single trial of a probability
experiment. In many problems, one must Ô¨Ånd the probability of two or more outcomes.
For this reason, it is necessary to distinguish between an outcome and an event.
An event consists of a set of outcomes of a probability experiment.
An event can be one outcome or more than one outcome. For example, if a die is
rolled and a 6 shows, this result is called an outcome, since it is a result of a single trial.
An event with one outcome is called a simple event. The event of getting an odd number

when a die is rolled is called a compound event, since it consists of three outcomes or
three simple events. In general, a compound event consists of two or more outcomes or
simple events.
There are three basic interpretations of probability:
1. Classical probability
2. Empirical or relative frequency probability
3. Subjective probability
Classical Probability
Classical probability uses sample spaces to determine the numerical probability that an
event will happen. You do not actually have to perform the experiment to determine that
probability. Classical probability is so named because it was the Ô¨Årst type of probability
studied formally by mathematicians in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Classical probability assumes that all outcomes in the sample space are equally
likely to occur. For example, when a single die is rolled, each outcome has the same prob-
ability of occurring. Since there are six outcomes, each outcome has a probability of .
When a card is selected from an ordinary deck of 52 cards, you assume that the deck
has been shufÔ¨Çed, and each card has the same probability of being selected. In this case,
it is .
Equally likely events are events that have the same probability of occurring.

Probabilities can be expressed as fractions, decimals, or‚Äîwhere appropriate‚Äî
percentages. If you ask, ‚ÄúWhat is the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed?‚Äù
typical responses can be any of the following three.
‚ÄúOne-half.‚Äù
‚ÄúPoint Ô¨Åve.‚Äù
‚ÄúFifty percent.‚Äù1
These answers are all equivalent. In most cases, the answers to examples and exercises
given in this chapter are expressed as fractions or decimals, but percentages are used
where appropriate.
1Strictly speaking, a percent is not a probability. However, in everyday language, probabilities are often expressed as percents
(i.e., there is a 60% chance of rain tomorrow). For this reason, some probabilities will be expressed as percents throughout this book.
Historical Note
During the mid-1600s,
a professional gambler
named Chevalier de
M√©r√© made a consid-
erable amount of
money on a gambling
game. He would bet
unsuspecting patrons
that in four rolls of a
die, he could get at
least one 6. He was
so successful at the
game that some
people refused to
play. He decided that
a new game was
necessary to continue
his winnings. By
reasoning, he Ô¨Ågured
he could roll at least
one double 6 in 24
rolls of two dice, but
his reasoning was
incorrect and he lost
systematically.
Unable to Ô¨Ågure out
why, he contacted
a mathematician
named Blaise Pascal
(1623‚Äì1662) to Ô¨Ånd
out why.
Pascal became
interested and
began studying
probability theory.
He corresponded with
a French government
ofÔ¨Åcial, Pierre de
Fermat (1601‚Äì1665),
whose hobby was
mathematics. Together
the two formulated
the beginnings of
probability theory.

Rounding Rule for Probabilities
Probabilities should be expressed as reduced
fractions or rounded to two or three decimal places. When the probability of an event is
an extremely small decimal, it is permissible to round the decimal to the Ô¨Årst nonzero
digit after the point. For example, 0.0000587 would be 0.00006. When obtaining proba-
bilities from one of the tables in Appendix C, use the number of decimal places given in
the table. If decimals are converted to percentages to express probabilities, move the dec-
imal point two places to the right and add a percent sign.

Historical Note
Ancient Greeks and
Romans made crude
dice from animal
bones, various stones,
minerals, and ivory.
When the dice were
tested mathematically,
some were found to
be quite accurate.
Example 4‚Äì5
Drawing Cards
Find the probability of getting a black 10 when drawing a card from a deck.
Solution
There are 52 cards in a deck, and there are two black 10s‚Äîthe 10 of spades and the 10
of clubs. Hence the probability of getting a black 10 is P(black 10) 
.

Example 4‚Äì6
Gender of Children
If a family has three children, Ô¨Ånd the probability that two of the three children are girls.
Solution
The sample space for the gender of the children for a family that has three children
has eight outcomes, that is, BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, GGG, GGB, GBG, and BGG.
(See Examples 4‚Äì3 and 4‚Äì4.) Since there are three ways to have two girls, namely,
GGB, GBG, and BGG, P(two girls)  .
In probability theory, it is important to understand the meaning of the words and and
or. For example, if you were asked to Ô¨Ånd the probability of getting a queen and a heart
when you were drawing a single card from a deck, you would be looking for the queen
of hearts. Here the word and means ‚Äúat the same time.‚Äù The word or has two meanings.
For example, if you were asked to Ô¨Ånd the probability of selecting a queen or a heart
when one card is selected from a deck, you would be looking for one of the 4 queens or
one of the 13 hearts. In this case, the queen of hearts would be included in both cases and
counted twice. So there would be 4  13  1  16 possibilities.
On the other hand, if you were asked to Ô¨Ånd the probability of getting a queen or a
king, you would be looking for one of the 4 queens or one of the 4 kings. In this case,
there would be 4  4  8 possibilities. In the Ô¨Årst case, both events can occur at the same
time; we say that this is an example of the inclusive or. In the second case, both events
cannot occur at the same time, and we say that this is an example of the exclusive or.

Example 4‚Äì7
Drawing Cards
A card is drawn from an ordinary deck. Find these probabilities.
a. Of getting a jack
b. Of getting the 6 of clubs (i.e., a 6 and a club)
c. Of getting a 3 or a diamond
d. Of getting a 3 or a 6

Solution
a. Refer to the sample space in Figure 4‚Äì2. There are 4 jacks so there are 4
outcomes in event E and 52 possible outcomes in the sample space. Hence,
P(jack) 

b. Since there is only one 6 of clubs in event E, the probability of getting a 6 of 
clubs is
P(6 of clubs) 
c. There are four 3s and 13 diamonds, but the 3 of diamonds is counted twice in this
listing. Hence, there are 16 possibilities of drawing a 3 or a diamond, so
P(3 or diamond) 

This is an example of the inclusive or.
d. Since there are four 3s and four 6s,
P(3 or 6) 

This is an example of the exclusive or.
There are four basic probability rules. These rules are helpful in solving probability
problems, in understanding the nature of probability, and in deciding if your answers to
the problems are correct.

Probability Rule 1
The probability of any event E is a number (either a fraction or decimal) between and
including 0 and 1. This is denoted by 0  P(E)  1.
Probability Rule 2
If an event E cannot occur (i.e., the event contains no members in the sample space), its
probability is 0.
Probability Rule 3
If an event E is certain, then the probability of E is 1.
Rule 1 states that probabilities cannot be negative or greater than 1.

Rolling a Die
When a single die is rolled, Ô¨Ånd the probability of getting a 9.
Solution
Since the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it is impossible to get a 9. Hence, the
probability is P(9) 

Complementary Events
Another important concept in probability theory is that of complementary events. When
a die is rolled, for instance, the sample space consists of the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
6. The event E of getting odd numbers consists of the outcomes 1, 3, and 5. The event of
not getting an odd number is called the complement of event E, and it consists of the out-
comes 2, 4, and 6.
The complement of an event E is the set of outcomes in the sample space that are
not included in the outcomes of event E. The complement of E is denoted by 
(read
‚ÄúE bar‚Äù).
Example 4‚Äì10 further illustrates the concept of complementary events.

Probability Rule 4
The sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes in the sample space is 1.
In other words, if P(E)  1, then the event E is certain to occur. This rule is illus-
trated in Example 4‚Äì9.
Example 4‚Äì9
Rolling a Die
When a single die is rolled, what is the probability of getting a number less than 7?
Solution
Since all outcomes‚Äî1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6‚Äîare less than 7, the probability is
P(number less than 7) 
 1
The event of getting a number less than 7 is certain.
In other words, probability values range from 0 to 1. When the probability of an
event is close to 0, its occurrence is highly unlikely. When the probability of an event is
near 0.5, there is about a 50-50 chance that the event will occur; and when the probabil-
ity of an event is close to 1, the event is highly likely to occur.

Example 4‚Äì10
Finding Complements
Find the complement of each event.
a. Rolling a die and getting a 4
b. Selecting a letter of the alphabet and getting a vowel

c. Selecting a month and getting a month that begins with a J
d. Selecting a day of the week and getting a weekday
Solution
a. Getting a 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6
b. Getting a consonant (assume y is a consonant)
c. Getting February, March, April, May, August, September, October, November,
or December
d. Getting Saturday or Sunday
The outcomes of an event and the outcomes of the complement make up the entire
sample space. For example, if two coins are tossed, the sample space is HH, HT, TH, and
TT. The complement of ‚Äúgetting all heads‚Äù is not ‚Äúgetting all tails,‚Äù since the event ‚Äúall
heads‚Äù is HH, and the complement of HH is HT, TH, and TT. Hence, the complement of
the event ‚Äúall heads‚Äù is the event ‚Äúgetting at least one tail.‚Äù
Since the event and its complement make up the entire sample space, it follows
that the sum of the probability of the event and the probability of its complement
will equal 1. That is, P(E)  P( )  1. For example, let E  all heads, or HH, and
let 
 at least one tail, or HT, TH, TT. Then P(E) 
and P( )  ; hence, 
P(E)  P( ) 

 1.
The rule for complementary events can be stated algebraically in three ways.

Stated in words, the rule is: If the probability of an event or the probability of its com-
plement is known, then the other can be found by subtracting the probability from 1. This
rule is important in probability theory because at times the best solution to a problem is
to Ô¨Ånd the probability of the complement of an event and then subtract from 1 to get the
probability of the event itself.

Probabilities can be represented pictorially by Venn diagrams. Figure 4‚Äì4(a) shows

the rectangle but outside the circle representing P(E). Recall that P(S)  1 and P(E) 
1  P( ). The reasoning is that P(E) is represented by the area of the circle and P( ) is
the probability of the events that are outside the circle.
Empirical Probability
The difference between classical and empirical probability is that classical probability
assumes that certain outcomes are equally likely (such as the outcomes when a die is
rolled), while empirical probability relies on actual experience to determine the likelihood
of outcomes. In empirical probability, one might actually roll a given die 6000 times,
observe the various frequencies, and use these frequencies to determine the probability of
an outcome.
Suppose, for example, that a researcher for the American Automobile Association
(AAA) asked 50 people who plan to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday how they will
get to their destination. The results can be categorized in a frequency distribution as
shown.
Method

Now probabilities can be computed for various categories. For example, the proba-
bility of selecting a person who is driving is , since 41 out of the 50 people said that
they were driving.

Law of Large Numbers

25 times? Not all the time. You should expect about 25 heads if the coin is fair. But due
to chance variation, 25 heads will not occur most of the time.
If the empirical probability of getting a head is computed by using a small number of
trials, it is usually not exactly . However, as the number of trials increases, the empirical
probability of getting a head will approach the theoretical probability of , if in fact the
coin is fair (i.e., balanced). This phenomenon is an example of the law of large numbers.
You should be careful to not think that the number of heads and number of tails tend
to ‚Äúeven out.‚Äù As the number of trials increases, the proportion of heads to the total num-
ber of trials will approach . This law holds for any type of gambling game‚Äîtossing dice,
playing roulette, and so on.
It should be pointed out that the probabilities that the proportions steadily approach
may or may not agree with those theorized in the classical model. If not, it can have impor-
tant implications, such as ‚Äúthe die is not fair.‚Äù Pit bosses in Las Vegas watch for empiri-
cal trends that do not agree with classical theories, and they will sometimes take a set of
dice out of play if observed frequencies are too far out of line with classical expected
frequencies.
Subjective Probability
The third type of probability is called subjective probability. Subjective probability uses
a probability value based on an educated guess or estimate, employing opinions and inex-
act information.
In subjective probability, a person or group makes an educated guess at the chance
that an event will occur. This guess is based on the person‚Äôs experience and evaluation of
a solution. For example, a sportswriter may say that there is a 70% probability that the
Pirates will win the pennant next year. A physician might say that, on the basis of her
diagnosis, there is a 30% chance the patient will need an operation. A seismologist might
say there is an 80% probability that an earthquake will occur in a certain area. These are
only a few examples of how subjective probability is used in everyday life.
All three types of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) are used to solve
a variety of problems in business, engineering, and other Ô¨Åelds.
Probability and Risk Taking
An area in which people fail to understand probability is risk taking. Actually, people fear
situations or events that have a relatively small probability of happening rather than those
events that have a greater likelihood of occurring. For example, many people think that
the crime rate is increasing every year. However, in his book entitled How Risk Affects
Your Everyday Life, author James Walsh states: ‚ÄúDespite widespread concern about the
number of crimes committed in the United States, FBI and Justice Department statistics
show that the national crime rate has remained fairly level for 20 years. It even dropped
slightly in the early 1990s.‚Äù
He further states, ‚ÄúToday most media coverage of risk to health and well-being
focuses on shock and outrage.‚Äù Shock and outrage make good stories and can scare us
about the wrong dangers. For example, the author states that if a person is 20% over-
weight, the loss of life expectancy is 900 days (about 3 years), but loss of life expectancy
from exposure to radiation emitted by nuclear power plants is 0.02 day. As you can see,
being overweight is much more of a threat than being exposed to radioactive emission.
Many people gamble daily with their lives, for example, by using tobacco, drinking
and driving, and riding motorcycles. When people are asked to estimate the probabilities
or frequencies of death from various causes, they tend to overestimate causes such as
accidents, Ô¨Åres, and Ô¨Çoods and to underestimate the probabilities of death from diseases
(other than cancer), strokes, etc. For example, most people think that their chances of
dying of a heart attack are 1 in 20, when in fact they are almost 1 in 3; the chances of

dying by pesticide poisoning are 1 in 200,000 (True Odds by James Walsh). The reason
people think this way is that the news media sensationalize deaths resulting from cata-
strophic events and rarely mention deaths from disease.
When you are dealing with life-threatening catastrophes such as hurricanes, Ô¨Çoods,
automobile accidents, or texting while driving, it is important to get the facts. That is, get
the actual numbers from accredited statistical agencies or reliable statistical studies, and
then compute the probabilities and make decisions based on your knowledge of proba-
bility and statistics.
In summary, then, when you make a decision or plan a course of action based on
probability, make sure that you understand the true probability of the event occurring.
Also, Ô¨Ånd out how the information was obtained (i.e., from a reliable source). Weigh the
cost of the action and decide if it is worth it. Finally, look for other alternatives or courses
of action with less risk involved.
Applying the Concepts 4‚Äì1
Tossing a Coin
Assume you are at a carnival and decide to play one of the games. You spot a table where a
person is Ô¨Çipping a coin, and since you have an understanding of basic probability, you believe
that the odds of winning are in your favor. When you get to the table, you Ô¨Ånd out that all you
have to do is to guess which side of the coin will be facing up after it is tossed. You are assured
that the coin is fair, meaning that each of the two sides has an equally likely chance of
occurring. You think back about what you learned in your statistics class about probability
before you decide what to bet on. Answer the following questions about the coin-tossing game.
1. What is the sample space?
2. What are the possible outcomes?
3. What does the classical approach to probability say about computing probabilities for this
type of problem?
You decide to bet on heads, believing that it has a 50% chance of coming up. A friend of yours,
who had been playing the game for awhile before you got there, tells you that heads has come
up the last 9 times in a row. You remember the law of large numbers.
4. What is the law of large numbers, and does it change your thoughts about what will occur
on the next toss?
5. What does the empirical approach to probability say about this problem, and could you use
it to solve this problem?
6. Can subjective probabilities be used to help solve this problem? Explain.
7. Assume you could win $1 million if you could guess what the results of the next toss will
be. What would you bet on? Why?
See page 249 for the answers.
1. What is a probability experiment? A probability experiment
is a chance process that leads to well-deÔ¨Åned outcomes.
2. DeÔ¨Åne sample space. The set of all possible outcomes of a
probability experiment is called a sample space.
3. What is the difference between an outcome and an
event? An outcome is the result of a single trial of a probability
experiment, but an event can consist of more than one outcome.
4. What are equally likely events? Equally likely events have
the same probability of occurring.
5. What is the range of the values of the probability of an
event? The range of values is 0 to 1 inclusive.
6. When an event is certain to occur, what is its
probability? 1

probability? 0
8. What is the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes
in a sample space? 1
9. If the probability that it will rain tomorrow is 0.20, what

The Addition Rules for Probability
Many problems involve Ô¨Ånding the probability of two or more events. For example, at a
large political gathering, you might wish to know, for a person selected at random, the
probability that the person is a female or is a Republican. In this case, there are three pos-
sibilities to consider:
1. The person is a female.
2. The person is a Republican.
3. The person is both a female and a Republican.
Consider another example. At the same gathering there are Republicans, Democrats,
and Independents. If a person is selected at random, what is the probability that the per-
son is a Democrat or an Independent? In this case, there are only two possibilities:
1. The person is a Democrat.
2. The person is an Independent.
The difference between the two examples is that in the Ô¨Årst case, the person selected
can be a female and a Republican at the same time. In the second case, the person
selected cannot be both a Democrat and an Independent at the same time. In the second
case, the two events are said to be mutually exclusive; in the Ô¨Årst case, they are not mutu-
ally exclusive.
Two events are mutually exclusive events if they cannot occur at the same time
(i.e., they have no outcomes in common).
In another situation, the events of getting a 4 and getting a 6 when a single card is
drawn from a deck are mutually exclusive events, since a single card cannot be both a 4
and a 6. On the other hand, the events of getting a 4 and getting a heart on a single draw
are not mutually exclusive, since you can select the 4 of hearts when drawing a single
card from an ordinary deck.
Objective 
Find the probability
of compound events,
using the addition
rules.

Historical Note
The Ô¨Årst book on
probability, The Book
of Chance and
Games, was written
by Jerome Cardan
(1501‚Äì1576). Cardan
was an astrologer,
philosopher, physician,
mathematician, and
gambler. This book
contained techniques
on how to cheat and
how to catch others at
cheating.
43. Odds Odds are used in gambling games to make them
fair. For example, if you rolled a die and won every time
you rolled a 6, then you would win on average once
every 6 times. So that the game is fair, the odds of 5 to 1
are given. This means that if you bet $1 and won, you
could win $5. On average, you would win $5 once in
6 rolls and lose $1 on the other 5 rolls‚Äîhence the term
fair game.
In most gambling games, the odds given are not fair.
For example, if the odds of winning are really 20 to 1,
the house might offer 15 to 1 in order to make a proÔ¨Åt.
Odds can be expressed as a fraction or as a ratio,
such as , 5:1, or 5 to 1. Odds are computed in favor
of the event or against the event. The formulas for
odds are

Example 4‚Äì16
Drawing a Card
Determine which events are mutually exclusive and which are not when a single card is
drawn from a deck.
a. Getting a 7 and getting a jack
b. Getting a club and getting a king
c. Getting a face card and getting an ace
d. Getting a face card and getting a spade
Solution
Only the events in parts a and c are mutually exclusive.
The probability of two or more events can be determined by the addition rules. The
Ô¨Årst addition rule is used when the events are mutually exclusive.
Addition Rule 1
When two events A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability that A or B will occur is
P(A or B)  P(A)  P(B)
Example 4‚Äì17
Coffee Shop Selection
A city has 9 coffee shops: 3 Starbuck‚Äôs, 2 Caribou Coffees, and 4 Crazy Mocho Coffees.
If a person selects one shop at random to buy a cup of coffee, Ô¨Ånd the probability that it
is either a Starbuck‚Äôs or Crazy Mocho Coffees.
Example 4‚Äì15
Rolling a Die
Determine which events are mutually exclusive and which are not, when a single die is
rolled.
a. Getting an odd number and getting an even number
b. Getting a 3 and getting an odd number
c. Getting an odd number and getting a number less than 4
d. Getting a number greater than 4 and getting a number less than 4
Solution
a. The events are mutually exclusive, since the Ô¨Årst event can be 1, 3, or 5 and the
second event can be 2, 4, or 6.
b. The events are not mutually exclusive, since the Ô¨Årst event is a 3 and the second
can be 1, 3, or 5. Hence, 3 is contained in both events.
c. The events are not mutually exclusive, since the Ô¨Årst event can be 1, 3, or 5 and
the second can be 1, 2, or 3. Hence, 1 and 3 are contained in both events.
d. The events are mutually exclusive, since the Ô¨Årst event can be 5 or 6 and the
second event can be 1, 2, or 3.

Selecting a Day of the Week
A day of the week is selected at random. Find the probability that it is a weekend day.
Solution
P(Saturday or Sunday)  P(Saturday)  P(Sunday) 
When two events are not mutually exclusive, we must subtract one of the two prob-
abilities of the outcomes that are common to both events, since they have been counted
twice. This technique is illustrated in Example 4‚Äì20.

Example 4‚Äì20
Drawing a Card
A single card is drawn at random from an ordinary deck of cards. Find the probability
that it is either an ace or a black card.
Solution
Since there are 4 aces and 26 black cards (13 spades and 13 clubs), 2 of the aces are
black cards, namely, the ace of spades and the ace of clubs. Hence the probabilities of
the two outcomes must be subtracted since they have been counted twice.
P(ace or black card)  P(ace)  P(black card)  P(black aces)  4
52  26
52  2

Solution
Since there are 3 Starbuck‚Äôs and 4 Crazy Mochos, and a total of 9 coffee shops,
P(Starbuck‚Äôs or Crazy Mocho)  P(Starbuck‚Äôs)  P(Crazy Mocho) 


The events are mutually exclusive.

Example 4‚Äì22
Driving While Intoxicated
On New Year‚Äôs Eve, the probability of a person driving while intoxicated is 0.32, the
probability of a person having a driving accident is 0.09, and the probability of a person
having a driving accident while intoxicated is 0.06. What is the probability of a person
driving while intoxicated or having a driving accident?
Solution
P(intoxicated or accident)  P(intoxicated)  P(accident) 
 P(intoxicated and accident) 
 0.32  0.09  0.06  0.35
In summary, then, when the two events are mutually exclusive, use addition rule 1.
When the events are not mutually exclusive, use addition rule 2.
The probability rules can be extended to three or more events. For three mutually
exclusive events A, B, and C,
P(A or B or C)  P(A)  P(B)  P(C)
Example 4‚Äì21
Selecting a Medical Staff Person
In a hospital unit there are 8 nurses and 5 physicians; 7 nurses and 3 physicians are females.
If a staff person is selected, Ô¨Ånd the probability that the subject is a nurse or a male.

13  10
13
Note: This rule can also be used when the events are mutually exclusive, since 
P(A and B) will always equal 0. However, it is important to make a distinction between
the two situations.
Addition Rule 2
If A and B are not mutually exclusive, then
P(A or B)  P(A)  P(B)  P(A and B)
When events are not mutually exclusive, addition rule 2 can be used to Ô¨Ånd the prob-
ability of the events.
Interesting Fact 
Card ShufÔ¨Çing
How many times does
a deck of cards need
to be shufÔ¨Çed so that
the cards are in
random order?
Actually, this question
is not easy to answer
since there are many
variables. First several
different methods are
used to shufÔ¨Çe a deck
of cards. Some of
the methods are the
rifÔ¨Çe method, the
overhand method,
the Corgi method,
and the Faro method.
Another factor
that needs to be
considered is what is
meant by the cards
being in a random
order. There are several
statistical tests that
can be used to
determine if a deck of
cards is randomized
after several shufÔ¨Çes,
but these tests give
somewhat different
results. 
Two mathematicians,
Persi Diaconis and
Dave Bayer, concluded
that a deck of cards
starts to become
random after 5 good
shufÔ¨Çes and is
completely random
after 7 shufÔ¨Çes.
However, a later study
done by Trefthen
concluded that only 6
shufÔ¨Çes are necessary.
The difference was
based on what is
considered a
randomized deck of
cards.

Venn Diagrams for the
Addition Rules
For three events that are not mutually exclusive,

 P(B and C)  P(A and B and C)
See Exercises 23 and 24 in this section.
Figure 4‚Äì5(a) shows a Venn diagram that represents two mutually exclusive events A
and B. In this case, P(A or B)  P(A)  P(B), since these events are mutually exclusive
and do not overlap. In other words, the probability of occurrence of event A or event B
is the sum of the areas of the two circles.
Figure 4‚Äì5(b) represents the probability of two events that are not mutually exclu-
sive. In this case, P(A or B)  P(A)  P(B)  P(A and B). The area in the intersection
or overlapping part of both circles corresponds to P(A and B); and when the area of cir-
cle A is added to the area of circle B, the overlapping part is counted twice. It must there-
fore be subtracted once to get the correct area or probability.
Note: Venn diagrams were developed by mathematician John Venn (1834‚Äì1923) and
are used in set theory and symbolic logic. They have been adapted to probability theory
also. In set theory, the symbol  represents the union of two sets, and A  B corresponds
to A or B. The symbol  represents the intersection of two sets, and A  B corresponds to
A and B. Venn diagrams show only a general picture of the probability rules and do not por-
tray all situations, such as P(A)  0, accurately.

Multiplication Rule 1
When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is
P(A and B)  P(A)  P(B)
Example 4‚Äì23

The Multiplication Rules and Conditional Probability
Section 4‚Äì2 showed that the addition rules are used to compute probabilities for mutually
exclusive and non-mutually exclusive events. This section introduces the multiplication
rules.
The Multiplication Rules
The multiplication rules can be used to Ô¨Ånd the probability of two or more events that
occur in sequence. For example, if you toss a coin and then roll a die, you can Ô¨Ånd the
probability of getting a head on the coin and a 4 on the die. These two events are said to
be independent since the outcome of the Ô¨Årst event (tossing a coin) does not affect the
probability outcome of the second event (rolling a die).
Two events A and B are independent events if the fact that A occurs does not affect
the probability of B occurring.
Here are other examples of independent events:
Rolling a die and getting a 6, and then rolling a second die and getting a 3.
Drawing a card from a deck and getting a queen, replacing it, and drawing a second
card and getting a queen.
To Ô¨Ånd the probability of two independent events that occur in sequence, you must
Ô¨Ånd the probability of each event occurring separately and then multiply the answers. For
example, if a coin is tossed twice, the probability of getting two heads is

 . This
result can be veriÔ¨Åed by looking at the sample space HH, HT, TH, TT. Then P(HH)  .

Drawing a Card
A card is drawn from a deck and replaced; then a second card is drawn. Find the
probability of getting a queen and then an ace.
Solution
The probability of getting a queen is , and since the card is replaced, the probability of
getting an ace is . Hence, the probability of getting a queen and an ace is
P(queen and ace)  P(queen)  P(ace)  4

Example 4‚Äì25
Selecting a Colored Ball
An urn contains 3 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 white balls. A ball is selected and its
color noted. Then it is replaced. A second ball is selected and its color noted. Find the
probability of each of these.
a. Selecting 2 blue balls
b. Selecting 1 blue ball and then 1 white ball
c. Selecting 1 red ball and then 1 blue ball
Solution
a. P(blue and blue)  P(blue)  P(blue) 
b. P(blue and white)  P(blue)  P(white) 
c. P(red and blue)  P(red)  P(blue) 
Multiplication rule 1 can be extended to three or more independent events by
using the formula
P(A and B and C and . . . and K)  P(A)  P(B)  P(C) . . . P(K)
When a small sample is selected from a large population and the subjects are not
replaced, the probability of the event occurring changes so slightly that for the most part,
it is considered to remain the same. Examples 4‚Äì26 and 4‚Äì27 illustrate this concept.

Survey on Stress
A Harris poll found that 46% of Americans say they suffer great stress at least once a
week. If three people are selected at random, Ô¨Ånd the probability that all three will say
that they suffer great stress at least once a week.
Source: 100% American.
Solution
Let S denote stress. Then
P(S and S and S)  P(S) ‚Ä¢ P(S) ‚Ä¢ P(S)
 (0.46)(0.46)(0.46)  0.097

Example 4‚Äì27
Male Color Blindness
Approximately 9% of men have a type of color blindness that prevents them from
distinguishing between red and green. If 3 men are selected at random, Ô¨Ånd the
probability that all of them will have this type of red-green color blindness.
Source: USA TODAY.
Solution
Let C denote red-green color blindness. Then
P(C and C and C)  P(C) ‚Ä¢ P(C) ‚Ä¢ P(C)
 (0.09)(0.09)(0.09)
 0.000729
Hence, the rounded probability is 0.0007.
In Examples 4‚Äì23 through 4‚Äì27, the events were independent of one another, since
the occurrence of the Ô¨Årst event in no way affected the outcome of the second event. On
the other hand, when the occurrence of the Ô¨Årst event changes the probability of the occur-
rence of the second event, the two events are said to be dependent. For example, suppose
a card is drawn from a deck and not replaced, and then a second card is drawn. What is
the probability of selecting an ace on the Ô¨Årst card and a king on the second card?
Before an answer to the question can be given, you must realize that the events are
dependent. The probability of selecting an ace on the Ô¨Årst draw is
. If that card is not
replaced, the probability of selecting a king on the second card is
, since there are 4 kings
and 51 cards remaining. The outcome of the Ô¨Årst draw has affected the outcome of the
second draw.
Dependent events are formally deÔ¨Åned now.
When the outcome or occurrence of the Ô¨Årst event affects the outcome or occurrence of
the second event in such a way that the probability is changed, the events are said to be
dependent events.
Here are some examples of dependent events:
Drawing a card from a deck, not replacing it, and then drawing a second card.
Selecting a ball from an urn, not replacing it, and then selecting a second ball.
Being a lifeguard and getting a suntan.
Having high grades and getting a scholarship.
Parking in a no-parking zone and getting a parking ticket.
To Ô¨Ånd probabilities when events are dependent, use the multiplication rule with a
modiÔ¨Åcation in notation. For the problem just discussed, the probability of getting an ace
on the Ô¨Årst draw is , and the probability of getting a king on the second draw is . By
the multiplication rule, the probability of both events occurring is
The event of getting a king on the second draw given that an ace was drawn the Ô¨Årst
time is called a conditional probability.
The conditional probability of an event B in relationship to an event A is the prob-
ability that event B occurs after event A has already occurred. The notation for conditional

Multiplication Rule 2
When two events are dependent, the probability of both occurring is
P(A and B)  P(A)  P(BA)
Example 4‚Äì28
University Crime
At a university in western Pennsylvania, there were 5 burglaries reported in 2003, 16 in
2004, and 32 in 2005. If a researcher wishes to select at random two burglaries to
further investigate, Ô¨Ånd the probability that both will have occurred in 2004.
Source: IUP Police Department.
Solution
In this case, the events are dependent since the researcher wishes to investigate two
distinct cases. Hence the Ô¨Årst case is selected and not replaced.

Homeowner‚Äôs and Automobile Insurance
World Wide Insurance Company found that 53% of the residents of a city had
homeowner‚Äôs insurance (H) with the company. Of these clients, 27% also had
automobile insurance (A) with the company. If a resident is selected at random, Ô¨Ånd
the probability that the resident has both homeowner‚Äôs and automobile insurance with
World Wide Insurance Company.
Solution
P(H and A)  P(H)  P(AH)  (0.53)(0.27)  0.1431
This multiplication rule can be extended to three or more events, as shown in
Example 4‚Äì30.
Example 4‚Äì30
Drawing Cards
Three cards are drawn from an ordinary deck and not replaced. Find the probability of
these events.

probability is P(BA). This notation does not mean that B is divided by A; rather, it means
the probability that event B occurs given that event A has already occurred. In the card
example, P(BA) is the probability that the second card is a king given that the Ô¨Årst card
is an ace, and it is equal to 
since the Ô¨Årst card was not replaced.

Selecting Colored Balls
Box 1 contains 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. Box 2 contains 3 blue balls and 1 red ball. A
coin is tossed. If it falls heads up, box 1 is selected and a ball is drawn. If it falls tails up,
box 2 is selected and a ball is drawn. Find the probability of selecting a red ball.
Solution
The Ô¨Årst two branches designate the selection of either box 1 or box 2. Then from box 1,
either a red ball or a blue ball can be selected. Likewise, a red ball or blue ball can be
selected from box 2. Hence a tree diagram of the example is shown in Figure 4‚Äì6.
Next determine the probabilities for each branch. Since a coin is being tossed for
the box selection, each branch has a probability of 
that is, heads for box 1 or tails for
box 2. The probabilities for the second branches are found by using the basic probability
rule. For example, if box 1 is selected and there are 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, the
probability of selecting a red ball is and the probability of selecting a blue ball is 
If box 2 is selected and it contains 3 blue balls and 1 red ball, then the probability of
selecting a red ball is and the probability of selecting a blue ball is 
Next multiply the probability for each outcome, using the rule P(A and B) 
For example, the probability of selecting box 1 and selecting a red ball is
The probability of selecting box 1 and a blue ball is 
The probability
of selecting box 2 and selecting a red ball is 
The probability of selecting box 2
and a blue ball is 
(Note that the sum of these probabilities is 1.)
Finally a red ball can be selected from either box 1 or box 2 so

Tree diagrams can be used when the events are independent or dependent, and they
can also be used for sequences of three or more events.
Conditional Probability
The conditional probability of an event B in relationship to an event A was deÔ¨Åned as the
probability that event B occurs after event A has already occurred.
The conditional probability of an event can be found by dividing both sides of the
equation for multiplication rule 2 by P(A), as shown:

Let

The probability P(F) is the probability of selecting a female:

The Venn diagram for conditional probability is shown in Figure 4‚Äì7. In this case,
which is represented by the area in the intersection or overlapping part of the circles
A and B, divided by the area of circle A. The reasoning here is that if you assume A
has occurred, then A becomes the sample space for the next calculation and is the 
denominator of the probability fraction 
. The numerator P(A and B) represents
the probability of the part of B that is contained in A. Hence, P(A and B) becomes the
numerator of the probability fraction 
. Imposing a condition reduces the
sample space.
Probabilities for ‚ÄúAt Least‚Äù
The multiplication rules can be used with the complementary event rule (Section 4‚Äì1)
to simplify solving probability problems involving ‚Äúat least.‚Äù Examples 4‚Äì35, 4‚Äì36, and

are bow ties. If 4 customers who purchased a tie are randomly selected, Ô¨Ånd the
probability that at least 1 purchased a bow tie.
Solution
Let E  at least 1 bow tie is purchased and 
 no bow ties are purchased. Then
P(E)  0.03
and
P( )  1  0.03  0.97
P(no bow ties are purchased)  (0.97)(0.97)(0.97)(0.97)  0.885; hence,
P(at least one bow tie is purchased)  1  0.885  0.115.

Drawing Cards
A game is played by drawing 4 cards from an ordinary deck and replacing each card
after it is drawn. Find the probability that at least 1 ace is drawn.
Solution
It is much easier to Ô¨Ånd the probability that no aces are drawn (i.e., losing) and then subtract
that value from 1 than to Ô¨Ånd the solution directly, because that would involve Ô¨Ånding the
probability of getting 1 ace, 2 aces, 3 aces, and 4 aces and then adding the results.
Let E  at least 1 ace is drawn and 
 no aces drawn. Then
Hence,
or a hand with at least 1 ace will occur about 27% of the time.

Applying the Concepts 4‚Äì3
Guilty or Innocent?
In July 1964, an elderly woman was mugged in Costa Mesa, California. In the vicinity of the
crime a tall, bearded man sat waiting in a yellow car. Shortly after the crime was committed, a
young, tall woman, wearing her blond hair in a ponytail, was seen running from the scene of the
crime and getting into the car, which sped off. The police broadcast a description of the suspected
muggers. Soon afterward, a couple Ô¨Åtting the description was arrested and convicted of the crime.
Although the evidence in the case was largely circumstantial, the two people arrested were
nonetheless convicted of the crime. The prosecutor based his entire case on basic probability
theory, showing the unlikeness of another couple being in that area while having all the same
characteristics that the elderly woman described. The following probabilities were used.
Characteristic
Assumed probability
Drives yellow car
1 out of 12
Man over 6 feet tall
1 out of 10
Man wearing tennis shoes
1 out of

Man with beard
1 out of 11
Woman with blond hair
1 out of 
3
Woman with hair in a ponytail
1 out of 13
Woman over 6 feet tall
1 out of 100
1. Compute the probability of another couple being in that area with the same characteristics.
2. Would you use the addition or multiplication rule? Why?
3. Are the characteristics independent or dependent?
4. How are the computations affected by the assumption of independence or dependence?
5. Should any court case be based solely on probabilities?
6. Would you convict the couple who was arrested even if there were no eyewitnesses?
7. Comment on why in today‚Äôs justice system no person can be convicted solely on the
results of probabilities.
8. In actuality, aren‚Äôt most court cases based on uncalculated probabilities?

Counting Rules
Many times a person must know the number of all possible outcomes for a sequence of
events. To determine this number, three rules can be used: the fundamental counting rule,
the permutation rule, and the combination rule. These rules are explained here, and they
will be used in Section 4‚Äì5 to Ô¨Ånd probabilities of events.
The Ô¨Årst rule is called the fundamental counting rule.
The Fundamental Counting Rule
Fundamental Counting Rule
In a sequence of n events in which the Ô¨Årst one has k1 possibilities and the second event has k2
and the third has k3, and so forth, the total number of possibilities of the sequence will be
k1  k2  k3    kn

Distribution of Blood Types
There are four blood types, A, B, AB, and O. Blood can also be Rh and Rh. Finally,
a blood donor can be classiÔ¨Åed as either male or female. How many different ways can
a donor have his or her blood labeled?
Example 4‚Äì41
IdentiÔ¨Åcation Cards
The manager of a department store chain wishes to make four-digit identiÔ¨Åcation cards
for her employees. How many different cards can be made if she uses the digits 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, and 6 and repetitions are permitted?

Section 4‚Äì4 Counting Rules
227
4‚Äì47
Solution
Since there are 4 spaces to Ô¨Åll on each card and there are 6 choices for each space, the
total number of cards that can be made is 6  6  6  6  1296.
Now, what if repetitions are not permitted? For Example 4‚Äì41, the Ô¨Årst digit can be
chosen in 6 ways. But the second digit can be chosen in only 5 ways, since there are only
Ô¨Åve digits left, etc. Thus, the solution is
6  5  4  3  360
The same situation occurs when one is drawing balls from an urn or cards from a
deck. If the ball or card is replaced before the next one is selected, then repetitions are
permitted, since the same one can be selected again. But if the selected ball or card is not
replaced, then repetitions are not permitted, since the same ball or card cannot be selected
the second time.
These examples illustrate the fundamental counting rule. In summary: If repetitions
are permitted, then the numbers stay the same going from left to right. If repetitions are
not permitted, then the numbers decrease by 1 for each place left to right.
Two other rules that can be used to determine the total number of possibilities of a
sequence of events are the permutation rule and the combination rule.
Factorial Notation
These rules use factorial notation. The factorial notation uses the exclamation point.
5!  5  4  3  2  1
9!  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
To use the formulas in the permutation and combination rules, a special deÔ¨Ånition of 0!
is needed. 0!  1.
Factorial Formulas
For any counting n
n!  n(n  1)(n  2)    1
0!  1
Permutations
A permutation is an arrangement of n objects in a speciÔ¨Åc order.
Examples 4‚Äì42 and 4‚Äì43 illustrate permutations.
Example 4‚Äì42
Business Location
Suppose a business owner has a choice of 5 locations in which to establish her business.
She decides to rank each location according to certain criteria, such as price of the store
and parking facilities. How many different ways can she rank the 5 locations?
Historical Note
In 1808 Christian
Kramp Ô¨Årst used the
factorial notation.

Chapter 4 Probability and Counting Rules
4‚Äì48
Solution
There are
5!  5  4  3  2  1  120
different possible rankings. The reason is that she has 5 choices for the Ô¨Årst location,
4 choices for the second location, 3 choices for the third location, etc.
In Example 4‚Äì42 all objects were used up. But what happens when not all objects
are used up? The answer to this question is given in Example 4‚Äì43.
Example 4‚Äì43
Business Location
Suppose the business owner in Example 4‚Äì42 wishes to rank only the top 3 of the
5 locations. How many different ways can she rank them?
Solution
Using the fundamental counting rule, she can select any one of the 5 for Ô¨Årst choice,
then any one of the remaining 4 locations for her second choice, and Ô¨Ånally, any one of
the remaining locations for her third choice, as shown.

The solutions in Examples 4‚Äì42 and 4‚Äì43 are permutations.
Permutation Rule
The arrangement of n objects in a speciÔ¨Åc order using r objects at a time is called a
permutation of n objects taking r objects at a time. It is written as nPr, and the formula is
nPr 
n!
n  r!
Objective 
Find the number of
ways that r objects
can be selected from
n objects, using the
permutation rule.

The notation nPr is used for permutations.
Although Examples 4‚Äì42 and 4‚Äì43 were solved by the multiplication rule, they can
now be solved by the permutation rule.
In Example 4‚Äì42, 5 locations were taken and then arranged in order; hence,

Television Ads
The advertising director for a television show has 7 ads to use on the program. If she
selects 1 of them for the opening of the show, 1 for the middle of the show, and 1 for
the ending of the show, how many possible ways can this be accomplished?
Solution
Since order is important, the solution is
Hence, there would be 210 ways to show 3 ads.

School Musical Plays
A school musical director can select 2 musical plays to present next year. One will be
presented in the fall, and one will be presented in the spring. If she has 9 to pick from,
how many different possibilities are there?
Solution
Order is important since one play can be presented in the fall and the other play in the
spring.
There are 72 different possibilities.
Combinations
Suppose a dress designer wishes to select two colors of material to design a new dress,
and she has on hand four colors. How many different possibilities can there be in this
situation?
This type of problem differs from previous ones in that the order of selection is not
important. That is, if the designer selects yellow and red, this selection is the same as the
selection red and yellow. This type of selection is called a combination. The difference
between a permutation and a combination is that in a combination, the order or arrange-
ment of the objects is not important; by contrast, order is important in a permutation.
Example 4‚Äì46 illustrates this difference.
A selection of distinct objects without regard to order is called a combination.

Letters
Given the letters A, B, C, and D, list the permutations and combinations for selecting
two letters.
Solution
The permutations are
AB
BA
CA
DA
AC
BC
CB
DB
AD
BD
CD
DC
In permutations, AB is different from BA. But in combinations, AB is the same as BA
since the order of the objects does not matter in combinations. Therefore, if duplicates are
removed from a list of permutations, what is left is a list of combinations, as shown.
AB
AC
BC
AD
BD
CD
Hence the combinations of A, B, C, and D are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD.
(Alternatively, BA could be listed and AB crossed out, etc.) The combinations have
been listed alphabetically for convenience, but this is not a requirement.
Combinations are used when the order or arrangement is not important, as in the
selecting process. Suppose a committee of 5 students is to be selected from 25 students.
The 5 selected students represent a combination, since it does not matter who is selected
Ô¨Årst, second, etc.

Combination Rule
The number of combinations of r objects selected from n objects is denoted by nCr and is
given by the formula
nCr 
n!

Section 4‚Äì4 Counting Rules

Example 4‚Äì47
Combinations
How many combinations of 4 objects are there, taken 2 at a time?
Solution
Since this is a combination problem, the answer is
This is the same result shown in Example 4‚Äì46.
Notice that the expression for nCr is
which is the formula for permutations with r! in the denominator. In other words,
This r! divides out the duplicates from the number of permutations, as shown in
Example 4‚Äì46. For each two letters, there are two permutations but only one combina-
tion. Hence, dividing the number of permutations by r! eliminates the duplicates. This
result can be veriÔ¨Åed for other values of n and r. Note: nCn  1.

Committee Selection
In a club there are 7 women and 5 men. A committee of 3 women and 2 men is to be
chosen. How many different possibilities are there?
Solution
Here, you must select 3 women from 7 women, which can be done in 7C3, or 35,
ways. Next, 2 men must be selected from 5 men, which can be done in 5C2, or 10,
ways. Finally, by the fundamental counting rule, the total number of different ways is
35  10  350, since you are choosing both men and women. Using the formula gives

Applying the Concepts 4‚Äì4
Garage Door Openers
Garage door openers originally had a series of four on/off switches so that homeowners could
personalize the frequencies that opened their garage doors. If all garage door openers were set
at the same frequency, anyone with a garage door opener could open anyone else‚Äôs garage
door.
1. Use a tree diagram to show how many different positions 4 consecutive on/off switches
could be in.
After garage door openers became more popular, another set of 4 on/off switches was added to
the systems.
2. Find a pattern of how many different positions are possible with the addition of each on/off
switch.
3. How many different positions are possible with 8 consecutive on/off switches?
4. Is it reasonable to assume, if you owned a garage door opener with 8 switches, that
someone could use his or her garage door opener to open your garage door by trying all
the different possible positions?
In 1989 it was reported that the ignition keys for 1988 Dodge Caravans were made from a
single blank that had Ô¨Åve cuts on it. Each cut was made at one out of Ô¨Åve possible levels. In
1988, assume there were 420,000 Dodge Caravans sold in the United States.
5. How many different possible keys can be made from the same key blank?
6. How many different 1988 Dodge Caravans could any one key start?
Look at the ignition key for your car and count the number of cuts on it. Assume that the cuts
are made at one of any of Ô¨Åve possible levels. Most car companies use one key blank for all
their makes and models of cars.
7. Conjecture how many cars your car company sold over recent years, and then Ô¨Ågure out
how many other cars your car key could start. What would you do to decrease the odds of
someone being able to open another vehicle with his or her key?

Probability and Counting Rules
The counting rules can be combined with the probability rules in this chapter to solve
many types of probability problems. By using the fundamental counting rule, the per-
mutation rules, and the combination rule, you can compute the probability of outcomes
of many experiments, such as getting a full house when 5 cards are dealt or selecting a
committee of 3 women and 2 men from a club consisting of 10 women and 10 men.
Objective 
Find the probability of
an event, using the
counting rules.

Defective Transistors
A box contains 24 transistors, 4 of which are defective. If 4 are sold at random, Ô¨Ånd the
following probabilities.
a. Exactly 2 are defective.
c. All are defective.
b. None is defective.
d. At least 1 is defective.
Solution
There are 24C4 ways to sell 4 transistors, so the denominator in each case will be 10,626.
a. Two defective transistors can be selected as 4C2 and two nondefective ones as
20C2. Hence,
b. The number of ways to choose no defectives is 20C4. Hence,
c. The number of ways to choose 4 defectives from 4 is 4C4, or 1. Hence,
d. To Ô¨Ånd the probability of at least 1 defective transistor, Ô¨Ånd the probability that
there are no defective transistors, and then subtract that probability from 1.

A combination lock consists of the 26 letters of the alphabet. If a 3-letter combination is
needed, Ô¨Ånd the probability that the combination will consist of the letters ABC in that
order. The same letter can be used more than once. (Note: A combination lock is really a
permutation lock.)
Solution
Since repetitions are permitted, there are 26  26  26  17,576 different possible
combinations. And since there is only one ABC combination, the probability is
P(ABC)  1263  117,576.

Tennis Tournament
There are 8 married couples in a tennis club. If 1 man and 1 woman are selected at random
to plan the summer tournament, Ô¨Ånd the probability that they are married to each other.
Solution
Since there are 8 ways to select the man and 8 ways to select the woman, there are 8  8,
or 64, ways to select 1 man and 1 woman. Since there are 8 married couples, the
solution is

As indicated at the beginning of this section, the counting rules and the probability
rules can be used to solve a large variety of probability problems found in business, gam-
bling, economics, biology, and other Ô¨Åelds.
Applying the Concepts 4‚Äì5
Counting Rules and Probability
One of the biggest problems for students when doing probability problems is to decide which
formula or formulas to use. Another problem is to decide whether two events are independent
or dependent. Use the following problem to help develop a better understanding of these
concepts.
Assume you are given a 5-question multiple-choice quiz. Each question has 5 possible
answers: A, B, C, D, and E.
1. How many events are there?
2. Are the events independent or dependent?
3. If you guess at each question, what is the probability that you get all of them correct?
4. What is the probability that a person would guess answer A for each question?
Assume that you are given a test in which you are to match the correct answers in the right
column with the questions in the left column. You can use each answer only once.
5. How many events are there?
6. Are the events independent or dependent?
7. What is the probability of getting them all correct if you are guessing?
8. What is the difference between the two problems?

The Mathematics of Gambling
Gambling is big business. There are state lotteries, casinos, sports betting, and church bingos. It seems that today
everybody is either watching or playing Texas Hold
‚ÄôEm Poker.
Using permutations, combinations, and the
probability rules, mathematicians can Ô¨Ånd the
probabilities of various gambling games. Here are
the probabilities of the various 5-card poker hands.

The chance of winning at gambling games can be compared by using what is called the house advantage, house edge,
or house percentage. For example, the house advantage for roulette is about 5.26%, which means in the long run, the
house wins 5.26 cents on every $1 bet; or you will lose, on average, 5.26 cents on every $1 you bet. The lower the house
advantage, the more favorable the game is to you.
For the game of craps, the house advantage is anywhere between 1.4 and 15%, depending on what you bet on. For the
game called keno, the house advantage is 29.5%. The house of advantage for Chuck-a-Luck is 7.87%, and for baccarat, it
is either 1.36 or 1.17% depending on your bet.
Slot machines have a house advantage anywhere from about 4 to 10% depending on the geographic location, such as
Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Mississippi, and the amount put in the machine, such as 5¬¢, 25¬¢, and $1.
Actually, gamblers found winning strategies for the game blackjack or 21 such as card counting. However, the
casinos retaliated by using multiple decks and by banning card counters.

Summary
In this chapter, the basic concepts of probability are explained. 
‚Ä¢ There are three basic types of probability. They are classical probability, empirical
probability, and subjective probability. Classical probability uses samples spaces.
Empirical probability uses frequency distributions, and subjective probability uses
an educated guess to determine the probability of an event. The probability of any
event is a number from 0 to 1. If an event cannot occur, the probability is 0. If an
event is certain, the probability is 1. The sum of the probability of all the events in
the sample space is 1. To Ô¨Ånd the probability of the complement of an event,
subtract the probability of the event from 1. (4‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time; otherwise,
the events are not mutually exclusive. To Ô¨Ånd the probability of two mutually
exclusive events occurring, add the probability of each event. To Ô¨Ånd the probability of
two events when they are not mutually exclusive, add the possibilities of the individual
events and then subtract the probability that both events occur at the same time. These
types of probability problems can be solved by using the addition rules. (4‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ Two events are independent if the occurrence of the Ô¨Årst event does not change the
probability of the second event occurring. Otherwise, the events are dependent. To
Ô¨Ånd the probability of two independent events occurring, multiply the probabilities
of each event. To Ô¨Ånd the probability that two dependent events occur, multiply the
probability that the Ô¨Årst event occurs by the probability that the second event occurs
given that the Ô¨Årst event has already occurred. The complement of an event is found
by selecting the outcomes in the sample space that are not involved in the outcomes
of the event. These types of problems can be solved by using the multiplication
rules and the complementary event rules. (4‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ Finally, when a large number of events can occur, the fundamental counting rule,
the permutation rule, and the combination rule can be used to determine the number
of ways that these events can occur. (4‚Äì4)
‚Ä¢ The counting rules and the probability rules can be used to solve more-complex
probability problems. (4‚Äì5)

Would You Bet Your Life?‚ÄîRevisited
In his book Probabilities in Everyday Life, John D. McGervey states that the chance of being
killed on any given commercial airline Ô¨Çight is almost 1 in 1 million and that the chance of
being killed during a transcontinental auto trip is about 1 in 8000. The corresponding
probabilities are 11,000,000  0.000001 as compared to 18000  0.000125. Since the
second number is 125 times greater than the Ô¨Årst number, you have a much higher risk driving
than Ô¨Çying across the United States.

Critical Thinking Challenges
1. Con Man Game Consider this problem: A con man has
3 coins. One coin has been specially made and has a head
on each side. A second coin has been specially made, and
on each side it has a tail. Finally, a third coin has a head
and a tail on it. All coins are of the same denomination.
The con man places the 3 coins in his pocket, selects one,
and shows you one side. It is heads. He is willing to bet
you even money that it is the two-headed coin. His
reasoning is that it can‚Äôt be the two-tailed coin since a
head is showing; therefore, there is a 50-50 chance of it
being the two-headed coin. Would you take the bet? 
(Hint: See Exercise 1 in Data Projects.)
2. de M√©r√© Dice Game Chevalier de M√©r√© won money
when he bet unsuspecting patrons that in 4 rolls of 1 die,
he could get at least one 6; but he lost money when he
bet that in 24 rolls of 2 dice, he could get at least a
double 6. Using the probability rules, Ô¨Ånd the
probability of each event and explain why he won the
majority of the time on the Ô¨Årst game but lost the
majority of the time when playing the second game.
(Hint: Find the probabilities of losing each game and
subtract from 1.)
3. Classical Birthday Problem How many people do you
think need to be in a room so that 2 people will have the
same birthday (month and day)? You might think it is 366.
This would, of course, guarantee it (excluding leap year),
but how many people would need to be in a room so that
there would be a 90% probability that 2 people would be
born on the same day? What about a 50% probability?
Actually, the number is much smaller than you
may think. For example, if you have 50 people in a room,
the probability that 2 people will have the same birthday
is 97%. If you have 23 people in a room, there is a 50%
probability that 2 people were born on the same day!
The problem can be solved by using the probability
rules. It must be assumed that all birthdays are equally
likely, but this assumption will have little effect on the
answers. The way to Ô¨Ånd the answer is by using the
complementary event rule as P(2 people having the same
birthday)  1  P(all have different birthdays).
For example, suppose there were 3 people in the
room. The probability that each had a different birthday
would be
Hence, the probability that at least 2 of the 3 people will
have the same birthday will be
1  0.992  0.008
Hence, for k people, the formula is
P(at least 2 people have the same birthday) 
Using your calculator, complete the table and verify
that for at least a 50% chance of 2 people having the
same birthday, 23 or more people will be needed.

with 4 children all would be girls? In a family of 5?
5. Politics and Economics Consider the U.S. Senate.
Find out about the composition of any three of the
Senate‚Äôs standing committees. How many different

composition of the Senate and the number of committee
members from each party for each committee?
6. Your Class Research the famous Monty Hall
probability problem. Conduct a simulation of the Monty

did. Did your simulation support the conclusions?
Section 4‚Äì1
Tossing a Coin
1. The sample space is the listing of all possible outcomes
of the coin toss.
2. The possible outcomes are heads or tails.
3. Classical probability says that a fair coin has a 50-50
chance of coming up heads or tails.
4. The law of large numbers says that as you increase the
number of trials, the overall results will approach the
theoretical probability. However, since the coin has no
‚Äúmemory,‚Äù it still has a 50-50 chance of coming up
heads or tails on the next toss. Knowing what has
already happened should not change your opinion on
what will happen on the next toss.
5. The empirical approach to probability is based on
running an experiment and looking at the results. You
cannot do that at this time.
6. Subjective probabilities could be used if you believe the
coin is biased.
7. Answers will vary; however, they should address that a
fair coin has a 50-50 chance of coming up heads or tails
on the next Ô¨Çip.
Section 4‚Äì2
Which Pain Reliever Is Best?
1. There were 192  186  188  566 subjects in the study.
2. The study lasted for 12 weeks.
3. The variables are the type of pain reliever and the side
effects.
4. Both variables are qualitative and nominal.
5. The numbers in the table are exact Ô¨Ågures.
6. The probability that a randomly selected person was
receiving a placebo is 192566  0.3392 (about 34%).
7. The probability that a randomly selected person was
receiving a placebo or drug A is (192  186)566 
378566  0.6678 (about 67%). These are mutually
exclusive events. The complement is that a randomly
selected person was receiving drug B.
8. The probability that a randomly selected person was
receiving a placebo or experienced a neurological
headache is (192  55  72)566  319566 
0.5636 (about 56%).
9. The probability that a randomly selected person was
not receiving a placebo or experienced a sinus headache
is (186  188)566  11566  385566  0.6802 
(about 68%).
Section 4‚Äì3
Guilty or Innocent?
1. The probability of another couple with the same
characteristics being in that area is
assuming the
characteristics are independent of one another.
2. You would use the multiplication rule, since you are
looking for the probability of multiple events happening
together.
3. We do not know if the characteristics are dependent or
independent, but we assumed independence for the
calculation in question 1.
4. The probabilities would change if there were
dependence among two or more events.
5. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that
probabilities can be used to explain how unlikely it is
to have a set of events occur at the same time (in this
case, how unlikely it is to have another couple with
the same characteristics in that area).
6. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that if the
only eyewitness was the woman who was mugged and
the probabilities are accurate, it seems very unlikely
that a couple matching these characteristics would be
in that area at that time. This might cause you to convict
the couple.

7. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that our
probabilities are theoretical and serve a purpose when
appropriate, but that court cases are based on much
more than impersonal chance.
8. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that juries
decide whether to convict a defendant if they Ô¨Ånd
evidence ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù that the person is
guilty. In probability terms, this means that if the
defendant was actually innocent, then the chance of
seeing the events that occurred is so unlikely as to have
occurred by chance. Therefore, the jury concludes that
the defendant is guilty.

Is Pooling Worthwhile?
Blood samples are used to screen people for certain diseases. When the disease is rare,
health care workers sometimes combine or pool the blood samples of a group of
individuals into one batch and then test it. If the test result of the batch is negative, no
further testing is needed since none of the individuals in the group has the disease.
However, if the test result of the batch is positive, each individual in the group must be
tested.
Consider this hypothetical example: Suppose the probability of a person having the
disease is 0.05, and a pooled sample of 15 individuals is tested. What is the probability
that no further testing will be needed for the individuals in the sample? The answer to
this question can be found by using what is called the binomial distribution. See
Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of the chapter.
This chapter explains probability distributions in general and a speciÔ¨Åc, often used
distribution called the binomial distribution. The Poisson, hypergeometric, and multino-
mial distributions are also explained.

Introduction
Many decisions in business, insurance, and other real-life situations are made by assign-
ing probabilities to all possible outcomes pertaining to the situation and then evaluating
the results. For example, a saleswoman can compute the probability that she will make
0, 1, 2, or 3 or more sales in a single day. An insurance company might be able to assign
probabilities to the number of vehicles a family owns. A self-employed speaker might be
able to compute the probabilities for giving 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 or more speeches each week.
Once these probabilities are assigned, statistics such as the mean, variance, and standard
deviation can be computed for these events. With these statistics, various decisions can
be made. The saleswoman will be able to compute the average number of sales she makes
per week, and if she is working on commission, she will be able to approximate her
weekly income over a period of time, say, monthly. The public speaker will be able to

plan ahead and approximate his average income and expenses. The insurance company
can use its information to design special computer forms and programs to accommodate
its customers‚Äô future needs.
This chapter explains the concepts and applications of what is called a probability
distribution. In addition, special probability distributions, such as the binomial,
multinomial, Poisson, and hypergeometric distributions, are explained.

Probability Distributions
Before probability distribution is deÔ¨Åned formally, the deÔ¨Ånition of a variable is
reviewed. In Chapter 1, a variable was deÔ¨Åned as a characteristic or attribute that can
assume different values. Various letters of the alphabet, such as X, Y, or Z, are used to
represent variables. Since the variables in this chapter are associated with probability,
they are called random variables.
For example, if a die is rolled, a letter such as X can be used to represent the
outcomes. Then the value that X can assume is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, corresponding to the
outcomes of rolling a single die. If two coins are tossed, a letter, say Y, can be used to
represent the number of heads, in this case 0, 1, or 2. As another example, if the temper-
ature at 8:00 A.M. is 43 and at noon it is 53, then the values T that the temperature
assumes are said to be random, since they are due to various atmospheric conditions at
the time the temperature was taken.
A random variable is a variable whose values are determined by chance.
Also recall from Chapter 1 that you can classify variables as discrete or continuous
by observing the values the variable can assume. If a variable can assume only a speciÔ¨Åc
number of values, such as the outcomes for the roll of a die or the outcomes for the toss
of a coin, then the variable is called a discrete variable.
Discrete variables have a Ô¨Ånite number of possible values or an inÔ¨Ånite number of
values that can be counted. The word counted means that they can be enumerated using
the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. For example, the number of joggers in Riverview Park each day
and the number of phone calls received after a TV commercial airs are examples of dis-
crete variables, since they can be counted.
Variables that can assume all values in the interval between any two given values
are called continuous variables. For example, if the temperature goes from 62 to 78 in
a 24-hour period, it has passed through every possible number from 62 to 78. Continuous
random variables are obtained from data that can be measured rather than counted.
Continuous random variables can assume an inÔ¨Ånite number of values and can be deci-
mal and fractional values. On a continuous scale, a person‚Äôs weight might be exactly
183.426 pounds if a scale could measure weight to the thousandths place; however, on a
digital scale that measures only to tenths of pounds, the weight would be 183.4 pounds.
Examples of continuous variables are heights, weights, temperatures, and time. In this
chapter only discrete random variables are used; Chapter 6 explains continuous random
variables.
The procedure shown here for constructing a probability distribution for a discrete
random variable uses the probability experiment of tossing three coins. Recall that when
three coins are tossed, the sample space is represented as TTT, TTH, THT, HTT, HHT,
HTH, THH, HHH; and if X is the random variable for the number of heads, then X
assumes the value 0, 1, 2, or 3.

254

Probabilities for the values of X can be determined as follows:
No heads
One head
Two heads
Three heads
TTT
TTH
THT
HTT
HHT
HTH
THH
HHH
Hence, the probability of getting no heads is , one head is , two heads is , and three
heads is . From these values, a probability distribution can be constructed by listing the
outcomes and assigning the probability of each outcome, as shown here.

Probability P(X)
A discrete probability distribution consists of the values a random variable can
assume and the corresponding probabilities of the values. The probabilities are
determined theoretically or by observation.
Discrete probability distributions can be shown by using a graph or a table. Probability
distributions can also be represented by a formula. See Exercises 31‚Äì36 at the end of this
section for examples.

did not need to actually perform the experiments to compute the probabilities. In contrast,
to construct actual probability distributions, you must observe the variable over a period

Speaking of 
Statistics
Coins, Births, and Other Random (?)
Events
Examples of random events such as
tossing coins are used in almost all books
on probability. But is Ô¨Çipping a coin really
a random event?
Tossing coins dates back to ancient
Roman times when the coins usually
consisted of the Emperor‚Äôs head on one
side (i.e., heads) and another icon such as
a ship on the other side (i.e., ships).
Tossing coins was used in both fortune
telling and ancient Roman games.
A Chinese form of divination called
the I-Ching (pronounced E-Ching) is
thought to be at least 4000 years old. It consists of 64 hexagrams made up of six horizontal lines. Each line is either
broken or unbroken, representing the yin and the yang. These 64 hexagrams are supposed to represent all possible
situations in life. To consult the I-Ching, a question is asked and then three coins are tossed six times. The way the coins
fall, either heads up or heads down, determines whether the line is broken (yin) or unbroken (yang). Once the hexagon is
determined, its meaning is consulted and interpreted to get the answer to the question. (Note: Another method used to
determine the hexagon employs yarrow sticks.)
In the 16th century, a mathematician named Abraham DeMoivre used the outcomes of tossing coins to study what
later became known as the normal distribution; however, his work at that time was not widely known.
Mathematicians usually consider the outcomes of a coin toss a random event. That is, each probability of getting a
head is , and the probability of getting a tail is . Also, it is not possible to predict with 100% certainty which outcome
will occur. But new studies question this theory. During World War II a South African mathematician named John
Kerrich tossed a coin 10,000 times while he was interned in a German prison camp. Unfortunately, the results of his
experiment were never recorded, so we don‚Äôt know the number of heads that occurred.
Several studies have shown that when a coin-tossing device is used, the probability that a coin will land on the same
side on which it is placed on the coin-tossing device is about 51%. It would take about 10,000 tosses to become aware
of this bias. Furthermore, researchers showed that when a coin is spun on its edge, the coin falls tails up about 80% of the
time since there is more metal on the heads side of a coin. This makes the coin slightly heavier on the heads side than on
the tails side.
Another assumption commonly made in probability theory is that the number of male births is equal to the number
of female births and that the probability of a boy being born is and the probability of a girl being born is . We know
this is not exactly true.
In the later 1700s, a French mathematician named Pierre Simon Laplace attempted to prove that more males than
females are born. He used records from 1745 to 1770 in Paris and showed that the percentage of females born was
about 49%. Although these percentages vary somewhat from location to location, further surveys show they are generally
true worldwide. Even though there are discrepancies, we generally consider the outcomes to be 50-50 since these
discrepancies are relatively small.
Based on this article, would you consider the coin toss at the beginning of a football game fair?

The Ô¨Årst requirement states that the sum of the probabilities of all the events must be
equal to 1. This sum cannot be less than 1 or greater than 1 since the sample space includes
all possible outcomes of the probability experiment. The second requirement states that
the probability of any individual event must be a value from 0 to 1. The reason (as stated
in Chapter 4) is that the range of the probability of any individual value can be 0, 1, or any
value between 0 and 1. A probability cannot be a negative number or greater than 1.

Two Requirements for a Probability Distribution
1. The sum of the probabilities of all the events in the sample space must equal 1; that is,
P(X)  1.
2. The probability of each event in the sample space must be between or equal to 0 and 1.
That is, 0  P(X)  1.

Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Expectation
The mean, variance, and standard deviation for a probability distribution are computed
differently from the mean, variance, and standard deviation for samples. This section
explains how these measures‚Äîas well as a new measure called the expectation‚Äîare
calculated for probability distributions.
Mean
In Chapter 3, the mean for a sample or population was computed by adding the values
and dividing by the total number of values, as shown in these formulas:
But how would you compute the mean of the number of spots that show on top when a
die is rolled? You could try rolling the die, say, 10 times, recording the number of spots,
and Ô¨Ånding the mean; however, this answer would only approximate the true mean. What
about 50 rolls or 100 rolls?Actually, the more times the die is rolled, the better the approx-
imation. You might ask, then, How many times must the die be rolled to get the exact
answer? It must be rolled an inÔ¨Ånite number of times. Since this task is impossible, the
previous formulas cannot be used because the denominators would be inÔ¨Ånity. Hence, a
new method of computing the mean is necessary. This method gives the exact theoretical
value of the mean as if it were possible to roll the die an inÔ¨Ånite number of times.
Before the formula is stated, an example will be used to explain the concept. Suppose
two coins are tossed repeatedly, and the number of heads that occurred is recorded. What
will be the mean of the number of heads? The sample space is

Historical Note

Louis Cauchy
(1789‚Äì1857), wrote a
book on probability.
While he was teaching
at the Military School
of Paris, one of his
students was
Napoleon Bonaparte.

and each outcome has a probability of . Now, in the long run, you would expect two
heads (HH) to occur approximately of the time, one head to occur approximately of
the time (HT or TH), and no heads (TT) to occur approximately of the time. Hence, on
average, you would expect the number of heads to be
 2 
 1 
 0  1
That is, if it were possible to toss the coins many times or an inÔ¨Ånite number of times,
the average of the number of heads would be 1.
Hence, to Ô¨Ånd the mean for a probability distribution, you must multiply each possi-
ble outcome by its corresponding probability and Ô¨Ånd the sum of the products.

Formula for the Mean of a Probability Distribution
The mean of a random variable with a discrete probability distribution is
m  X1  P(X1)  X2  P(X2)  X3  P(X3)      Xn  P(Xn)
 X  P(X)
where X1, X2, X3, . . . , Xn are the outcomes and P(X1), P(X2), P(X3), . . . , P(Xn) are the
corresponding probabilities.
Note: X  P(X) means to sum the products.
Rounding Rule for the Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation for a
Probability Distribution The rounding rule for the mean, variance, and standard
deviation for variables of a probability distribution is this: The mean, variance, and stan-
dard deviation should be rounded to one more decimal place than the outcome X. When
fractions are used, they should be reduced to lowest terms.
Examples 5‚Äì5 through 5‚Äì8 illustrate the use of the formula.
Example 5‚Äì5
Rolling a Die
Find the mean of the number of spots that appear when a die is tossed.
Solution
In the toss of a die, the mean can be computed thus.

 2 
 3 
 4 
 5 
 6 

 3 or 3.5
That is, when a die is tossed many times, the theoretical mean will be 3.5. Note that
even though the die cannot show a 3.5, the theoretical average is 3.5.
The reason why this formula gives the theoretical mean is that in the long run, each
outcome would occur approximately of the time. Hence, multiplying the outcome by
its corresponding probability and Ô¨Ånding the sum would yield the theoretical mean. In
other words, outcome 1 would occur approximately of the time, outcome 2 would
occur approximately of the time, etc.

Hence, the mean of the number of trips lasting Ô¨Åve nights or more per year taken by
American adults is 1.2.

Variance and Standard Deviation
For a probability distribution, the mean of the random variable describes the measure of
the so-called long-run or theoretical average, but it does not tell anything about the spread
of the distribution. Recall from Chapter 3 that to measure this spread or variability, statis-
ticians use the variance and standard deviation. These formulas were used:
or
These formulas cannot be used for a random variable of a probability distribution since
N is inÔ¨Ånite, so the variance and standard deviation must be computed differently.
To Ô¨Ånd the variance for the random variable of a probability distribution, subtract the
theoretical mean of the random variable from each outcome and square the difference.
Then multiply each difference by its corresponding probability and add the products. The
formula is
s2  [(X  m)2  P(X)]
Finding the variance by using this formula is somewhat tedious. So for simpliÔ¨Åed
computations, a shortcut formula can be used. This formula is algebraically equivalent to
the longer one and is used in the examples that follow.

On Hold for Talk Radio
A talk radio station has four telephone lines. If the host is unable to talk (i.e., during a
commercial) or is talking to a person, the other callers are placed on hold. When all
lines are in use, others who are trying to call in get a busy signal. The probability that 0,

No. The mean number of people calling at any one time is 1.6. Since the standard

because m  2s would be 1.6  2(1.1)  1.6  2.2  3.8. Very few callers would get a
busy signal since at least 75% of the callers would either get through or be put on hold.
(See Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem in Section 3‚Äì2.)
Expectation
Another concept related to the mean for a probability distribution is that of expected
value or expectation. Expected value is used in various types of games of chance, in
insurance, and in other areas, such as decision theory.
The expected value of a discrete random variable of a probability distribution is the
theoretical average of the variable. The formula is
m  E(X )  X  P(X)
The symbol E(X ) is used for the expected value.
The formula for the expected value is the same as the formula for the theoretical
mean. The expected value, then, is the theoretical mean of the probability distribution.
That is, E(X)  m.
When expected value problems involve money, it is customary to round the answer
to the nearest cent.

Example 5‚Äì12
Winning Tickets
One thousand tickets are sold at $1 each for a color television valued at $350. What is
the expected value of the gain if you purchase one ticket?
Solution
The problem can be set up as follows:
Win
Lose
Gain X
$349
$1
Probability P(X)
999
1000
1
1000

Two things should be noted. First, for a win, the net gain is $349, since you do not
get the cost of the ticket ($1) back. Second, for a loss, the gain is represented by a
negative number, in this case $1. The solution, then, is
E(X)  $349 
 ($1) 
 $0.65
Expected value problems of this type can also be solved by Ô¨Ånding the overall gain
(i.e., the value of the prize won or the amount of money won, not considering the cost
of the ticket for the prize or the cost to play the game) and subtracting the cost of the
tickets or the cost to play the game, as shown:
E(X)  $350 
 $1  $0.65
Here, the overall gain ($350) must be used.
Note that the expectation is $0.65. This does not mean that you lose $0.65, since
you can only win a television set valued at $350 or lose $1 on the ticket. What this expec-
tation means is that the average of the losses is $0.65 for each of the 1000 ticket holders.
Here is another way of looking at this situation: If you purchased one ticket each week
over a long time, the average loss would be $0.65 per ticket, since theoretically, on
average, you would win the set once for each 1000 tickets purchased.

Solution
Since there are 3 sides with 6 spots, the probability of getting a 6 is

Bond Investment
A Ô¨Ånancial adviser suggests that his client select one of two types of bonds in which to
invest $5000. Bond X pays a return of 4% and has a default rate of 2%. Bond Y has a 
return and a default rate of 1%. Find the expected rate of return and decide which
bond would be a better investment. When the bond defaults, the investor loses all the
investment.
21
2%

Solution
The return on bond X is 
. The expected return then is
The return on bond Y is 
. The expected return then is
Hence, bond X would be a better investment since the expected return is higher.
In gambling games, if the expected value of the game is zero, the game is said to be
fair. If the expected value of a game is positive, then the game is in favor of the player.
That is, the player has a better than even chance of winning. If the expected value of the
game is negative, then the game is said to be in favor of the house. That is, in the long run,
the players will lose money.
In his book Probabilities in Everyday Life (Ivy Books, 1986), author John D.
McGervy gives the expectations for various casino games. For keno, the house wins
$0.27 on every $1.00 bet. For Chuck-a-Luck, the house wins about $0.52 on every $1.00
bet. For roulette, the house wins about $0.90 on every $1.00 bet. For craps, the house
wins about $0.88 on every $1.00 bet. The bottom line here is that if you gamble long
enough, sooner or later you will end up losing money.
Applying the Concepts 5‚Äì2
Expected Value
On March 28, 1979, the nuclear generating facility at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, began
discharging radiation into the atmosphere. People exposed to even low levels of radiation can
experience health problems ranging from very mild to severe, even causing death. A local
newspaper reported that 11 babies were born with kidney problems in the three-county area
surrounding the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. The expected value for that problem in
infants in that area was 3. Answer the following questions.
1. What does expected value mean?
2. Would you expect the exact value of 3 all the time?
3. If a news reporter stated that the number of cases of kidney problems in newborns was
nearly four times as much as was usually expected, do you think pregnant mothers living
in that area would be overly concerned?
4. Is it unlikely that 11 occurred by chance?
5. Are there any other statistics that could better inform the public?
6. Assume that 3 out of 2500 babies were born with kidney problems in that three-county
area the year before the accident. Also assume that 11 out of 2500 babies were born with
kidney problems in that three-county area the year after the accident. What is the real
percent of increase in that abnormality?
7. Do you think that pregnant mothers living in that area should be overly concerned after
looking at the results in terms of rates?

THE GAMBLER‚ÄôS FALLACY
WHY WE EXPECT TO STRIKE IT RICH AFTER A LOSING STREAK
A GAMBLER USUALLY WAGERS 
more after taking a loss, in the misguided 
belief that a run of bad luck increases the 
probability of a win. We tend to cling to 
the misconception that past events can 
skew future odds. ‚ÄúOn some level, you‚Äôre 
thinking, ‚ÄòIf I just lost, it‚Äôs going to even 
out.‚Äô The extent to which you‚Äôre disturbed 
by a loss seems to go along with risky 
behavior,‚Äù says University of Michigan 
psychologist William Gehring, Ph.D., co-
author of a new study linking dicey 
decision-making to neurological activity 
originating in the medial frontal cortex, 
long thought to be an area of the brain 
used in error detection.
Because people are so driven to up the 
ante after a loss, Gehring believes that the 
medial frontal cortex unconsciously 
influences future decisions based on the 
impact of the loss, in addition to 
registering the loss itself.
Gehring drew this conclusion by asking 
12 subjects fitted with electrode caps to 
choose either the number 5 or 25, with the 
larger number representing the riskier bet. 
On any given round, both numbers could 
amount to a loss, both could amount to a 
gain or the results could split, one number 
signifying a loss, the other a gain.
The medial frontal cortex responded to 
the outcome of a gamble within a quarter 
of a second, registering sharp electrical 
impulses only after a loss. Gehring points 
out that if the medial frontal cortex 
simply detected errors it would have 
reacted after participants chose the lesser 
of two possible gains. In other words, 
choosing ‚Äú5‚Äù during a round in which 
both numbers paid off and betting on 
‚Äú25‚Äù would have yielded a larger profit.
After the study appeared in Science, 
Gehring received several e-mails from 
stock traders likening the ‚Äúgambler‚Äôs 
fallacy‚Äù to impulsive trading decisions 
made directly after off-loading a losing 
security. Researchers speculate that such 
risky, split-second decision-making could 
extend to fighter pilots, firemen and 
policemen‚Äîprofessions in which rapid- 
fire decisions are crucial and frequent.

The Binomial Distribution
Many types of probability problems have only two outcomes or can be reduced to two
outcomes. For example, when a coin is tossed, it can land heads or tails. When a baby is
born, it will be either male or female. In a basketball game, a team either wins or loses.
A true/false item can be answered in only two ways, true or false. Other situations can be

reduced to two outcomes. For example, a medical treatment can be classiÔ¨Åed as effective
or ineffective, depending on the results. A person can be classiÔ¨Åed as having normal or
abnormal blood pressure, depending on the measure of the blood pressure gauge. A
multiple-choice question, even though there are four or Ô¨Åve answer choices, can be clas-
siÔ¨Åed as correct or incorrect. Situations like these are called binomial experiments.
A binomial experiment is a probability experiment that satisÔ¨Åes the following four
requirements:
1. There must be a Ô¨Åxed number of trials.
2. Each trial can have only two outcomes or outcomes that can be reduced to two
outcomes. These outcomes can be considered as either success or failure.
3. The outcomes of each trial must be independent of one another.
4. The probability of a success must remain the same for each trial.
A binomial experiment and its results give rise to a special probability distribution
called the binomial distribution.
The outcomes of a binomial experiment and the corresponding probabilities of these
outcomes are called a binomial distribution.
In binomial experiments, the outcomes are usually classiÔ¨Åed as successes or failures.
For example, the correct answer to a multiple-choice item can be classiÔ¨Åed as a success,
but any of the other choices would be incorrect and hence classiÔ¨Åed as a failure. The
notation that is commonly used for binomial experiments and the binomial distribution
is deÔ¨Åned now.

In 1653, Blaise Pascal

Pascal‚Äôs triangle that
can be used in the
binomial distribution.

Note that 0  X  n and X  0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n.
Binomial Probability Formula
In a binomial experiment, the probability of exactly X successes in n trials is

The probability of a success in a binomial experiment can be computed with this
formula.
An explanation of why the formula works is given following Example 5‚Äì15.

Chapter 5 Discrete Probability Distributions

Example 5‚Äì15
Tossing Coins
A coin is tossed 3 times. Find the probability of getting exactly two heads.
Solution
This problem can be solved by looking at the sample space. There are three ways to get
two heads.
HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT
The answer is , or 0.375.
Looking at the problem in Example 5‚Äì15 from the standpoint of a binomial experi-
ment, one can show that it meets the four requirements.
1. There are a Ô¨Åxed number of trials (three).
2. There are only two outcomes for each trial, heads or tails.
3. The outcomes are independent of one another (the outcome of one toss in no way
affects the outcome of another toss).
4. The probability of a success (heads) is in each case.
In this case, n  3, X  2, p  , and q  . Hence, substituting in the formula gives
P(2 heads) 
which is the same answer obtained by using the sample space.
The same example can be used to explain the formula. First, note that there are three
ways to get exactly two heads and one tail from a possible eight ways. They are HHT,
HTH, and THH. In this case, then, the number of ways of obtaining two heads from three
coin tosses is 3C2, or 3, as shown in Chapter 4. In general, the number of ways to get X
successes from n trials without regard to order is
This is the Ô¨Årst part of the binomial formula. (Some calculators can be used for this.)
Next, each success has a probability of and can occur twice. Likewise, each failure
has a probability of and can occur once, giving the ( )2( )1 part of the formula. To gen-
eralize, then, each success has a probability of p and can occur X times, and each failure
has a probability of q and can occur n  X times. Putting it all together yields the bino-
mial probability formula.

Survey on Employment
A survey from Teenage Research Unlimited (Northbrook, Illinois) found that 30% of
teenage consumers receive their spending money from part-time jobs. If 5 teenagers
are selected at random, Ô¨Ånd the probability that at least 3 of them will have part-time jobs.
Solution
To Ô¨Ånd the probability that at least 3 have part-time jobs, it is necessary to Ô¨Ånd the
individual probabilities for 3, or 4, or 5 and then add them to get the total probability.
Hence,
P(at least three teenagers have part-time jobs)
 0.132  0.028  0.002  0.162
Computing probabilities by using the binomial probability formula can be quite
tedious at times, so tables have been developed for selected values of n and p. Table B in
Appendix C gives the probabilities for individual events. Example 5‚Äì18 shows how to
use Table B to compute probabilities for binomial experiments.

the binomial table.
a. There are exactly 5 people in the sample who are afraid of being alone at night.
b. There are at most 3 people in the sample who are afraid of being alone at night.
c. There are at least 3 people in the sample who are afraid of being alone at night.

Solution
a. n  20, p  0.05, and X  5. From the table, we get 0.002.
b. n  20 and p  0.05. ‚ÄúAt most 3 people‚Äù means 0, or 1, or 2, or 3.

Driving While Intoxicated
A report from the Secretary of Health and Human Services stated that 70% of single-
vehicle trafÔ¨Åc fatalities that occur at night on weekends involve an intoxicated driver.
If a sample of 15 single-vehicle trafÔ¨Åc fatalities that occur at night on a weekend is
selected, Ô¨Ånd the probability that exactly 12 involve a driver who is intoxicated.
Source: 100% American by Daniel Evan Weiss.
Solution
Now, n  15, p  0.70, and X  12. From Table B, P(12)  0.170. Hence, the
probability is 0.17.
Remember that in the use of the binomial distribution, the outcomes must be inde-
pendent. For example, in the selection of components from a batch to be tested, each
component must be replaced before the next one is selected. Otherwise, the outcomes are
not independent. However, a dilemma arises because there is a chance that the same
component could be selected again. This situation can be avoided by not replacing
the component and using a distribution called the hypergeometric distribution to calculate
the probabilities. The hypergeometric distribution is presented later in this chapter. Note
that when the population is large and the sample is small, the binomial probabilities can
be shown to be nearly the same as the corresponding hypergeometric probabilities.
Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation for the Binomial Distribution
The mean, variance, and standard deviation of a variable that has the binomial distribution can

Likelihood of Twins
The Statistical Bulletin published by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. reported that 2% 
of all American births result in twins. If a random sample of 8000 births is taken, Ô¨Ånd the
mean, variance, and standard deviation of the number of births that would result in twins.
Source: 100% American by Daniel Evan Weiss.
Solution
This is a binomial situation, since a birth can result in either twins or not twins (i.e., two
outcomes).
m  n  p  (8000)(0.02)  160
s2  n  p  q  (8000)(0.02)(0.98)  156.8

For the sample, the average number of births that would result in twins is 160, the
variance is 156.8, or 157, and the standard deviation is 12.5, or 13 if rounded.

Unsanitary Restaurants
Health ofÔ¨Åcials routinely check sanitary conditions of restaurants. Assume you visit a popular
tourist spot and read in the newspaper that in 3 out of every 7 restaurants checked, there were
unsatisfactory health conditions found. Assuming you are planning to eat out 10 times while
you are there on vacation, answer the following questions.
1. How likely is it that you will eat at three restaurants with unsanitary conditions?
2. How likely is it that you will eat at four or Ô¨Åve restaurants with unsanitary conditions?
3. Explain how you would compute the probability of eating in at least one restaurant with
unsanitary conditions. Could you use the complement to solve this problem?
4. What is the most likely number to occur in this experiment?
5. How variable will the data be around the most likely number?
6. How do you know that this is a binomial distribution?
7. If it is a binomial distribution, does that mean that the likelihood of a success is always
50% since there are only two possible outcomes?

Other Types of Distributions (Optional)
In addition to the binomial distribution, other types of distributions are used in statistics.
Three of the most commonly used distributions are the multinomial distribution, the
Poisson distribution, and the hypergeometric distribution. They are described next.
The Multinomial Distribution
Recall that in order for an experiment to be binomial, two outcomes are required for each
trial. But if each trial in an experiment has more than two outcomes, a distribution called
the multinomial distribution must be used. For example, a survey might require the
responses of ‚Äúapprove,‚Äù ‚Äúdisapprove,‚Äù or ‚Äúno opinion.‚Äù In another situation, a person
may have a choice of one of Ô¨Åve activities for Friday night, such as a movie, dinner, base-
ball game, play, or party. Since these situations have more than two possible outcomes
for each trial, the binomial distribution cannot be used to compute probabilities.
The multinomial distribution can be used for such situations if the probabilities for
each trial remain constant and the outcomes are independent for a Ô¨Åxed number of trials.
The events must also be mutually exclusive.
Objective
Find probabilities for
outcomes of variables,
using the Poisson,
hypergeometric, and
multinomial
distributions.

Formula for the Multinomial Distribution
If X consists of events E1, E2, E3, . . . , Ek, which have corresponding probabilities p1, p2, p3, . . . ,
pk of occurring, and X1 is the number of times E1 will occur, X2 is the number of times E2 will
occur, X3 is the number of times E3 will occur, etc., then the probability that X will occur is
P(X) 
where X1  X2  X3  . . .  Xk  n and p1  p2  p3  . . .  pk  1.

Example 5‚Äì24
Leisure Activities
In a large city, 50% of the people choose a movie, 30% choose dinner and a play, and
20% choose shopping as a leisure activity. If a sample of 5 people is randomly
selected, Ô¨Ånd the probability that 3 are planning to go to a movie, 1 to a play, and 1
to a shopping mall.

Solution
We know that n  5, X1  3, X2  1, X3  1, p1  0.50, p2  0.30, and p3  0.20.
Substituting in the formula gives
P(X) 
 (0.50)3(0.30)1(0.20)1  0.15
Again, note that the multinomial distribution can be used even though replacement
is not done, provided that the sample is small in comparison with the population.

2, or 3 cups of coffee are 0.3, 0.5, 0.15, and 0.05, respectively. If 8 customers enter
the shop, Ô¨Ånd the probability that 2 will purchase something other than coffee, 4 will
purchase 1 cup of coffee, 1 will purchase 2 cups, and 1 will purchase 3 cups.
Solution
Let n  8, X1  2, X2  4, X3  1, and X4  1. 
Then

Example 5‚Äì26
Selecting Colored Balls
A box contains 4 white balls, 3 red balls, and 3 blue balls. A ball is selected at
random, and its color is written down. It is replaced each time. Find the probability
that if 5 balls are selected, 2 are white, 2 are red, and 1 is blue.
Solution
We know that n  5, X1  2, X2  2, X3  1; p1 
, p2 
, and p3 
; hence,
P(X) 
Thus, the multinomial distribution is similar to the binomial distribution but has
the advantage of allowing you to compute probabilities when there are more than two out-
comes for each trial in the experiment. That is, the multinomial distribution is a general
distribution, and the binomial distribution is a special case of the multinomial distribution.
The Poisson Distribution
A discrete probability distribution that is useful when n is large and p is small and when
the independent variables occur over a period of time is called the Poisson distribution.
In addition to being used for the stated conditions (i.e., n is large, p is small, and the vari-
ables occur over a period of time), the Poisson distribution can be used when a density
of items is distributed over a given area or volume, such as the number of plants grow-
ing per acre or the number of defects in a given length of videotape.

Historical Notes
Simeon D. Poisson
(1781‚Äì1840)
formulated the
distribution that bears
his name. It appears
only once in his
writings and is only
one page long.
Mathematicians paid
little attention to it
until 1907, when a
statistician named
W. S. Gosset found
real applications for it.

Round the answers to four decimal places.

Formula for the Poisson Distribution
The probability of X occurrences in an interval of time, volume, area, etc., for a variable where
l (Greek letter lambda) is the mean number of occurrences per unit (time, volume, area, etc.) is
P(X; l) 
where X  0, 1, 2, . . .
The letter e is a constant approximately equal to 2.7183.

Example 5‚Äì27
Typographical Errors
If there are 200 typographical errors randomly distributed in a 500-page manuscript,
Ô¨Ånd the probability that a given page contains exactly 3 errors.
Solution
First, Ô¨Ånd the mean number l of errors. Since there are 200 errors distributed over 500
pages, each page has an average of
or 0.4 error per page. Since X  3, substituting into the formula yields
Thus, there is less than a 1% chance that any given page will contain exactly 3 errors.
Since the mathematics involved in computing Poisson probabilities is somewhat
complicated, tables have been compiled for these probabilities. Table C in Appendix C
gives P for various values for l and X.
In Example 5‚Äì27, where X is 3 and l is 0.4, the table gives the value 0.0072 for the
probability. See Figure 5‚Äì4.

Example 5‚Äì28
Toll-Free Telephone Calls
A sales Ô¨Årm receives, on average, 3 calls per hour on its toll-free number. For any given
hour, Ô¨Ånd the probability that it will receive the following.
a. At most 3 calls
b. At least 3 calls
c. 5 or more calls

Solution
a. ‚ÄúAt most 3 calls‚Äù means 0, 1, 2, or 3 calls. Hence,
P(0; 3)  P(1; 3)  P(2; 3)  P(3; 3)
 0.0498  0.1494  0.2240  0.2240
 0.6472
b. ‚ÄúAt least 3 calls‚Äù means 3 or more calls. It is easier to Ô¨Ånd the probability of 0, 1,
and 2 calls and then subtract this answer from 1 to get the probability of at least
3 calls.
P(0; 3)  P(1; 3)  P(2; 3)  0.0498  0.1494  0.2240  0.4232
and
1  0.4232  0.5768
c. For the probability of 5 or more calls, it is easier to Ô¨Ånd the probability of getting
0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 calls and subtract this answer from 1. Hence,
P(0; 3)  P(1; 3)  P(2; 3)  P(3; 3)  P(4; 3)
 0.0498  0.1494  0.2240  0.2240  0.1680
 0.8152
and
1  0.8152  0.1848
Thus, for the events described, the part a event is most likely to occur, and the
part c event is least likely to occur.
The Poisson distribution can also be used to approximate the binomial distribution
when the expected value l  n  p is less than 5, as shown in Example 5‚Äì29. (The same
is true when n  q 	 5.)

If approximately 2% of the people in a room of 200 people are left-handed, Ô¨Ånd the
probability that exactly 5 people there are left-handed.
Solution
Since l  n  p, then l  (200)(0.02)  4. Hence,
which is veriÔ¨Åed by the formula 200C5(0.02)5(0.98)195  0.1579. The difference between
the two answers is based on the fact that the Poisson distribution is an approximation
and rounding has been used.
The Hypergeometric Distribution
When sampling is done without replacement, the binomial distribution does not give
exact probabilities, since the trials are not independent. The smaller the size of the pop-
ulation, the less accurate the binomial probabilities will be.
For example, suppose a committee of 4 people is to be selected from 7 women and
5 men. What is the probability that the committee will consist of 3 women and 1 man?
PX; l 
2.7183445
5!
 0.1563

To solve this problem, you must Ô¨Ånd the number of ways a committee of 3 women
and 1 man can be selected from 7 women and 5 men. This answer can be found by using
combinations; it is
7C3  5C1  35  5  175
Next, Ô¨Ånd the total number of ways a committee of 4 people can be selected from 12
people. Again, by the use of combinations, the answer is
12C4  495
Finally, the probability of getting a committee of 3 women and 1 man from 7 women and
5 men is
The results of the problem can be generalized by using a special probability dis-
tribution called the hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution is
a distribution of a variable that has two outcomes when sampling is done without
replacement.
The probabilities for the hypergeometric distribution can be calculated by using the
formula given next.

Formula for the Hypergeometric Distribution
Given a population with only two types of objects (females and males, defective and
nondefective, successes and failures, etc.), such that there are a items of one kind and b items
of another kind and a  b equals the total population, the probability P(X) of selecting
without replacement a sample of size n with X items of type a and n  X items of type b is
PX  aCX  bCnX
abCn
The basis of the formula is that there are aCX ways of selecting the Ô¨Årst type of items,
bCnX ways of selecting the second type of items, and abCn ways of selecting n items
from the entire population.

Assistant Manager Applicants
Ten people apply for a job as assistant manager of a restaurant. Five have completed
college and Ô¨Åve have not. If the manager selects 3 applicants at random, Ô¨Ånd the
probability that all 3 are college graduates.
Solution
Assigning the values to the variables gives
a  5 college graduates

House Insurance
A recent study found that 2 out of every 10 houses in a neighborhood have no
insurance. If 5 houses are selected from 10 houses, Ô¨Ånd the probability that exactly
1 will be uninsured.
Solution
In this example, a  2, b  8, n  5, X  1, and n  X  4.
In many situations where objects are manufactured and shipped to a company,
the company selects a few items and tests them to see whether they are satisfactory or
defective. If a certain percentage is defective, the company then can refuse the whole
shipment. This procedure saves the time and cost of testing every single item. To make
the judgment about whether to accept or reject the whole shipment based on a small
sample of tests, the company must know the probability of getting a speciÔ¨Åc number of
defective items. To calculate the probability, the company uses the hypergeometric
distribution.

Example 5‚Äì32
Defective Compressor Tanks
A lot of 12 compressor tanks is checked to see whether there are any defective tanks.
Three tanks are checked for leaks. If 1 or more of the 3 is defective, the lot is rejected.
Find the probability that the lot will be rejected if there are actually 3 defective tanks in
the lot.
Solution
Since the lot is rejected if at least 1 tank is found to be defective, it is necessary to Ô¨Ånd
the probability that none are defective and subtract this probability from 1.
Here, a  3, b  9, n  3, and X  0; so
Hence,
P(at least 1 defective)  1  P(no defectives)  1  0.38  0.62
There is a 0.62, or 62%, probability that the lot will be rejected when 3 of the 12 tanks
are defective.

Applying the Concepts 5‚Äì4
Rockets and Targets
During the latter days of World War II, the Germans developed Ô¨Çying rocket bombs. These
bombs were used to attack London. Allied military intelligence didn‚Äôt know whether these
bombs were Ô¨Åred at random or had a sophisticated aiming device. To determine the answer,
they used the Poisson distribution.
To assess the accuracy of these bombs, London was divided into 576 square regions. Each
region was square kilometer in area. They then compared the number of actual hits with the
theoretical number of hits by using the Poisson distribution. If the values in both distributions
were close, then they would conclude that the rockets were Ô¨Åred at random. The actual
distribution is as follows:
Hits

Summary
‚Ä¢ A discrete probability distribution consists of the values a random variable can
assume and the corresponding probabilities of these values. There are two
requirements of a probability distribution: the sum of the probabilities of the events
must equal 1, and the probability of any single event must be a number from 0 to 1.
Probability distributions can be graphed. (5‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ The mean, variance, and standard deviation of a probability distribution can be
found. The expected value of a discrete random variable of a probability
distribution can also be found. This is basically a measure of the average. (5‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ A binomial experiment has four requirements. There must be a Ô¨Åxed number of
trials. Each trial can have only two outcomes. The outcomes are independent
of each other, and the probability of a success must remain the same for each trial.
The probabilities of the outcomes can be found by using the binomial formula
or the binomial table. (5‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ In addition to the binomial distribution, there are some other commonly used
probability distributions. They are the multinomial distribution, the Poisson
distribution, and the hypergeometric distribution. (5‚Äì4)

Is Pooling Worthwhile?‚ÄîRevisited
In the case of the pooled sample, the probability that only one test will be needed can be
determined by using the binomial distribution. The question being asked is, In a sample of 15
individuals, what is the probability that no individual will have the disease? Hence, n  15,
p  0.05, and X  0. From Table B in Appendix C, the probability is 0.463, or 46% of the time,
only one test will be needed. For screening purposes, then, pooling samples in this case would
save considerable time, money, and effort as opposed to testing every individual in the population.

is unsanitary is independent of the probability that any
other restaurant is unsanitary. The probability that a
restaurant is unsanitary remains constant at . And we

What Is Normal?
Medical researchers have determined so-called normal intervals for a person‚Äôs blood
pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and the like. For example, the normal range of sys-
tolic blood pressure is 110 to 140. The normal interval for a person‚Äôs triglycerides is from
30 to 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). By measuring these variables, a physician can
determine if a patient‚Äôs vital statistics are within the normal interval or if some type of
treatment is needed to correct a condition and avoid future illnesses. The question then is,
How does one determine the so-called normal intervals? See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited
at the end of the chapter.
In this chapter, you will learn how researchers determine normal intervals for speciÔ¨Åc
medical tests by using a normal distribution. You will see how the same methods are used
to determine the lifetimes of batteries, the strength of ropes, and many other traits.
Introduction
Random variables can be either discrete or continuous. Discrete variables and their dis-
tributions were explained in Chapter 5. Recall that a discrete variable cannot assume all
values between any two given values of the variables. On the other hand, a continuous
variable can assume all values between any two given values of the variables. Examples
of continuous variables are the heights of adult men, body temperatures of rats, and cho-
lesterol levels of adults. Many continuous variables, such as the examples just mentioned,
have distributions that are bell-shaped, and these are called approximately normally dis-
tributed variables. For example, if a researcher selects a random sample of 100 adult
women, measures their heights, and constructs a histogram, the researcher gets a graph
similar to the one shown in Figure 6‚Äì1(a). Now, if the researcher increases the sample size
and decreases the width of the classes, the histograms will look like the ones shown in
Figure 6‚Äì1(b) and (c). Finally, if it were possible to measure exactly the heights of all
adult females in the United States and plot them, the histogram would approach what is
called a normal distribution, shown in Figure 6‚Äì1(d). This distribution is also known as
Historical Note
The name normal
curve was used by
several statisticians,
namely, Francis
Galton, Charles
Sanders, Wilhelm
Lexis, and Karl
Pearson near the end
of the 19th century.

a bell curve or a Gaussian distribution, named for the German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss (1777‚Äì1855), who derived its equation.
No variable Ô¨Åts a normal distribution perfectly, since a normal distribution is a
theoretical distribution. However, a normal distribution can be used to describe many
variables, because the deviations from a normal distribution are very small. This concept
will be explained further in Section 6‚Äì1.
When the data values are evenly distributed about the mean, a distribution is said to
be a symmetric distribution. (A normal distribution is symmetric.) Figure 6‚Äì2(a) shows
a symmetric distribution. When the majority of the data values fall to the left or right of
the mean, the distribution is said to be skewed. When the majority of the data values fall
to the right of the mean, the distribution is said to be a negatively or left-skewed distri-
bution. The mean is to the left of the median, and the mean and the median are to the left
of the mode. See Figure 6‚Äì2(b). When the majority of the data values fall to the left of
the mean, a distribution is said to be a positively or right-skewed distribution. The
mean falls to the right of the median, and both the mean and the median fall to the right
of the mode. See Figure 6‚Äì2(c).

The ‚Äútail‚Äù of the curve indicates the direction of skewness (right is positive, left is
negative). These distributions can be compared with the ones shown in Figure 3‚Äì1 in
Chapter 3. Both types follow the same principles.
This chapter will present the properties of a normal distribution and discuss its
applications. Then a very important fact about a normal distribution called the central
limit theorem will be explained. Finally, the chapter will explain how a normal
distribution curve can be used as an approximation to other distributions, such as the
binomial distribution. Since a binomial distribution is a discrete distribution, a cor-
rection for continuity may be employed when a normal distribution is used for its
approximation.

represent many physical objects, such as a wheel or a gear. Even though it is not possi-
ble to manufacture a wheel that is perfectly round, the equation and the properties of a
circle can be used to study many aspects of the wheel, such as area, velocity, and accel-
eration. In a similar manner, the theoretical curve, called a normal distribution curve,
can be used to study many variables that are not perfectly normally distributed but are
nevertheless approximately normal.
The mathematical equation for a normal distribution is
where
e  2.718 ( means ‚Äúis approximately equal to‚Äù)
p  3.14
m  population mean
s  population standard deviation
This equation may look formidable, but in applied statistics, tables or technology is used
for speciÔ¨Åc problems instead of the equation.
Another important consideration in applied statistics is that the area under a normal
distribution curve is used more often than the values on the y axis. Therefore, when a
normal distribution is pictured, the y axis is sometimes omitted.
Circles can be different sizes, depending on their diameters (or radii), and can be
used to represent wheels of different sizes. Likewise, normal curves have different shapes
and can be used to represent different variables.
The shape and position of a normal distribution curve depend on two parameters, the
mean and the standard deviation. Each normally distributed variable has its own normal
distribution curve, which depends on the values of the variable‚Äôs mean and standard
deviation. Figure 6‚Äì4(a) shows two normal distributions with the same mean values but
different standard deviations. The larger the standard deviation, the more dispersed, or
spread out, the distribution is. Figure 6‚Äì4(b) shows two normal distributions with the
same standard deviation but with different means. These curves have the same shapes but
are located at different positions on the x axis. Figure 6‚Äì4(c) shows two normal distribu-
tions with different means and different standard deviations.

Historical Notes
The discovery of the
equation for a normal
distribution can be
traced to three
mathematicians. In
1733, the French
mathematician
Abraham DeMoivre
derived an equation for
a normal distribution
based on the random
variation of the number
of heads appearing
when a large number
of coins were tossed.
Not realizing any
connection with the
naturally occurring
variables, he showed
this formula to only
a few friends. About
100 years later, two
mathematicians, Pierre
Laplace in France and
Carl Gauss in
Germany, derived the
equation of the normal
curve independently
and without any
knowledge of
DeMoivre‚Äôs work. In
1924, Karl Pearson
found that DeMoivre
had discovered the
formula before Laplace
or Gauss.
The values given in item 8 of the summary follow the empirical rule for data given
in Section 3‚Äì2.
You must know these properties in order to solve problems involving distributions
that are approximately normal.
A normal distribution is a continuous, symmetric, bell-shaped distribution of a 
variable.
The properties of a normal distribution, including those mentioned in the deÔ¨Ånition,
are explained next.
Summary of the Properties of the Theoretical Normal Distribution
1. A normal distribution curve is bell-shaped.
2. The mean, median, and mode are equal and are located at the center of the distribution.
3. A normal distribution curve is unimodal (i.e., it has only one mode).
4. The curve is symmetric about the mean, which is equivalent to saying that its shape is the
same on both sides of a vertical line passing through the center.
5. The curve is continuous; that is, there are no gaps or holes. For each value of X, there is a
corresponding value of Y.
6. The curve never touches the x axis. Theoretically, no matter how far in either direction
the curve extends, it never meets the x axis‚Äîbut it gets increasingly closer.
7. The total area under a normal distribution curve is equal to 1.00, or 100%. This fact
may seem unusual, since the curve never touches the x axis, but one can prove it
mathematically by using calculus. (The proof is beyond the scope of this textbook.)
8. The area under the part of a normal curve that lies within 1 standard deviation of the
mean is approximately 0.68, or 68%; within 2 standard deviations, about 0.95, or 95%;
and within 3 standard deviations, about 0.997, or 99.7%. See Figure 6‚Äì5, which also
shows the area in each region.

The Standard Normal Distribution
Since each normally distributed variable has its own mean and standard deviation, as
stated earlier, the shape and location of these curves will vary. In practical applications,
then, you would have to have a table of areas under the curve for each variable. To sim-
plify this situation, statisticians use what is called the standard normal distribution.
The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1.
The standard normal distribution is shown in Figure 6‚Äì6.
The values under the curve indicate the proportion of area in each section. For exam-
ple, the area between the mean and 1 standard deviation above or below the mean is
about 0.3413, or 34.13%.
The formula for the standard normal distribution is
All normally distributed variables can be transformed into the standard normally dis-
tributed variable by using the formula for the standard score:
This is the same formula used in Section 3‚Äì3. The use of this formula will be explained
in Section 6‚Äì3.
As stated earlier, the area under a normal distribution curve is used to solve practi-
cal application problems, such as Ô¨Ånding the percentage of adult women whose height is
between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 7 inches, or Ô¨Ånding the probability that a new battery
will last longer than 4 years. Hence, the major emphasis of this section will be to show
the procedure for Ô¨Ånding the area under the standard normal distribution curve for any
z value. The applications will be shown in Section 6‚Äì2. Once the X values are trans-
formed by using the preceding formula, they are called z values. The z value or z score
is actually the number of standard deviations that a particular X value is away from the
mean. Table E in Appendix C gives the area (to four decimal places) under the standard
normal curve for any z value from 3.49 to 3.49.

Finding Areas Under the Standard Normal Distribution Curve
For the solution of problems using the standard normal distribution, a two-step process
is recommended with the use of the Procedure Table shown.
The two steps are 
Step 1
Draw the normal distribution curve and shade the area.
Step 2
Find the appropriate Ô¨Ågure in the Procedure Table and follow the directions
given.
There are three basic types of problems, and all three are summarized in the
Procedure Table. Note that this table is presented as an aid in understanding how to use
the standard normal distribution table and in visualizing the problems. After learning
the procedures, you should not Ô¨Ånd it necessary to refer to the Procedure Table for every
problem.

Table E in Appendix C gives the area under the normal distribution curve to the left
of any z value given in two decimal places. For example, the area to the left of a z value
of 1.39 is found by looking up 1.3 in the left column and 0.09 in the top row. Where the
two lines meet gives an area of 0.9177. See Figure 6‚Äì7.

We are looking for the area under the standard normal distribution to the left

Step 2
We are looking for the area to the right of z  1.19. This is an example
of the second case. Look up the area for z  1.19. It is 0.1170. Subtract it
from 1.0000. 1.0000  0.1170  0.8830. Hence, 88.30% of the area under the
standard normal distribution curve is to the left of z  1.19.
Example 6‚Äì3

Step 2
Since the area desired is between two given z values, look up the areas
corresponding to the two z values and subtract the smaller area from the
larger area. (Do not subtract the z values.) The area for z  1.68 is 0.9535,
and the area for z  1.37 is 0.0853. The area between the two z values is
0.9535  0.0853  0.8682 or 86.82%. 
A Normal Distribution Curve as a Probability Distribution Curve
A normal distribution curve can be used as a probability distribution curve for normally
distributed variables. Recall that a normal distribution is a continuous distribution, as
opposed to a discrete probability distribution, as explained in Chapter 5. The fact that it
is continuous means that there are no gaps in the curve. In other words, for every z value
on the x axis, there is a corresponding height, or frequency, value.
The area under the standard normal distribution curve can also be thought of as a
probability. That is, if it were possible to select any z value at random, the probability of
choosing one, say, between 0 and 2.00 would be the same as the area under the curve
between 0 and 2.00. In this case, the area is 0.4772. Therefore, the probability of
randomly selecting any z value between 0 and 2.00 is 0.4772. The problems involving
probability are solved in the same manner as the previous examples involving areas
in this section. For example, if the problem is to Ô¨Ånd the probability of selecting a
z value between 2.25 and 2.94, solve it by using the method shown in case 3 of the
Procedure Table.
For probabilities, a special notation is used. For example, if the problem is to
Ô¨Ånd the probability of any z value between 0 and 2.32, this probability is written as
P(0  z  2.32).

Solution
a. P(0  z  2.32) means to Ô¨Ånd the area under the standard normal distribution
curve between 0 and 2.32. First look up the area corresponding to 2.32. It is
0.9898. Then look up the area corresponding to z  0. It is 0.500. Subtract the
two areas: 0.9898  0.5000  0.4898. Hence the probability is 0.4898, or
48.98%. This is shown in Figure 6‚Äì11.

or 95.05%. 
c. P(z  1.91) is shown in Figure 6‚Äì13. Look up the area that corresponds to
z  1.91. It is 0.9719. Then subtract this area from 1.0000. P(z  1.91) 
1.0000  0.9719  0.0281, or 2.81%. 
Note: In a continuous distribution, the probability of any exact z value is 0 since the
area would be represented by a vertical line above the value. But vertical lines in theory
have no area. So

In this case it is necessary to add 0.5000 to the given area of 0.2123 to get the
cumulative area of 0.7123. Look up the area in Table E. The value in the left column is
0.5, and the top value is 0.06. Add these two values to get z  0.56. See Figure 6‚Äì15. 
Sometimes, one must Ô¨Ånd a speciÔ¨Åc z value for a given area under the standard
normal distribution curve. The procedure is to work backward, using Table E.
Since Table E is cumulative, it is necessary to locate the cumulative area up to a
given z value. Example 6‚Äì5 shows this.

Chapter 6 The Normal Distribution
6‚Äì12
If the exact area cannot be found, use the closest value. For example, if you wanted
to Ô¨Ånd the z value for an area 0.9241, the closest area is 0.9236, which gives a z value of
1.43. See Table E in Appendix C.
The rationale for using an area under a continuous curve to determine a probability
can be understood by considering the example of a watch that is powered by a battery.
When the battery goes dead, what is the probability that the minute hand will stop some-
where between the numbers 2 and 5 on the face of the watch? In this case, the values of
the variable constitute a continuous variable since the hour hand can stop anywhere on
the dial‚Äôs face between 0 and 12 (one revolution of the minute hand). Hence, the sample
space can be considered to be 12 units long, and the distance between the numbers 2 and
5 is 5  2, or 3 units. Hence, the probability that the minute hand stops on a number
between 2 and 5 is 
. See Figure 6‚Äì16(a).
The problem could also be solved by using a graph of a continuous variable. Let us
assume that since the watch can stop anytime at random, the values where the minute
hand would land are spread evenly over the range of 0 through 12. The graph would then
consist of a continuous uniform distribution with a range of 12 units. Now if we require
the area under the curve to be 1 (like the area under the standard normal distribution), the
height of the rectangle formed by the curve and the x axis would need to be . The reason
is that the area of a rectangle is equal to the base times the height. If the base is 12 units
long, then the height has to be 
since 
.
The area of the rectangle with a base from 2 through 5 would be 
or . See
Figure 6‚Äì16(b). Notice that the area of the small rectangle is the same as the probability
found previously. Hence the area of this rectangle corresponds to the probability of this
event. The same reasoning can be applied to the standard normal distribution curve
shown in Example 6‚Äì5.
Finding the area under the standard normal distribution curve is the Ô¨Årst step in solving
a wide variety of practical applications in which the variables are normally distributed.
Some of these applications will be presented in Section 6‚Äì2.

Assessing Normality
Many times in statistics it is necessary to see if a set of data values is approximately normally
distributed. There are special techniques that can be used. One technique is to draw a
histogram for the data and see if it is approximately bell-shaped. (Note: It does not have to
be exactly symmetric to be bell-shaped.)

Applications of the Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution curve can be used to solve a wide variety of practical
problems. The only requirement is that the variable be normally or approximately nor-
mally distributed. There are several mathematical tests to determine whether a variable
is normally distributed. See the Critical Thinking Challenges on page 352. For all the
problems presented in this chapter, you can assume that the variable is normally or
approximately normally distributed.
To solve problems by using the standard normal distribution, transform the original
variable to a standard normal distribution variable by using the formula
This is the same formula presented in Section 3‚Äì3. This formula transforms the values of
the variable into standard units or z values. Once the variable is transformed, then the
Procedure Table and Table E in Appendix C can be used to solve problems.
For example, suppose that the scores for a standardized test are normally distributed,
have a mean of 100, and have a standard deviation of 15. When the scores are trans-
formed to z values, the two distributions coincide, as shown in Figure 6‚Äì17. (Recall that
the z distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.)

A survey found that women spend on average $146.21 on beauty products during the
summer months. Assume the standard deviation is $29.44. Find the percentage of women
who spend less than $160.00. Assume the variable is normally distributed.

Step 2
Find the z value corresponding to $160.00.

shown in the z distribution in Figure 6‚Äì19.

Therefore 0.6808, or 68.08%, of the women spend less than $160.00 on beauty products
during the summer months.

Find the appropriate area, using Table E. The area to the left of z2 is 0.9332,
and the area to the left of z1 is 0.3085. Hence the area between z1 and z2 is

area to the right of z  1.1 is 1.0000  0.8643  0.1357.

Coffee Consumption
Americans consume an average of 1.64 cups of coffee per day. Assume the variable is
approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.24 cup. If 500
individuals are selected, approximately how many will drink less than 1 cup of coffee
per day?
Source: Chicago Sun-Times.
Solution
Step 1
Draw a Ô¨Ågure and represent the area as shown in Figure 6‚Äì23.
Step 2
Find the z value for 1.
Step 3
Find the area to the left of z  2.67. It is 0.0038.
Step 4
To Ô¨Ånd how many people drank less than 1 cup of coffee, multiply the sample
size 500 by 0.0038 to get 1.9. Since we are asking about people, round the
answer to 2 people. Hence, approximately 2 people will drink less than 1 cup
of coffee a day.
Note: For problems using percentages, be sure to change the percentage to a decimal
before multiplying. Also, round the answer to the nearest whole number, since it is not
possible to have 1.9 people.

Step 2
Find the z value that corresponds to an area of 0.9000 by looking up 0.9000 in
the area portion of Table E. If the speciÔ¨Åc value cannot be found, use the closest
value‚Äîin this case 0.8997, as shown in Figure 6‚Äì25. The corresponding z
value is 1.28. (If the area falls exactly halfway between two z values, use the
larger of the two z values. For example, the area 0.9500 falls halfway between
0.9495 and 0.9505. In this case use 1.65 rather than 1.64 for the z value.)

Figure 6‚Äì26 shows that two values are needed, one above the mean and one below
the mean. To get the area to the left of the positive z value, add 0.5000  0.3000 
0.8000 (30%  0.3000). The z value with area to the left closest to 0.8000 is 0.84.
Substituting in the formula X  zs  m gives
X1  zs  m  (0.84)(8)  120  126.72
The area to the left of the negative z value is 20%, or 0.2000. The area closest to 0.2000
is 0.84.
X2  (0.84)(8)  120  113.28
Therefore, the middle 60% will have blood pressure readings of 113.28  X  126.72.
As shown in this section, a normal distribution is a useful tool in answering many
questions about variables that are normally or approximately normally distributed.

Chapter 6 The Normal Distribution
6‚Äì24
Determining Normality
A normally shaped or bell-shaped distribution is only one of many shapes that a distribu-
tion can assume; however, it is very important since many statistical methods require that
the distribution of values (shown in subsequent chapters) be normally or approximately
normally shaped.
There are several ways statisticians check for normality. The easiest way is to draw
a histogram for the data and check its shape. If the histogram is not approximately bell-
shaped, then the data are not normally distributed.
Skewness can be checked by using the Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient of skewness (PC) also
called Pearson‚Äôs index of skewness. The formula is
If the index is greater than or equal to 1 or less than or equal to 1, it can be concluded
that the data are signiÔ¨Åcantly skewed.
In addition, the data should be checked for outliers by using the method shown in
Chapter 3. Even one or two outliers can have a big effect on normality.
Examples 6‚Äì11 and 6‚Äì12 show how to check for normality.

Since the histogram is approximately bell-shaped, we can say that the distribution is
approximately normal.
Step 2
Check for skewness. For these data, 
 79.5, median  77.5, and s  40.5.
Using the Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient of skewness gives
PC 
 0.148
In this case, the PC is not greater than 1 or less than 1, so it can be
concluded that the distribution is not signiÔ¨Åcantly skewed.
Step 3
Check for outliers. Recall that an outlier is a data value that lies more than
1.5(IQR) units below Q1 or 1.5(IQR) units above Q3. In this case, Q1  45
and Q3  98; hence, IQR  Q3  Q1  98  45  53. An outlier would be 
a data value less than 45  1.5(53)  34.5 or a data value larger than 
98  1.5(53)  177.5. In this case, there are no outliers.
Since the histogram is approximately bell-shaped, the data are not signiÔ¨Åcantly
skewed, and there are no outliers, it can be concluded that the distribution is
approximately normally distributed.

signiÔ¨Åcantly skewed to the left.
Step 3
Check for outliers. In this case, Q1  96.5 and Q3  155.5. IQR  Q3 
Q1  155.5  96.5  59. Any value less than 96.5  1.5(59)  8 or above
155.5  1.5(59)  244 is considered an outlier. There are no outliers.
In summary, the distribution is somewhat negatively skewed.
Another method that is used to check normality is to draw a normal quantile plot.
Quantiles, sometimes called fractiles, are values that separate the data set into approxi-
mately equal groups. Recall that quartiles separate the data set into four approximately
equal groups, and deciles separate the data set into 10 approximately equal groups. A nor-
mal quantile plot consists of a graph of points using the data values for the x coordinates
and the z values of the quantiles corresponding to the x values for the y coordinates.
(Note: The calculations of the z values are somewhat complicated, and technology is usu-
ally used to draw the graph. The Technology Step by Step section shows how to draw a
normal quantile plot.) If the points of the quantile plot do not lie in an approximately
straight line, then normality can be rejected.
There are several other methods used to check for normality. A method using normal
probability graph paper is shown in the Critical Thinking Challenge section at the end of
this chapter, and the chi-square goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test is shown in Chapter 11. Two other
tests sometimes used to check normality are the Kolmogorov-Smikirov test and the
Lilliefors test. An explanation of these tests can be found in advanced textbooks.
Applying the Concepts 6‚Äì2
Smart People
Assume you are thinking about starting a Mensa chapter in your hometown of Visiala,
California, which has a population of about 10,000 people. You need to know how many
people would qualify for Mensa, which requires an IQ of at least 130. You realize that IQ is
normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Complete the
following.
1. Find the approximate number of people in Visiala who are eligible for Mensa.
2. Is it reasonable to continue your quest for a Mensa chapter in Visiala?
3. How could you proceed to Ô¨Ånd out how many of the eligible people would actually join
the new chapter? Be speciÔ¨Åc about your methods of gathering data.
4. What would be the minimum IQ score needed if you wanted to start an Ultra-Mensa club
that included only the top 1% of IQ scores?

Determining Normality
There are several ways in which statisticians test a data set for normality. Four are shown here.
Construct a Histogram
Inspect the histogram for
shape.
1. Enter the data in the Ô¨Årst
column of a new
worksheet. Name the
column Inventory.
2. Use Stat>Basic
Statistics>Graphical
Summary presented in
Section 3‚Äì3 to create
the histogram. Is it
symmetric? Is there a
single peak?
Check for Outliers
Inspect the boxplot for outliers. There are no outliers in this graph. Furthermore, the box is in
the middle of the range, and the median is in the middle of the box. Most likely this is not a
skewed distribution either.
Calculate The Pearson CoefÔ¨Åcient of Skewness
The measure of skewness in the graphical summary is not the same as the Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient.
Use the calculator and the formula.
3. Select Calc>Calculator, then type PC in the text box for Store result in:.
4. Enter the expression: 3*(MEAN(C1)MEDI(C1))/(STDEV(C1)). Make sure you get all
the parentheses in the right place!
5. Click [OK]. The result, 0.148318, will be stored in the Ô¨Årst row of C2 named PC. Since it
is smaller than 1, the distribution is not skewed.
Construct a Normal Probability Plot
6. Select Graph>Probability Plot, then Single and click [OK].
7. Double-click C1 Inventory to select the data to be graphed.
8. Click [Distribution] and make sure that Normal is selected. Click [OK].

may also put Your Name in the subtitle.
10. Click [OK] twice. Inspect the graph to see if
the graph of the points is linear.
These data are nearly normal.
What do you look for in the plot?
a) An ‚ÄúS curve‚Äù indicates a distribution that
is too thick in the tails, a uniform
distribution, for example.
b) Concave plots indicate a skewed
distribution.
c) If one end has a point that is extremely
high or low, there may be outliers.

Normal Random Variables
To Ô¨Ånd the probability for a normal random variable:
Press 2nd [DISTR], then 2 for normalcdf(
The form is normalcdf(lower x value, upper x value, m, s)
Use E99 for  (inÔ¨Ånity) and E99 for  (negative inÔ¨Ånity). Press 2nd [EE] to get E.
Example: Find the probability that x is between 27 and 31 when m  28 and s  2 
(Example 6‚Äì7a from the text).
normalcdf(27,31,28,2)
To Ô¨Ånd the percentile for a normal random variable:
Press 2nd [DISTR], then 3 for invNorm(
The form is invNorm(area to the left of x value, m, s)
Example: Find the 90th percentile when m  200 and s  20 (Example 6‚Äì9 from text).
invNorm(.9,200,20)
To construct a normal quantile plot:
1. Enter the data values into L1.
2. Press 2nd [STAT PLOT] to get the STAT PLOT menu.
3. Press 1 for Plot 1.
4. Turn on the plot by pressing ENTER while the cursor is Ô¨Çashing over ON.
5. Move the cursor to the normal quantile plot (6th graph).
6. Make sure L1 is entered for the Data List and X is highlighted for the Data Axis.
7. Press WINDOW for the Window menu. Adjust Xmin and Xmax according to the data
values. Adjust Ymin and Ymax as well, Ymin  3 and Ymax  3 usually work Ô¨Åne.
8. Press GRAPH.
Using the data from the previous example gives
Since the points in the normal quantile plot lie close to a straight line, the distribution is
approximately normal.

Normal Quantile Plot
Excel can be used to construct a normal quantile plot in order to examine if a set of data is
approximately normally distributed.
1. Enter the data from the MINITAB example into column A of a new worksheet. The data
should be sorted in ascending order. If the data are not already sorted in ascending order,
highlight the data to be sorted and select the Sort & Filter icon from the toolbar. Then
select Sort Smallest to Largest.
2. After all the data are entered and sorted in column A, select cell B1. Type:
=NORMSINV(1/(2*18)). Since the sample size is 18, each score represents , or
approximately 5.6%, of the sample. Each data value is assumed to subdivide the data into
equal intervals. Each data value corresponds to the midpoint of a particular subinterval.
Thus, this procedure will standardize the data by assuming each data value represents the
midpoint of a subinterval of width .
3. Repeat the procedure from step 2 for each data value in column A. However, for each
subsequent value in column A, enter the next odd multiple of 
in the argument for the
NORMSINV function. For example, in cell B2, type: =NORMSINV(3/(2*18)). In cell
B3, type: =NORMSINV(5/(2*18)), and so on until all the data values have corresponding
z scores.
4. Highlight the data from columns A and B, and select Insert, then Scatter chart. Select the
Scatter with only markers (the Ô¨Årst Scatter chart).
5. To insert a title to the chart: Left-click on any region of the chart. Select Chart Tools and
Layout from the toolbar. Then select Chart Title.
6. To insert a label for the variable on the horizontal axis: Left-click on any region of the chart.
Select Chart Tools and Layout form the toolbar. Then select Axis Titles>Primary Horizontal

Properties of the Distribution of Sample Means
1. The mean of the sample means will be the same as the population mean.
2. The standard deviation of the sample means will be smaller than the standard deviation of
the population, and it will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the
square root of the sample size.
The following example illustrates these two properties. Suppose a professor gave an
8-point quiz to a small class of four students. The results of the quiz were 2, 6, 4, and 8.
For the sake of discussion, assume that the four students constitute the population. The
mean of the population is
The standard deviation of the population is
The graph of the original distribution is shown in Figure 6‚Äì29. This is called a uniform
distribution.

In addition to knowing how individual data values vary about the mean for a population,
statisticians are interested in knowing how the means of samples of the same size taken
from the same population vary about the population mean.
Distribution of Sample Means
Suppose a researcher selects a sample of 30 adult males and Ô¨Ånds the mean of the
measure of the triglyceride levels for the sample subjects to be 187 milligrams/deciliter.
Then suppose a second sample is selected, and the mean of that sample is found to be
192 milligrams/deciliter. Continue the process for 100 samples. What happens then is that
the mean becomes a random variable, and the sample means 187, 192, 184, . . . , 196 con-
stitute a sampling distribution of sample means.
A sampling distribution of sample means is a distribution using the means
computed from all possible random samples of a speciÔ¨Åc size taken from a population.
If the samples are randomly selected with replacement, the sample means, for the
most part, will be somewhat different from the population mean m. These differences are
caused by sampling error.
Sampling error is the difference between the sample measure and the corresponding
population measure due to the fact that the sample is not a perfect representation of the
population.
When all possible samples of a speciÔ¨Åc size are selected with replacement from a
population, the distribution of the sample means for a variable has two important prop-
erties, which are explained next.

Historical Notes
Two mathematicians
who contributed to
the development
of the central limit
theorem were
Abraham DeMoivre
(1667‚Äì1754) and
Pierre Simon Laplace
(1749‚Äì1827).
DeMoivre was once
jailed for his religious
beliefs. After his
release, DeMoivre
made a living by
consulting on the
mathematics of
gambling and
insurance. He wrote
two books, Annuities
Upon Lives and The
Doctrine of Chance.
Laplace held a
government position
under Napoleon and
later under Louis XVIII.
He once computed
the probability of the
sun rising to be
18,226,214/
18,226,215.

which is the same as the population mean. Hence,
The standard deviation of sample means, denoted by 
, is
which is the same as the population standard deviation, divided by 
:
(Note: Rounding rules were not used here in order to show that the answers coincide.)
In summary, if all possible samples of size n are taken with replacement from the
same population, the mean of the sample means, denoted by 
, equals the population
mean m; and the standard deviation of the sample means, denoted by 
, equals 
.
The standard deviation of the sample means is called the standard error of the mean.
Hence,
A third property of the sampling distribution of sample means pertains to the shape
of the distribution and is explained by the central limit theorem.

Unusual Stats
Each year a person
living in the United
States consumes on
average 1400 pounds
of food.
The Central Limit Theorem
As the sample size n increases without limit, the shape of the distribution of the sample means
taken with replacement from a population with mean m and standard deviation s will
approach a normal distribution. As previously shown, this distribution will have a mean m and
a standard deviation 
.
sn
If the sample size is sufÔ¨Åciently large, the central limit theorem can be used to
answer questions about sample means in the same manner that a normal distribution can
be used to answer questions about individual values. The only difference is that a new
formula must be used for the z values. It is
Notice that 
is the sample mean, and the denominator must be adjusted since means
are being used instead of individual data values. The denominator is the standard devia-
tion of the sample means.
If a large number of samples of a given size are selected from a normally distributed
population, or if a large number of samples of a given size that is greater than or equal to
30 are selected from a population that is not normally distributed, and the sample means
are computed, then the distribution of sample means will look like the one shown in
Figure 6‚Äì31. Their percentages indicate the areas of the regions.
It‚Äôs important to remember two things when you use the central limit theorem:
1. When the original variable is normally distributed, the distribution of the sample
means will be normally distributed, for any sample size n.
2. When the distribution of the original variable might not be normal, a sample size of
30 or more is needed to use a normal distribution to approximate the distribution of
the sample means. The larger the sample, the better the approximation will be.

Hours That Children Watch Television
A. C. Neilsen reported that children between the ages of 2 and 5 watch an average of
25 hours of television per week. Assume the variable is normally distributed and the
standard deviation is 3 hours. If 20 children between the ages of 2 and 5 are randomly
selected, Ô¨Ånd the probability that the mean of the number of hours they watch television
will be greater than 26.3 hours.

Solution
Since the variable is approximately normally distributed, the distribution of sample
means will be approximately normal, with a mean of 25. The standard deviation of the
sample means is

To Ô¨Ånd the area between the two z values of 2.25 and 1.50, look up the corresponding
area in Table E and subtract one from the other. The area for z  2.25 is 0.0122,
and the area for z  1.50 is 0.9332. Hence the area between the two values is
0.9332  0.0122  0.9210, or 92.1%.
Hence, the probability of obtaining a sample mean between 90 and 100 months is
92.1%; that is, P(90 

Hence, the probability that the mean of a sample of 40 individuals is less than
224 pounds per year is 0.9222, or 92.22%. That is, P(
 224)  0.9222.
Comparing the two probabilities, you can see that the probability of selecting
an individual who consumes less than 224 pounds of meat per year is 58.71%,
but the probability of selecting a sample of 40 people with a mean consumption
of meat that is less than 224 pounds per year is 92.22%. This rather large
difference is due to the fact that the distribution of sample means is much less
variable than the distribution of individual data values. (Note: An individual
person is the equivalent of saying n  1.)
Finite Population Correction Factor (Optional)
The formula for the standard error of the mean
is accurate when the samples are
drawn with replacement or are drawn without replacement from a very large or inÔ¨Ånite pop-
ulation. Since sampling with replacement is for the most part unrealistic, a correction factor
is necessary for computing the standard error of the mean for samples drawn without
replacement from a Ô¨Ånite population. Compute the correction factor by using the expression
where N is the population size and n is the sample size.
This correction factor is necessary if relatively large samples are taken from a small
population, because the sample mean will then more accurately estimate the population
mean and there will be less error in the estimation. Therefore, the standard error of the
mean must be multiplied by the correction factor to adjust for large samples taken from
a small population. That is,
Finally, the formula for the z value becomes
When the population is large and the sample is small, the correction factor is gener-
ally not used, since it will be very close to 1.00.

The Normal Approximation to the Binomial
Distribution
A normal distribution is often used to solve problems that involve the binomial distribu-
tion since when n is large (say, 100), the calculations are too difÔ¨Åcult to do by hand using
the binomial distribution. Recall from Chapter 5 that a binomial distribution has the fol-
lowing characteristics:
1. There must be a Ô¨Åxed number of trials.
2. The outcome of each trial must be independent.

Section 6‚Äì4 The Normal Approximation to the Binomial Distribution
341
6‚Äì43
3. Each experiment can have only two outcomes or outcomes that can be reduced to
two outcomes.
4. The probability of a success must remain the same for each trial.
Also, recall that a binomial distribution is determined by n (the number of trials) and
p (the probability of a success). When p is approximately 0.5, and as n increases, the
shape of the binomial distribution becomes similar to that of a normal distribution. The
larger n is and the closer p is to 0.5, the more similar the shape of the binomial distribu-
tion is to that of a normal distribution.
But when p is close to 0 or 1 and n is relatively small, a normal approximation is
inaccurate. As a rule of thumb, statisticians generally agree that a normal approxima-
tion should be used only when n 	 p and n 	 q are both greater than or equal to 5. (Note:
q  1  p.) For example, if p is 0.3 and n is 10, then np  (10)(0.3)  3, and a normal
distribution should not be used as an approximation. On the other hand, if p  0.5 and
n  10, then np  (10)(0.5)  5 and nq  (10)(0.5)  5, and a normal distribution can
be used as an approximation. See Figure 6‚Äì36.

Chapter 6 The Normal Distribution
6‚Äì44
In addition to the previous condition of np  5 and nq  5, a correction for conti-
nuity may be used in the normal approximation.
A correction for continuity is a correction employed when a continuous distribution is
used to approximate a discrete distribution.
The continuity correction means that for any speciÔ¨Åc value of X, say 8, the bound-
aries of X in the binomial distribution (in this case, 7.5 to 8.5) must be used. (See Sec-
tion 1‚Äì2.) Hence, when you employ a normal distribution to approximate the binomial,
you must use the boundaries of any speciÔ¨Åc value X as they are shown in the binomial
distribution. For example, for P(X  8), the correction is P(7.5  X  8.5). For P(X  7),
the correction is P(X  7.5). For P(X  3), the correction is P(X  2.5).
Students sometimes have difÔ¨Åculty deciding whether to add 0.5 or subtract 0.5 from
the data value for the correction factor. Table 6‚Äì2 summarizes the different situations.

Summary
‚Ä¢ A normal distribution can be used to describe a variety of variables, such as
heights, weights, and temperatures. A normal distribution is bell-shaped, unimodal,
symmetric, and continuous; its mean, median, and mode are equal. Since each
normally distributed variable has its own distribution with mean m and standard
deviation s, mathematicians use the standard normal distribution, which has a mean
of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Other approximately normally distributed
variables can be transformed to the standard normal distribution with the formula
z  (X  m)s. (6‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ A normal distribution can be used to solve a variety of problems in which the
variables are approximately normally distributed. (6‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ A sampling distribution of sample means is a distribution using the means
computed from all possible random samples of a speciÔ¨Åc size taken from a
population. The difference between a sample measure and the corresponding
population measure is due to what is called sampling error. The mean of the sample
means will be the same as the population mean. The standard deviation of the
sample mean will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the
square root of the sample size. The central limit theorem states that as the sample
size increases without limit, the shape of the distribution of the sample means taken
with replacement from a population will approach a normal distribution. (6‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ A normal distribution can be used to approximate other distributions, such as a
binomial distribution. For a normal distribution to be used as an approximation, the
conditions np  5 and nq  5 must be met. Also, a correction for continuity may be
used for more accurate results. (6‚Äì4)

What Is Normal?‚ÄîRevisited
Many of the variables measured in medical tests‚Äîblood pressure, triglyceride level, etc.‚Äîare
approximately normally distributed for the majority of the population in the United States. Thus,
researchers can Ô¨Ånd the mean and standard deviation of these variables. Then, using these two
measures along with the z values, they can Ô¨Ånd normal intervals for healthy individuals. For
example, 95% of the systolic blood pressures of healthy individuals fall within 2 standard
deviations of the mean. If an individual‚Äôs pressure is outside the determined normal range (either
above or below), the physician will look for a possible cause and prescribe treatment if necessary.

Critical Thinking Challenges
Sometimes a researcher must decide whether a variable is
normally distributed. There are several ways to do this. One
simple but very subjective method uses special graph paper,
which is called normal probability paper. For the distribution
of systolic blood pressure readings given in Chapter 3 of the
textbook, the following method can be used:
1. Make a table, as shown.

results for any of our random samples. While it is a
remote possibility, it is highly unlikely.
2. A good estimate for the population mean would be to
Ô¨Ånd the average of the students‚Äô sample means.
Similarly, a good estimate for the population standard
deviation would be to Ô¨Ånd the average of the students‚Äô
sample standard deviations.

How Safe Are You?
1. A reliability rating of 97% means that, on average, the
device will not fail 97% of the time. We do not know
how many times it will fail for any particular set of
100 climbs.
2. The probability of at least 1 failure in 100 climbs is 
1  (0.97)100  1  0.0476  0.9524 (about 95%).
3. The complement of the event in question 2 is the event
of ‚Äúno failures in 100 climbs.‚Äù
4. This can be considered a binomial experiment. We have
two outcomes: success and failure. The probability of
the equipment working (success) remains constant at
97%. We have 100 independent climbs. And we are
counting the number of times the equipment works in
these 100 climbs.
5. We could use the binomial probability formula, but it
would be very messy computationally.
6. The probability of at least two failures cannot be
estimated with the normal distribution (see below). So
the probability is 1  [(0.97)100  100(0.97)99(0.03)] 
1  0.1946  0.8054 (about 80.5%).
7. We should not use the normal approximation to the

have needed a correction for continuity, since we would
have been approximating a discrete distribution with a

9. Since a second safety hook will be successful or fail
independently of the Ô¨Årst safety hook, the probability
of failure drops from 3% to (0.03)(0.03)  0.0009,
or 0.09%.

Statistics
Today
Would You Change the Channel?
A survey by the Roper Organization found that 45% of the people who were offended by
a television program would change the channel, while 15% would turn off their televi-
sion sets. The survey further stated that the margin of error is 3 percentage points, and
4000 adults were interviewed.
Several questions arise:
1. How do these estimates compare with the true population percentages?
2. What is meant by a margin of error of 3 percentage points?
3. Is the sample of 4000 large enough to represent the population of all adults who
watch television in the United States?
See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of the chapter for the answers.
After reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions, since this
chapter explains how statisticians can use statistics to make estimates of parameters.

Introduction
One aspect of inferential statistics is estimation, which is the process of estimating the
value of a parameter from information obtained from a sample. For example, The Book
of Odds, by Michael D. Shook and Robert L. Shook (New York: Penguin Putnam, Inc.),
contains the following statements:
‚ÄúOne out of 4 Americans is currently dieting.‚Äù (Calorie Control Council)
‚ÄúSeventy-two percent of Americans have Ô¨Çown on commercial airlines.‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Bristol
Meyers Report: Medicine in the Next Century‚Äù)
‚ÄúThe average kindergarten student has seen more than 5000 hours of television.‚Äù (U.S.
Department of Education)
‚ÄúThe average school nurse makes $32,786 a year.‚Äù (National Association of School Nurses)
‚ÄúThe average amount of life insurance is $108,000 per household with life insurance.‚Äù
(American Council of Life Insurance)

Since the populations from which these values were obtained are large, these values are
only estimates of the true parameters and are derived from data collected from samples.
The statistical procedures for estimating the population mean, proportion, variance,
and standard deviation will be explained in this chapter.
An important question in estimation is that of sample size. How large should the sam-
ple be in order to make an accurate estimate? This question is not easy to answer since the
size of the sample depends on several factors, such as the accuracy desired and the prob-
ability of making a correct estimate. The question of sample size will be explained in this
chapter also.
Inferential statistical techniques have various assumptions that must be met before valid
conclusions can be obtained. One common assumption is that the samples must be randomly
selected. Chapter 1 explains how to obtain a random sample. The other common assumption
is that either the sample size must be greater than or equal to 30 or the population must be
normally or approximately normally distributed if the sample size is less than 30.
To check this assumption, you can use the methods explained in Chapter 6. Just for
review, the methods are to check the histogram to see if it is approximately bell-shaped,
check for outliers, and if possible, generate a normal quartile plot and see if the points
fall close to a straight line. (Note: An area of statistics called nonparametric statistics
does not require the variable to be normally distributed.)
Some statistical techniques are called robust. This means that the distribution of the
variable can depart somewhat from normality, and valid conclusions can still be obtained.

ConÔ¨Ådence Intervals for the Mean 
When S Is Known
Suppose a college president wishes to estimate the average age of students attending
classes this semester. The president could select a random sample of 100 students and
Ô¨Ånd the average age of these students, say, 22.3 years. From the sample mean, the
president could infer that the average age of all the students is 22.3 years. This type of
estimate is called a point estimate.
A point estimate is a speciÔ¨Åc numerical value estimate of a parameter. The best point
estimate of the population mean m is the sample mean .
You might ask why other measures of central tendency, such as the median and
mode, are not used to estimate the population mean. The reason is that the means of sam-
ples vary less than other statistics (such as medians and modes) when many samples are
selected from the same population. Therefore, the sample mean is the best estimate of the
population mean.
Sample measures (i.e., statistics) are used to estimate population measures (i.e., para-
meters). These statistics are called estimators. As previously stated, the sample mean is a
better estimator of the population mean than the sample median or sample mode.
A good estimator should satisfy the three properties described now.

Objective 
Find the conÔ¨Ådence
interval for the mean
when s is known.
1
Three Properties of a Good Estimator
1. The estimator should be an unbiased estimator. That is, the expected value or the mean of
the estimates obtained from samples of a given size is equal to the parameter being estimated.
2. The estimator should be consistent. For a consistent estimator, as sample size increases,
the value of the estimator approaches the value of the parameter estimated.
3. The estimator should be a relatively efÔ¨Åcient estimator. That is, of all the statistics that can
be used to estimate a parameter, the relatively efÔ¨Åcient estimator has the smallest variance.

ConÔ¨Ådence Intervals
As stated in Chapter 6, the sample mean will be, for the most part, somewhat different
from the population mean due to sampling error. Therefore, you might ask a second ques-
tion: How good is a point estimate? The answer is that there is no way of knowing how
close a particular point estimate is to the population mean.
This answer places some doubt on the accuracy of point estimates. For this reason,
statisticians prefer another type of estimate, called an interval estimate.
An interval estimate of a parameter is an interval or a range of values used to estimate
the parameter. This estimate may or may not contain the value of the parameter being
estimated.
In an interval estimate, the parameter is speciÔ¨Åed as being between two values. For
example, an interval estimate for the average age of all students might be 21.9  m 
22.7, or 22.3  0.4 years.
Either the interval contains the parameter or it does not. A degree of conÔ¨Ådence (usu-
ally a percent) can be assigned before an interval estimate is made. For instance, you may
wish to be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that the interval contains the true population mean. Another
question then arises. Why 95%? Why not 99 or 99.5%?
If you desire to be more conÔ¨Ådent, such as 99 or 99.5% conÔ¨Ådent, then you must
make the interval larger. For example, a 99% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean age of
college students might be 21.7  m  22.9, or 22.3  0.6. Hence, a tradeoff occurs. To
be more conÔ¨Ådent that the interval contains the true population mean, you must make the
interval wider.
The conÔ¨Ådence level of an interval estimate of a parameter is the probability that the
interval estimate will contain the parameter, assuming that a large number of samples are
selected and that the estimation process on the same parameter is repeated.
A conÔ¨Ådence interval is a speciÔ¨Åc interval estimate of a parameter determined by using
data obtained from a sample and by using the speciÔ¨Åc conÔ¨Ådence level of the estimate.
Intervals constructed in this way are called conÔ¨Ådence intervals. Three common con-
Ô¨Ådence intervals are used: the 90, the 95, and the 99% conÔ¨Ådence intervals.
The algebraic derivation of the formula for determining a conÔ¨Ådence interval for a
mean will be shown later. A brief intuitive explanation will be given Ô¨Årst.
The central limit theorem states that when the sample size is large, approximately
95% of the sample means taken from a population and same sample size will fall within
1.96 standard errors of the population mean, that is,
Now, if a speciÔ¨Åc sample mean is selected, say, , there is a 95% probability that the
interval m  1.96(s
) contains . Likewise, there is a 95% probability that the inter-
val speciÔ¨Åed by
will contain m, as will be shown later. Stated another way,

Historical Notes
Point and interval
estimates were known
as long ago as the late
1700s. However, it
wasn‚Äôt until 1937 that
a mathematician,
J. Neyman, formulated
practical applications
for them.

Hence, you can be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that the population mean is contained within that
interval when the values of the variable are normally distributed in the population.
The value used for the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval, 1.96, is obtained from Table E in
Appendix C. For a 99% conÔ¨Ådence interval, the value 2.58 is used instead of 1.96 in the
formula. This value is also obtained from Table E and is based on the standard normal
distribution. Since other conÔ¨Ådence intervals are used in statistics, the symbol za2 (read
‚Äúzee sub alpha over two‚Äù) is used in the general formula for conÔ¨Ådence intervals. The
Greek letter a (alpha) represents the total area in both tails of the standard normal distri-
bution curve, and a2 represents the area in each one of the tails. More will be said after
Examples 7‚Äì1 and 7‚Äì2 about Ô¨Ånding other values for za2.
The relationship between a and the conÔ¨Ådence level is that the stated conÔ¨Ådence level
is the percentage equivalent to the decimal value of 1  a, and vice versa. When the 95%
conÔ¨Ådence interval is to be found, a  0.05, since 1  0.05  0.95, or 95%.When a  0.01,
then 1  a  1  0.01  0.99, and the 99% conÔ¨Ådence interval is being calculated.

Rounding Rule for a ConÔ¨Ådence Interval for a Mean When you are comput-

decimal place than the number of decimal places in the original data. When you are com-

deviation, round off to the same number of decimal places as given for the mean.

Days It Takes to Sell an Aveo
A researcher wishes to estimate the number of days it takes an automobile dealer to sell
a Chevrolet Aveo. A sample of 50 cars had a mean time on the dealer‚Äôs lot of 54 days.
Assume the population standard deviation to be 6.0 days. Find the best point estimate of
the population mean and the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval of the population mean.
Source: Based on information obtained from Power Information Network.
Solution
The best point estimate of the mean is 54 days. For the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval use z  1.96.
Hence one can say with 95% conÔ¨Ådence that the interval between 52.3 and 55.7 days
does contain the population mean, based on a sample of 50 automobiles.

Waiting Times in Emergency Rooms
A survey of 30 emergency room patients found that the average waiting time for treatment
was 174.3 minutes. Assuming that the population standard deviation is 46.5 minutes, Ô¨Ånd the
best point estimate of the population mean and the 99% conÔ¨Ådence of the population mean.
Source: Based on information from Press Ganey Associates Inc.
Solution
The best point estimate is 174.3 minutes. The 99% conÔ¨Ådence is interval is
Hence, one can be 99% conÔ¨Ådent that the mean waiting time for emergency room
treatment is between 152.4 and 196.2 minutes.
Another way of looking at a conÔ¨Ådence interval is shown in Figure 7‚Äì2. According to
the central limit theorem, approximately 95% of the sample means fall within 1.96 standard
deviations of the population mean if the sample size is 30 or more, or if s is known when n

is less than 30 and the population is normally distributed. If it were possible to build a con-
Ô¨Ådence interval about each sample mean, as was done in Examples 7‚Äì1 and 7‚Äì2 for m, 95%
of these intervals would contain the population mean, as shown in Figure 7‚Äì3. Hence, you
can be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that an interval built around a speciÔ¨Åc sample mean would contain the
population mean. If you desire to be 99% conÔ¨Ådent, you must enlarge the conÔ¨Ådence inter-
vals so that 99 out of every 100 intervals contain the population mean.
Since other conÔ¨Ådence intervals (besides 90, 95, and 99%) are sometimes used in sta-
tistics, an explanation of how to Ô¨Ånd the values for za2 is necessary. As stated previously,
the Greek letter a represents the total of the areas in both tails of the normal distribution.
The value for a is found by subtracting the decimal equivalent for the desired conÔ¨Ådence
level from 1. For example, if you wanted to Ô¨Ånd the 98% conÔ¨Ådence interval, you would
change 98% to 0.98 and Ô¨Ånd a  1  0.98, or 0.02. Then a2 is obtained by dividing a
by 2. So a2 is 0.022, or 0.01. Finally, z0.01 is the z value that will give an area of 0.01 in
the right tail of the standard normal distribution curve. See Figure 7‚Äì4.

Once a2 is determined, the corresponding za2 value can be found by using the pro-
cedure shown in Chapter 6, which is reviewed here. To get the za2 value for a 98%
conÔ¨Ådence interval, subtract 0.01 from 1.0000 to get 0.9900. Next, locate the area that is
closest to 0.9900 (in this case, 0.9901) in Table E, and then Ô¨Ånd the corresponding
z value. In this example, it is 2.33. See Figure 7‚Äì5.
For conÔ¨Ådence intervals, only the positive z value is used in the formula.
When the original variable is normally distributed and 
is known, the standard nor-
mal distribution can be used to Ô¨Ånd conÔ¨Ådence intervals regardless of the size of the sam-
ple. When n  30, the distribution of means will be approximately normal even if the
original distribution of the variable departs from normality. 
When 
is unknown, s can be used as an estimate of 
but a different distribution
is used for the critical values. This method is explained in Section 7‚Äì2.

Find za2. Subtract 0.05 from 1.000 to get 0.9500. The corresponding z value
obtained from Table E is 1.65. (Note: This value is found by using the z value
for an area between 0.9495 and 0.9505. A more precise z value obtained
mathematically is 1.645 and is sometimes used; however, 1.65 will be used in

Comment to Computer and Statistical Calculator Users
This chapter and subsequent chapters include examples using raw data. If you are using
computer or calculator programs to Ô¨Ånd the solutions, the answers you get may vary
somewhat from the ones given in the textbook. This is so because computers and calculators
do not round the answers in the intermediate steps and can use 12 or more decimal places for
computation. Also, they use more-exact critical values than those given in the tables in the
back of this book. These small discrepancies are part and parcel of statistics.
Sample Size
Sample size determination is closely related to statistical estimation. Quite often you
ask, How large a sample is necessary to make an accurate estimate? The answer is not
simple, since it depends on three things: the margin of error, the population standard
deviation, and the degree of conÔ¨Ådence. For example, how close to the true mean do you
want to be (2 units, 5 units, etc.), and how conÔ¨Ådent do you wish to be (90, 95, 99%,
etc.)? For the purpose of this chapter, it will be assumed that the population standard
deviation of the variable is known or has been estimated from a previous study.

Since a  0.01 (or 1  0.99), za2  2.58 and E  2. Substituting in the formula, 
Round the value 31.2 up to 32. Therefore, to be 99% conÔ¨Ådent that the estimate is
within 2 feet of the true mean depth, the scientist needs at least a sample of 32
measurements.
In most cases in statistics, we round off. However, when determining sample size,
we always round up to the next whole number.
Notice that when you are Ô¨Ånding the sample size, the size of the population is irrele-
vant when the population is large or inÔ¨Ånite or when sampling is done with replacement.
In other cases, an adjustment is made in the formula for computing sample size. This
adjustment is beyond the scope of this book.
The formula for determining sample size requires the use of the population standard
deviation. What happens when s is unknown? In this case, an attempt is made to esti-
mate s. One such way is to use the standard deviation s obtained from a sample taken
previously as an estimate for s. The standard deviation can also be estimated by divid-
ing the range by 4.
Sometimes, interval estimates rather than point estimates are reported. For instance,
you may read a statement: ‚ÄúOn the basis of a sample of 200 families, the survey estimates
that an American family of two spends an average of $84 per week for groceries. One

The algebraic derivation of the formula for a conÔ¨Ådence interval is shown next. As
explained in Chapter 6, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal
when large samples (n  30) are taken from a population. Also,
Furthermore, there is a probability of 1  a that a z will have a value between za2 and
za2. Hence,
By using algebra, the formula can be rewritten as
Subtracting 
from both sides and from the middle gives
Multiplying by 1 gives

Assume you work for Kimberly Clark Corporation, the makers of Kleenex. The job you are
presently working on requires you to decide how many Kleenexes are to be put in the new
automobile glove compartment boxes. Complete the following.
1. How will you decide on a reasonable number of Kleenexes to put in the boxes?
2. When do people usually need Kleenexes?
3. What type of data collection technique would you use?
4. Assume you found out that from your sample of 85 people, on average about 57 Kleenexes
are used throughout the duration of a cold, with a population standard deviation of 15. Use
a conÔ¨Ådence interval to help you decide how many Kleenexes will go in the boxes.
5. Explain how you decided how many Kleenexes will go in the boxes.

ConÔ¨Ådence Intervals for the Mean 
When S Is Unknown
When s is known and the sample size is 30 or more, or the population is normally dis-
tributed if the sample size is less than 30, the conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean can be
found by using the z distribution as shown in Section 7‚Äì1. However, most of the time, the
value of 
is not known, so it must be estimated by using s, namely, the standard devia-
tion of the sample. When s is used, especially when the sample size is small, critical val-
ues greater than the values for
are used in conÔ¨Ådence intervals in order to keep the
interval at a given level, such as the 95%. These values are taken from the Student t dis-
tribution, most often called the t distribution.
To use this method, the samples must be simple random samples, and the population
from which the samples were taken must be normally or approximately normally dis-
tributed, or the sample size must be 30 or more.
Some important characteristics of the t distribution are described now.

Historical Notes
The t distribution was
formulated in 1908
by an Irish brewing
employee named
W. S. Gosset.
Gosset was involved
in researching new
methods of
manufacturing ale.
Because brewing
employees were not
allowed to publish
results, Gosset
published his Ô¨Ånding
using the pseudonym
Student; hence, the
t distribution is
sometimes called 
Student‚Äôs t distribution.
Characteristics of the t Distribution
The t distribution shares some characteristics of the normal distribution and differs from it in
others. The t distribution is similar to the standard normal distribution in these ways:
1. It is bell-shaped.
2. It is symmetric about the mean.
3. The mean, median, and mode are equal to 0 and are located at the center of the distribution.
4. The curve never touches the x axis.
The t distribution differs from the standard normal distribution in the following ways:
1. The variance is greater than 1.
2. The t distribution is actually a family of curves based on the concept of degrees of
freedom, which is related to sample size.
3. As the sample size increases, the t distribution approaches the standard normal
distribution. See Figure 7‚Äì6.
Many statistical distributions use the concept of degrees of freedom, and the formu-
las for Ô¨Ånding the degrees of freedom vary for different statistical tests. The degrees of
freedom are the number of values that are free to vary after a sample statistic has been
computed, and they tell the researcher which speciÔ¨Åc curve to use when a distribution
consists of a family of curves.
For example, if the mean of 5 values is 10, then 4 of the 5 values are free to vary.
But once 4 values are selected, the Ô¨Åfth value must be a speciÔ¨Åc number to get a sum of
50, since 50 
 5  10. Hence, the degrees of freedom are 5  1  4, and this value tells
the researcher which t curve to use.

t for d.f. = 20
t  for d.f. = 5
Figure 7‚Äì6
The t Family of Curves

The symbol d.f. will be used for degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom for a
conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean are found by subtracting 1 from the sample size. That
is, d.f.  n  1. Note: For some statistical tests used later in this book, the degrees of
freedom are not equal to n  1.
The formula for Ô¨Ånding a conÔ¨Ådence interval about the mean by using the t dis-
tribution is given now.

Example 7‚Äì5
When d.f. is greater than 30, it may fall between two table values. For example, if
d.f.
it falls between 65 and 70. Many textbooks say to use the closest value, for
example, 68 is closer to 70 than 65; however, in this textbook a conservative approach is
used. In this case, always round down to the nearest table value. In this case, 68 rounds
down to 65.
Note: At the bottom of Table F where d.f. is large or , the za2 values can be found
for speciÔ¨Åc conÔ¨Ådence intervals. The reason is that as the degrees of freedom increase,

Sleeping Time
Ten randomly selected people were asked how long they slept at night. The mean time
was 7.1 hours, and the standard deviation was 0.78 hour. Find the 95% conÔ¨Ådence
interval of the mean time. Assume the variable is normally distributed.
Source: Based on information in Number Freaking.
Solution
Since s is unknown and s must replace it, the t distribution (Table F) must be used for
the conÔ¨Ådence interval. Hence, with 9 degrees of freedom ta2  2.262. The 95%
conÔ¨Ådence interval can be found by substituting in the formula.
7.1  0.56  m  7.1  0.56
6.54  m  7.66
Therefore, one can be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that the population mean is between 6.54 and
7.66 inches.

Assumptions for Finding a ConÔ¨Ådence Interval for a Mean When S Is
Unknown
1. The sample is a random sample.
2. Either n  30 or the population is normally distributed if n  30.

One can be 99% conÔ¨Ådent that the population mean number of home Ô¨Åres
started by candles each year is between 4785.2 and 9297.6, based on a sample
of home Ô¨Åres occurring over a period of 7 years.
Students sometimes have difÔ¨Åculty deciding whether to use za2 or ta2 values when
Ô¨Ånding conÔ¨Ådence intervals for the mean. As stated previously, when s is known,
za2 values can be used no matter what the sample size is, as long as the variable is nor-
mally distributed or n  30. When s is unknown and n  30, then s can be used in
the formula and ta2 values can be used. Finally, when s is unknown and n  30, s is used
in the formula and ta2 values are used, as long as the variable is approximately normally
distributed. These rules are summarized in Figure 7‚Äì8.

were named Serenity. The parameter 12% is called a proportion. It means that of all the
pleasure boats in the United States, 12 out of every 100 are named Serenity. A proportion
represents a part of a whole. It can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. In
this case, 12%  0.12 
or . Proportions can also represent probabilities. In this case,
if a pleasure boat is selected at random, the probability that it is called Serenity is 0.12.

As with means, the statistician, given the sample proportion, tries to estimate the
population proportion. Point and interval estimates for a population proportion can be
made by using the sample proportion. For a point estimate of p (the population propor-
tion), 
(the sample proportion) is used. On the basis of the three properties of a good
estimator, is unbiased, consistent, and relatively efÔ¨Åcient. But as with means, one is not
able to decide how good the point estimate of p is. Therefore, statisticians also use an
interval estimate for a proportion, and they can assign a probability that the interval will
contain the population proportion.
The conÔ¨Ådence interval for a particular p is based on the sampling distribution of .
When the sample size n is no more than 5% of the population size, the sampling distribu-
tion of
is approximately normal with a mean of p and a standard deviation of 
,

A researcher wishes to estimate the percentage of M&M‚Äôs that are brown. He wants to

This formula can be found by solving the margin of error value for n in the formula
There are two situations to consider. First, if some approximation of

(e.g., from a previous study), that value can be used in the formula.
Second, if no approximation of

give a sample size sufÔ¨Åciently large to guarantee an accurate prediction, given the conÔ¨Å-

is at maximum, as shown here.

Does Success Bring Happiness?
W. C. Fields said, ‚ÄúStart every day off
with a smile and get it over with.‚Äù
Do you think people are happy
because they are successful, or are they
successful because they are just happy
people? A recent survey conducted by
Money magazine showed that 34% of the
people surveyed said that they were happy
because they were successful; however,
63% said that they were successful
because they were happy individuals.
The people surveyed had an average
household income of $75,000 or more.
The margin of error was 2.5%. Based
on the information in this article, what

ConÔ¨Ådence Intervals for Variances 
and Standard Deviations
In Sections 7‚Äì1 through 7‚Äì3 conÔ¨Ådence intervals were calculated for means and propor-
tions. This section will explain how to Ô¨Ånd conÔ¨Ådence intervals for variances and stan-
dard deviations. In statistics, the variance and standard deviation of a variable are as
important as the mean. For example, when products that Ô¨Åt together (such as pipes) are
manufactured, it is important to keep the variations of the diameters of the products as
small as possible; otherwise, they will not Ô¨Åt together properly and will have to be
scrapped. In the manufacture of medicines, the variance and standard deviation of the
medication in the pills play an important role in making sure patients receive the proper
dosage. For these reasons, conÔ¨Ådence intervals for variances and standard deviations are
necessary.
Objective 
Find a conÔ¨Ådence
interval for a variance
and a standard
deviation.

Chapter 7 ConÔ¨Ådence Intervals and Sample Size
7‚Äì32
To calculate these conÔ¨Ådence intervals, a new statistical distribution is needed. It is
called the chi-square distribution.
The chi-square variable is similar to the t variable in that its distribution is a family
of curves based on the number of degrees of freedom. The symbol for chi-square is x2
(Greek letter chi, pronounced ‚Äúki‚Äù). Several of the distributions are shown in Figure 7‚Äì9,
along with the corresponding degrees of freedom. The chi-square distribution is obtained
from the values of (n  1)s2s2 when random samples are selected from a normally dis-
tributed population whose variance is s2.
A chi-square variable cannot be negative, and the distributions are skewed to the
right. At about 100 degrees of freedom, the chi-square distribution becomes somewhat
symmetric. The area under each chi-square distribution is equal to 1.00, or 100%.
Table G in Appendix C gives the values for the chi-square distribution. These values
are used in the denominators of the formulas for conÔ¨Ådence intervals. Two different values
Historical Note
The 2 distribution with
2 degrees of freedom
was formulated by a
mathematician named
Hershel in 1869
while he was studying
the accuracy of
shooting arrows at a
target. Many other
mathematicians have
since contributed to its
development.

of Curves

are used in the formula because the distribution is not symmetric. One value is found on
the left side of the table, and the other is on the right. See Figure 7‚Äì10. For example, to
Ô¨Ånd the table values corresponding to the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval, you must Ô¨Årst change
95% to a decimal and subtract it from 1 (1  0.95  0.05). Then divide the answer by
2 (a2  0.052  0.025). This is the column on the right side of the table, used to get the
values for x2
right. To get the value for x2
left, subtract the value of a2 from 1 (1  0.052 
0.975). Finally, Ô¨Ånd the appropriate row corresponding to the degrees of freedom n  1.
A similar procedure is used to Ô¨Ånd the values for a 90 or 99% conÔ¨Ådence interval.

Recall that s2 is the symbol for the sample variance and s is the symbol for the sample
standard deviation. If the problem gives the sample standard deviation s, be sure to square
it when you are using the formula. But if the problem gives the sample variance s2, do not
square it when you are using the formula, since the variance is already in square units.
Assumptions for Finding a ConÔ¨Ådence Interval for a Variance 
or Standard Deviation
1. The sample is a random sample.
2. The population must be normally distributed.
Rounding Rule for a ConÔ¨Ådence Interval for a Variance or Standard
Deviation When you are computing a conÔ¨Ådence interval for a population variance or
standard deviation by using raw data, round off to one more decimal place than the num-
ber of decimal places in the original data.
When you are computing a conÔ¨Ådence interval for a population variance or standard
deviation by using a sample variance or standard deviation, round off to the same num-
ber of decimal places as given for the sample variance or standard deviation.
Example 7‚Äì14 shows how to Ô¨Ånd a conÔ¨Ådence interval for a variance and standard
deviation.

Example 7‚Äì14
Nicotine Content
Find the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the variance and standard deviation of the nicotine
content of cigarettes manufactured if a sample of 20 cigarettes has a standard deviation
of 1.6 milligrams.
Solution
Since a  0.05, the two critical values, respectively, for the 0.025 and 0.975 levels for
19 degrees of freedom are 32.852 and 8.907. The 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the
variance is found by substituting in the formula.
1.5  s2  5.5
Hence, you can be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that the true variance for the nicotine content is
between 1.5 and 5.5.
For the standard deviation, the conÔ¨Ådence interval is
1.2  s  2.3
Hence, you can be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that the true standard deviation for the nicotine
content of all cigarettes manufactured is between 1.2 and 2.3 milligrams based on a
sample of 20 cigarettes.

Summary
‚Ä¢ An important aspect of inferential statistics is estimation. Estimations of parameters
of populations are accomplished by selecting a random sample from that population
and choosing and computing a statistic that is the best estimator of the parameter. A
good estimator must be unbiased, consistent, and relatively efÔ¨Åcient. The best
estimate of m is . (7‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ There are two types of estimates of a parameter: point estimates and interval estimates.
A point estimate is a speciÔ¨Åc value. For example, if a researcher wishes to estimate
the average length of a certain adult Ô¨Åsh, a sample of the Ô¨Åsh is selected and
measured. The mean of this sample is computed, for example, 3.2 centimeters.
From this sample mean, the researcher estimates the population mean to be
3.2 centimeters. The problem with point estimates is that the accuracy of the
estimate cannot be determined. For this reason, statisticians prefer to use the
interval estimate. By computing an interval about the sample value, statisticians can
be 95 or 99% (or some other percentage) conÔ¨Ådent that their estimate contains the
true parameter. The conÔ¨Ådence level is determined by the researcher. The higher the
conÔ¨Ådence level, the wider the interval of the estimate must be. For example, a 95%
conÔ¨Ådence interval of the true mean length of a certain species of Ô¨Åsh might be

whereas the 99% conÔ¨Ådence interval might be
3.15  m  3.25 (7‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ When the population standard deviation is known, the z value is used to compute
the conÔ¨Ådence interval. (7‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Closely related to computing conÔ¨Ådence intervals is the determination of the sample
size to make an estimate of the mean. This information is needed to determine the
minimum sample size necessary.
1. The degree of conÔ¨Ådence must be stated.
2. The population standard deviation must be known or be able to be estimated.
3. The margin of error must be stated. (7‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ If the population standard deviation is unknown, the t value is used. When the
sample size is less than 30, the population must be normally distributed. (7‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ ConÔ¨Ådence intervals and sample sizes can also be computed for proportions by
using the normal distribution. (7‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ Finally, conÔ¨Ådence intervals for variances and standard deviations can be computed
by using the chi-square distribution. (7‚Äì4)

How Much Better Is Better?
Suppose a school superintendent reads an article which states that the overall mean score
for the SAT is 910. Furthermore, suppose that, for a sample of students, the average of the
SAT scores in the superintendent‚Äôs school district is 960. Can the superintendent conclude
that the students in his school district scored higher on average? At Ô¨Årst glance, you might
be inclined to say yes, since 960 is higher than 910. But recall that the means of samples
vary about the population mean when samples are selected from a speciÔ¨Åc population. So
the question arises, Is there a real difference in the means, or is the difference simply due
to chance (i.e., sampling error)? In this chapter, you will learn how to answer that ques-
tion by using statistics that explain hypothesis testing. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited
for the answer. In this chapter, you will learn how to answer many questions of this type
by using statistics that are explained in the theory of hypothesis testing.
Introduction
Researchers are interested in answering many types of questions. For example, a scien-
tist might want to know whether the earth is warming up. A physician might want to
know whether a new medication will lower a person‚Äôs blood pressure. An educator might
wish to see whether a new teaching technique is better than a traditional one. A retail
merchant might want to know whether the public prefers a certain color in a new line of
fashion. Automobile manufacturers are interested in determining whether seat belts will
reduce the severity of injuries caused by accidents. These types of questions can be
addressed through statistical hypothesis testing, which is a decision-making process for
evaluating claims about a population. In hypothesis testing, the researcher must deÔ¨Åne
the population under study, state the particular hypotheses that will be investigated, give
the signiÔ¨Åcance level, select a sample from the population, collect the data, perform the
calculations required for the statistical test, and reach a conclusion.
Hypotheses concerning parameters such as means and proportions can be investigated.
There are two speciÔ¨Åc statistical tests used for hypotheses concerning means: the z test

and the t test. This chapter will explain in detail the hypothesis-testing procedure along with
the z test and the t test. In addition, a hypothesis-testing procedure for testing a single vari-
ance or standard deviation using the chi-square distribution is explained in Section 8‚Äì5.
The three methods used to test hypotheses are
1. The traditional method
2. The P-value method
3. The conÔ¨Ådence interval method
The traditional method will be explained Ô¨Årst. It has been used since the hypothesis-
testing method was formulated. A newer method, called the P-value method, has become
popular with the advent of modern computers and high-powered statistical calculators. It
will be explained at the end of Section 8‚Äì2. The third method, the conÔ¨Ådence interval
method, is explained in Section 8‚Äì6 and illustrates the relationship between hypothesis
testing and conÔ¨Ådence intervals.
Section 8‚Äì1 Steps in Hypothesis Testing‚ÄîTraditional Method
401
8‚Äì3
8‚Äì1
Steps in Hypothesis Testing‚ÄîTraditional Method
Every hypothesis-testing situation begins with the statement of a hypothesis.
A statistical hypothesis is a conjecture about a population parameter. This conjecture
may or may not be true.
There are two types of statistical hypotheses for each situation: the null hypothesis
and the alternative hypothesis.
The null hypothesis, symbolized by H0, is a statistical hypothesis that states that there
is no difference between a parameter and a speciÔ¨Åc value, or that there is no difference
between two parameters.
The alternative hypothesis, symbolized by H1, is a statistical hypothesis that states the
existence of a difference between a parameter and a speciÔ¨Åc value, or states that there is
a difference between two parameters.
(Note: Although the deÔ¨Ånitions of null and alternative hypotheses given here use the
word parameter, these deÔ¨Ånitions can be extended to include other terms such as distri-
butions and randomness. This is explained in later chapters.)
As an illustration of how hypotheses should be stated, three different statistical stud-
ies will be used as examples.
Situation A
A medical researcher is interested in Ô¨Ånding out whether a new medica-
tion will have any undesirable side effects. The researcher is particularly concerned with
the pulse rate of the patients who take the medication. Will the pulse rate increase,
decrease, or remain unchanged after a patient takes the medication?
Since the researcher knows that the mean pulse rate for the population under study
is 82 beats per minute, the hypotheses for this situation are
H0: m  82
and
H1: m  82
The null hypothesis speciÔ¨Åes that the mean will remain unchanged, and the alternative
hypothesis states that it will be different. This test is called a two-tailed test (a term that
will be formally deÔ¨Åned later in this section), since the possible side effects of the med-
icine could be to raise or lower the pulse rate.
Objective 
Understand the
deÔ¨Ånitions used in
hypothesis testing.
1
Objective 
State the null and
alternative hypotheses.
2

Situation B
A chemist invents an additive to increase the life of an automobile bat-
tery. If the mean lifetime of the automobile battery without the additive is 36 months,
then her hypotheses are
H0: m  36
and
H1: m  36
In this situation, the chemist is interested only in increasing the lifetime of the batteries,
so her alternative hypothesis is that the mean is greater than 36 months. The null hypoth-
esis is that the mean is equal to 36 months. This test is called right-tailed, since the inter-
est is in an increase only.
Situation C
A contractor wishes to lower heating bills by using a special type of
insulation in houses. If the average of the monthly heating bills is $78, her hypotheses
about heating costs with the use of insulation are
H0: m  $78
and
H1: m  $78
This test is a left-tailed test, since the contractor is interested only in lowering heating costs.
To state hypotheses correctly, researchers must translate the conjecture or claim from
words into mathematical symbols. The basic symbols used are as follows:
Equal to

Greater than

Not equal to

Less than

The null and alternative hypotheses are stated together, and the null hypothesis con-
tains the equals sign, as shown (where k represents a speciÔ¨Åed number).
Two-tailed test
Right-tailed test
Left-tailed test
H0: m  k
H0: m  k
H0: m  k
H1: m  k
H1: m  k
H1: m  k
The formal deÔ¨Ånitions of the different types of tests are given later in this section.
In this book, the null hypothesis is always stated using the equals sign. This is done
because in most professional journals, and when we test the null hypothesis, the assump-
tion is that the mean, proportion, or standard deviation is equal to a given speciÔ¨Åc value.
Also, when a researcher conducts a study, he or she is generally looking for evidence
to support a claim. Therefore, the claim should be stated as the alternative hypothesis,
i.e., using  or  or . Because of this, the alternative hypothesis is sometimes called
the research hypothesis.

Example 8‚Äì1
State the null and alternative hypotheses for each conjecture.
a. A researcher thinks that if expectant mothers use vitamin pills, the birth weight
of the babies will increase. The average birth weight of the population is 8.6 pounds.
b. An engineer hypothesizes that the mean number of defects can be decreased in a
manufacturing process of compact disks by using robots instead of humans for
certain tasks. The mean number of defective disks per 1000 is 18.
c. A psychologist feels that playing soft music during a test will change the results
of the test. The psychologist is not sure whether the grades will be higher or
lower. In the past, the mean of the scores was 73.
Solution
a. H0: m  8.6 and H1: m  8.6
b. H0: m  18 and H1: m  18
c. H0: m  73 and H1: m  73
After stating the hypothesis, the researcher designs the study. The researcher selects
the correct statistical test, chooses an appropriate level of signiÔ¨Åcance, and formulates a
plan for conducting the study. In situation A, for instance, the researcher will select a
sample of patients who will be given the drug. After allowing a suitable time for the drug
to be absorbed, the researcher will measure each person‚Äôs pulse rate.
Recall that when samples of a speciÔ¨Åc size are selected from a population, the means of
these samples will vary about the population mean, and the distribution of the sample
means will be approximately normal when the sample size is 30 or more. (See Section 6‚Äì3.)
So even if the null hypothesis is true, the mean of the pulse rates of the sample of patients
will not, in most cases, be exactly equal to the population mean of 82 beats per minute.
There are two possibilities. Either the null hypothesis is true, and the difference between
the sample mean and the population mean is due to chance; or the null hypothesis is false,
and the sample came from a population whose mean is not 82 beats per minute but is some
other value that is not known. These situations are shown in Figure 8‚Äì1.
The farther away the sample mean is from the population mean, the more evidence
there would be for rejecting the null hypothesis. The probability that the sample came
from a population whose mean is 82 decreases as the distance or absolute value of the
difference between the means increases.
If the mean pulse rate of the sample were, say, 83, the researcher would probably
conclude that this difference was due to chance and would not reject the null hypothesis.
But if the sample mean were, say, 90, then in all likelihood the researcher would con-
clude that the medication increased the pulse rate of the users and would reject the null
hypothesis. The question is, Where does the researcher draw the line? This decision is not
made on feelings or intuition; it is made statistically. That is, the difference must be sig-
niÔ¨Åcant and in all likelihood not due to chance. Here is where the concepts of statistical
test and level of signiÔ¨Åcance are used.
Aclaim, though, can be stated as either the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis;
however, the statistical evidence can only support the claim if it is the alternative hypothe-
sis. Statistical evidence can be used to reject the claim if the claim is the null hypothesis.
These facts are important when you are stating the conclusion of a statistical study.
Table 8‚Äì1 shows some common phrases that are used in hypotheses and conjectures,
and the corresponding symbols. This table should be helpful in translating verbal con-
jectures into mathematical symbols.

A statistical test uses the data obtained from a sample to make a decision about
whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
The numerical value obtained from a statistical test is called the test value.
In this type of statistical test, the mean is computed for the data obtained from the
sample and is compared with the population mean. Then a decision is made to reject or
not reject the null hypothesis on the basis of the value obtained from the statistical test.
If the difference is signiÔ¨Åcant, the null hypothesis is rejected. If it is not, then the null
hypothesis is not rejected.
In the hypothesis-testing situation, there are four possible outcomes. In reality, the
null hypothesis may or may not be true, and a decision is made to reject or not reject it
on the basis of the data obtained from a sample. The four possible outcomes are shown
in Figure 8‚Äì2. Notice that there are two possibilities for a correct decision and two pos-
sibilities for an incorrect decision.

If a null hypothesis is true and it is rejected, then a type I error is made. In situation
A, for instance, the medication might not signiÔ¨Åcantly change the pulse rate of all the users
in the population; but it might change the rate, by chance, of the subjects in the sample. In
this case, the researcher will reject the null hypothesis when it is really true, thus commit-
ting a type I error.
On the other hand, the medication might not change the pulse rate of the subjects in the
sample, but when it is given to the general population, it might cause a signiÔ¨Åcant increase
or decrease in the pulse rate of users. The researcher, on the basis of the data obtained from
the sample, will not reject the null hypothesis, thus committing a type II error.
In situation B, the additive might not signiÔ¨Åcantly increase the lifetimes of automobile
batteries in the population, but it might increase the lifetimes of the batteries in the sample.
In this case, the null hypothesis would be rejected when it was really true. This would be
a type I error. On the other hand, the additive might not work on the batteries selected for
the sample, but if it were to be used in the general population of batteries, it might signif-
icantly increase their lifetimes. The researcher, on the basis of information obtained from
the sample, would not reject the null hypothesis, thus committing a type II error.
A type I error occurs if you reject the null hypothesis when it is true.
A type II error occurs if you do not reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
The hypothesis-testing situation can be likened to a jury trial. In a jury trial, there are
four possible outcomes. The defendant is either guilty or innocent, and he or she will be
convicted or acquitted. See Figure 8‚Äì3.
Now the hypotheses are
H0: The defendant is innocent
H1: The defendant is not innocent (i.e., guilty)
Next, the evidence is presented in court by the prosecutor, and based on this evi-
dence, the jury decides the verdict, innocent or guilty.
If the defendant is convicted but he or she did not commit the crime, then a type I
error has been committed. See block 1 of Figure 8‚Äì3. On the other hand, if the defendant
is convicted and he or she has committed the crime, then a correct decision has been
made. See block 2.
If the defendant is acquitted and he or she did not commit the crime, a correct deci-
sion has been made by the jury. See block 3. However, if the defendant is acquitted and
he or she did commit the crime, then a type II error has been made. See block 4.

The decision of the jury does not prove that the defendant did or did not commit the
crime. The decision is based on the evidence presented. If the evidence is strong enough,
the defendant will be convicted in most cases. If the evidence is weak, the defendant will
be acquitted in most cases. Nothing is proved absolutely. Likewise, the decision to reject
or not reject the null hypothesis does not prove anything. The only way to prove anything
statistically is to use the entire population, which, in most cases, is not possible. The
decision, then, is made on the basis of probabilities. That is, when there is a large differ-
ence between the mean obtained from the sample and the hypothesized mean, the null
hypothesis is probably not true. The question is, How large a difference is necessary to
reject the null hypothesis? Here is where the level of signiÔ¨Åcance is used.
The level of signiÔ¨Åcance is the maximum probability of committing a type I error. This
probability is symbolized by a (Greek letter alpha). That is, P(type I error)  a.
The probability of a type II error is symbolized by b, the Greek letter beta. That is,
P(type II error)  b. In most hypothesis-testing situations, b cannot be easily computed;
however, a and b are related in that decreasing one increases the other.
Statisticians generally agree on using three arbitrary signiÔ¨Åcance levels: the 0.10,
0.05, and 0.01 levels. That is, if the null hypothesis is rejected, the probability of a type I
error will be 10%, 5%, or 1%, depending on which level of signiÔ¨Åcance is used. Here is
another way of putting it: When a  0.10, there is a 10% chance of rejecting a true null
hypothesis; when a  0.05, there is a 5% chance of rejecting a true null hypothesis; and
when a  0.01, there is a 1% chance of rejecting a true null hypothesis.
In a hypothesis-testing situation, the researcher decides what level of signiÔ¨Åcance to
use. It does not have to be the 0.10, 0.05, or 0.01 level. It can be any level, depending on
the seriousness of the type I error. After a signiÔ¨Åcance level is chosen, a critical value is
selected from a table for the appropriate test. If a z test is used, for example, the z table
(Table E in Appendix C) is consulted to Ô¨Ånd the critical value. The critical value deter-
mines the critical and noncritical regions.
The critical value separates the critical region from the noncritical region. The symbol
for critical value is C.V.
The critical or rejection region is the range of values of the test value that indicates
that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference and that the null hypothesis should be rejected.
The noncritical or nonrejection region is the range of values of the test value that
indicates that the difference was probably due to chance and that the null hypothesis
should not be rejected.
The critical value can be on the right side of the mean or on the left side of the mean
for a one-tailed test. Its location depends on the inequality sign of the alternative hypoth-
esis. For example, in situation B, where the chemist is interested in increasing the aver-
age lifetime of automobile batteries, the alternative hypothesis is H1: m  36. Since the
inequality sign is , the null hypothesis will be rejected only when the sample mean is
signiÔ¨Åcantly greater than 36. Hence, the critical value must be on the right side of the
mean. Therefore, this test is called a right-tailed test.
A one-tailed test indicates that the null hypothesis should be rejected when the test
value is in the critical region on one side of the mean. A one-tailed test is either a right-
tailed test or left-tailed test, depending on the direction of the inequality of the
alternative hypothesis.

Unusual Stats
Of workers in the
United States, 64%
drive to work alone
and 6% of workers
walk to work.

To obtain the critical value, the researcher must choose an alpha level. In situation B,
suppose the researcher chose a  0.01. Then the researcher must Ô¨Ånd a z value such that
1% of the area falls to the right of the z value and 99% falls to the left of the z value, as
shown in Figure 8‚Äì4(a).
Next, the researcher must Ô¨Ånd the area value in Table E closest to 0.9900. The critical
z value is 2.33, since that value gives the area closest to 0.9900 (that is, 0.9901), as shown
in Figure 8‚Äì4(b).
The critical and noncritical regions and the critical value are shown in Figure 8‚Äì5.

Now, move on to situation C, where the contractor is interested in lowering the heating
bills. The alternative hypothesis is H1: m  $78. Hence, the critical value falls to the left
of the mean. This test is thus a left-tailed test. At a  0.01, the critical value is 2.33,
since 0.0099 is the closest value to 0.01. This is shown in Figure 8‚Äì6.
When a researcher conducts a two-tailed test, as in situation A, the null hypothesis
can be rejected when there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in either direction, above or below
the mean.

In a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis should be rejected when the test value is in
either of the two critical regions.
For a two-tailed test, then, the critical region must be split into two equal parts. If
a  0.01, then one-half of the area, or 0.005, must be to the right of the mean and one-
half must be to the left of the mean, as shown in Figure 8‚Äì7.
In this case, the z value on the left side is found by looking up the z value corre-
sponding to an area of 0.0050. The z value falls about halfway between 2.57 and 2.58
corresponding to the areas 0.0049 and 0.0051. The average of 2.57 and 2.58 is
[(2.57)  (2.58)]  2  2.575 so if the z value is needed to three decimal places,
2.575 is used; however, if the z value is rounded to two decimal places, 2.58 is used.
On the right side, it is necessary to Ô¨Ånd the z value corresponding to 0.99  0.005,
or 0.9950. Again, the value falls between 0.9949 and 0.9951, so 2.575 or 2.58 can be
used. See Figure 8‚Äì7.

Finding the Critical Values for SpeciÔ¨Åc A Values, Using Table E
Step 1
Draw the Ô¨Ågure and indicate the appropriate area.
a. If the test is left-tailed, the critical region, with an area equal to a, will be on the
left side of the mean.
b. If the test is right-tailed, the critical region, with an area equal to a, will be on
the right side of the mean.
c. If the test is two-tailed, a must be divided by 2; one-half of the area will be to
the right of the mean, and one-half will be to the left of the mean.
Step 2
a. For a left-tailed test, use the z value that corresponds to the area equivalent to a
in Table E.
b. For a right-tailed test, use the z value that corresponds to the area equivalent to
1  a.
c. For a two-tailed test, use the z value that corresponds to a2 for the left value. It
will be negative. For the right value, use the z value that corresponds to the area
equivalent to 1  a2. It will be positive.

Solution a
Step 1
Draw the Ô¨Ågure and indicate the appropriate area. Since this is a left-tailed
test, the area of 0.10 is located in the left tail, as shown in Figure 8‚Äì10.
Step 2
Find the area closest to 0.1000 in Table E. In this case, it is 0.1003. Find the
z value that corresponds to the area 0.1003. It is 1.28. See Figure 8‚Äì10.

The two z values corresponding to 0.9949 and 0.9951 are 2.57 and 2.58. Since
0.9500 is halfway between these two values, Ô¨Ånd the average of the two values
(2.57  2.58)  2  2.575. However, 2.58 is most often used. See Figure 8‚Äì12.
In hypothesis testing, the following steps are recommended.
1. State the hypotheses. Be sure to state both the null and the alternative hypotheses.
2. Design the study. This step includes selecting the correct statistical test, choosing a
level of signiÔ¨Åcance, and formulating a plan to carry out the study. The plan should
include information such as the deÔ¨Ånition of the population, the way the sample will
be selected, and the methods that will be used to collect the data.
3. Conduct the study and collect the data.
4. Evaluate the data. The data should be tabulated in this step, and the statistical test
should be conducted. Finally, decide whether to reject or not reject the null
hypothesis.
5. Summarize the results.
For the purposes of this chapter, a simpliÔ¨Åed version of the hypothesis-testing pro-
cedure will be used, since designing the study and collecting the data will be omitted. The
steps are summarized in the Procedure Table.

Eggs and Your Health
The Incredible Edible Egg company recently found that eating eggs does not increase a
person‚Äôs blood serum cholesterol. Five hundred subjects participated in a study that lasted for
2 years. The participants were randomly assigned to either a no-egg group or a moderate-egg
group. The blood serum cholesterol levels were checked at the beginning and at the end of the
study. Overall, the groups‚Äô levels were not signiÔ¨Åcantly different. The company reminds us that
eating eggs is healthy if done in moderation. Many of the previous studies relating eggs and
high blood serum cholesterol jumped to improper conclusions.

z Test for a Mean
Objective 
Test means when s is
known, using the
z test.
5
In this chapter, two statistical tests will be explained: the z test is used when s is known,
and the t test is used when s is unknown. This section explains the z test, and Section 8‚Äì3
explains the t test.
Many hypotheses are tested using a statistical test based on the following general
formula:
The observed value is the statistic (such as the sample mean) that is computed from the
sample data. The expected value is the parameter (such as the population mean) that you
would expect to obtain if the null hypothesis were true‚Äîin other words, the hypothesized
value. The denominator is the standard error of the statistic being tested (in this case, the
standard error of the mean).
The z test is deÔ¨Åned formally as follows.
The z test is a statistical test for the mean of a population. It can be used when n 
 30,
or when the population is normally distributed and s is known.
The formula for the z test is
where
 sample mean
m  hypothesized population mean
s  population standard deviation
n  sample size
For the z test, the observed value is the value of the sample mean. The expected value
is the value of the population mean, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The denom-
inator s
is the standard error of the mean.
The formula for the z test is the same formula shown in Chapter 6 for the situation
where you are using a distribution of sample means. Recall that the central limit theorem
allows you to use the standard normal distribution to approximate the distribution of sam-
ple means when n 
 30.
Note: Your Ô¨Årst encounter with hypothesis testing can be somewhat challenging and
confusing, since there are many new concepts being introduced at the same time. To
understand all the concepts, you must carefully follow each step in the examples and try
each exercise that is assigned. Only after careful study and patience will these concepts
become clear.

Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Find the critical value(s).

Example 8‚Äì3
Days on Dealers‚Äô Lots
A researcher wishes to see if the mean number of days that a basic, low-price, small
automobile sits on a dealer‚Äôs lot is 29. A sample of 30 automobile dealers has a mean
of 30.1 days for basic, low-price, small automobiles. At a  0.05, test the claim that
the mean time is greater than 29 days. The standard deviation of the population is
3.8 days.
Source: Based on information from Power Information Network.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: m  29
and
H1: m  29 (claim)
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since a  0.05 and the test is a right-tailed test, the
critical value is z  1.65.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since the test value, 1.59, is less than the critical value,
1.65, and is not in the critical region, the decision is to not reject the null
hypothesis. This test is summarized in Figure 8‚Äì13.

Speaking of 
Statistics
This study found that people who used
pedometers reported having increased
energy, mood improvement, and weight
loss. State possible null and alternative
hypotheses for the study. What would be
a likely population? What is the sample
size? Comment on the sample size.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Example 8‚Äì3 illustrates these Ô¨Åve steps.

Comment: Even though in Example 8‚Äì3 the sample mean of 30.1 is higher than the
hypothesized population mean of 29, it is not signiÔ¨Åcantly higher. Hence, the difference
may be due to chance. When the null hypothesis is not rejected, there is still a probabil-
ity of a type II error, i.e., of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
The probability of a type II error is not easily ascertained. Further explanation about
the type II error is given in Section 8‚Äì6. For now, it is only necessary to realize that the
probability of type II error exists when the decision is not to reject the null hypothesis.
Also note that when the null hypothesis is not rejected, it cannot be accepted as true.
There is merely not enough evidence to say that it is false. This guideline may sound a
little confusing, but the situation is analogous to a jury trial. The verdict is either guilty
or not guilty and is based on the evidence presented. If a person is judged not guilty, it
does not mean that the person is proved innocent; it only means that there was not enough
evidence to reach the guilty verdict.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim
H0: m  $80
and
H1: m  $80 (claim)
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since a  0.10 and the test is a left-tailed test, the
critical value is 1.28.
Step 3
Compute the test value. Since the exercise gives raw data, it is necessary to Ô¨Ånd
the mean of the data. Using the formulas in Chapter 3 or your calculator gives
 75.0 and s  19.2. Substitute in the formula
z   X  m

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim
that the mean time is greater than 29 days.

Comment: In Example 8‚Äì4, the difference is said to be signiÔ¨Åcant. However, when
the null hypothesis is rejected, there is always a chance of a type I error. In this case, the
probability of a type I error is at most 0.10, or 10%.

Cost of Rehabilitation
The Medical Rehabilitation Education Foundation reports that the average cost of
rehabilitation for stroke victims is $24,672. To see if the average cost of rehabilitation
is different at a particular hospital, a researcher selects a random sample of 35 stroke
victims at the hospital and Ô¨Ånds that the average cost of their rehabilitation is $26,343.
The standard deviation of the population is $3251. At a  0.01, can it be concluded that
the average cost of stroke rehabilitation at a particular hospital is different from $24,672?

Outcomes of a
Hypothesis-Testing
Situation for Two
SpeciÔ¨Åc Cases
First, the claim can be either the null or alternative hypothesis, and one should iden-
tify which it is. Second, after the study is completed, the null hypothesis is either rejected
or not rejected. From these two facts, the decision can be identiÔ¨Åed in the appropriate
block of Figure 8‚Äì16.
For example, suppose a researcher claims that the mean weight of an adult animal
of a particular species is 42 pounds. In this case, the claim would be the null hypothesis,
H0: m  42, since the researcher is asserting that the parameter is a speciÔ¨Åc value. If the
null hypothesis is rejected, the conclusion would be that there is enough evidence to reject
the claim that the mean weight of the adult animal is 42 pounds. See Figure 8‚Äì17(a).
On the other hand, suppose the researcher claims that the mean weight of the adult
animals is not 42 pounds. The claim would be the alternative hypothesis H1: m  42.
Furthermore, suppose that the null hypothesis is not rejected. The conclusion, then,
would be that there is not enough evidence to support the claim that the mean weight of
the adult animals is not 42 pounds. See Figure 8‚Äì17(b).

Chapter 8 Hypothesis Testing
8‚Äì20
Again, remember that nothing is being proved true or false. The statistician is only
stating that there is or is not enough evidence to say that a claim is probably true or false.
As noted previously, the only way to prove something would be to use the entire
population under study, and usually this cannot be done, especially when the population
is large.
P-Value Method for Hypothesis Testing
Statisticians usually test hypotheses at the common a levels of 0.05 or 0.01 and some-
times at 0.10. Recall that the choice of the level depends on the seriousness of the
type I error. Besides listing an a value, many computer statistical packages give a
P-value for hypothesis tests.
The P-value (or probability value) is the probability of getting a sample statistic (such as
the mean) or a more extreme sample statistic in the direction of the alternative hypothesis
when the null hypothesis is true.
In other words, the P-value is the actual area under the standard normal distribution curve
(or other curve, depending on what statistical test is being used) representing the proba-
bility of a particular sample statistic or a more extreme sample statistic occurring if the
null hypothesis is true.
For example, suppose that an alternative hypothesis is H1: m  50 and the mean of
a sample is 
 52. If the computer printed a P-value of 0.0356 for a statistical test,
then the probability of getting a sample mean of 52 or greater is 0.0356 if the true
population mean is 50 (for the given sample size and standard deviation). The rela-
tionship between the P-value and the a value can be explained in this manner. For
P  0.0356, the null hypothesis would be rejected at a  0.05 but not at a  0.01. See
Figure 8‚Äì18.
When the hypothesis test is two-tailed, the area in one tail must be doubled. For
a two-tailed test, if a is 0.05 and the area in one tail is 0.0356, the P-value will be
2(0.0356)  0.0712. That is, the null hypothesis should not be rejected at a  0.05, since
0.0712 is greater than 0.05. In summary, then, if the P-value is less than a, reject the null
hypothesis. If the P-value is greater than a, do not reject the null hypothesis.
The P-values for the z test can be found by using Table E in Appendix C. First Ô¨Ånd
the area under the standard normal distribution curve corresponding to the z test value.
For a left-tailed test, use the area given in the table; for a right-tailed test, use 1.0000
minus the area given in the table. To get the P-value for a two-tailed test, double the area
you found in the tail. This procedure is shown in step 3 of Examples 8‚Äì6 and 8‚Äì7.
The P-value method for testing hypotheses differs from the traditional method some-
what. The steps for the P-value method are summarized next.

Cost of College Tuition
A researcher wishes to test the claim that the average cost of tuition and fees at a four-
year public college is greater than $5700. She selects a random sample of 36 four-year
public colleges and Ô¨Ånds the mean to be $5950. The population standard deviation is
$659. Is there evidence to support the claim at a  0.05? Use the P-value method.
Source: Based on information from the College Board.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim. H0: m  $5700 and H1: m  $5700
(claim).
Step 2
Compute the test value.
Step 3
Find the P-value. Using Table E in Appendix C, Ô¨Ånd the corresponding area
under the normal distribution for z  2.28. It is 0.9887. Subtract this value for
the area from 1.0000 to Ô¨Ånd the area in the right tail.
1.0000  0.9887  0.0113
Hence the P-value is 0.0113.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since the P-value is less than 0.05, the decision is to reject
the null hypothesis. See Figure 8‚Äì19.

Wind Speed
A researcher claims that the average wind speed in a certain city is 8 miles per hour.
A sample of 32 days has an average wind speed of 8.2 miles per hour. The standard
deviation of the population is 0.6 mile per hour. At a  0.05, is there enough evidence
to reject the claim? Use the P-value method.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: m  8 (claim)

H1: m  8
Step 2
Compute the test value.
Step 3
Find the P-value. Using Table E, Ô¨Ånd the corresponding area for z  1.89. It
is 0.9706. Subtract the value from 1.0000.
1.0000  0.9706  0.0294
Since this is a two-tailed test, the area of 0.0294 must be doubled to get the
P-value.
2(0.0294)  0.0588
Step 4
Make the decision. The decision is to not reject the null hypothesis, since the
P-value is greater than 0.05. See Figure 8‚Äì20.

P-Values and A Values
for Example 8‚Äì7
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the claim that
the average wind speed is 8 miles per hour.
In Examples 8‚Äì6 and 8‚Äì7, the P-value and the a value were shown on a normal dis-
tribution curve to illustrate the relationship between the two values; however, it is not
necessary to draw the normal distribution curve to make the decision whether to reject
the null hypothesis. You can use the following rule:
Decision Rule When Using a P-Value
If P-value  a, reject the null hypothesis.
If P-value  a, do not reject the null hypothesis.
In Example 8‚Äì6, P-value  0.0113 and a  0.05. Since P-value  a, the null hypoth-
esis was rejected. In Example 8‚Äì7, P-value  0.0588 and a  0.05. Since P-value  a,
the null hypothesis was not rejected.

The P-values given on calculators and computers are slightly different from those
found with Table E. This is so because z values and the values in Table E have been
rounded. Also, most calculators and computers give the exact P-value for two-tailed tests,
so it should not be doubled (as it should when the area found in Table E is used).
A clear distinction between the a value and the P-value should be made. The a value
is chosen by the researcher before the statistical test is conducted. The P-value is com-
puted after the sample mean has been found.
There are two schools of thought on P-values. Some researchers do not choose an a
value but report the P-value and allow the reader to decide whether the null hypothesis
should be rejected.
In this case, the following guidelines can be used, but be advised that these guide-
lines are not written in stone, and some statisticians may have other opinions.
Section 8‚Äì2 z Test for a Mean
421
8‚Äì23
Guidelines for P-Values
If P-value  0.01, reject the null hypothesis. The difference is highly signiÔ¨Åcant.
If P-value  0.01 but P-value  0.05, reject the null hypothesis. The difference is signiÔ¨Åcant.
If P-value  0.05 but P-value  0.10, consider the consequences of type I error before
rejecting the null hypothesis.
If P-value  0.10, do not reject the null hypothesis. The difference is not signiÔ¨Åcant.
Others decide on the a value in advance and use the P-value to make the decision, as
shown in Examples 8‚Äì6 and 8‚Äì7. A note of caution is needed here: If a researcher selects
a  0.01 and the P-value is 0.03, the researcher may decide to change the a value from
0.01 to 0.05 so that the null hypothesis will be rejected. This, of course, should not be
done. If the a level is selected in advance, it should be used in making the decision.
One additional note on hypothesis testing is that the researcher should distinguish
between statistical signiÔ¨Åcance and practical signiÔ¨Åcance. When the null hypothesis is
rejected at a speciÔ¨Åc signiÔ¨Åcance level, it can be concluded that the difference is probably
not due to chance and thus is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. However, the results may not have any
practical signiÔ¨Åcance. For example, suppose that a new fuel additive increases the miles per
gallon that a car can get by mile for a sample of 1000 automobiles. The results may be
statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 0.05 level, but it would hardly be worthwhile to market the
product for such a small increase. Hence, there is no practical signiÔ¨Åcance to the results. It
is up to the researcher to use common sense when interpreting the results of a statistical test.
Applying the Concepts 8‚Äì2
Car Thefts
You recently received a job with a company that manufactures an automobile antitheft device.
To conduct an advertising campaign for the product, you need to make a claim about the
number of automobile thefts per year. Since the population of various cities in the United
States varies, you decide to use rates per 10,000 people. (The rates are based on the number of
people living in the cities.) Your boss said that last year the theft rate per 10,000 people was
44 vehicles. You want to see if it has changed. The following are rates per 10,000 people for
36 randomly selected locations in the United States.

Hypothesis Test for the Mean and the z Distribution
MINITAB can be used to calculate the test statistic and its P-value. The P-value approach does
not require a critical value from the table. If the P-value is smaller than a, the null hypothesis
is rejected. For Example 8‚Äì4, test the claim that the mean shoe cost is less than $80.
1. Enter the data into a column of MINITAB. Do not try to type in the dollar signs! Name the
column ShoeCost.
2. If sigma is known, skip to step 3; otherwise estimate sigma from the sample standard
deviation s.
Calculate the Standard Deviation in the Sample
a) Select Calc>Column Statistics.
b) Check the button for Standard deviation.
c) Select ShoeCost for the Input variable.
d) Type s in the text box for Store the result in:.
e) Click [OK].

3. Select Stat>Basic Statistics>1 Sample Z, then select ShoeCost in the Variable text
box.
4. Click in the text box and enter the value of sigma or type s, the sample standard deviation.
5. Click in the text box for Test mean, and enter the hypothesized value of 80.
6. Click on [Options].
a) Change the ConÔ¨Ådence level to 90.
b) Change the Alternative to less than. This setting is crucial for calculating the P-value.
7. Click [OK] twice.

8‚Äì3
t Test for a Mean
When the population standard deviation is unknown, the z test is not normally used for
testing hypotheses involving means. A different test, called the t test, is used. The distrib-
ution of the variable should be approximately normal.
As stated in Chapter 7, the t distribution is similar to the standard normal distribu-
tion in the following ways.
1. It is bell-shaped.
2. It is symmetric about the mean.
3. The mean, median, and mode are equal to 0 and are located at the center of the
distribution.
4. The curve never touches the x axis.
The t distribution differs from the standard normal distribution in the following ways.
1. The variance is greater than 1.
2. The t distribution is a family of curves based on the degrees of freedom, which is a
number related to sample size. (Recall that the symbol for degrees of freedom is
d.f. See Section 7‚Äì2 for an explanation of degrees of freedom.)
3. As the sample size increases, the t distribution approaches the normal distribution.
The t test is deÔ¨Åned next.
The t test is a statistical test for the mean of a population and is used when the
population is normally or approximately normally distributed, and s is unknown.
The formula for the t test is
The degrees of freedom are d.f.  n  1.
The formula for the t test is similar to the formula for the z test. But since the popu-
lation standard deviation s is unknown, the sample standard deviation s is used instead.
The critical values for the t test are given in Table F in Appendix C. For a one-tailed
test, Ô¨Ånd the a level by looking at the top row of the table and Ô¨Ånding the appropriate
column. Find the degrees of freedom by looking down the left-hand column. 
Notice that the degrees of freedom are given for values from 1 through 30, then at
intervals above 30. When the degrees of freedom are above 30, some textbooks will tell
you to use the nearest table value; however, in this textbook, you should always round

Solution
Find the 0.01 column in the row labeled One tail, and Ô¨Ånd 22 in the left column. The
critical value is 2.508 since the test is a one-tailed left test.
Example 8‚Äì10

Solution
Find the 0.10 column in the row labeled Two tails, and Ô¨Ånd 18 in the column labeled d.f.

1.701.
Example 8‚Äì8

Solution
Find the 0.05 column in the top row and 16 in the left-hand column. Where the row and
column meet, the appropriate critical value is found; it is 1.746. See Figure 8‚Äì21.
down to the nearest table value. For example, if d.f.  59, use d.f.  55 to Ô¨Ånd the crit-
ical value or values. This is a conservative approach.
As the degrees of freedom get larger, the critical values approach the z values. Hence
the bottom values (large sample size) are the same as the z values that were used in the
last section.

When you test hypotheses by using the t test (traditional method), follow the same
procedure as for the z test, except use Table F.
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Find the critical value(s) from Table F.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Remember that the t test should be used when the population is approximately normally
distributed and the population standard deviation is unknown.

There is not enough evidence to support the educator‚Äôs claim that the average
salary of substitute teachers in Allegheny County is less than $60 per day.
The P-values for the t test can be found by using Table F; however, speciÔ¨Åc P-values
for t tests cannot be obtained from the table since only selected values of a (for example,
0.01, 0.05) are given. To Ô¨Ånd speciÔ¨Åc P-values for t tests, you would need a table simi-
lar to Table E for each degree of freedom. Since this is not practical, only intervals can
be found for P-values. Examples 8‚Äì14 to 8‚Äì16 show how to use Table F to determine
intervals for P-values for the t test.
Example 8‚Äì14
Find the P-value when the t test value is 2.056, the sample size is 11, and the test is
right-tailed.
Solution
To get the P-value, look across the row with 10 degrees of freedom (d.f.  n  1) in
Table F and Ô¨Ånd the two values that 2.056 falls between. They are 1.812 and 2.228. Since
this is a right-tailed test, look up to the row labeled One tail, a and Ô¨Ånd the two a values
corresponding to 1.812 and 2.228. They are 0.05 and 0.025, respectively. See Figure 8‚Äì24.

Finding the P-Value for
Example 8‚Äì14
Example 8‚Äì15
Find the P-value when the t test value is 2.983, the sample size is 6, and the test is
two-tailed.
Solution
To get the P-value, look across the row with d.f.  5 and Ô¨Ånd the two values that 2.983
falls between. They are 2.571 and 3.365. Then look up to the row labeled Two tails,
a to Ô¨Ånd the corresponding a values.
In this case, they are 0.05 and 0.02. Hence the P-value is contained in the interval
0.02  P-value  0.05. This means that the P-value is between 0.02 and 0.05. In this case,
if a  0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected since P-value  0.05; but if a  0.01, the
null hypothesis cannot be rejected since P-value  0.01 (actually P-value  0.02).
Note: Since many of you will be using calculators or computer programs that
give the speciÔ¨Åc P-value for the t test and other tests presented later in this textbook,
these speciÔ¨Åc values, in addition to the intervals, will be given for the answers to the
examples and exercises.
The P-value obtained from a calculator for Example 8‚Äì14 is 0.033. The P-value
obtained from a calculator for Example 8‚Äì15 is 0.031.
Hence, the P-value would be contained in the interval 0.025  P-value  0.05. This
means that the P-value is between 0.025 and 0.05. If a were 0.05, you would reject
the null hypothesis since the P-value is less than 0.05. But if a were 0.01, you would
not reject the null hypothesis since the P-value is greater than 0.01. (Actually, it is greater
than 0.025.)

To test hypotheses using the P-value method, follow the same steps as explained in
Section 8‚Äì2. These steps are repeated here.
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Compute the test value.
Step 3
Find the P-value.
Step 4

Jogger‚Äôs Oxygen Uptake
A physician claims that joggers‚Äô maximal volume oxygen uptake is greater than the
average of all adults. A sample of 15 joggers has a mean of 40.6 milliliters per kilogram
(ml/kg) and a standard deviation of 6 ml/kg. If the average of all adults is 36.7 ml/kg, is
there enough evidence to support the physician‚Äôs claim at a  0.05?
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: m  36.7
and
H1: m  36.7 (claim)
Step 2
Compute the test value. The test value is
Step 3
Find the P-value. Looking across the row with d.f.  14 in Table F, you
see that 2.517 falls between 2.145 and 2.624, corresponding to a  0.025
and a  0.01 since this is a right-tailed test. Hence, P-value  0.01 and
P-value  0.025, or 0.01  P-value  0.025. That is, the P-value is
somewhere between 0.01 and 0.025. (The P-value obtained from a calculator
is 0.012.)
Step 4
Reject the null hypothesis since P-value  0.05 (that is, P-value  a).
Step 5
There is enough evidence to support the claim that the joggers‚Äô maximal
volume oxygen uptake is greater than 36.7 ml/kg.
Students sometimes have difÔ¨Åculty deciding whether to use the z test or t test. The
rules are the same as those pertaining to conÔ¨Ådence intervals.
1. If s is known, use the z test. The variable must be normally distributed if 
n  30.
2. If s is unknown but n 
 30, use the t test.
3. If s is unknown and n  30, use the t test. (The population must be approximately
normally distributed.)
These rules are summarized in Figure 8‚Äì25.

A tobacco company claims that its best-selling cigarettes contain at most 40 mg of nicotine.
This claim is tested at the 1% signiÔ¨Åcance level by using the results of 15 randomly selected
cigarettes. The mean is 42.6 mg and the standard deviation is 3.7 mg. Evidence suggests that
nicotine is normally distributed. Information from a computer output of the hypothesis test is

Statistics
Can Sunshine Relieve Pain?
A study conducted at the University of
Pittsburgh showed that hospital patients in
rooms with lots of sunlight required less
pain medication the day after surgery and
during their total stay in the hospital than
patients who were in darker rooms.
Patients in the sunny rooms
averaged 3.2 milligrams of pain reliever
per hour for their total stay as opposed to
4.1 milligrams per hour for those in darker
rooms. This study compared two groups
of patients. Although no statistical tests
were mentioned in the article, what
statistical test do you think the researchers
used to compare the groups?

z Test for a Proportion
Many hypothesis-testing situations involve proportions. Recall from Chapter 7 that a
proportion is the same as a percentage of the population.
These data were obtained from The Book of Odds by Michael D. Shook and Robert
L. Shook (New York: Penguin Putnam, Inc.):
‚Ä¢ 59% of consumers purchase gifts for their fathers.
‚Ä¢ 85% of people over 21 said they have entered a sweepstakes.
‚Ä¢ 51% of Americans buy generic products.
‚Ä¢ 35% of Americans go out for dinner once a week.
A hypothesis test involving a population proportion can be considered as a binomial
experiment when there are only two outcomes and the probability of a success does not
change from trial to trial. Recall from Section 5‚Äì3 that the mean is m  np and the stan-
dard deviation is s 
for the binomial distribution.
Since a normal distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution
when np 
 5 and nq 
 5, the standard normal distribution can be used to test hypothe-
ses for proportions.

The formula is derived from the normal approximation to the binomial and follows

esized population proportion), and 
is the standard error.
The formula

Applying the Concepts 8‚Äì4
Quitting Smoking
Assume you are part of a research team that compares products designed to help people quit
smoking. Condor Consumer Products Company would like more speciÔ¨Åc details about the
study to be made available to the scientiÔ¨Åc community. Review the following and then answer
the questions about how you would have conducted the study.
New StopSmoke
No method has been proved more effective.
StopSmoke provides signiÔ¨Åcant advantages
over all other methods. StopSmoke is simpler
to use, and it requires no weaning. StopSmoke
is also signiÔ¨Åcantly less expensive than the
leading brands. StopSmoke‚Äôs superiority has
been proved in two independent studies.

X2 Test for a Variance or Standard Deviation
In Chapter 7, the chi-square distribution was used to construct a conÔ¨Ådence interval for
a single variance or standard deviation. This distribution is also used to test a claim about
a single variance or standard deviation.
To Ô¨Ånd the area under the chi-square distribution, use Table G in Appendix C. There
are three cases to consider:
1. Finding the chi-square critical value for a speciÔ¨Åc a when the hypothesis test is
right-tailed.
2. Finding the chi-square critical value for a speciÔ¨Åc a when the hypothesis test is 
left-tailed.
3. Finding the chi-square critical values for a speciÔ¨Åc a when the hypothesis test is
two-tailed.
Objective 
Test variances or
standard deviations,
using the chi-square
test.

Example 8‚Äì21

Example 8‚Äì22
Find the critical chi-square value for 10 degrees of freedom when a  0.05 and the test
is left-tailed.
Solution
This distribution is shown in Figure 8‚Äì32.
When the test is left-tailed, the a value must be subtracted from 1, that is, 
1  0.05  0.95. The left side of the table is used, because the chi-square table gives
the area to the right of the critical value, and the chi-square statistic cannot be negative.
The table is set up so that it gives the values for the area to the right of the critical value.
In this case, 95% of the area will be to the right of the value.
For 0.95 and 10 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 3.940. See Figure 8‚Äì33.
Find the a value at the top of Table G, and Ô¨Ånd the corresponding degrees of freedom in
the left column. The critical value is located where the two columns meet‚Äîin this case,
24.996. See Figure 8‚Äì31.

Example 8‚Äì23
Find the critical chi-square values for 22 degrees of freedom when a  0.05 and a two-
tailed test is conducted.
Solution
When a two-tailed test is conducted, the area must be split, as shown in Figure 8‚Äì34.
Note that the area to the right of the larger value is 0.025 (0.052 or a2), and the area
to the right of the smaller value is 0.975 (1.00  0.052 or 1  a2).
Remember that chi-square values cannot be negative. Hence, you must use a values
in the table of 0.025 and 0.975. With 22 degrees of freedom, the critical values are
36.781 and 10.982, respectively.
After the degrees of freedom reach 30, Table G gives values only for multiples of 10
(40, 50, 60, etc.). When the exact degrees of freedom sought are not speciÔ¨Åed in the table,
the closest smaller value should be used. For example, if the given degrees of freedom
are 36, use the table value for 30 degrees of freedom. This guideline keeps the type I error
equal to or below the a value.
When you are testing a claim about a single variance using the chi-square test, there
are three possible test situations: right-tailed test, left-tailed test, and two-tailed test.
If a researcher believes the variance of a population to be greater than some speciÔ¨Åc
value, say, 225, then the researcher states the hypotheses as
H0: s2  225
and
H1: s2  225
and conducts a right-tailed test.
If the researcher believes the variance of a population to be less than 225, then the
researcher states the hypotheses as
H0: s2  225
and
H1: s2  225
and conducts a left-tailed test.
Finally, if a researcher does not wish to specify a direction, she or he states the
hypotheses as
H0: s2  225
and
H1: s2  225
and conducts a two-tailed test.

You might ask, Why is it important to test variances? There are several reasons. First,
in any situation where consistency is required, such as in manufacturing, you would like
to have the smallest variation possible in the products. For example, when bolts are man-
ufactured, the variation in diameters due to the process must be kept to a minimum, or
the nuts will not Ô¨Åt them properly. In education, consistency is required on a test. That is,
if the same students take the same test several times, they should get approximately the
same grades, and the variance of each of the student‚Äôs grades should be small. On the
other hand, if the test is to be used to judge learning, the overall standard deviation of all
the grades should be large so that you can differentiate those who have learned the sub-
ject from those who have not learned it.
Three assumptions are made for the chi-square test, as outlined here.
448
Chapter 8 Hypothesis Testing
8‚Äì50
Assumptions for the Chi-Square Test for a Single Variance
1. The sample must be randomly selected from the population.
2. The population must be normally distributed for the variable under study.
3. The observations must be independent of one another.
The traditional method for hypothesis testing follows the same Ô¨Åve steps listed ear-
lier. They are repeated here.
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Find the critical value(s).
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Examples 8‚Äì24 through 8‚Äì26 illustrate the traditional hypothesis-testing procedure
for variances.
Example 8‚Äì24
Variation of Test Scores
An instructor wishes to see whether the variation in scores of the 23 students in her
class is less than the variance of the population. The variance of the class is 198. Is
there enough evidence to support the claim that the variation of the students is less than
the population variance (s2  225) at a  0.05? Assume that the scores are normally
distributed.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: s2  225
and
H1: s2  225 (claim)
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since this test is left-tailed and a  0.05, use the value
1  0.05  0.95. The degrees of freedom are n  1  23  1  22. Hence,
the critical value is 12.338. Note that the critical region is on the left, as
shown in Figure 8‚Äì35.
Unusual Stat
About 20% of cats
owned in the United
States are overweight.

Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since the test value 19.36 falls in the noncritical region, as
shown in Figure 8‚Äì36, the decision is to not reject the null hypothesis.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: s  8
and
H1: s  8 (claim)
Since the standard deviation is given, it should be squared to get the variance.
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since this test is right-tailed with d.f. of 15  1  14
and a  0.10, the critical value is 21.064.
Step 3
Compute the test value. Since raw data are given, the standard deviation of the
sample must be found by using the formula in Chapter 3 or your calculator. It
is s  11.2.

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to support the claim that the
standard deviation is greater than 8.
Example 8‚Äì26
Nicotine Content of Cigarettes
A cigarette manufacturer wishes to test the claim that the variance of the nicotine content
of its cigarettes is 0.644. Nicotine content is measured in milligrams, and assume that it
is normally distributed. A sample of 20 cigarettes has a standard deviation of 1.00 mil-
ligram. At a  0.05, is there enough evidence to reject the manufacturer‚Äôs claim?
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: s2  0.644 (claim)
and
H1: s2  0.644
Step 2
Find the critical values. Since this test is a two-tailed test at a  0.05, the
critical values for 0.025 and 0.975 must be found. The degrees of freedom are
19; hence, the critical values are 32.852 and 8.907, respectively. The critical
or rejection regions are shown in Figure 8‚Äì38.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Since the standard deviation s is given in the problem, it must be squared for
the formula.
Step 4
Make the decision. Do not reject the null hypothesis, since the test value falls
between the critical values (8.907  29.5  32.852) and in the noncritical
region, as shown in Figure 8‚Äì39.

P-Value Interval for
Example 8‚Äì27
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the
manufacturer‚Äôs claim that the variance of the nicotine content of the cigarettes
is equal to 0.644.
Approximate P-values for the chi-square test can be found by using Table G in
Appendix C. The procedure is somewhat more complicated than the previous procedures
for Ô¨Ånding P-values for the z and t tests since the chi-square distribution is not exactly
symmetric and x2 values cannot be negative. As we did for the t test, we will determine
an interval for the P-value based on the table. Examples 8‚Äì27 through 8‚Äì29 show the
procedure.
Example 8‚Äì27
Find the P-value when x2  19.274, n  8, and the test is right-tailed.
Solution
To get the P-value, look across the row with d.f.  7 in Table G and Ô¨Ånd the two values
that 19.274 falls between. They are 18.475 and 20.278. Look up to the top row and Ô¨Ånd
the a values corresponding to 18.475 and 20.278. They are 0.01 and 0.005, respectively.
See Figure 8‚Äì40. Hence the P-value is contained in the interval 0.005  P-value  0.01.
(The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.007.)

452
Chapter 8 Hypothesis Testing
8‚Äì54
Example 8‚Äì28
Find the P-value when x2  3.823, n  13, and the test is left-tailed.
Solution
To get the P-value, look across the row with d.f.  12 and Ô¨Ånd the two values that 3.823
falls between. They are 3.571 and 4.404. Look up to the top row and Ô¨Ånd the values
corresponding to 3.571 and 4.404. They are 0.99 and 0.975, respectively. When the x2
test value falls on the left side, each of the values must be subtracted from 1 to get the
interval that P-value falls between.
1  0.99  0.01
and
1  0.975  0.025
Hence the P-value falls in the interval
0.01  P-value  0.025
(The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.014.)
When the x2 test is two-tailed, both interval values must be doubled. If a two-tailed
test were being used in Example 8‚Äì28, then the interval would be 2(0.01)  P-value 
2(0.025), or 0.02  P-value  0.05.
The P-value method for hypothesis testing for a variance or standard deviation fol-
lows the same steps shown in the preceding sections.
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Compute the test value.
Step 3
Find the P-value.
Step 4
Make the decision.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Example 8‚Äì29 shows the P-value method for variances or standard deviations.
Example 8‚Äì29
Car Inspection Times
A researcher knows from past studies that the standard deviation of the time it takes
to inspect a car is 16.8 minutes. A sample of 24 cars is selected and inspected. The
standard deviation is 12.5 minutes. At a  0.05, can it be concluded that the standard
deviation has changed? Use the P-value method.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: s  16.8
and
H1: s  16.8 (claim)
Step 2
Compute the test value.
Step 3
Find the P-value. Using Table G with d.f.  23, the value 12.733 falls
between 11.689 and 13.091, corresponding to 0.975 and 0.95, respectively.
Since these values are found on the left side of the distribution, each value
must be subtracted from 1. Hence 1  0.975  0.025 and 1  0.95  0.05.
Since this is a two-tailed test, the area must be doubled to obtain the P-value
interval. Hence 0.05  P-value  0.10, or somewhere between 0.05 and 0.10.
(The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.085.)

the decision is to not reject the null hypothesis since P-value  a.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that
the standard deviation has changed.
Applying the Concepts 8‚Äì5
Testing Gas Mileage Claims
Assume that you are working for the Consumer Protection Agency and have recently been
getting complaints about the highway gas mileage of the new Dodge Caravans. Chrysler
Corporation agrees to allow you to randomly select 40 of its new Dodge Caravans to test the
highway mileage. Chrysler claims that the Caravans get 28 mpg on the highway. Your results
show a mean of 26.7 and a standard deviation of 4.2. You support Chrysler‚Äôs claim.
1. Show why you support Chrysler‚Äôs claim by listing the P-value from your output. After
more complaints, you decide to test the variability of the miles per gallon on the highway.
From further questioning of Chrysler‚Äôs quality control engineers, you Ô¨Ånd they are
claiming a standard deviation of 2.1.
2. Test the claim about the standard deviation.
3. Write a short summary of your results and any necessary action that Chrysler must take to
remedy customer complaints.
4. State your position about the necessity to perform tests of variability along with tests of the
means.

Additional Topics Regarding Hypothesis Testing
In hypothesis testing, there are several other concepts that might be of interest to students
in elementary statistics. These topics include the relationship between hypothesis testing
and conÔ¨Ådence intervals, and some additional information about the type II error.
ConÔ¨Ådence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing
There is a relationship between conÔ¨Ådence intervals and hypothesis testing. When the
null hypothesis is rejected in a hypothesis-testing situation, the conÔ¨Ådence interval for
the mean using the same level of signiÔ¨Åcance will not contain the hypothesized mean.
Likewise, when the null hypothesis is not rejected, the conÔ¨Ådence interval computed
using the same level of signiÔ¨Åcance will contain the hypothesized mean. Examples 8‚Äì30
and 8‚Äì31 show this concept for two-tailed tests.
Objective 
Test hypotheses,

intervals.

Example 8‚Äì30
Sugar Production
Sugar is packed in 5-pound bags. An inspector suspects the bags may not contain
5 pounds. A sample of 50 bags produces a mean of 4.6 pounds and a standard deviation
of 0.7 pound. Is there enough evidence to conclude that the bags do not contain 5 pounds
as stated at a  0.05? Also, Ô¨Ånd the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval of the true mean.

Example 8‚Äì31
Hog Weights
A researcher claims that adult hogs fed a special diet will have an average weight of
200 pounds. A sample of 10 hogs has an average weight of 198.2 pounds and a standard
deviation of 3.3 pounds. At a  0.05, can the claim be rejected? Also, Ô¨Ånd the 95%
conÔ¨Ådence interval of the true mean.
Solution
Now H0: m  200 pounds (claim) and H1: m  200 pounds. The t test must be used
since s is unknown. It is assumed that hog weights are normally distributed. The critical
values at a  0.05 with 9 degrees of freedom are 	2.262 and 2.262. The test value is
Thus, the null hypothesis is not rejected. There is not enough evidence to reject the
claim that the weight of the adult hogs is 200 pounds.
The 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval of the mean is
The 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval does contain the hypothesized mean m  200. Again there
is agreement between the hypothesis test and the conÔ¨Ådence interval.
In summary, then, when the null hypothesis is rejected at a signiÔ¨Åcance level of a,
the conÔ¨Ådence interval computed at the 1  a level will not contain the value of the mean

that is stated in the null hypothesis. On the other hand, when the null hypothesis is not
rejected, the conÔ¨Ådence interval computed at the same signiÔ¨Åcance level will contain the
value of the mean stated in the null hypothesis. These results are true for other hypothesis-
testing situations and are not limited to means tests.
The relationship between conÔ¨Ådence intervals and hypothesis testing presented here
is valid for two-tailed tests. The relationship between one-tailed hypothesis tests and one-
sided or one-tailed conÔ¨Ådence intervals is also valid; however, this technique is beyond
the scope of this textbook.
Type II Error and the Power of a Test
Recall that in hypothesis testing, there are two possibilities: Either the null hypothesis H0
is true, or it is false. Furthermore, on the basis of the statistical test, the null hypothesis
is either rejected or not rejected. These results give rise to four possibilities, as shown in
Figure 8‚Äì41. This Ô¨Ågure is similar to Figure 8‚Äì2. 
As stated previously, there are two types of errors: type I and type II. A type I error
can occur only when the null hypothesis is rejected. By choosing a level of signiÔ¨Åcance,
say, of 0.05 or 0.01, the researcher can determine the probability of committing a type I
error. For example, suppose that the null hypothesis was H0: m  50, and it was rejected.
At the 0.05 level (one tail), the researcher has only a 5% chance of being wrong, i.e., of
rejecting a true null hypothesis.
On the other hand, if the null hypothesis is not rejected, then either it is true or a type II
error has been committed. A type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is indeed false,
but is not rejected. The probability of committing a type II error is denoted as b.
The value of b is not easy to compute. It depends on several things, including the value
of a, the size of the sample, the population standard deviation, and the actual difference
between the hypothesized value of the parameter being tested and the true parameter. The
researcher has control over two of these factors, namely, the selection of a and the size of
the sample. The standard deviation of the population is sometimes known or can be esti-
mated. The major problem, then, lies in knowing the actual difference between the hypoth-
esized parameter and the true parameter. If this difference were known, then the value of
the parameter would be known; and if the parameter were known, then there would be no
need to do any hypothesis testing. Hence, the value of b cannot be computed. But this does
not mean that it should be ignored. What the researcher usually does is to try to minimize
the size of b or to maximize the size of 1  b, which is called the power of a test.
The power of a statistical test measures the sensitivity of the test to detect a real dif-
ference in parameters if one actually exists. The power of a test is a probability and, like
all probabilities, can have values ranging from 0 to 1. The higher the power, the more sen-
sitive the test is to detecting a real difference between parameters if there is a difference.

In other words, the closer the power of a test is to 1, the better the test is for rejecting the
null hypothesis if the null hypothesis is, in fact, false.
The power of a test is equal to 1  b, that is, 1 minus the probability of committing a
type II error. The power of the test is shown in the upper right-hand block of Figure 8‚Äì41. If
somehow it were known that b  0.04, then the power of a test would be 1  0.04  0.96,
or 96%. In this case, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false is 96%.
As stated previously, the power of a test depends on the probability of committing a
type II error, and since b is not easily computed, the power of a test cannot be easily com-
puted. (See the Critical Thinking Challenges on page 468.)
However, there are some guidelines that can be used when you are conducting a sta-
tistical study concerning the power of a test. When you are conducting a statistical study,
use the test that has the highest power for the data. There are times when the researcher
has a choice of two or more statistical tests to test the hypotheses. The tests with the high-
est power should be used. It is important, however, to remember that statistical tests have
assumptions that need to be considered.
If these assumptions cannot be met, then another test with lower power should be
used. The power of a test can be increased by increasing the value of a. For example,
instead of using a  0.01, use a  0.05. Recall that as a increases, b decreases. So if b
is decreased, then 1  b will increase, thus increasing the power of the test.
Another way to increase the power of a test is to select a larger sample size. A larger
sample size would make the standard error of the mean smaller and consequently reduce b.
(The derivation is omitted.)
These two methods should not be used at the whim of the researcher. Before a can
be increased, the researcher must consider the consequences of committing a type I error.
If these consequences are more serious than the consequences of committing a type II
error, then a should not be increased.
Likewise, there are consequences to increasing the sample size. These consequences
might include an increase in the amount of money required to do the study and an
increase in the time needed to tabulate the data. When these consequences result, increas-
ing the sample size may not be practical.
There are several other methods a researcher can use to increase the power of a sta-
tistical test, but these methods are beyond the scope of this book.
One Ô¨Ånal comment is necessary. When the researcher fails to reject the null hypoth-
esis, this does not mean that there is not enough evidence to support alternative hypothe-
ses. It may be that the null hypothesis is false, but the statistical test has too low a power
to detect the real difference; hence, one can conclude only that in this study, there is not
enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
The relationship among a, b, and the power of a test can be analyzed in greater detail
than the explanation given here. However, it is hoped that this explanation will show you
that there is no magic formula or statistical test that can guarantee foolproof results when
a decision is made about the validity of H0. Whether the decision is to reject H0 or not to
reject H0, there is in either case a chance of being wrong. The goal, then, is to try to keep
the probabilities of type I and type II errors as small as possible.

Corporation agrees to allow you to randomly select 40 of its new Dodge Caravans to test the
highway mileage. Chrysler claims that the vans get 28 mpg on the highway. Your results show
a mean of 26.7 and a standard deviation of 4.2. You are not certain if you should create a
conÔ¨Ådence interval or run a hypothesis test. You decide to do both at the same time.
1. Draw a normal curve, labeling the critical values, critical regions, test statistic, and
population mean. List the signiÔ¨Åcance level and the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Draw a conÔ¨Ådence interval directly below the normal distribution, labeling the sample
mean, error, and boundary values.
3. Explain which parts from each approach are the same and which parts are different.
4. Draw a picture of a normal curve and conÔ¨Ådence interval where the sample and
hypothesized means are equal.
5. Draw a picture of a normal curve and conÔ¨Ådence interval where the lower boundary of
the conÔ¨Ådence interval is equal to the hypothesized mean.

Summary
This chapter introduces the basic concepts of hypothesis testing. A statistical hypothesis
is a conjecture about a population. There are two types of statistical hypotheses: the null
and the alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference, and
the alternative hypothesis speciÔ¨Åes a difference. To test the null hypothesis, researchers
use a statistical test. Many test values are computed by using
‚Ä¢ Researchers compute a test value from the sample data to decide whether the null
hypothesis should be rejected. Statistical tests can be one-tailed or two-tailed,
depending on the hypotheses.
The null hypothesis is rejected when the difference between the population para-
meter and the sample statistic is said to be signiÔ¨Åcant. The difference is signiÔ¨Åcant
when the test value falls in the critical region of the distribution. The critical region
is determined by a, the level of signiÔ¨Åcance of the test. The level is the probability of
committing a type I error. This error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected
when it is true. Three generally agreed upon signiÔ¨Åcance levels are 0.10, 0.05, and
0.01. A second kind of error, the type II error, can occur when the null hypothesis is
not rejected when it is false. (8‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ There are two common methods used to test hypotheses; they are the traditional
method and the P-value method. (8‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ All hypothesis-testing situations using the traditional method should include the
following steps:
1. State the null and alternative hypotheses and identify the claim.
2. State an alpha level and Ô¨Ånd the critical value(s).
3. Compute the test value.
4. Make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.
5. Summarize the results.
‚Ä¢ All hypothesis-testing situations using the P-value method should include the
following steps:
1. State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
2. Compute the test value.
3. Find the P-value.
4. Make the decision.
5. Summarize the results.
‚Ä¢ The z test is used to test a mean when the population standard deviation is known.
When the sample size is less than 30, the population values need to be normally
distributed. (8‚Äì2)

an individual spends reading the newspaper? Find the

‚Ä¢ When the population standard deviation is not known, researchers use a t test to test
a claim about a mean. If the sample size is less than 30, the population values need
to be normally or approximately normally distributed. (8‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ The z test can be used to test a claim about a population when np  5 and
nq  5. (8‚Äì4)
‚Ä¢ A single variance can be tested by using the chi-square test. (8‚Äì5)
‚Ä¢ There is a relationship between conÔ¨Ådence intervals and hypothesis testing. When
the null hypothesis is rejected, the conÔ¨Ådence interval for the mean using the same
level of signiÔ¨Åcance will not contain the hypothesized mean. When the null
hypothesis is not rejected, the conÔ¨Ådence interval, using the same level of
signiÔ¨Åcance, will contain the hypothesized mean. (8‚Äì6)

13. Alcohol and Tobacco Use by High School Students
The use of both alcohol and tobacco by high school
seniors has declined in the last 30 years. Alcohol use is
down from 68.2 to 43.1%, and the use of cigarettes by
high school seniors has decreased from 36.7 to 20.4%.
A random sample of 300 high school seniors from a
large region indicated that 18% had used cigarettes
during the 30 days prior to the survey. At the 0.05 level
of signiÔ¨Åcance does this differ from the national

To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate? Small or Large?
InÔ¨Çuenza is a serious disease among the elderly, especially those living in nursing homes.
Those residents are more susceptible to inÔ¨Çuenza than elderly persons living in the com-
munity because the former are usually older and more debilitated, and they live in a
closed environment where they are exposed more so than community residents to the
virus if it is introduced into the home. Three researchers decided to investigate the use of
vaccine and its value in determining outbreaks of inÔ¨Çuenza in small nursing homes.
These researchers surveyed 83 licensed homes in seven counties in Michigan. Part
of the study consisted of comparing the number of people being vaccinated in small
nursing homes (100 or fewer beds) with the number in larger nursing homes (more than
100 beds). Unlike the statistical methods presented in Chapter 8, these researchers used
the techniques explained in this chapter to compare two sample proportions to see if there
was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the vaccination rates of patients in small nursing homes
compared to those in large nursing homes. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of
the chapter.

Introduction
The basic concepts of hypothesis testing were explained in Chapter 8. With the z, t, and
x2 tests, a sample mean, variance, or proportion can be compared to a speciÔ¨Åc popula-
tion mean, variance, or proportion to determine whether the null hypothesis should be
rejected.
There are, however, many instances when researchers wish to compare two sample
means, using experimental and control groups. For example, the average lifetimes of two
different brands of bus tires might be compared to see whether there is any difference in
tread wear. Two different brands of fertilizer might be tested to see whether one is better
than the other for growing plants. Or two brands of cough syrup might be tested to see
whether one brand is more effective than the other.

In the comparison of two means, the same basic steps for hypothesis testing shown
in Chapter 8 are used, and the z and t tests are also used. When comparing two means
by using the t test, the researcher must decide if the two samples are independent or
dependent. The concepts of independent and dependent samples will be explained in
Sections 9‚Äì2 and 9‚Äì3.
The z test can be used to compare two proportions, as shown in Section 9‚Äì4. Finally,
two variances can be compared by using an F test as shown in Section 9‚Äì5.

Testing the Difference Between Two Means: 
Using the z Test
Suppose a researcher wishes to determine whether there is a difference in the average age
of nursing students who enroll in a nursing program at a community college and those
who enroll in a nursing program at a university. In this case, the researcher is not inter-
ested in the average age of all beginning nursing students; instead, he is interested in
comparing the means of the two groups. His research question is, Does the mean age of
nursing students who enroll at a community college differ from the mean age of nursing
students who enroll at a university? Here, the hypotheses are
H0: m1  m2
H1: m1  m2

m2  mean age of all beginning nursing students at the university
Another way of stating the hypotheses for this situation is
H0: m1  m2  0
H1: m1  m2  0
If there is no difference in population means, subtracting them will give a difference of
zero. If they are different, subtracting will give a number other than zero. Both methods
of stating hypotheses are correct; however, the Ô¨Årst method will be used in this book.
Objective 
Test the difference
between sample
means, using the
z test.
1
Assumptions for the z Test to Determine the Difference Between Two Means
1. Both samples are random samples.
2. The samples must be independent of each other. That is, there can be no relationship
between the subjects in each sample.
3. The standard deviations of both populations must be known, and if the sample sizes are
less than 30, the populations must be normally or approximately normally distributed.
The theory behind testing the difference between two means is based on selecting
pairs of samples and comparing the means of the pairs. The population means need not
be known.
All possible pairs of samples are taken from populations. The means for each pair of
samples are computed and then subtracted, and the differences are plotted. If both popu-
lations have the same mean, then most of the differences will be zero or close to zero.

Occasionally, there will be a few large differences due to chance alone, some positive and
others negative. If the differences are plotted, the curve will be shaped like a normal dis-
tribution and have a mean of zero, as shown in Figure 9‚Äì1.
The variance of the difference

is equal to the sum of the individual variances
of

standard error of the difference is
In the comparison of two sample means, the difference may be due to chance, in
which case the null hypothesis will not be rejected and the researcher can assume that
the means of the populations are basically the same. The difference in this case is not sig-
niÔ¨Åcant. See Figure 9‚Äì2(a). On the other hand, if the difference is signiÔ¨Åcant, the null
hypothesis is rejected and the researcher can conclude that the population means are
different. See Figure 9‚Äì2(b).

from Table E in Appendix C.

Hotel Room Cost
A survey found that the average hotel room rate in New Orleans is $88.42 and the
average room rate in Phoenix is $80.61. Assume that the data were obtained from two
samples of 50 hotels each and that the standard deviations of the populations are $5.62
and $4.83, respectively. At a  0.05, can it be concluded that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant
difference in the rates?

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: m1  m2
and
H1: m1  m2 (claim)

Step 2
Find the critical values. Since a  0.05, the critical values are 1.96
and 1.96.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. Reject the null hypothesis at a  0.05, since 7.45  1.96.

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to support the claim that the
means are not equal. Hence, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the rates.
The P-values for this test can be determined by using the same procedure shown in
Section 8‚Äì2. For example, if the test value for a two-tailed test is 1.40, then the P-value
obtained from Table E is 0.1616. This value is obtained by looking up the area for
z  1.40, which is 0.9192. Then 0.9192 is subtracted from 1.0000 to get 0.0808. Finally,
this value is doubled to get 0.1616 since the test is two-tailed. If a  0.05, the decision
would be to not reject the null hypothesis, since P-value  a.
The P-value method for hypothesis testing for this chapter also follows the same for-
mat as stated in Chapter 8. The steps are reviewed here.
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Compute the test value.
Step 3
Find the P-value.
Step 4
Make the decision.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Example 9‚Äì2 illustrates these steps.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: m1  m2
and
H1: m1  m2 (claim)
Step 2
Compute the test value. Using a calculator or the formula in Chapter 3, Ô¨Ånd
the mean for each data set.
For the males
 8.6
and
s1  3.3
For the females
 7.9
and
s2  3.3
Substitute in the formula.
Step 3
Find the P-value. For z  1.06, the area is 0.8554, and 1.0000  0.8554 
0.1446, or a P-value of 0.1446.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since the P-value is larger than a (that is, 0.1446  0.10),
the decision is to not reject the null hypothesis. See Figure 9‚Äì4.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that
colleges offer more sports for males than they do for females.

*Note: Calculator results may differ due to rounding.
Sometimes, the researcher is interested in testing a speciÔ¨Åc difference in means
other than zero. For example, he or she might hypothesize that the nursing students at a

community college are, on average, 3.2 years older than those at a university. In this case,
the hypotheses are
H0: m1  m2  3.2
and
H1: m1  m2  3.2
The formula for the z test is still
where m1  m2 is the hypothesized difference or expected value. In this case, m1  m2  3.2.
ConÔ¨Ådence intervals for the difference between two means can also be found. When
you are hypothesizing a difference of zero, if the conÔ¨Ådence interval contains zero, the
null hypothesis is not rejected. If the conÔ¨Ådence interval does not contain zero, the null
hypothesis is rejected.
ConÔ¨Ådence intervals for the difference between two means can be found by using
this formula:

Substitute in the formula, using za2  1.96.
Since the conÔ¨Ådence interval does not contain zero, the decision is to reject the null
hypothesis, which agrees with the previous result.

Step by Step
z Test for the Difference Between Two Means
Excel has a two-sample z test included in the Data Analysis Add-in. To perform a z test for the
difference between the means of two populations, given two independent samples, do this:
1. Enter the Ô¨Årst sample data set into column A.
2. Enter the second sample data set into column B.
3. If the population variances are not known but n  30 for both samples, use the formulas
=VAR(A1:An) and =VAR(B1:Bn), where An and Bn are the last cells with data in each
column, to Ô¨Ånd the variances of the sample data sets.
4. Select the Data tab from the toolbar. Then select Data Analysis.
5. In the Analysis Tools box, select z test: Two sample for Means.
6. Type the ranges for the data in columns A and B and type a value (usually 0) for the
Hypothesized Mean Difference.
7. If the population variances are known, type them for Variable 1 and Variable 2. Otherwise,
use the sample variances obtained in step 3.
8. Specify the conÔ¨Ådence level Alpha.
9. Specify a location for the output, and click [OK].
Example XL9‚Äì1
Test the claim that the two population means are equal, using the sample data provided

Testing the Difference Between Two Means
of Independent Samples: Using the t Test
In Section 9‚Äì1, the z test was used to test the difference between two means when the pop-
ulation standard deviations were known and the variables were normally or approximately
normally distributed, or when both sample sizes were greater than or equal to 30. In many
situations, however, these conditions cannot be met‚Äîthat is, the population standard devi-
ations are not known. In these cases, a t test is used to test the difference between means
when the two samples are independent and when the samples are taken from two normally
or approximately normally distributed populations. Samples are independent samples
when they are not related. Also it will be assumed that the variances are not equal.
Objective 
Test the difference
between two means
for independent
samples, using the
t test.

Farm Sizes
The average size of a farm in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, is 191 acres. The average size
of a farm in Greene County, Pennsylvania, is 199 acres. Assume the data were obtained
from two samples with standard deviations of 38 and 12 acres, respectively, and sample
sizes of 8 and 10, respectively. Can it be concluded at a  0.05 that the average size of the
farms in the two counties is different? Assume the populations are normally distributed.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim for the means.
H0: m1  m2
and
H1: m1  m2 (claim)
Step 2
Find the critical values. Since the test is two-tailed, since a  0.05, and since
the variances are unequal, the degrees of freedom are the smaller of n1  1
or n2  1. In this case, the degrees of freedom are 8  1  7. Hence, from
Table F, the critical values are 2.365 and 2.365.
Step 3
Compute the test value. Since the variances are unequal, use the Ô¨Årst formula.
Step 4
Make the decision. Do not reject the null hypothesis, since 0.57  2.365.
See Figure 9‚Äì5.

When raw data are given in the exercises, use your calculator or the formulas in
Chapter 3 to Ô¨Ånd the means and variances for the data sets. Then follow the procedures
shown in this section to test the hypotheses.
Assumptions for the t Test for Two Independent Means When S1 and S2
Are Unknown
1. The samples are random samples.
2. The sample data are independent of one another.
3. When the sample sizes are less than 30, the populations must be normally or
approximately normally distributed.

Example 9‚Äì5
Find the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval for the data in Example 9‚Äì4.
Solution
Substitute in the formula.
Since 0 is contained in the interval, the decision is to not reject the null hypothesis 
H0: m1  m2.
In many statistical software packages, a different method is used to compute the
degrees of freedom for this t test. They are determined by the formula
This formula will not be used in this textbook.
There are actually two different options for the use of t tests. One option is used when
the variances of the populations are not equal, and the other option is used when the vari-
ances are equal. To determine whether two sample variances are equal, the researcher
can use an F test, as shown in Section 9‚Äì5.
When the variances are assumed to be equal, this formula is used and 
follows the format of
For the numerator, the terms are the same as in the previously given formula. However,
a note of explanation is needed for the denominator of the second test statistic. Since both

populations are assumed to have the same variance, the standard error is computed with
what is called a pooled estimate of the variance. A pooled estimate of the variance is
a weighted average of the variance using the two sample variances and the degrees of
freedom of each variance as the weights. Again, since the algebraic derivation of the
standard error is somewhat complicated, it is omitted.
Note, however, that not all statisticians are in agreement about using the F test before
using the t test. Some believe that conducting the F and t tests at the same level of signiÔ¨Å-
cance will change the overall level of signiÔ¨Åcance of the t test. Their reasons are beyond
the scope of this textbook. Because of this, we will assume that s1  s2 in this textbook.

Testing the Difference Between Two Means: 
Dependent Samples
In Section 9‚Äì2, the t test was used to compare two sample means when the samples were
independent. In this section, a different version of the t test is explained. This version is
used when the samples are dependent. Samples are considered to be dependent samples
when the subjects are paired or matched in some way.
For example, suppose a medical researcher wants to see whether a drug will affect
the reaction time of its users. To test this hypothesis, the researcher must pretest the
subjects in the sample Ô¨Årst. That is, they are given a test to ascertain their normal reaction
times. Then after taking the drug, the subjects are tested again, using a posttest. Finally, the
means of the two tests are compared to see whether there is a difference. Since the same
subjects are used in both cases, the samples are related; subjects scoring high on the pretest
will generally score high on the posttest, even after consuming the drug. Likewise, those
scoring lower on the pretest will tend to score lower on the posttest. To take this effect into
account, the researcher employs a t test, using the differences between the pretest values
and the posttest values. Thus only the gain or loss in values is compared.
Here are some other examples of dependent samples. A researcher may want to
design an SAT preparation course to help students raise their test scores the second time
they take the SAT. Hence, the differences between the two exams are compared. A med-
ical specialist may want to see whether a new counseling program will help subjects lose
weight. Therefore, the preweights of the subjects will be compared with the postweights.
Besides samples in which the same subjects are used in a pre-post situation, there are
other cases where the samples are considered dependent. For example, students might
be matched or paired according to some variable that is pertinent to the study; then one
student is assigned to one group, and the other student is assigned to a second group. For
instance, in a study involving learning, students can be selected and paired according to
their IQs. That is, two students with the same IQ will be paired. Then one will be assigned
to one sample group (which might receive instruction by computers), and the other stu-
dent will be assigned to another sample group (which might receive instruction by the
lecture discussion method). These assignments will be done randomly. Since a student‚Äôs
IQ is important to learning, it is a variable that should be controlled. By matching sub-
jects on IQ, the researcher can eliminate the variable‚Äôs inÔ¨Çuence, for the most part.
Matching, then, helps to reduce type II error by eliminating extraneous variables.
Two notes of caution should be mentioned. First, when subjects are matched according
to one variable, the matching process does not eliminate the inÔ¨Çuence of other variables.
Matching students according to IQ does not account for their mathematical ability or their
familiarity with computers. Since not all variables inÔ¨Çuencing a study can be controlled, it
is up to the researcher to determine which variables should be used in matching. Second,
when the same subjects are used for a pre-post study, sometimes the knowledge that they
are participating in a study can inÔ¨Çuence the results. For example, if people are placed in a
special program, they may be more highly motivated to succeed simply because they have
been selected to participate; the program itself may have little effect on their success.
When the samples are dependent, a special t test for dependent means is used. This
test employs the difference in values of the matched pairs. The hypotheses are as follows:
Two-tailed
Left-tailed
Right-tailed
H0: mD  0
H0: mD  0
H0: mD  0
H1: mD  0
H1: mD  0
H1: mD  0
Objective

where mD is the symbol for the expected mean of the difference of the matched pairs. The
general procedure for Ô¨Ånding the test value involves several steps.
First, Ô¨Ånd the differences of the values of the pairs of data.
D  X1  X2
Second, Ô¨Ånd the mean 
of the differences, using the formula
where n is the number of data pairs. Third, Ô¨Ånd the standard deviation sD of the differ-
ences, using the formula
Fourth, Ô¨Ånd the estimated standard error 
of the differences, which is
Finally, Ô¨Ånd the test value, using the formula
The formula in the Ô¨Ånal step follows the basic format of
where the observed value is the mean of the differences. The expected value mD is zero if
the hypothesis is mD  0. The standard error of the difference is the standard deviation of
the difference, divided by the square root of the sample size. Both populations must be
normally or approximately normally distributed. Example 9‚Äì6 illustrates the hypothesis-
testing procedure in detail.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypothesis and identify the claim. Since we are interested to see if
there has been an increase in deposits, the deposits 3 years ago must be less
than the deposits today; hence, the differences must be signiÔ¨Åcantly less
3 years ago than they are today. Hence the mean of the differences must be
less than zero.

video games for at least 3 hours each
week made about 37% fewer mistakes and
Ô¨Ånished operations 27% faster than those
who did not play video games.
The type of surgery that they
performed is called laparoscopic surgery,
where the surgeon inserts a tiny video
camera into the body and uses a joystick
to maneuver the surgical instruments
while watching the results on a television
monitor. This study compares two groups
and uses proportions. What statistical test
do you think was used to compare the
percentages? (See Section 9‚Äì4.)

As a researcher for the EPA, you have been asked to determine if the air quality in the United
States has changed over the past 2 years. You select a random sample of 10 metropolitan areas
and Ô¨Ånd the number of days each year that the areas failed to meet acceptable air quality
standards. The data are shown.

Testing the Difference Between Proportions
The z test with some modiÔ¨Åcations can be used to test the equality of two proportions.
For example, a researcher might ask, Is the proportion of men who exercise regularly less
than the proportion of women who exercise regularly? Is there a difference in the per-
centage of students who own a personal computer and the percentage of nonstudents who
own one? Is there a difference in the proportion of college graduates who pay cash for
purchases and the proportion of non-college graduates who pay cash?
Recall from Chapter 7 that the symbol 
(‚Äúp hat‚Äù) is the sample proportion used
to estimate the population proportion, denoted by p. For example, if in a sample of
30 college students, 9 are on probation, then the sample proportion is 

, or 0.3. The
population proportion p is the number of all students who are on probation, divided by
the number of students who attend the college. The formula for 
is
where
X  number of units that possess the characteristic of interest
n  sample size
When you are testing the difference between two population proportions p1 and p2, the
hypotheses can be stated thus, if no difference between the proportions is hypothesized.
H0: p1  p2
or
H0: p1  p2  0
H1: p1  p2
H1: p1  p2  0
Similar statements using  or  in the alternate hypothesis can be formed for one-tailed
tests.
For two proportions, 
1  X1n1 is used to estimate p1 and 
2  X2 n2 is used to
estimate p2. The standard error of the difference is

Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to say that the proportion of

The P-value for the difference of proportions can be found from Table E, as shown
in Section 9‚Äì1. For Example 9‚Äì10, 6.38 is beyond 3.49; hence, the null hypothesis can
be rejected since the P-value is less than 0.001.

Speaking of 
Statistics
Is More Expensive Better?
An article in the Journal of the
American Medical Association
explained a study done on
placebo pain pills. Researchers
randomly assigned 82 healthy
people to two groups. The
individuals in the Ô¨Årst group were
given sugar pills, but they were
told that the pills were a new,
fast-acting opioid pain reliever
similar to codeine and that they
were listed at $2.50 each. The
individuals in the other group
received the same sugar pills but
were told that the pills had been
marked down to 10¬¢ each.
Each group received electrical
shocks before and after taking the
pills. They were then asked if the
pills reduced the pain. Eighty-Ô¨Åve percent of the group who were told that the pain pills cost $2.50 said that they were effective,
while 61% of the group who received the supposedly discounted pills said that they were effective.
State possible null and alternative hypotheses for this study. What statistical test could be used in this study? What
might be the conclusion of the study?

Testing the Difference Between Two Variances
In addition to comparing two means, statisticians are interested in comparing two
variances or standard deviations. For example, is the variation in the temperatures for a
certain month for two cities different?
In another situation, a researcher may be interested in comparing the variance of the
cholesterol of men with the variance of the cholesterol of women. For the comparison of
two variances or standard deviations, an F test is used. The F test should not be confused
with the chi-square test, which compares a single sample variance to a speciÔ¨Åc popula-
tion variance, as shown in Chapter 8.
If two independent samples are selected from two normally distributed populations
in which the variances are equal (
) and if the variances 
and 
are compared
as , the sampling distribution of the variances is called the F distribution.

Characteristics of the F Distribution
1. The values of F cannot be negative, because variances are always positive or zero.
2. The distribution is positively skewed.
3. The mean value of F is approximately equal to 1.
4. The F distribution is a family of curves based on the degrees of freedom of the variance
of the numerator and the degrees of freedom of the variance of the denominator.

where the larger of the two variances is placed in the numerator regardless of the subscripts.
(See note on page 519.)
The F test has two terms for the degrees of freedom: that of the numerator, n1  1, and
that of the denominator, n2  1, where n1 is the sample size from which the larger variance
was obtained.
F  s2
1
s2
2
When you are Ô¨Ånding the F test value, the larger of the variances is placed in the
numerator of the F formula; this is not necessarily the variance of the larger of the two
sample sizes.
Table H in Appendix C gives the F critical values for a  0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05,
and 0.10 (each a value involves a separate table in Table H). These are one-tailed
values; if a two-tailed test is being conducted, then the a2 value must be used. For
example, if a two-tailed test with a  0.05 is being conducted, then the 0.052  0.025
table of Table H should be used.
Example 9‚Äì12
Find the critical value for a right-tailed F test when a  0.05, the degrees of freedom
for the numerator (abbreviated d.f.N.) are 15, and the degrees of freedom for the
denominator (d.f.D.) are 21.
Solution
Since this test is right-tailed with a  0.05, use the 0.05 table. The d.f.N. is listed across
the top, and the d.f.D. is listed in the left column. The critical value is found where the
row and column intersect in the table. In this case, it is 2.18. See Figure 9‚Äì11.

Find the critical value for a two-tailed F test with a  0.05 when the sample size from
which the variance for the numerator was obtained was 21 and the sample size from which
the variance for the denominator was obtained was 12.
Solution
Since this is a two-tailed test with a  0.05, the 0.052  0.025 table must be used.
Here, d.f.N.  21  1  20, and d.f.D.  12  1  11; hence, the critical value is 3.23.
See Figure 9‚Äì12.
As noted previously, when the F test is used, the larger variance is always placed in
the numerator of the formula. When you are conducting a two-tailed test, a is split; and
even though there are two values, only the right tail is used. The reason is that the F test
value is always greater than or equal to 1.

When the degree of freedom values cannot be found in the table, the closest value on
the smaller side should be used. For example, if d.f.N.  14, this value is between the
given table values of 12 and 15; therefore, 12 should be used, to be on the safe side.

Notes for the Use of the F Test
1. The larger variance should always be placed in the numerator of the formula regardless of
the subscripts. (See note on page 519.)
2. For a two-tailed test, the a value must be divided by 2 and the critical value placed on the
right side of the F curve.
3. If the standard deviations instead of the variances are given in the problem, they must be
squared for the formula for the F test.
4. When the degrees of freedom cannot be found in Table H, the closest value on the smaller
side should be used.

Assumptions for Testing the Difference Between Two Variances
1. The samples must be random samples.
2. The populations from which the samples were obtained must be normally distributed.
(Note: The test should not be used when the distributions depart from normality.)
3. The samples must be independent of one another.
Unusual Stat

Find the critical value.
Step 3
Compute the test value.

Finding P-values for the F test statistic is somewhat more complicated since it
requires looking through all the F tables (Table H in Appendix C) using the speciÔ¨Åc d.f.N.
and d.f.D. values. For example, suppose that a certain test has F  3.58, d.f.N.  5, and
d.f.D.  10. To Ô¨Ånd the P-value interval for F  3.58, you must Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ånd the corre-
sponding F values for d.f.N.  5 and d.f.D.  10 for a equal to 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05,
and 0.10 in Table H. Then make a table as shown.
A
0.10
0.05
0.025
0.01
0.005
F
2.52
3.33
4.24
5.64
6.87
Now locate the two F values that the test value 3.58 falls between. In this case, 3.58 falls
between 3.33 and 4.24, corresponding to 0.05 and 0.025. Hence, the P-value for a right-
tailed test for F  3.58 falls between 0.025 and 0.05 (that is, 0.025  P-value  0.05).
For a right-tailed test, then, you would reject the null hypothesis at a  0.05 but not at
a  0.01. The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.0408. Remember that for a
two-tailed test the values found in Table H for a must be doubled. In this case, 0.05 
P-value  0.10 for F  3.58.
Once you understand the concept, you can dispense with making a table as shown
and Ô¨Ånd the P-value directly from Table H.

Section 9‚Äì5 Testing the Difference Between Two Variances
519
9‚Äì49
Step 4
Make the decision. The decision is to not reject the null hypothesis since
P-value  0.10.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that
the variance in the number of passengers for American airports is greater
than the variance in the number of passengers for foreign airports.
If the exact degrees of freedom are not speciÔ¨Åed in Table H, the closest smaller value
should be used. For example, if a  0.05 (right-tailed test), d.f.N.  18, and d.f.D.  20,
use the column d.f.N.  15 and the row d.f.D.  20 to get F  2.20.
Note: It is not absolutely necessary to place the larger variance in the numerator
when you are performing the F test. Critical values for left-tailed hypotheses tests can be
found by interchanging the degrees of freedom and taking the reciprocal of the value
found in Table H.
Also, you should use caution when performing the F test since the data can run
contrary to the hypotheses on rare occasions. For example, if the hypotheses are 
H0: 

(written H0: 

) and H1: 

, but if 

, then the F test should
not be performed and you would not reject the null hypothesis.

1. When one is computing the F test value, what condition
is placed on the variance that is in the numerator?
The variance in the numerator should be the larger of the two variances.
2. Why is the critical region always on the right side in the
use of the F test? The larger variance is placed in the
numerator of the formula; hence, F  1.
3. What are the two different degrees of freedom
associated with the F distribution?
4. What are the characteristics of the F distribution?

Summary
Many times researchers are interested in comparing two parameters such as two means,
two proportions, or two variances. These measures are obtained from two samples, then
compared using a z test, t test, or an F test.
‚Ä¢ If two sample means are compared, when the samples are independent and the
population standard deviations are known, a z test is used. If the sample sizes are
less than 30, the populations should be normally distributed. (9‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ If two means are compared when the samples are independent and the sample
standard deviations are used, then a t test is used. Both variances are assumed to be
unequal. (9‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ When the two samples are dependent or related, such as using the same subjects
and comparing the means of before and after tests, then the t test for dependent
samples is used. (9‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ Two proportions can be compared by using the z test for proportions. In this case,
each of n1p1, n1q1, n2p2, and n2q2 must all be 5 or more. (9‚Äì4)
‚Ä¢ Two variances can be compared by using an F test. The critical values for the F test
are obtained from the F distribution. (9‚Äì5)
‚Ä¢ ConÔ¨Ådence intervals for differences between two parameters can also be found.

Using a z test to compare two proportions, the researchers found that the proportion of residents
in smaller nursing homes who were vaccinated (80.8%) was statistically greater than that of
residents in large nursing homes who were vaccinated (68.7%). Using statistical methods
presented in later chapters, they also found that the larger size of the nursing home and the lower
frequency of vaccination were signiÔ¨Åcant predictions of inÔ¨Çuenza outbreaks in nursing homes.

ABOUT 15 OUT OF 100 CHILDREN ARE BORN SHY, BUT ONLY
THREE WILL BE SHY AS ADULTS.
DO OVERACTIVE STRESS HORMONES DAMAGE HEALTH?
FEARFUL TYPES MAY MEET THEIR 
maker sooner, at least among rats. 
Researchers have for the first time 
connected a personality trait‚Äîfear of 
novelty‚Äîto an early death. 
Sonia 
Cavigelli 
and 
Martha 
McClintock, psychologists at the 
University of Chicago, presented 
unfamiliar bowls, tunnels and bricks to 
a group of young male rats. Those 
hesitant to explore the mystery objects 
were classified as ‚Äúneophobic.‚Äù
The researchers found that the 
neophobic 
rats 
produced 
high         
levels of stress hormones, called 
glucocorticoids‚Äîtypically involved in 
the fight-or-flight stress response‚Äî 
when faced with strange situations. 
Those rats continued to have high 
levels of the hormones at random 
times throughout their lives, indicating 
that timidity is a fixed and stable trait. 
The team then set out to examine the 
cumulative effects of this personality 
trait on the rats‚Äô health. 
Timid rats were 60 percent more 
likely to die at any given time than 
were their outgoing brothers. The 
causes of death were similar for both 
groups. ‚ÄúOne hypothesis as to why the 
neophobic rats died earlier is that the 
stress hormones negatively affected 
their immune system,‚Äù Cavigelli says. 
Neophobes died, on average, three 
months before their rat brothers, a 
significant gap, considering that most 
rats lived only two years.
Shyness‚Äîthe human equivalent of 
neophobia‚Äîcan be detected in infants 
as young as 14 months. Shy people 
also produce more stress hormones 
than 
‚Äúaverage,‚Äù 
or 
thrill-seeking 
humans. 
But 
introverts 
don't 
necessarily stay shy for life, as rats 
apparently do. Jerome Kagan, a 
professor of psychology at Harvard 
University, has found that while         
15 out of every 100 children will          
be born with a shy temperament,           
only three will appear shy as          
adults. 
None, 
however, 
will 
be 
extroverts. 
Extrapolating from the doomed fate 
of neophobic rats to their human 
counterparts is difficult. ‚ÄúBut it means 
that something as simple as a 
personality 
trait 
could 
have 
physiological consequences,‚Äù Cavigelli 
says.

9. There is not enough evidence to conclude that there
is a difference in the number of home runs hit by
National League versus American League baseball
players.
10. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that since we
do not have a random sample of data from each league,
we cannot answer the original question asked.

Too Long on the Telephone
1. These samples are independent.
2. We compare the P-value of 0.06317 to the signiÔ¨Åcance
level to check if the null hypothesis should be 
rejected.
3. The P-value of 0.06317 also gives the probability of a
type I error.
4. Since two critical values are shown, we know that a
two-tailed test was done.
5. Since the P-value of 0.06317 is greater than the
signiÔ¨Åcance value of 0.05, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis and Ô¨Ånd that we do not have enough
evidence to conclude that there is a difference in the
lengths of telephone calls made by employees in the
two divisions of the company.
6. If the signiÔ¨Åcance level had been 0.10, we would have
rejected the null hypothesis, since the P-value would
have been less than the signiÔ¨Åcance level.

Do Dust Storms Affect Respiratory Health?
Southeast Washington state has a long history of seasonal dust storms. Several researchers
decided to see what effect, if any, these storms had on the respiratory health of the people
living in the area. They undertook (among other things) to see if there was a relationship
between the amount of dust and sand particles in the air when the storms occur and the
number of hospital emergency room visits for respiratory disorders at three community
hospitals in southeast Washington. Using methods of correlation and regression, which
are explained in this chapter, they were able to determine the effect of these dust storms
on local residents. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of the chapter.

Introduction
In Chapters 7 and 8, two areas of inferential statistics‚ÄîconÔ¨Ådence intervals and hypoth-
esis testing‚Äîwere explained. Another area of inferential statistics involves determining
whether a relationship exists between two or more numerical or quantitative variables. For
example, a businessperson may want to know whether the volume of sales for a given
month is related to the amount of advertising the Ô¨Årm does that month. Educators are inter-
ested in determining whether the number of hours a student studies is related to the stu-
dent‚Äôs score on a particular exam. Medical researchers are interested in questions such as,
Is caffeine related to heart damage? or Is there a relationship between a person‚Äôs age and
his or her blood pressure? A zoologist may want to know whether the birth weight of a
certain animal is related to its life span. These are only a few of the many questions that
can be answered by using the techniques of correlation and regression analysis.
Correlation is a statistical method used to determine whether a linear relationship
between variables exists. Regression is a statistical method used to describe the nature of
the relationship between variables, that is, positive or negative, linear or nonlinear.
The purpose of this chapter is to answer these questions statistically:
1. Are two or more variables linearly related?
2. If so, what is the strength of the relationship?

3. What type of relationship exists?
4. What kind of predictions can be made from the relationship?
To answer the Ô¨Årst two questions, statisticians use a numerical measure to determine
whether two or more variables are linearly related and to determine the strength of the rela-
tionship between or among the variables. This measure is called a correlation coefÔ¨Åcient.
For example, there are many variables that contribute to heart disease, among them lack
of exercise, smoking, heredity, age, stress, and diet. Of these variables, some are more
important than others; therefore, a physician who wants to help a patient must know which
factors are most important.
To answer the third question, you must ascertain what type of relationship exists.
There are two types of relationships: simple and multiple. In a simple relationship, there
are two variables‚Äîan independent variable, also called an explanatory variable or a
predictor variable, and a dependent variable, also called a response variable. A simple
relationship analysis is called simple regression, and there is one independent variable that
is used to predict the dependent variable. For example, a manager may wish to see whether
the number of years the salespeople have been working for the company has anything to
do with the amount of sales they make. This type of study involves a simple relationship,
since there are only two variables‚Äîyears of experience and amount of sales.
In a multiple relationship, called multiple regression, two or more independent
variables are used to predict one dependent variable. For example, an educator may wish
to investigate the relationship between a student‚Äôs success in college and factors such
as the number of hours devoted to studying, the student‚Äôs GPA, and the student‚Äôs high
school background. This type of study involves several variables.
Simple relationships can also be positive or negative. A positive relationship exists
when both variables increase or decrease at the same time. For instance, a person‚Äôs height
and weight are related; and the relationship is positive, since the taller a person is, gen-
erally, the more the person weighs. In a negative relationship, as one variable increases,
the other variable decreases, and vice versa. For example, if you measure the strength
of people over 60 years of age, you will Ô¨Ånd that as age increases, strength generally
decreases. The word generally is used here because there are exceptions.
Finally, the fourth question asks what type of predictions can be made. Predictions are
made in all areas and daily. Examples include weather forecasting, stock market analyses,
sales predictions, crop predictions, gasoline price predictions, and sports predictions. Some
predictions are more accurate than others, due to the strength of the relationship. That is,
the stronger the relationship is between variables, the more accurate the prediction is.

Scatter Plots and Correlation
In simple correlation and regression studies, the researcher collects data on two numeri-
cal or quantitative variables to see whether a relationship exists between the variables.
For example, if a researcher wishes to see whether there is a relationship between number
of hours of study and test scores on an exam, she must select a random sample of
students, determine the hours each studied, and obtain their grades on the exam. A table
can be made for the data, as shown here.

Chapter 10 Correlation and Regression

As stated previously, the two variables for this study are called the independent vari-
able and the dependent variable. The independent variable is the variable in regression
that can be controlled or manipulated. In this case, the number of hours of study is the
independent variable and is designated as the x variable. The dependent variable is the
variable in regression that cannot be controlled or manipulated. The grade the student
received on the exam is the dependent variable, designated as the y variable. The reason
for this distinction between the variables is that you assume that the grade the student
earns depends on the number of hours the student studied. Also, you assume that, to some
extent, the student can regulate or control the number of hours he or she studies for the
exam.
The determination of the x and y variables is not always clear-cut and is sometimes
an arbitrary decision. For example, if a researcher studies the effects of age on a person‚Äôs
blood pressure, the researcher can generally assume that age affects blood pressure.
Hence, the variable age can be called the independent variable, and the variable blood
pressure can be called the dependent variable. On the other hand, if a researcher is study-
ing the attitudes of husbands on a certain issue and the attitudes of their wives on the
same issue, it is difÔ¨Åcult to say which variable is the independent variable and which is
the dependent variable. In this study, the researcher can arbitrarily designate the variables
as independent and dependent.
The independent and dependent variables can be plotted on a graph called a scatter
plot. The independent variable x is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the dependent vari-
able y is plotted on the vertical axis.
A scatter plot is a graph of the ordered pairs (x, y) of numbers consisting of the
independent variable x and the dependent variable y.
The scatter plot is a visual way to describe the nature of the relationship between the
independent and dependent variables. The scales of the variables can be different, and
the coordinates of the axes are determined by the smallest and largest data values of the
variables.
The procedure for drawing a scatter plot is shown in Examples 10‚Äì1 through 10‚Äì3.

Step 1
Draw and label the x and y axes.
Step 2
Plot each point on the graph, as shown in Figure 10‚Äì2.

After the plot is drawn, it should be analyzed to determine which type of relationship,
if any, exists. For example, the plot shown in Figure 10‚Äì1 suggests a positive relationship,
since as the number of cars rented increases, revenue tends to increase also. The plot of
the data shown in Figure 10‚Äì2 suggests a negative relationship, since as the number of
absences increases, the Ô¨Ånal grade decreases. Finally, the plot of the data shown in
Figure 10‚Äì3 shows no speciÔ¨Åc type of relationship, since no pattern is discernible.
Note that the data shown in Figures 10‚Äì1 and 10‚Äì2 also suggest a linear relationship,
since the points seem to Ô¨Åt a straight line, although not perfectly. Sometimes a scatter
plot, such as the one in Figure 10‚Äì4, shows a curvilinear relationship between the data.
In this situation, the methods shown in this section and in Section 10‚Äì2 cannot be used.
Methods for curvilinear relationships are beyond the scope of this book.

explained in this section is called the Pearson product moment correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
(PPMC), named after statistician Karl Pearson, who pioneered the research in this area.
The correlation coefÔ¨Åcient computed from the sample data measures the strength
and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The symbol for
the sample correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is r. The symbol for the population correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient is r (Greek letter rho).
The range of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is from 1 to 1. If there is a strong positive
linear relationship between the variables, the value of r will be close to 1. If there is a
strong negative linear relationship between the variables, the value of r will be close to
1. When there is no linear relationship between the variables or only a weak relation-
ship, the value of r will be close to 0. See Figure 10‚Äì5.
The graphs in Figure 10‚Äì6 show the relationship between the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients
and their corresponding scatter plots. Notice that as the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
increases from 0 to 1 (parts a, b, and c), data values become closer to an increasingly
strong relationship. As the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient decreases from 0 to 1
(parts d, e, and f), the data values also become closer to a straight line. Again this sug-
gests a stronger relationship.
There are several ways to compute the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient. One
method is to use the formula shown here.

Rounding Rule for the Correlation CoefÔ¨Åcient
Round the value of r to three
decimal places.
The formula looks somewhat complicated, but using a table to compute the values,
as shown in Example 10‚Äì4, makes it somewhat easier to determine the value of r.
There are no units associated with r, and the value of r will remain unchanged if the
x and y values are switched.

1. The sample is a random sample.
2. The data pairs fall approximately on a straight line and are measured at the interval or
ratio level.
3. The variables have a joint normal distribution. (This means that given any speciÔ¨Åc value
of x, the y values are normally distributed; and given any speciÔ¨Åc value of y, the x values
are normally distributed.)

Find the values of xy, x2, and y2 and place these values in the corresponding

Step 3
Substitute in the formula and solve for r.
The value of r indicates a very weak negative relationship between the variables.
In Example 10‚Äì4, the value of r was high (close to 1.00); in Example 10‚Äì6, the value
of r was much lower (close to 0). This question then arises, When is the value of r due
to chance, and when does it suggest a signiÔ¨Åcant linear relationship between the vari-
ables? This question will be answered next.
The SigniÔ¨Åcance of the Correlation CoefÔ¨Åcient
As stated before, the range
of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is between 1 and 1. When the value of r is near 1 or
1, there is a strong linear relationship. When the value of r is near 0, the linear rela-
tionship is weak or nonexistent. Since the value of r is computed from data obtained from
samples, there are two possibilities when r is not equal to zero: either the value of r is
high enough to conclude that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant linear relationship between the vari-
ables, or the value of r is due to chance.

To make this decision, you use a hypothesis-testing procedure. The traditional
method is similar to the one used in previous chapters.
Step 1
State the hypotheses.
Step 2
Find the critical values.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
The population correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is computed from taking all possible (x, y)
pairs; it is designated by the Greek letter r (rho). The sample correlation coefÔ¨Åcient can
then be used as an estimator of r if the following assumptions are valid.
1. The variables x and y are linearly related.
2. The variables are random variables.
3. The two variables have a bivariate normal distribution.
A biviarate normal distribution means that for the pairs of (x, y) data values, the cor-
responding y values have a bell-shaped distribution for any given x value, and the x val-
ues for any given y value have a bell-shaped distribution.
Formally deÔ¨Åned, the population correlation coefÔ¨Åcient r is the correlation computed
by using all possible pairs of data values (x, y) taken from a population.
In hypothesis testing, one of these is true:
H0: r  0
This null hypothesis means that there is no correlation between the 
x and y variables in the population.
H1: r  0
This alternative hypothesis means that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant correla-
tion between the variables in the population.
When the null hypothesis is rejected at a speciÔ¨Åc level, it means that there is a
signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the value of r and 0. When the null hypothesis is not
rejected, it means that the value of r is not signiÔ¨Åcantly different from 0 (zero) and is
probably due to chance.
Several methods can be used to test the signiÔ¨Åcance of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient.
Three methods will be shown in this section. The Ô¨Årst uses the t test.

Although hypothesis tests can be one-tailed, most hypotheses involving the correla-
tion coefÔ¨Åcient are two-tailed. Recall that r represents the population correlation coefÔ¨Å-
cient. Also, if there is no linear relationship, the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient will
be 0. Hence, the hypotheses will be
H0: r  0
and
H1: r  0
You do not have to identify the claim here, since the question will always be whether
there is a signiÔ¨Åcant linear relationship between the variables.
Historical Notes
A mathematician
named Karl Pearson
(1857‚Äì1936) became
interested in Francis
Galton‚Äôs work and saw
that the correlation
and regression theory
could be applied to
other areas besides
heredity. Pearson
developed the
correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
that bears his name.

The two-tailed critical values are used. These values are found in Table F in
Appendix C. Also, when you are testing the signiÔ¨Åcance of a correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, both
variables x and y must come from normally distributed populations.

Example 10‚Äì7
Test the signiÔ¨Åcance of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient found in Example 10‚Äì4. Use a  0.05
and r  0.982.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses.
H0: r  0
and
H1: r  0
Step 2
Find the critical values. Since a  0.05 and there are 6  2  4 degrees of
freedom, the critical values obtained from Table F are 2.776, as shown in
Figure 10‚Äì7.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between the number
of cars a rental agency owns and its annual income.
The second method that can be used to test the signiÔ¨Åcance of r is the P-value method.
The method is the same as that shown in Chapters 8 and 9. It uses the following steps.
Step 1
State the hypotheses.
Step 2
Find the test value. (In this case, use the t test.)

Step 3
Find the P-value. (In this case, use Table F.)
Step 4
Make the decision.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Consider an example where t  4.059 and d.f.  4. Using Table F with d.f.  4
and the row Two tails, the value 4.059 falls between 3.747 and 4.604; hence, 0.01 
P-value  0.02. (The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.015.) That is, the P-value
falls between 0.01 and 0.02. The decision, then, is to reject the null hypothesis since
P-value  0.05.
The third method of testing the signiÔ¨Åcance of r is to use Table I in Appendix C. This
table shows the values of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient that are signiÔ¨Åcant for a speciÔ¨Åc a
level and a speciÔ¨Åc number of degrees of freedom. For example, for 7 degrees of free-
dom and a  0.05, the table gives a critical value of 0.666. Any value of r greater than
0.666 or less than 0.666 will be signiÔ¨Åcant, and the null hypothesis will be rejected.
See Figure 10‚Äì9. When Table I is used, you need not compute the t test value. Table I is
for two-tailed tests only.

obtained in Example 10‚Äì6.
Solution
H0: r  0
and
H1: r  0
Since the sample size is 8, there are n  2, or 8  2  6, degrees of freedom. When
a  0.01 and d.f.  6, the value obtained from Table I is 0.834. For a signiÔ¨Åcant
relationship, a value of r greater than 0.834 or less than 0.834 is needed. Since the
value of r  0.176 is greater than 0.834, the null hypothesis is not rejected. Hence
there is not enough evidence to say that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant linear relationship between
age and wealth. See Figure 10‚Äì10.

Possible Relationships Between Variables
When the null hypothesis has been rejected for a speciÔ¨Åc a value, any of the following Ô¨Åve
possibilities can exist.
1. There is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the variables. That is, x causes y.
For example, water causes plants to grow, poison causes death, and heat causes ice to melt.
2. There is a reverse cause-and-effect relationship between the variables. That is, y causes x.
For example, suppose a researcher believes excessive coffee consumption causes
nervousness, but the researcher fails to consider that the reverse situation may occur. That
is, it may be that an extremely nervous person craves coffee to calm his or her nerves.
3. The relationship between the variables may be caused by a third variable. For example, if
a statistician correlated the number of deaths due to drowning and the number of cans of
soft drink consumed daily during the summer, he or she would probably Ô¨Ånd a signiÔ¨Åcant
relationship. However, the soft drink is not necessarily responsible for the deaths, since
both variables may be related to heat and humidity.
4. There may be a complexity of interrelationships among many variables. For example, a
researcher may Ô¨Ånd a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between students‚Äô high school grades and
college grades. But there probably are many other variables involved, such as IQ, hours
of study, inÔ¨Çuence of parents, motivation, age, and instructors.
5. The relationship may be coincidental. For example, a researcher may be able to Ô¨Ånd a
signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between the increase in the number of people who are exercising
and the increase in the number of people who are committing crimes. But common sense
dictates that any relationship between these two values must be due to coincidence.
When two variables are highly correlated, item 3 in the box states that there exists a
possibility that the correlation is due to a third variable. If this is the case and the third
variable is unknown to the researcher or not accounted for in the study, it is called a
Correlation and Causation
Researchers must understand the nature of the linear
relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y. When a
hypothesis test indicates that a signiÔ¨Åcant linear relationship exists between the variables,
researchers must consider the possibilities outlined next.

lurking variable. An attempt should be made by the researcher to identify such variables
and to use methods to control their inÔ¨Çuence.
It is important to restate the fact that even if the correlation between two variables is
high, it does not necessarily mean causation. There are other possibilities, such as lurk-
ing variables or just a coincidental relationship. See the Speaking of Statistics article on
page 548.
Also, you should be cautious when the data for one or both of the variables involve
averages rather than individual data. It is not wrong to use averages, but the results cannot
be generalized to individuals since averaging tends to smooth out the variability among
individual data values. The result could be a higher correlation than actually exists.
Thus, when the null hypothesis is rejected, the researcher must consider all possibil-
ities and select the appropriate one as determined by the study. Remember, correlation
does not necessarily imply causation.

NEW YORK (AP)‚ÄîTwo new studies sug-
gest that coffee drinking, even up to 512 cups 
per day, does not increase the risk of heart 
disease, and other studies that claim to have 
found increased risks might have missed the 
true culprits, a researcher says.
‚ÄúIt might not be the coffee cup in one 
hand, it might be the cigarette or coffee roll 
in the other,‚Äù said Dr. Peter W. F. Wilson, the 
author of one of the new studies.
He noted in a telephone interview Thurs-
day that many coffee drinkers, particularly 
heavy coffee drinkers, are smokers. And one 
of the new studies found that coffee drinkers 
had excess fat in their diets.
The findings of the new studies conflict 
sharply with a study reported in November 
1985 by Johns Hopkins University scientists 
in Baltimore.
The Hopkins scientists found that coffee 
drinkers who consumed five or more cups of 
coffee per day had three times the heart-
disease risk of non-coffee drinkers.
The reason for the discrepancy appears to 
be that many of the coffee drinkers in the 
Hopkins study also smoked‚Äîand it was the 
smoking that increased their heart-disease 
risk, said Wilson.
Wilson, director of laboratories for the 
Framingham Heart Study in Framingham, 
Mass., said Thursday at a conference spon-
sored by the American Heart Association in 
Charleston, S.C., that he had examined
the coffee intake of 3,937 participants in
the Framingham study during 1956‚Äì66 and 
an additional 2,277 during the years 
1972‚Äì1982.
In contrast to the subjects in the Hopkins 
study, most of these coffee drinkers con-
sumed two or three cups per day, Wilson 
said. Only 10 percent drank six or more cups 
per day.
He then looked at blood cholesterol levels 
and heart and blood vessel disease in the two 
groups. ‚ÄúWe ran these analyses for coronary 
heart disease, heart attack, sudden death and 
stroke and in absolutely every analysis, we 
found no link with coffee,‚Äù Wilson said.
He found that coffee consumption was 
linked to a significant decrease in total blood 
cholesterol in men, and to a moderate in-
crease in total cholesterol in women.

Regression
In studying relationships between two variables, collect the data and then construct a
scatter plot. The purpose of the scatter plot, as indicated previously, is to determine the
nature of the relationship. The possibilities include a positive linear relationship, a nega-
tive linear relationship, a curvilinear relationship, or no discernible relationship. After the
scatter plot is drawn, the next steps are to compute the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
and to test the signiÔ¨Åcance of the relationship. If the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
is signiÔ¨Åcant, the next step is to determine the equation of the regression line, which is
the data‚Äôs line of best Ô¨Åt. (Note: Determining the regression line when r is not signiÔ¨Åcant
and then making predictions using the regression line are meaningless.) The purpose of
the regression line is to enable the researcher to see the trend and make predictions on
the basis of the data.
Line of Best Fit
Figure 10‚Äì11 shows a scatter plot for the data of two variables. It shows that several lines
can be drawn on the graph near the points. Given a scatter plot, you must be able to draw
the line of best Ô¨Åt. Best Ô¨Åt means that the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from

each point to the line is at a minimum. The reason you need a line of best Ô¨Åt is that the
values of y will be predicted from the values of x; hence, the closer the points are to the
line, the better the Ô¨Åt and the prediction will be. See Figure 10‚Äì12. When r is positive,
the line slopes upward and to the right. When r is negative, the line slopes downward
from left to right.
Determination of the Regression Line Equation
In algebra, the equation of a line is usually given as y  mx  b, where m is the slope of
the line and b is the y intercept. (Students who need an algebraic review of the properties
of a line should refer to Appendix A, Section A‚Äì3, before studying this section.) In
statistics, the equation of the regression line is written as y	  a  bx, where a is the y	
intercept and b is the slope of the line. See Figure 10‚Äì13.
There are several methods for Ô¨Ånding the equation of the regression line. Two for-
mulas are given here. These formulas use the same values that are used in computing the
value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient. The mathematical development of these formulas is
beyond the scope of this book.

Example 10‚Äì9
Car Rental Companies
Find the equation of the regression line for the data in Example 10‚Äì4, and graph the line
on the scatter plot of the data.
Solution
The values needed for the equation are n  6, x  153.8, y  18.7, xy  682.77,
and x2  5859.26. Substituting in the formulas, you get
Hence, the equation of the regression line y	  a  bx is
y	  0.396  0.106x
To graph the line, select any two points for x and Ô¨Ånd the corresponding values for
y. Use any x values between 10 and 60. For example, let x  15. Substitute in the equa-
tion and Ô¨Ånd the corresponding y	 value.
y	  0.396
 0.396  0.106(15)
 1.986 
Let x  40; then
y	  0.396  0.106x
 0.396  0.106(40)
 4.636 
Then plot the two points (15, 1.986) and (40, 4.636) and draw a line connecting the two
points. See Figure 10‚Äì14.
Note: When you draw the regression line, it is sometimes necessary to truncate the
graph (see Chapter 2). This is done when the distance between the origin and the Ô¨Årst
labeled coordinate on the x axis is not the same as the distance between the rest of the

Historical Note
In 1795, Adrien-Marie
Legendre (1752‚Äì1833)
measured the meridian
arc on the earth‚Äôs
surface from
Barcelona, Spain, to
Dunkirk, England. This
measure was used as
the basis for the
measure of the meter.
Legendre developed
the least-squares
method around the
year 1805.
Example 10‚Äì10
Absences and Final Grades
Find the equation of the regression line for the data in Example 10‚Äì5, and graph the line
on the scatter plot.
Solution
The values needed for the equation are n  7, x  57, y  511, xy  3745, and
x2  579. Substituting in the formulas, you get
Hence, the equation of the regression line y	  a  bx is
y	  102.493  3.622x
The graph of the line is shown in Figure 10‚Äì15.
The sign of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient and the sign of the slope of the regression line
will always be the same. That is, if r is positive, then b will be positive; if r is negative,
then b will be negative. The reason is that the numerators of the formulas are the same
and determine the signs of r and b, and the denominators are always positive. The regres-
sion line will always pass through the point whose x coordinate is the mean of the x val-
ues and whose y coordinate is the mean of the y values, that is, ( , ).

coordinate is not the same as the distance between the other labeled y	 coordinates.
When the x axis or the y axis has been truncated, do not use the y	 intercept value to
graph the line. When you graph the regression line, always select x values between the
smallest x data value and the largest x data value.

The regression line can be used to make predictions for the dependent variable. The
method for making predictions is shown in Example 10‚Äì11.
Example 10‚Äì11
Car Rental Companies
Use the equation of the regression line to predict the income of a car rental agency that
has 200,000 automobiles.
Solution
Since the x values are in 10,000s, divide 200,000 by 10,000 to get 20, and then
substitute 20 for x in the equation.
y	  0.396  0.106x
 0.396  0.106(20)
 2.516 
Hence, when a rental agency has 200,000 automobiles, its revenue will be approximately
$2.516 billion.
The value obtained in Example 10‚Äì11 is a point prediction, and with point predic-
tions, no degree of accuracy or conÔ¨Ådence can be determined. More information on
prediction is given in Section 10‚Äì3.
The magnitude of the change in one variable when the other variable changes exactly
1 unit is called a marginal change. The value of slope b of the regression line equation
represents the marginal change. For example, in Example 10‚Äì9 the slope of the regres-
sion line is 0.106, which means for each increase of 10,000 cars, the value of y changes
0.106 unit ($106 million) on average.
When r is not signiÔ¨Åcantly different from 0, the best predictor of y is the mean of the
data values of y. For valid predictions, the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient must be
signiÔ¨Åcant. Also, two other assumptions must be met.

Extrapolation, or making predictions beyond the bounds of the data, must be inter-
preted cautiously. For example, in 1979, some experts predicted that the United States
would run out of oil by the year 2003. This prediction was based on the current con-
sumption and on known oil reserves at that time. However, since then, the automobile
industry has produced many new fuel-efÔ¨Åcient vehicles. Also, there are many as yet
undiscovered oil Ô¨Åelds. Finally, science may someday discover a way to run a car on
something as unlikely but as common as peanut oil. In addition, the price of a gallon of
gasoline was predicted to reach $10 a few years later. Fortunately this has not come to
pass. Remember that when predictions are made, they are based on present conditions or
on the premise that present trends will continue. This assumption may or may not prove
true in the future. 
The steps for Ô¨Ånding the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient and the regression line
equation are summarized in this Procedure Table:

Assumptions for Valid Predictions in Regression
1. The sample is a random sample.
2. For any speciÔ¨Åc value of the independent variable x, the value of the dependent variable
y must be normally distributed about the regression line. See Figure 10‚Äì16(a).
3. The standard deviation of each of the dependent variables must be the same for each
value of the independent variable. See Figure 10‚Äì16(b).

Section 10‚Äì2 Regression

A scatter plot should be checked for outliers. An outlier is a point that seems out of
place when compared with the other points (see Chapter 3). Some of these points can affect
the equation of the regression line. When this happens, the points are called inÔ¨Çuential
points or inÔ¨Çuential observations.
When a point on the scatter plot appears to be an outlier, it should be checked to see
if it is an inÔ¨Çuential point. An inÔ¨Çuential point tends to ‚Äúpull‚Äù the regression line toward
the point itself. To check for an inÔ¨Çuential point, the regression line should be graphed
with the point included in the data set. Then a second regression line should be graphed
that excludes the point from the data set. If the position of the second line is changed con-
siderably, the point is said to be an inÔ¨Çuential point. Points that are outliers in the x direc-
tion tend to be inÔ¨Çuential points.
Researchers should use their judgment as to whether to include inÔ¨Çuential observa-
tions in the Ô¨Ånal analysis of the data. If the researcher feels that the observation is not
necessary, then it should be excluded so that it does not inÔ¨Çuence the results of the study.
However, if the researcher feels that it is necessary, then he or she may want to obtain
additional data values whose x values are near the x value of the inÔ¨Çuential point and then
include them in the study.

CoefÔ¨Åcient of Determination and Standard 
Error of the Estimate
The previous sections stated that if the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is signiÔ¨Åcant, the equation
of the regression line can be determined. Also, for various values of the independent vari-
able x, the corresponding values of the dependent variable y can be predicted. Several
other measures are associated with the correlation and regression techniques. They include
the coefÔ¨Åcient of determination, the standard error of the estimate, and the prediction
interval. But before these concepts can be explained, the different types of variation
associated with the regression model must be deÔ¨Åned.
Types of Variation for the Regression Model
Consider the following hypothetical regression model.
x
1
2
3
4
5
y
10
8
12
16
20

The equation of the regression line is y	  4.8  2.8x, and r  0.919. The sample y
values are 10, 8, 12, 16, and 20. The predicted values, designated by y	, for each x can be
found by substituting each x value into the regression equation and Ô¨Ånding y	. For exam-
ple, when x  1,
y	  4.8  2.8x  4.8  (2.8)(1)  7.6
Now, for each x, there is an observed y value and a predicted y	 value; for example,
when x  1, y  10, and y	  7.6. Recall that the closer the observed values are to the
predicted values, the better the Ô¨Åt is and the closer r is to 1 or 1.
The total variation (y  )2 is the sum of the squares of the vertical distances each
point is from the mean. The total variation can be divided into two parts: that which is
attributed to the relationship of x and y and that which is due to chance. The variation
obtained from the relationship (i.e., from the predicted y	 values) is (y	 
)2 and is
called the explained variation. Most of the variations can be explained by the relation-
ship. The closer the value r is to 1 or 1, the better the points Ô¨Åt the line and the closer
(y	  )2 is to (y  )2. In fact, if all points fall on the regression line, (y	  )2 will
equal (y  )2, since y	 is equal to y in each case.
On the other hand, the variation due to chance, found by (y  y	)2, is called the
unexplained variation. This variation cannot be attributed to the relationship. When
the unexplained variation is small, the value of r is close to 1 or 1. If all points fall on
the regression line, the unexplained variation (y  y	)2 will be 0. Hence, the total variation
is equal to the sum of the explained variation and the unexplained variation. That is,
(y  )2  (y	  )2  (y  y	)2
These values are shown in Figure 10‚Äì17. For a single point, the differences are called
deviations. For the hypothetical regression model given earlier, for x  1 and y  10, you
get y	  7.6 and  13.2.
The procedure for Ô¨Ånding the three types of variation is illustrated next.
Step 1
Find the predicted y	 values.
For x  1
y	  4.8  2.8x  4.8  (2.8)(1)  7.6
For x  2
y	  4.8  (2.8)(2)  10.4
For x  3
y	  4.8  (2.8)(3)  13.2
For x  4
y	  4.8  (2.8)(4)  16.0
For x  5
y	  4.8  (2.8)(5)  18.8

Note: The values (y  y	) are called residuals. A residual is the difference between
the actual value of y and the predicted value y	 for a given x value. The mean of the resid-
uals is always zero. As stated previously, the regression line determined by the formulas
in Section 10‚Äì2 is the line that best Ô¨Åts the points of the scatter plot. The sum of the
squares of the residuals computed by using the regression line is the smallest possible
value. For this reason, a regression line is also called a least-squares line.

Residual Plots
As previously stated, the values y  y are called residuals (sometimes called the prediction
errors). These values can be plotted with the x values, and the plot, called a residual plot,
can be used to determine how well the regression line can be used to make predictions.
The residuals for the previous example are calculated as shown.

Residual Plot
To interpret a residual plot, you need to determine if the residuals form a pattern.
Figure 10‚Äì19 shows four examples of residual plots. If the residual values are more or
less evenly distributed about the line, as shown in Figure 10‚Äì19(a), then the relationship
between x and y is linear and the regression line can be used to make predictions. This
means that the standard deviations of each of the dependent variables must be the same
for each value of the independent variable. This is called the homoscedasticity assumption.
See assumption 3 on page 556.
Figure 10‚Äì19(b) shows that the variance of the residuals increases as the values of x
increase. This means that the regression line is not suitable for predictions.
Figure 10‚Äì19(c) shows a curvilinear relationship between the x values and the resid-
ual values; hence, the regression line is not suitable for making predictions.
Figure 10‚Äì19(d) shows that as the x values increase, the residuals increase and
become more dispersed. This means that the regression line is not suitable for making
predictions.

Karl Pearson
recommended in
1897 that the French
government close all

community to use

probability.
CoefÔ¨Åcient of Determination
The coefÔ¨Åcient of determination is the ratio of the explained variation to the total varia-
tion and is denoted by r 2. That is,
For the example, r 2  78.4/92.8  0.845. The term r 2 is usually expressed as a per-
centage. So in this case, 84.5% of the total variation is explained by the regression line
using the independent variable.
Another way to arrive at the value for r 2 is to square the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient. In
this case, r  0.919 and r 2  0.845, which is the same value found by using the varia-
tion ratio.
The coefÔ¨Åcient of determination is a measure of the variation of the dependent
variable that is explained by the regression line and the independent variable. The symbol
for the coefÔ¨Åcient of determination is r 2.
Of course, it is usually easier to Ô¨Ånd the coefÔ¨Åcient of determination by squaring r
and converting it to a percentage. Therefore, if r  0.90, then r 2  0.81, which is equiv-
alent to 81%. This result means that 81% of the variation in the dependent variable is
accounted for by the variations in the independent variable. The rest of the variation,
0.19, or 19%, is unexplained. This value is called the coefÔ¨Åcient of nondetermination and
is found by subtracting the coefÔ¨Åcient of determination from 1. As the value of r
approaches 0, r 2 decreases more rapidly. For example, if r  0.6, then r 2  0.36, which
means that only 36% of the variation in the dependent variable can be attributed to the
variation in the independent variable.

Standard Error of the Estimate
When a 
value is predicted for a speciÔ¨Åc x value, the prediction is a point prediction.
However, a prediction interval about the 
value can be constructed, just as a conÔ¨Ådence
interval was constructed for an estimate of the population mean. The prediction interval
uses a statistic called the standard error of the estimate.
The standard error of the estimate, denoted by sest, is the standard deviation of the
observed y values about the predicted 
values. The formula for the standard error of
the estimate is
The standard error of the estimate is similar to the standard deviation, but the mean
is not used. As can be seen from the formula, the standard error of the estimate is the
square root of the unexplained variation‚Äîthat is, the variation due to the difference of
the observed values and the expected values‚Äîdivided by n  2. So the closer the
observed values are to the predicted values, the smaller the standard error of the estimate
will be.
Example 10‚Äì12 shows how to compute the standard error of the estimate.

This value is close to the value found in Example 10‚Äì12. The difference is due
to rounding.
Prediction Interval
The standard error of the estimate can be used for constructing a prediction interval
(similar to a conÔ¨Ådence interval) about a y	 value.
When a speciÔ¨Åc value x is substituted into the regression equation, the y	that you get
is a point estimate for y. For example, if the regression line equation for the age of a
machine and the monthly maintenance cost is y	 55.57  8.13x (Example 10‚Äì12), then
the predicted maintenance cost for a 3-year-old machine would be y	  55.57  8.13(3),
or $79.96. Since this is a point estimate, you have no idea how accurate it is. But you can
construct a prediction interval about the estimate. By selecting an a value, you can
achieve a (1  a) ‚Ä¢ 100% conÔ¨Ådence that the interval contains the actual mean of the y
values that correspond to the given value of x.
The reason is that there are possible sources of prediction errors in Ô¨Ånding the regres-
sion line equation. One source occurs when Ô¨Ånding the standard error of the estimate sest.
Two others are errors made in estimating the slope and the y	 intercept, since the equa-
tion of the regression line will change somewhat if different random samples are used
when calculating the equation.

Multiple Regression (Optional)
The previous sections explained the concepts of simple linear regression and correlation.
In simple linear regression, the regression equation contains one independent variable x
and one dependent variable y and is written as
y  a  bx
where a is the y intercept and b is the slope of the regression line.
In multiple regression, there are several independent variables and one dependent
variable, and the equation is
y  a  b1x1  b2x2  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  bkxk
where x1, x2, . . . , xk are the independent variables.
For example, suppose a nursing instructor wishes to see whether there is a relation-
ship between a student‚Äôs grade point average, age, and score on the state board nursing
examination. The two independent variables are GPA (denoted by x1) and age (denoted
by x2). The instructor will collect the data for all three variables for a sample of nursing
students. Rather than conduct two separate simple regression studies, one using the GPA
and state board scores and another using ages and state board scores, the instructor can
conduct one study using multiple regression analysis with two independent variables‚Äî
GPA and ages‚Äîand one dependent variable‚Äîstate board scores.
A multiple regression correlation R can also be computed to determine if a signiÔ¨Å-
cant relationship exists between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
Multiple regression analysis is used when a statistician thinks there are several indepen-
dent variables contributing to the variation of the dependent variable. This analysis then
can be used to increase the accuracy of predictions for the dependent variable over one
independent variable alone.
Two other examples for multiple regression analysis are when a store manager wants
to see whether the amount spent on advertising and the amount of Ô¨Çoor space used for a
display affect the amount of sales of a product, and when a sociologist wants to see
whether the amount of time children spend watching television and playing video games
is related to their weight. Multiple regression analysis can also be conducted by using

more than two independent variables, denoted by x1, x2, x3, . . . , xm. Since these compu-
tations are quite complicated and for the most part would be done on a computer, this
chapter will show the computations for two independent variables only.
For example, the nursing instructor wishes to see whether a student‚Äôs grade point
average and age are related to the student‚Äôs score on the state board nursing exami-

SUCCESS
HOME SMART HOME
KIDS WHO GROW UP IN A CLEAN HOUSE FARE BETTER AS ADULTS
Good-bye, GPA. So long, SATs. New 
research suggests that we may be able 
to predict children‚Äôs future success 
from the level of cleanliness in their 
homes.
 A University of Michigan study 
presented at the annual meeting of the 
American Economic Association 
uncovered a surprising correlation: 
children raised in clean homes were 
later found to have completed more 
school and to have higher earning 
potential than those raised in dirty 
homes. The clean homes may indicate 
a family that values organization and 
similarly helpful skills at school and 
work, researchers say.
 Cleanliness ratings for about 5,000 
households were assessed between 
1968 and 1972, and respondents were 
interviewed 25 years later to determine 
educational achievement and profes-
sional earnings of the young adults 
who had grown up there, controlling 
for variables such as race, socio-
economic status and level of parental 
education. The data showed that those 
raised in homes rated ‚Äúclean‚Äù to ‚Äúvery 
clean‚Äù had completed an average of 
1.6 more years of school than those 
raised in ‚Äúnot very clean‚Äù or ‚Äúdirty‚Äù 
homes. Plus, the first group‚Äôs annual 
wages averaged about $3,100 more 
than the second‚Äôs.
 But don't buy stock in Mr. Clean and 
Pine Sol just yet. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not 
advocating that everyone go out and 
clean their homes right this minute,‚Äù 
explains Rachel Dunifon, a University 
of Michigan doctoral candidate and a 
researcher on the study. Rather, the 
main implication of the study, Dunifon 
says, is that there is significant evidence 
that non-cognitive factors, such as 
organization and efficiency, play a role 
in determining academic and financial 
success.

Speaking of 
Statistics
In this study, researchers found a
correlation between the cleanliness of
the homes children are raised in and
the years of schooling completed and
earning potential for those children.
What interfering variables were
controlled? How might these have
been controlled? Summarize the
conclusions of the study.

Section 10‚Äì4 Multiple Regression (Optional)

10‚Äì45
The multiple regression equation obtained from the data is
y	  44.81  87.64x1  14.533x2
If a student has a GPA of 3.0 and is 25 years old, her predicted state board score can
be computed by substituting these values in the equation for x1 and x2, respectively, as
shown.
y	  44.81  87.64(3.0)  14.533(25)
 581.44 or 581
Hence, if a student has a GPA of 3.0 and is 25 years old, the student‚Äôs predicted state
board score is 581.
The Multiple Regression Equation
A multiple regression equation with two independent variables (x1 and x2) and one depen-
dent variable has the form
y	  a  b1x1  b2x2
A multiple regression equation with three independent variables (x1, x2, and x3) and one
dependent variable has the form
y	  a  b1x1  b2x2  b3x3
General Form of the Multiple Regression Equation
The general form of the multiple regression equation with k independent variables is
y	  a  b1x1  b2x2  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  bkxk
The x‚Äôs are the independent variables. The value for a is more or less an intercept,
although a multiple regression equation with two independent variables constitutes a
plane rather than a line. The b‚Äôs are called partial regression coefÔ¨Åcients. Each b repre-
sents the amount of change in y	 for one unit of change in the corresponding x value when
the other x values are held constant. In the example just shown, the regression equation
was y	  44.81  87.64x1  14.533x2. In this case, for each unit of change in the stu-
dent‚Äôs GPA, there is a change of 87.64 units in the state board score with the student‚Äôs
age x2 being held constant. And for each unit of change in x2 (the student‚Äôs age), there is
a change of 14.533 units in the state board score with the GPA held constant.
Assumptions for Multiple Regression
The assumptions for multiple regression are similar to those for simple regression.
1. For any speciÔ¨Åc value of the independent variable, the values of the y variable are
normally distributed. (This is called the normality assumption.)
2. The variances (or standard deviations) for the y variables are the same for each value of
the independent variable. (This is called the equal-variance assumption.)
3. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent
variables. (This is called the linearity assumption.)
4. The independent variables are not correlated. (This is called the nonmulticollinearity
assumption.)
5. The values for the y variables are independent. (This is called the independence
assumption.)

In multiple regression, as in simple regression, the strength of the relationship
between the independent variables and the dependent variable is measured by a correla-
tion coefÔ¨Åcient. This multiple correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is symbolized by R. The value of
R can range from 0 to 1; R can never be negative. The closer to 1, the stronger the
relationship; the closer to 0, the weaker the relationship. The value of R takes into
account all the independent variables and can be computed by using the values of the
individual correlation coefÔ¨Åcients. The formula for the multiple correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
when there are two independent variables is shown next.

The formula for R is

is the value of the correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient for variables x1 and x2.

In this case, R is 0.989, as shown in Example 10‚Äì15. The multiple correlation coef-
Ô¨Åcient is always higher than the individual correlation coefÔ¨Åcients. For this speciÔ¨Åc
example, the multiple correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is higher than the two individual correlation
coefÔ¨Åcients computed by using grade point average and state board scores (

Hence, the correlation between a student‚Äôs grade point average and age with the
student‚Äôs score on the nursing state board examination is 0.989. In this case, there is a
strong relationship among the variables; the value of R is close to 1.00.

As with simple regression, R2 is the coefÔ¨Åcient of multiple determination, and it is
the amount of variation explained by the regression model. The expression 1  R2 rep-
resents the amount of unexplained variation, called the error or residual variation. Since
R  0.989, R2  0.978 and 1  R2  1  0.978  0.022.
Testing the SigniÔ¨Åcance of R
An F test is used to test the signiÔ¨Åcance of R. The hypotheses are
H0: r  0
and
H1: r  0
where r represents the population correlation coefÔ¨Åcient for multiple correlation.
F Test for SigniÔ¨Åcance of R
The formula for the F test is
where n is the number of data groups (x1, x2, . . . , y) and k is the number of independent 
variables.
The degrees of freedom are d.f.N.  n  k and d.f.D.  n  k  1.
F 

Example 10‚Äì16
State Board Scores
Test the signiÔ¨Åcance of the R obtained in Example 10‚Äì15 at a  0.05.
Solution
The critical value obtained from Table H with a  0.05, d.f.N.  3, and d.f.D. 
5  2  1  2 is 19.16. Hence, the decision is to reject the null hypothesis and
conclude that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship among the student‚Äôs GPA, age, and
score on the nursing state board examination.
Adjusted R2
Since the value of R2 is dependent on n (the number of data pairs) and k (the number of
variables), statisticians also calculate what is called an adjusted R2, denoted by 
. This
is based on the number of degrees of freedom.

The adjusted R2 is smaller than R2 and takes into account the fact that when n and k
are approximately equal, the value of R may be artiÔ¨Åcially high, due to sampling error
rather than a true relationship among the variables. This occurs because the chance varia-
tions of all the variables are used in conjunction with one another to derive the regression
equation. Even if the individual correlation coefÔ¨Åcients for each independent variable and
the dependent variable were all zero, the multiple correlation coefÔ¨Åcient due to sampling
error could be higher than zero.
Hence, both R2 and 
are usually reported in a multiple regression analysis.
R2
adj
Example 10‚Äì17
State Board Scores
Calculate the adjusted R2 for the data in Example 10‚Äì16. The value for R is 0.989.
Solution
In this case, when the number of data pairs and the number of independent variables are
accounted for, the adjusted multiple coefÔ¨Åcient of determination is 0.956.
Applying the Concepts 10‚Äì4
More Math Means More Money
In a study to determine a person‚Äôs yearly income 10 years after high school, it was found that
the two biggest predictors are number of math courses taken and number of hours worked per
week during a person‚Äôs senior year of high school. The multiple regression equation generated
from a sample of 20 individuals is

The session window shows the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient for each pair of variables. The multiple
correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is signiÔ¨Åcant at 0.021. Ninety-six percent of the variation from the mean
is explained by the regression equation. The regression equation is SCORE  44.8 
87.6*GPA  1.45*AGE.
Summary
‚Ä¢ Many relationships among variables exist in the real world. One way to determine
whether a linear relationship exists is to use the statistical techniques known as
correlation and regression. The strength and direction of a linear relationship are
measured by the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient. It can assume values between
and including 1 and 1. The closer the value of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is to
1 or 1, the stronger the linear relationship is between the variables. A value of
1 or 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship. A positive relationship between
two variables means that for small values of the independent variable, the values
of the dependent variable will be small, and that for large values of the independent
variable, the values of the dependent variable will be large. A negative relationship
between two variables means that for small values of the independent variable,
the values of the dependent variable will be large, and that for large values of the
independent variable, the values of the dependent variable will be small. (10‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Remember that a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between two variables does not necessarily
mean that one variable is a direct cause of the other variable. In some cases this is
true, but other possibilities that should be considered include a complex relationship
involving other (perhaps unknown) variables, a third variable interacting with both
variables, or a relationship due solely to chance. (10‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Relationships can be linear or curvilinear. To determine the shape, you draw a scatter
plot of the variables. If the relationship is linear, the data can be approximated by a
straight line, called the regression line, or the line of best Ô¨Åt. The closer the value

of r is to 1 or 1, the more closely the points will Ô¨Åt the
line. (10‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ A residual plot can be used to determine if the regression
line equation can be used for predictions. (10‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ The coefÔ¨Åcient of determination is a better indicator of the
strength of a linear relationship than the correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient. It is better because it identiÔ¨Åes the percentage
of variation of the dependent variable that is directly
attributable to the variation of the independent variable.
The coefÔ¨Åcient of determination is obtained by squaring
the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient and converting the result to a
percentage. (10‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ Another statistic used in correlation and regression is the
standard error of the estimate, which is an estimate of the
standard deviation of the y values about the predicted y	
values. The standard error of the estimate can be used to
construct a prediction interval about a speciÔ¨Åc value point
estimate y	 of the mean of the y values for a given value of
x. (10‚Äì3)
‚Ä¢ In addition, relationships can be multiple. That is, there
can be two or more independent variables and one depen-
dent variable. A coefÔ¨Åcient of correlation and a regression
equation can be found for multiple relationships, just as
they can be found for simple relationships. (10‚Äì4)

Do Dust Storms Affect Respiratory Health?‚ÄîRevisited
The researchers correlated the dust pollutant levels in the atmosphere and the number of daily
emergency room visits for several respiratory disorders, such as bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma,
and pneumonia. Using the Pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, they found overall a signiÔ¨Åcant
but low correlation, r  0.13, for bronchitis visits only. However, they found a much higher
correlation value for sinusitis, P-value  0.08, when pollutant levels exceeded maximums set
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In addition, they found statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
correlation coefÔ¨Åcients r  0.94 for sinusitis visits and r  0.74 for upper-respiratory-tract
infection visits 2 days after the dust pollutants exceeded the maximum levels set by the EPA.

Use a signiÔ¨Åcance level of 0.05 for all tests below.
1. Business and Finance Use the stocks in data project 1
of Chapter 2 identiÔ¨Åed as the Dow Jones Industrials as
the sample. For each, note the current price and the
amount of the last year‚Äôs dividends. Are the two
variables linearly related? How much variability in
amount of dividend is explainable by the price?
2. Sports and Leisure For each team in major league
baseball note the number of wins the team had last year
and the number of home runs by its best home run
hitter. Is the number of wins linearly related to the
number of home runs hit? How much variability in total
wins is explained by home runs hit? Write a regression
equation to determine how many wins you would
expect a team to have, knowing their top home run
output.
3. Technology Use the data collected in data project 3
of Chapter 2 for this problem. For the data set note
the length of the song and the year it was released. Is
there a linear relationship between the length of a
song and the year it was released? Is the sign on the
correlation coefÔ¨Åcient positive or negative? What does
the sign on the coefÔ¨Åcient indicate about the
relationship?
4. Health and Wellness Use a fast-food restaurant to
compile your data. For each menu item note its fat
grams and its total calories. Is there a linear relationship
between the two variables? How much variance in total
calories is explained by fat grams? Write a regression
equation to determine how many total calories you
would expect in an item, knowing its fat grams.
5. Politics and Economics For each state Ô¨Ånd its average
SAT Math score, SAT English score, and average
household income. Which has the strongest linear
relationship, SAT Math and SAT English, SAT Math
and income, or SAT English and income?
6. Your Class Use the data collected in data project 6
of Chapter 2 regarding heart rates. Is there a linear
relationship between the heart rates before and after
exercise? How much of the variability in heart rate after
exercise is explainable by heart rate before exercise?
Write a regression equation to determine what heart rate
after exercise you would expect for a person, given the
person‚Äôs heart rate before exercise.

Stopping Distances Revisited
1. The linear regression equation is
2. The slope says that for each additional mile per hour a
car is traveling, we expect the stopping distance to
increase by 6.45 feet, on average. The y intercept is the
braking distance we would expect for a car traveling
0 mph‚Äîthis is meaningless in this context, but is an
important part of the model.
3.
The braking
distance for a car traveling 45 mph is approximately
138 feet.
4.
The braking
distance for a car traveling 100 mph is approximately
493 feet.
5. It is not appropriate to make predictions of braking
distance for speeds outside of the given data values
(for example, the 100 mph above) because we know
nothing about the relationship between the two
variables outside of the range of the data.
Section 10‚Äì3
Interpreting Simple Linear
Regression
1. Both variables are moving in the same direction.
In others words, the two variables are positively
associated. This is so because the correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient is positive.
2. The unexplained variation of 3026.49 measures the
distances from the prediction line to the actual values.
3. The slope of the regression line is 0.725983.
4. The y intercept is 16.5523.
5. The critical value of 0.378419 can be found in a table.
6. The allowable risk of making a type I error is 0.10, the
level of signiÔ¨Åcance.
7. The variation explained by the regression is 0.631319,
or about 63.1%.
8. The average scatter of points about the regression line is
12.9668, the standard error of the estimate.
9. The null hypothesis is that there is no correlation,
10. We compare the test statistic of 0.794556 to the
critical value to see if the null hypothesis should
be rejected.

11. Since 0.794556  0.378419, we reject the null
hypothesis and Ô¨Ånd that there is enough evidence to
conclude that the correlation is not equal to zero.

More Math Means 
More Money
1. The dependent variable is yearly income 10 years after
high school.
2. The independent variables are number of math courses
taken and number of hours worked per week during the
senior year of high school.
3. Multiple regression assumes that the independent
variables are not highly correlated.
4. We expect a person‚Äôs yearly income 10 years after
high school to be $4540 more, on average, for each
additional math course taken, all other variables held
constant. We expect a person‚Äôs yearly income 10 years
after high school to be $1290 more, on average, for each
additional hour worked per week during the senior
year of high school, all other variables held constant.
5.
The
predicted yearly income 10 years after high school
is $68,120.
6. The multiple correlation coefÔ¨Åcient of 0.77 means that
there is a fairly strong positive relationship between the
independent variables (number of math courses and
hours worked during senior year of high school) and the
dependent variable (yearly income 10 years after high
school).
7.
8.
9. The equation appears to be a fairly good predictor of
income, since 54.5% of the variation in yearly income
10 years after high school is explained by the
regression model.
10. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that yearly
income 10 years after high school increases with more
math classes and more hours of work during the senior
year of high school. The number of math classes has a
higher coefÔ¨Åcient, so more math does mean more money!

Statistics and Heredity
An Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel (1822‚Äì1884), studied genetics, and his principles are
the foundation for modern genetics. Mendel used his spare time to grow a variety of peas
at the monastery. One of his many experiments involved crossbreeding peas that had
smooth yellow seeds with peas that had wrinkled green seeds. He noticed that the results
occurred with regularity. That is, some of the offspring had smooth yellow seeds, some
had smooth green seeds, some had wrinkled yellow seeds, and some had wrinkled green
seeds. Furthermore, after several experiments, the percentages of each type seemed to
remain approximately the same. Mendel formulated his theory based on the assumption
of dominant and recessive traits and tried to predict the results. He then crossbred his
peas and examined 556 seeds over the next generation.
Finally, he compared the actual results with the theoretical results to see if his theory
was correct. To do this, he used a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù chi-square test, which is explained in this
chapter. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of this chapter.

Introduction
The chi-square distribution was used in Chapters 7 and 8 to Ô¨Ånd a conÔ¨Ådence interval for
a variance or standard deviation and to test a hypothesis about a single variance or stan-
dard deviation.
It can also be used for tests concerning frequency distributions, such as ‚ÄúIf a sample
of buyers is given a choice of automobile colors, will each color be selected with the
same frequency?‚Äù The chi-square distribution can be used to test the independence of

two variables, for example, ‚ÄúAre senators‚Äô opinions on gun control independent of party
afÔ¨Åliations?‚Äù That is, do the Republicans feel one way and the Democrats feel differently,
or do they have the same opinion?
Finally, the chi-square distribution can be used to test the homogeneity of propor-
tions. For example, is the proportion of high school seniors who attend college immedi-
ately after graduating the same for the northern, southern, eastern, and western parts of
the United States?
This chapter explains the chi-square distribution and its applications. In addition to
the applications mentioned here, chi-square has many other uses in statistics.

Test for Goodness of Fit
In addition to being used to test a single variance, the chi-square statistic can be used to
see whether a frequency distribution Ô¨Åts a speciÔ¨Åc pattern. For example, to meet cus-
tomer demands, a manufacturer of running shoes may wish to see whether buyers show
a preference for a speciÔ¨Åc style. A trafÔ¨Åc engineer may wish to see whether accidents
occur more often on some days than on others, so that she can increase police patrols
accordingly. An emergency service may want to see whether it receives more calls at cer-
tain times of the day than at others, so that it can provide adequate stafÔ¨Ång.
When you are testing to see whether a frequency distribution Ô¨Åts a speciÔ¨Åc pattern,
you can use the chi-square goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test. For example, suppose as a market analyst
you wished to see whether consumers have any preference among Ô¨Åve Ô¨Çavors of a new
fruit soda. A sample of 100 people provided these data:
Cherry
Strawberry
Orange
Lime
Grape
32
28
16
14
10
If there were no preference, you would expect each Ô¨Çavor to be selected with equal fre-
quency. In this case, the equal frequency is 1005  20. That is, approximately 20 peo-
ple would select each Ô¨Çavor.
Since the frequencies for each Ô¨Çavor were obtained from a sample, these actual fre-
quencies are called the observed frequencies. The frequencies obtained by calculation
(as if there were no preference) are called the expected frequencies. A completed table
for the test is shown.

The observed frequencies will almost always differ from the expected frequencies
due to sampling error; that is, the values differ from sample to sample. But the question
is: Are these differences signiÔ¨Åcant (a preference exists), or are they due to chance? The
chi-square goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test will enable the researcher to determine the answer.
Before computing the test value, you must state the hypotheses. The null hypothesis
should be a statement indicating that there is no difference or no change. For this exam-
ple, the hypotheses are as follows:
H0: Consumers show no preference for Ô¨Çavors of the fruit soda.
H1: Consumers show a preference.
In the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test, the degrees of freedom are equal to the number of cate-
gories minus 1. For this example, there are Ô¨Åve categories (cherry, strawberry, orange,
lime, and grape); hence, the degrees of freedom are 5  1  4. This is so because the

Karl Pearson
(1857‚Äì1936) Ô¨Årst
used the chi-square
distribution as a
goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test for
data. He developed
many types of
descriptive graphs
and gave them
unusual names such
as stigmograms,
topograms,
stereograms,
and radiograms.

Two assumptions are needed for the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test. These assumptions are
given next.

Assumptions for the Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test
1. The data are obtained from a random sample.
2. The expected frequency for each category must be 5 or more.
This test is a right-tailed test, since when the O  E values are squared, the answer
will be positive or zero. This formula is explained in Example 11‚Äì1.
Example 11‚Äì1
Fruit Soda Flavor Preference
Is there enough evidence to reject the claim that there is no preference in the selection
of fruit soda Ô¨Çavors, using the data shown previously? Let a  0.05.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: Consumers show no preference for Ô¨Çavors (claim).
H1: Consumers show a preference.
Step 2
Find the critical value. The degrees of freedom are 5  1  4, and a  0.05.
Hence, the critical value from Table G in Appendix C is 9.488.
Step 3
Compute the test value by subtracting the expected value from the
corresponding observed value, squaring the result and dividing by the
expected value, and Ô¨Ånding the sum. The expected value for each category
is 20, as shown previously.
Step 4
Make the decision. The decision is to reject the null hypothesis, since 
18.0  9.488, as shown in Figure 11‚Äì1.

egory is Ô¨Åxed.

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to reject the claim that
consumers show no preference for the Ô¨Çavors.
To get some idea of why this test is called the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test, examine graphs
of the observed values and expected values. See Figure 11‚Äì2. From the graphs, you can
see whether the observed values and expected values are close together or far apart.

When the observed values and expected values are close together, the chi-square test
value will be small. Then the decision will be to not reject the null hypothesis‚Äîhence,
there is ‚Äúa good Ô¨Åt.‚Äù See Figure 11‚Äì3(a). When the observed values and the expected val-
ues are far apart, the chi-square test value will be large. Then the null hypothesis will be
rejected‚Äîhence, there is ‚Äúnot a good Ô¨Åt.‚Äù See Figure 11‚Äì3(b).

Example 11‚Äì2
Retired Senior Executives Return to Work
The Russel Reynold Association surveyed retired senior executives who had returned
to work. They found that after returning to work, 38% were employed by another
organization, 32% were self-employed, 23% were either freelancing or consulting, and
7% had formed their own companies. To see if these percentages are consistent with
those of Allegheny County residents, a local researcher surveyed 300 retired executives
who had returned to work and found that 122 were working for another company, 85
were self-employed, 76 were either freelancing or consulting, and 17 had formed their
own companies. At a  0.10, test the claim that the percentages are the same for those
people in Allegheny County.
Source: Michael L. Shook and Robert D. Shook, The Book of Odds.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim. 
H0: The retired executives who returned to work are distributed as follows:
38% are employed by another organization, 32% are self-employed,
23% are either freelancing or consulting, and 7% have formed their
own companies (claim).
H1: The distribution is not the same as stated in the null hypothesis.
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since a  0.10 and the degrees of freedom are
4  1  3, the critical value is 6.251.
Step 3
Compute the test value. The expected values are computed as follows:
0.38  300  114
0.23  300  69
0.32  300  96
0.07  300  21

Step 4
Make the decision. Since 3.2939  6.251, the decision is not to reject the null
hypothesis. See Figure 11‚Äì4.

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the claim. It can
be concluded that the percentages are not signiÔ¨Åcantly different from those
given in the null hypothesis.
Example 11‚Äì3
Firearm Deaths
A researcher read that Ô¨Årearm-related deaths for people aged 1 to 18 were distributed as
follows: 74% were accidental, 16% were homicides, and 10% were suicides. In her
district, there were 68 accidental deaths, 27 homicides, and 5 suicides during the past
year. At a  0.10, test the claim that the percentages are equal.
Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim:
H0: The deaths due to Ô¨Årearms for people aged 1 through 18 are distributed as
follows: 74% accidental, 16% homicides, and 10% suicides (claim).
H1: The distribution is not the same as stated in the null hypothesis.
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since a  0.10 and the degrees of freedom are
3  1  2, the critical value is 4.605.
Step 3
Compute the test value. The expected values are as follows:
0.74  100  74

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to reject the claim that the
distribution is 74% accidental, 16% homicides, and 10% suicides.
The P-value method of hypothesis testing can also be used for the chi-square tests
explained in this chapter. The P-values for chi-square are found in Table G in Appen-
dix C. The method used to Ô¨Ånd the P-value for a chi-square test value is the same as the
method shown in Section 8‚Äì5. The P-value for x2  3.2939 with d.f.  3 (for the data
in Example 11‚Äì2) is greater than 0.10 since 6.251 is the value in Table G for a  0.10.
(The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.348.) Hence P-value  0.10. The decision
is to not reject the null hypothesis, which is consistent with the decision made in Exam-
ple 11‚Äì2 using the traditional method of hypothesis testing.
For use of the chi-square goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test, statisticians have determined that the
expected frequencies should be at least 5, as stated in the assumptions. The reasoning is
as follows: The chi-square distribution is continuous, whereas the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test is
discrete. However, the continuous distribution is a good approximation and can be used
when the expected value for each class is at least 5. If an expected frequency of a class
is less than 5, then that class can be combined with another class so that the expected fre-
quency is 5 or more.
Test of Normality (Optional)
The chi-square goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test can be used to test a variable to see if it is normally
distributed. The null hypotheses are
H0: The variable is normally distributed.
H1: The variable is not normally distributed.
The procedure is somewhat complicated. It involves Ô¨Ånding the expected frequen-
cies for each class of a frequency distribution by using the standard normal distribution.
Then the actual frequencies (i.e., observed frequencies) are compared to the expected fre-
quencies, using the chi-square goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test. If the observed frequencies are close
in value to the expected frequencies, the chi-square test value will be small, and the null
hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, it can be concluded that the variable is
approximately normally distributed.
On the other hand, if there is a large difference between the observed frequencies and
the expected frequencies, the chi-square test value will be larger, and the null hypothesis
can be rejected. In this case, it can be concluded that the variable is not normally dis-
tributed. Example 11‚Äì4 illustrates the procedure for the chi-square test of normality. To
Ô¨Ånd the areas in the examples, you might want to review Section 6‚Äì2.
Example 11‚Äì4 shows how to do the calculations.

The critical value in this test has the degrees of freedom equal to the number of
categories 3 since one degree of freedom is lost for each parameter that is estimated.
In this case, the mean and standard deviation have been estimated so two additional
degrees of freedom are needed.
The C.V. with d.f.  2 and a  0.05 is 5.991, so the null hypothesis is rejected.
Hence, the distribution can be considered not normally distributed.
Note: At a  0.01, the C.V.  9.210 and the null hypotheses would not be rejected.
So it is important to decide which critical value should be used.

12. Ages of Head Start Program Students The Head
Start Program provides a wide range of services to low-
income children up to the age of 5 and their families. Its
goals are to provide services to improve social and
learning skills and to improve health and nutrition status
so that the participants can begin school on an equal
footing with their more advantaged peers. The
distribution of ages for participating children is as
follows: 4% Ô¨Åve-year-olds, 52% four-year-olds, 34%
three-year-olds, and 10% under 3 years. When the
program was assessed in a particular region, it was
found that of the 200 participants, 20 were 5 years old,
120 were 4 years old, 40 were 3 years old, and 20 were
under 3 years. Is there sufÔ¨Åcient evidence at a  0.05

Tests Using Contingency Tables
When data can be tabulated in table form in terms of frequencies, several types of
hypotheses can be tested by using the chi-square test.
Two such tests are the independence of variables test and the homogeneity of pro-
portions test. The test of independence of variables is used to determine whether two
variables are independent of or related to each other when a single sample is selected.
The test of homogeneity of proportions is used to determine whether the proportions for
a variable are equal when several samples are selected from different populations. Both
tests use the chi-square distribution and a contingency table, and the test value is found
in the same way. The independence test will be explained Ô¨Årst.
Test for Independence
The chi-square independence test can be used to test the independence of two variables.
For example, suppose a new postoperative procedure is administered to a number of
patients in a large hospital. The researcher can ask the question, Do the doctors feel dif-
ferently about this procedure from the nurses, or do they feel basically the same way?
Note that the question is not whether they prefer the procedure but whether there is a dif-
ference of opinion between the two groups.
To answer this question, a researcher selects a sample of nurses and doctors and tab-
ulates the data in table form, as shown.
Prefer new
Prefer old
No
Group
procedure
procedure
preference
Nurses
100
80
20
Doctors
50
120
30
As the survey indicates, 100 nurses prefer the new procedure, 80 prefer the old pro-
cedure, and 20 have no preference; 50 doctors prefer the new procedure, 120 like the old
procedure, and 30 have no preference. Since the main question is whether there is a dif-
ference in opinion, the null hypothesis is stated as follows:
H0: The opinion about the procedure is independent of the profession.
The alternative hypothesis is stated as follows:
H1: The opinion about the procedure is dependent on the profession.
If the null hypothesis is not rejected, the test means that both professions feel basi-
cally the same way about the procedure and the differences are due to chance. If the null
hypothesis is rejected, the test means that one group feels differently about the procedure
from the other. Remember that rejection does not mean that one group favors the proce-
dure and the other does not. Perhaps both groups favor it or both dislike it, but in differ-
ent proportions.
To test the null hypothesis by using the chi-square independence test, you must com-
pute the expected frequencies, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. These frequen-
cies are computed by using the observed frequencies given in the table.
When data are arranged in table form for the chi-square independence test, the table
is called a contingency table. The table is made up of R rows and C columns. The table
here has two rows and three columns.

A contingency table is designated as an R  C (rows by columns) table. In this case,
R  2 and C  3; hence, this table is a 2  3 contingency table. Each block in the table
is called a cell and is designated by its row and column position. For example, the cell with
a frequency of 80 is designated as C1,2, or row 1, column 2. The cells are shown below.
Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
Row 1
C1,1
C1,2
C1,3
Row 2
C2,1
C2,2
C2,3
The degrees of freedom for any contingency table are (rows  1) times
(columns  1); that is, d.f.  (R  1)(C  1). In this case, (2  1)(3  1)  (1)(2)  2.
The reason for this formula for d.f. is that all the expected values except one are free to
vary in each row and in each column.
Using the previous table, you can compute the expected frequencies for each block
(or cell), as shown next.
1. Find the sum of each row and each column, and Ô¨Ånd the grand total, as shown.

2. For each cell, multiply the corresponding row sum by the column sum and divide
by the grand total, to get the expected value:
For example, for C1,2, the expected value, denoted by E1,2, is (refer to the previous
tables)
For each cell, the expected values are computed as follows:
The expected values can now be placed in the corresponding cells along with the
observed values, as shown.

The rationale for the computation of the expected frequencies for a contingency table
uses proportions. For C1,1 a total of 150 out of 400 people prefer the new procedure. And
since there are 200 nurses, you would expect, if the null hypothesis were true,
(150400)(200), or 75, of the nurses to be in favor of the new procedure.

Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that the
amount of alcohol a person consumes is dependent on the individual‚Äôs gender.
Step 4
Make the decision. The decision is to not reject the null hypothesis, since
0.283  4.605. See Figure 11‚Äì8.
Test for Homogeneity of Proportions
The second chi-square test that uses a contingency table is called the homogeneity of
proportions test. In this situation, samples are selected from several different populations,
and the researcher is interested in determining whether the proportions of elements that
have a common characteristic are the same for each population. The sample sizes are
speciÔ¨Åed in advance, making either the row totals or column totals in the contingency
table known before the samples are selected. For example, a researcher may select a
sample of 50 freshmen, 50 sophomores, 50 juniors, and 50 seniors and then Ô¨Ånd the pro-
portion of students who are smokers in each level. The researcher will then compare the
proportions for each group to see if they are equal. The hypotheses in this case would be
H0: p1  p2  p3  p4
H1: At least one proportion is different from the others.
If the researcher does not reject the null hypothesis, it can be assumed that the pro-
portions are equal and the differences in them are due to chance. Hence, the proportion of
students who smoke is the same for grade levels freshmen through senior. When the null
hypothesis is rejected, it can be assumed that the proportions are not all equal. The
computational procedure is the same as that for the test of independence shown in
Example 11‚Äì7.
Objective 
Test proportions for
homogeneity, using
chi-square.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: p1  p2  p3  p4 (claim)
H1: At least one proportion differs from the others.
Step 2
Find the critical value. The formula for the degrees of freedom is the same as
before: (R  1)(C  1)  (2  1)(4  1)  1(3)  3. The critical value is
7.815.
Step 3
Compute the test value. Since we want to test the claim that the proportions
are equal, we use the expected value as 
and the formula 
.

Assumptions for the Chi-Square Independence and Homogeneity Tests
1. The data are obtained from a random sample.
2. The expected value in each cell must be 5 or more.
When the degrees of freedom for a contingency table are equal to 1‚Äîthat is, the table
is a 2  2 table‚Äîsome statisticians suggest using the Yates correction for continuity. The
formula for the test is then
Since the chi-square test is already conservative, most statisticians agree that the Yates
correction is not necessary. (See Exercise 33 in Exercises 11‚Äì2.)

Speaking of 
Statistics
Does Color Affect Your Appetite?
It has been suggested that color is related
to appetite in humans. For example, if the
walls in a restaurant are painted certain
colors, it is thought that the customer will
eat more food. A study was done at the
University of Illinois and the University
of Pennsylvania. When people were given
six varieties of jellybeans mixed in a bowl
or separated by color, they ate about twice
as many from the bowl with the mixed
jellybeans as from the bowls that were
separated by color.
It is thought that when the jellybeans
were mixed, people felt that it offered a
greater variety of choices, and the variety
of choices increased their appetites.
In this case one variable‚Äîcolor‚Äîis
categorical, and the other variable‚Äî
amount of jellybeans eaten‚Äîis
numerical. Could a chi-square goodness-
of-Ô¨Åt test be used here? If so, suggest
how it could be set up.

Summary
‚Ä¢ Three uses of the chi-square distribution were explained in this chapter. It can be
used as a goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test to determine whether the frequencies of a distribution
are the same as the hypothesized frequencies. For example, is the number of
defective parts produced by a factory the same each day? This test is always a right-
tailed test. (11‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ The test of independence is used to determine whether two variables are related or
are independent. This test uses a contingency table and is always a right-tailed test.
An example of its use is a test to determine whether the attitudes of urban residents
about the recycling of trash differ from the attitudes of rural residents. (11‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ Finally, the homogeneity of proportions test is used to determine if several propor-
tions are all equal when samples are selected from different populations. (11‚Äì2)
The chi-square distribution is also used for other types of statistical hypothesis
tests, such as the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is explained in Chapter 13.

1. TrafÔ¨Åc Accident Fatalities A trafÔ¨Åc safety report
indicated that for the 21‚Äì24 year age group, 31.58% of
trafÔ¨Åc fatalities were victims who had used a seat belt.
Victims who were not wearing a seat belt accounted for
59.83% of the deaths, and the status of the rest was
unknown. A study of 120 trafÔ¨Åc fatalities in a particular
region showed that for this age group, 35 of the victims
had used a seat belt, 78 had not, and the status of the
rest was unknown. At a  0.05 is there sufÔ¨Åcient

Mendel‚Äôs genetic theory is simple but useful in predicting the results of hybridization.
A Fly in the Ointment
Although Mendel‚Äôs theory is basically correct, an English statistician named R.A. Fisher examined
Mendel‚Äôs data some 50 years later. He found that the observed (actual) results agreed too closely
with the expected (theoretical) results and concluded that the data had in some way been falsiÔ¨Åed.
The results were too good to be true. Several explanations have been proposed, ranging from
deliberate misinterpretation to an assistant‚Äôs error, but no one can be sure how this happened.

Is Seeing Really Believing?
Many adults look on the eyewitness testimony of children with skepticism. They believe
that young witnesses‚Äô testimony is less accurate than the testimony of adults in court
cases. Several statistical studies have been done on this subject.
In a preliminary study, three researchers selected fourteen 8-year-olds, fourteen
12-year-olds, and fourteen adults. The researchers showed each group the same video of
a crime being committed. The next day, each witness responded to direct and cross-
examination questioning. Then the researchers, using statistical methods explained in
this chapter, were able to determine if there were differences in the accuracy of the testi-
mony of the three groups on direct examination and on cross-examination. The statisti-
cal methods used here differ from the ones explained in Chapter 9 because there are three
groups rather than two. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of this chapter.

Introduction
The F test, used to compare two variances as shown in Chapter 9, can also be used to
compare three or more means. This technique is called analysis of variance, or ANOVA.
It is used to test claims involving three or more means. (Note: The F test can also be used
to test the equality of two means. But since it is equivalent to the t test in this case, the
t test is usually used instead of the F test when there are only two means.) For example,
suppose a researcher wishes to see whether the means of the time it takes three groups of
students to solve a computer problem using Fortran, Basic, and Pascal are different. The
researcher will use the ANOVA technique for this test. The z and t tests should not be
used when three or more means are compared, for reasons given later in this chapter.
For three groups, the F test can only show whether a difference exists among the
three means. It cannot reveal where the difference lies‚Äîthat is, between 
1 and 
2, or 
1 and 
3, or 
2 and 
3. If the F test indicates that there is a difference among the means,
other statistical tests are used to Ô¨Ånd where the difference exists. The most commonly
used tests are the Scheff√© test and the Tukey test, which are also explained in this chapter.

Historical Note
The methods of
analysis of variance
were developed by
R. A. Fisher in the
early 1920s.

The analysis of variance that is used to compare three or more means is called a one-
way analysis of variance since it contains only one variable. In the previous example, the
variable is the type of computer language used. The analysis of variance can be extended
to studies involving two variables, such as type of computer language used and mathe-
matical background of the students. These studies involve a two-way analysis of variance.
Section 12‚Äì3 explains the two-way analysis of variance.
Section 12‚Äì1 One-Way Analysis of Variance
631
12‚Äì3
12‚Äì1
One-Way Analysis of Variance
When an F test is used to test a hypothesis concerning the means of three or more popu-
lations, the technique is called analysis of variance (commonly abbreviated as ANOVA).
At Ô¨Årst glance, you might think that to compare the means of three or more samples, you
can use the t test, comparing two means at a time. But there are several reasons why the
t test should not be done.
First, when you are comparing two means at a time, the rest of the means under study
are ignored. With the F test, all the means are compared simultaneously. Second, when
you are comparing two means at a time and making all pairwise comparisons, the proba-
bility of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true is increased, since the more t tests
that are conducted, the greater is the likelihood of getting signiÔ¨Åcant differences by
chance alone. Third, the more means there are to compare, the more t tests are needed.
For example, for the comparison of 3 means two at a time, 3 t tests are required. For the
comparison of 5 means two at a time, 10 tests are required. And for the comparison of
10 means two at a time, 45 tests are required.
Assumptions for the F Test for Comparing Three or More Means
1. The populations from which the samples were obtained must be normally or
approximately normally distributed.
2. The samples must be independent of one another.
3. The variances of the populations must be equal.
Objective 
Use the one-way
ANOVA technique to
determine if there is a
signiÔ¨Åcant difference
among three or more
means.
1
Even though you are comparing three or more means in this use of the F test, vari-
ances are used in the test instead of means.
With the F test, two different estimates of the population variance are made. The Ô¨Årst
estimate is called the between-group variance, and it involves Ô¨Ånding the variance of
the means. The second estimate, the within-group variance, is made by computing the
variance using all the data and is not affected by differences in the means. If there is no
difference in the means, the between-group variance estimate will be approximately
equal to the within-group variance estimate, and the F test value will be approximately
equal to 1. The null hypothesis will not be rejected. However, when the means differ
signiÔ¨Åcantly, the between-group variance will be much larger than the within-group vari-
ance; the F test value will be signiÔ¨Åcantly greater than 1; and the null hypothesis will be
rejected. Since variances are compared, this procedure is called analysis of variance
(ANOVA).
For a test of the difference among three or more means, the following hypotheses
should be used:
H0: m1  m2      mk
H1: At least one mean is different from the others.

As stated previously, a signiÔ¨Åcant test value means that there is a high probability
that this difference in means is not due to chance, but it does not indicate where the dif-
ference lies.
The degrees of freedom for this F test are d.f.N.  k  1, where k is the number of
groups, and d.f.D.  N  k, where N is the sum of the sample sizes of the groups
N  n1  n2      nk. The sample sizes need not be equal. The F test to compare
means is always right-tailed.
Examples 12‚Äì1 and 12‚Äì2 illustrate the computational procedure for the ANOVA
technique for comparing three or more means, and the steps are summarized in the
Procedure Table shown after the examples.

Lowering Blood Pressure
A researcher wishes to try three different techniques to lower the blood pressure
of individuals diagnosed with high blood pressure. The subjects are randomly
assigned to three groups; the Ô¨Årst group takes medication, the second group exercises,
and the third group follows a special diet. After four weeks, the reduction in each
person‚Äôs blood pressure is recorded. At a  0.05, test the claim that there is no
difference among the means. The data are shown.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: m1  m2  m3 (claim)
H1: At least one mean is different from the others.
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since k  3 and N  15,

The critical value is 3.89, obtained from Table H in Appendix C with 
a  0.05.
Step 3
Compute the test value, using the procedure outlined here.
a. Find the mean and variance of each sample (these values are shown below
the data).
b. Find the grand mean. The grand mean, denoted by 
, is the mean of all
values in the samples.
When samples are equal in size, Ô¨Ånd

by k, where k  the number of groups.

c. Find the between-group variance, denoted by .
Note: This formula Ô¨Ånds the variance among the means by using the
sample sizes as weights and considers the differences in the means.
d. Find the within-group variance, denoted by 
.
Note: This formula Ô¨Ånds an overall variance by calculating a weighted
average of the individual variances. It does not involve using differences of
the means.
e. Find the F test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. The decision is to reject the null hypothesis, since 
9.17  3.89.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to reject the claim and
conclude that at least one mean is different from the others.
The numerator of the fraction obtained in step 3, part c, of the computational proce-
dure is called the sum of squares between groups, denoted by SSB. The numerator of the
fraction obtained in step 3, part d, of the computational procedure is called the sum of
squares within groups, denoted by SSW. This statistic is also called the sum of squares
for the error. SSB is divided by d.f.N. to obtain the between-group variance. SSW is divided
by N  k to obtain the within-group or error variance. These two variances are sometimes
called mean squares, denoted by MSB and MSW. These terms are used to summarize the
analysis of variance and are placed in a summary table, as shown in Table 12‚Äì1.

The P-values for ANOVA are found by using the procedure shown in Section 9‚Äì2.
For Example 12‚Äì2, Ô¨Ånd the two a values in the tables for the F distribution (Table H),
using d.f.N.  2 and d.f.D.  15, where F  5.05 falls between. In this case, 5.05
falls between 4.77 and 6.36, corresponding, respectively, to a  0.025 and a  0.01;
hence, 0.01  P-value  0.025. Since the P-value is between 0.01 and 0.025 and since
P-value  0.05 (the originally chosen value for a), the decision is to reject the null
hypothesis. (The P-value obtained from a calculator is 0.021.)
When the null hypothesis is rejected in ANOVA, it only means that at least one mean
is different from the others. To locate the difference or differences among the means, it
is necessary to use other tests such as the Tukey or the Scheff√© test.

The Scheff√© Test and the Tukey Test
When the null hypothesis is rejected using the F test, the researcher may want to know
where the difference among the means is. Several procedures have been developed to
determine where the signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the means lie after the ANOVA procedure
has been performed. Among the most commonly used tests are the Scheff√© test and the
Tukey test.
Scheff√© Test
To conduct the Scheff√© test, you must compare the means two at a time, using all possi-
ble combinations of means. For example, if there are three means, the following com-
parisons must be done:
1 versus 
2
1 versus 
3
2 versus 
3

Using the Scheff√© test, test each pair of means in Example 12‚Äì1 to see whether a

Solution
a. For
1 versus 
2,
b. For
2 versus 
3,
c. For 
1 versus 
3,
The critical value for the analysis of variance for Example 12‚Äì1 was 3.89, found
by using Table H with a  0.05, d.f.N.  k  1  2, and d.f.D.  N  k  12. In this
case, it is multiplied by k  1 as shown.
The critical value for F	 at a  0.05, with d.f.N.  2 and d.f.D.  12, is
(k  1)(C.V.)  (3  1)(3.89)  7.78
Since only the F test value for part a (
1 versus 
2) is greater than the critical value,
7.78, the only signiÔ¨Åcant difference is between 
1 and 
2, that is, between medication
and exercise.
On occasion, when the F test value is greater than the critical value, the Scheff√© test
may not show any signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the pairs of means. This result occurs because
the difference may actually lie in the average of two or more means when compared with
the other mean. The Scheff√© test can be used to make these types of comparisons, but the
technique is beyond the scope of this book.

KNEE PAIN
You sign up for a clinical trial of 
arthroscopic surgery used to relieve knee 
pain caused by arthritis. You√≠re sedated 
and wake up with tiny incisions. Soon 
your bum knee feels better. Two years 
later you find out you had ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù 
surgery. In a study at the Houston VA 
Medical Center, researchers divided 180 
patients into three groups: two groups had 
damaged cartilage removed, while the 
third got simulated surgery. Yet an equal 
number of patients in all groups felt better 
after two years. Some 650,000 people 
have the surgery annually, but they‚Äôre 
wasting their money, says Dr. Nelda P. 
Wray, who led the study. And the patients 
who got fake surgery? ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt angry 
at us,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey still report feeling 
better.‚Äù

Speaking of 
Statistics
This study involved three groups. The
results showed that patients in all three
groups felt better after 2 years. State
possible null and alternative hypotheses
for this study. Was the null hypothesis
rejected? Explain how the statistics could
have been used to arrive at the conclusion.
When the absolute value of q is greater than the critical value for the Tukey test, there
is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the two means being compared. The procedures for
Ô¨Ånding q and the critical value from Table N in Appendix C for the Tukey test are shown
in Example 12‚Äì4.
Example 12‚Äì4
Using the Tukey test, test each pair of means in Example 12‚Äì1 to see whether a speciÔ¨Åc
difference exists, at a  0.05.

Finding the Critical
Value in Table N for
the Tukey Test
(Example 12‚Äì4)
You might wonder why there are two different tests that can be used after the ANOVA.
Actually, there are several other tests that can be used in addition to the Scheff√© and
Tukey tests. It is up to the researcher to select the most appropriate test. The Scheff√©
test is the most general, and it can be used when the samples are of different sizes.
Furthermore, the Scheff√© test can be used to make comparisons such as the average of
1 and 
2 compared with 
3. However, the Tukey test is more powerful than the Scheff√©
test for making pairwise comparisons for the means. A rule of thumb for pairwise com-
parisons is to use the Tukey test when the samples are equal in size and the Scheff√© test
when the samples differ in size. This rule will be followed in this textbook.
Applying the Concepts 12‚Äì2
Colors That Make You Smarter
The following set of data values was obtained from a study of people‚Äôs perceptions on whether
the color of a person‚Äôs clothing is related to how intelligent the person looks. The subjects rated
the person‚Äôs intelligence on a scale of 1 to 10. Group 1 subjects were randomly shown people
with clothing in shades of blue and gray. Group 2 subjects were randomly shown people with

To Ô¨Ånd the critical value for the Tukey test, use Table N in Appendix C. The number
of means k is found in the row at the top, and the degrees of freedom for 
are found in
the left column (denoted by v). Since k  3, d.f.  12, and a  0.05, the critical value
is 3.77. See Figure 12‚Äì1. Hence, the only q value that is greater in absolute value than
the critical value is the one for the difference between 
and 
. The conclusion, then,
is that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in means for medication and exercise. These
results agree with the Scheff√© analysis.

3. Explain why separate t tests are not accepted in this situation.
4. When would Tukey‚Äôs test be preferred over the Scheff√© method? Explain.
See page 668 for the answers.
1. What two tests can be used to compare two means when
the null hypothesis is rejected using the one-way
ANOVA F test? The Scheff√© and Tukey tests are used.
2. Explain the difference between the two tests used to
compare two means when the null hypothesis is rejected
using the one-way ANOVA F test.
For Exercises 3 through 9, the null hypothesis was
rejected. Use the Scheff√© test when sample sizes are
unequal or the Tukey test when sample sizes are equal,
to test the differences between the pairs of means.

Two-Way Analysis of Variance
The analysis of variance technique shown previously is called a one-way ANOVA since
there is only one independent variable. The two-way ANOVA is an extension of the one-
way analysis of variance; it involves two independent variables. The independent vari-
ables are also called factors.
The two-way analysis of variance is quite complicated, and many aspects of the subject
should be considered when you are using a research design involving a two-way ANOVA.
For the purposes of this textbook, only a brief introduction to the subject will be given.
In doing a study that involves a two-way analysis of variance, the researcher is able
to test the effects of two independent variables or factors on one dependent variable. In
addition, the interaction effect of the two variables can be tested.
For example, suppose a researcher wishes to test the effects of two different types of
plant food and two different types of soil on the growth of certain plants. The two inde-
pendent variables are the type of plant food and the type of soil, while the dependent
variable is the plant growth. Other factors, such as water, temperature, and sunlight, are
held constant.
Objective 
Use the two-way
ANOVA technique to
determine if there is a
signiÔ¨Åcant difference
in the main effects or
interaction.
3

To conduct this experiment, the researcher sets up four groups of plants. See
Figure 12‚Äì2. Assume that the plant food type is designated by the letters A1 and A2 and
the soil type by the Roman numerals I and II. The groups for such a two-way ANOVA
are sometimes called treatment groups. The four groups are
Group 1
Plant food A1, soil type I
Group 2
Plant food A1, soil type II
Group 3
Plant food A2, soil type I
Group 4
Plant food A2, soil type II
The plants are assigned to the groups at random. This design is called a 2 
 2 (read 
‚Äútwo-by-two‚Äù) design, since each variable consists of two levels, that is, two different
treatments.
The two-wayANOVAenables the researcher to test the effects of the plant food and the
soil type in a single experiment rather than in separate experiments involving the plant food
alone and the soil type alone. Furthermore, the researcher can test an additional hypothesis
about the effect of the interaction of the two variables‚Äîplant food and soil type‚Äîon plant
growth. For example, is there a difference between the growth of plants using plant food A1
and soil type II and the growth of plants using plant food A2 and soil type I? When a dif-
ference of this type occurs, the experiment is said to have a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect.
That is, the types of plant food affect the plant growth differently in different soil types.
When the interaction effect is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant the researcher should not consider the
effects of the individual factors without considering the interaction effect.
There are many different kinds of two-way ANOVA designs, depending on the num-
ber of levels of each variable. Figure 12‚Äì3 shows a few of these designs. As stated pre-
viously, the plant food‚Äìsoil type experiment uses a 2 
 2 ANOVA.
The design in Figure 12‚Äì3(a) is called a 3 
 2 design, since the factor in the rows
has three levels and the factor in the columns has two levels. Figure 12‚Äì3(b) is a 3 
 3
design, since each factor has three levels. Figure 12‚Äì3(c) is a 4 
 3 design.
The two-way ANOVA design has several null hypotheses. There is one for each
independent variable and one for the interaction. In the plant food‚Äìsoil type problem, the
hypotheses are as follows:
1. H0: There is no interaction effect between type of plant food used and type of soil
used on plant growth.
H1: There is an interaction effect between food type and soil type on plant growth.
2. H0: There is no difference in means of heights of plants grown using different foods.
H1: There is a difference in means of heights of plants grown using different foods.

3. H0: There is no difference in means of heights of plants grown in different soil
types.
H1: There is a difference in means of heights of plants grown in different soil types.
The Ô¨Årst set of hypotheses concerns the interaction effect; the second and third sets test
the effects of the independent variables, which are sometimes called the main effects.
As with the one-way ANOVA, a between-group variance estimate is calculated, and
a within-group variance estimate is calculated. An F test is then performed for each of
the independent variables and the interaction. The results of the two-way ANOVA are
summarized in a two-way table, as shown in Table 12‚Äì4 for the plant experiment.

Assumptions for the Two-Way ANOVA
1. The populations from which the samples were obtained must be normally or
approximately normally distributed.
2. The samples must be independent.
3. The variances of the populations from which the samples were selected must be equal.
4. The groups must be equal in sample size.
The computational procedure for the two-way ANOVA is quite lengthy. For this rea-
son, it will be omitted in Example 12‚Äì5, and only the two-wayANOVAsummary table will
be shown. The table used in Example 12‚Äì5 is similar to the one generated by most com-
puter programs. You should be able to interpret the table and summarize the results.
Example 12‚Äì5
Gasoline Consumption
A researcher wishes to see whether the type of gasoline used and the type of automobile
driven have any effect on gasoline consumption. Two types of gasoline, regular and
high-octane, will be used, and two types of automobiles, two-wheel- and four-wheel-
drive, will be used in each group. There will be two automobiles in each group, for a
total of eight automobiles used. Using a two-way analysis of variance, the researcher
will perform the following steps.
Step 1
State the hypotheses.
Step 2
Find the critical value for each F test, using a  0.05.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses. The hypotheses for the interaction are these:
H0: There is no interaction effect between type of gasoline used and type of
automobile a person drives on gasoline consumption.
H1: There is an interaction effect between type of gasoline used and type of
automobile a person drives on gasoline consumption.
The hypotheses for the gasoline types are
H0: There is no difference between the means of gasoline consumption for
two types of gasoline.
H1: There is a difference between the means of gasoline consumption for two
types of gasoline.
The hypotheses for the types of automobile driven are
H0: There is no difference between the means of gasoline consumption for
two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive automobiles.
H1: There is a difference between the means of gasoline consumption for two-
wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive automobiles.
Step 2
Find the critical values for each F test. In this case, each independent variable,
or factor, has two levels. Hence, a 2 
 2 ANOVA table is used. Factor A is
designated as the gasoline type. It has two levels, regular and high-octane;
therefore, a  2. Factor B is designated as the automobile type. It also has

two levels; therefore, b  2. The degrees of freedom for each factor are as
follows:
Factor A:
d.f.N.  a  1  2  1  1
Factor B: 
d.f.N.  b  1  2  1  1
Interaction (A 
 B):
d.f.N.  (a  1)(b  1)
 (2  1)(2  1)  1  1  1
Within (error):
d.f.D.  ab(n  1)
 2  2(2  1)  4
where n is the number of data values in each group. In this case, n  2.
The critical value for the FA test is found by using a  0.05, d.f.N.  1,
and d.f.D.  4. In this case, FA  7.71. The critical value for the FB test is
found by using a  0.05, d.f.N.  1, and d.f.D.  4; also FB is 7.71. 
Finally, the critical value for the FA
B test is found by using d.f.N.  1 and
d.f.D.  4; it is also 7.71.
Note: If there are different levels of the factors, the critical values will not
all be the same. For example, if factor A has three levels and factor b has four
levels, and if there are two subjects in each group, then the degrees of
freedom are as follows:
d.f.N.  a  1  3  1  2
factor A
d.f.N.  b  1  4  1  3
factor B

Interesting Fact 
Some birds can Ô¨Çy as
high as 5 miles.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since FB  11.733 and FA
B  65.552 are greater than the
critical value 7.71, the null hypotheses concerning the type of automobile
driven and the interaction effect should be rejected. Since the interaction
effect is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant no decision should be made about the
automobile type without further investigation.
Step 5
Summarize the results. Since the null hypothesis for the interaction effect was
rejected, it can be concluded that the combination of type of gasoline and
type of automobile does affect gasoline consumption.
In the preceding analysis, the effect of the type of gasoline used and the effect of the
type of automobile driven are called the main effects. If there is no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction
effect, the main effects can be interpreted independently. However, if there is a signiÔ¨Å-
cant interaction effect, the main effects must be interpreted cautiously.
To interpret the results of a two-way analysis of variance, researchers suggest draw-
ing a graph, plotting the means of each group, analyzing the graph, and interpreting the
results. In Example 12‚Äì5, Ô¨Ånd the means for each group or cell by adding the data values
in each cell and dividing by n. The means for each cell are shown in the chart here.
Type of automobile
Gas
Two-wheel-drive
Four-wheel-drive
Regular
High-octane
The graph of the means for each of the variables is shown in Figure 12‚Äì4. In this
graph, the lines cross each other. When such an intersection occurs and the interaction is
signiÔ¨Åcant, the interaction is said to be a disordinal interaction. When there is a disor-
dinal interaction, you should not interpret the main effects without considering the
interaction effect.
The other type of interaction that can occur is an ordinal interaction. Figure 12‚Äì5
shows a graph of means in which an ordinal interaction occurs between two variables. The
lines do not cross each other, nor are they parallel. If the F test value for the interaction is
signiÔ¨Åcant and the lines do not cross each other, then the interaction is said to be an ordinal
interaction and the main effects can be interpreted independently of each other.
Finally, when there is no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction effect, the lines in the graph will
be parallel or approximately parallel. When this situation occurs, the main effects can
be interpreted independently of each other because there is no signiÔ¨Åcant interaction.

Figure 12‚Äì6 shows the graph of two variables when the interaction effect is not signiÔ¨Å-

Example 12‚Äì5 was an example of a 2 
 2 two-way analysis of variance, since each
independent variable had two levels. For other types of variance problems, such as a
3 
 2 or a 4 
 3 ANOVA, interpretation of the results can be quite complicated. Proce-
dures using tests such as the Tukey and Scheff√© tests for analyzing the cell means exist
and are similar to the tests shown for the one-way ANOVA, but they are beyond the scope
of this textbook. Many other designs for analysis of variance are available to researchers,
such as three-factor designs and repeated-measure designs; they are also beyond the
scope of this book.

Summary
‚Ä¢ The F test, as shown in Chapter 9, can be used to compare two sample variances to
determine whether they are equal. It can also be used to compare three or more
means. When three or more means are compared, the technique is called analysis of
variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA technique uses two estimates of the population
variance. The between-group variance is the variance of the sample means; the
within-group variance is the overall variance of all the values. When there is no
signiÔ¨Åcant difference among the means, the two estimates will be approximately
equal and the F test value will be close to 1. If there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference among
the means, the between-group variance estimate will be larger than the within-group
variance estimate and a signiÔ¨Åcant test value will result. (12‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ If there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference among means, the researcher may wish to see
where this difference lies. Several statistical tests can be used to compare the
sample means after the ANOVA technique has been done. The most common are
the Scheff√© test and the Tukey test. When the sample sizes are the same, the Tukey
test can be used. The Scheff√© test is more general and can be used when the sample
sizes are equal or not equal. (12‚Äì2)

662
Chapter 12 Analysis of Variance
12‚Äì34
‚Ä¢ When there is one independent variable, the analysis of variance is called a one-way
ANOVA. When there are two independent variables, the analysis of variance is called
a two-way ANOVA. The two-way ANOVA enables the researcher to test the effects
of two independent variables and a possible interaction effect on one dependent
variable. If an interaction effect is found to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, the researcher
must investigate further to Ô¨Ånd out if the main effects can be examined. (12‚Äì3)

Is Seeing Really Believing?‚ÄîRevisited
To see if there were differences in the testimonies of the witnesses in the three age groups, the
witnesses responded to 17 questions, 10 on direct examination and 7 on cross-examination.
These were then scored for accuracy. An analysis of variance test with age as the independent
variable was used to compare the total number of questions answered correctly by the groups.
The results showed no signiÔ¨Åcant differences among the age groups for the direct examination
questions. However, there was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference among the groups on the cross-
examination questions. Further analysis showed the 8-year-olds were signiÔ¨Åcantly less
accurate under cross-examination compared to the other two groups. The 12-year-old and
adult eyewitnesses did not differ in the accuracy of their cross-examination responses.

questionnaire was used to collect data for the
study. Included were questions related to
demographics, parental drinking behaviors, and
the College Wellness Check (WS), a health risk
appraisal designed especially for college
students (Dewey & Cabral, 1986). Analysis of
variance procedures revealed that ACOAs had
signiÔ¨Åcantly lower wellness scores (WS) than 
non-ACOAs. Chi-square analyses of the individual
variables revealed that ACOAs and non-ACOAs
were signiÔ¨Åcantly different on 15 of the 50
variables of the WS. A discriminant analysis
procedure revealed the similarities between
Unsure subjects and ACOA subjects. The results
provide valuable information regarding ACOAs

Use a signiÔ¨Åcance level of 0.05 for all tests below.
1. Business and Finance Select 10 stocks at random
from the Dow Jones Industrials, the NASDAQ, and
the S&P 500. For each, note the gain or loss in the last
quarter. Use analysis of variance to test the claim that
stocks from all three groups have had equal
performance.
2. Sports and Leisure Use total earnings data for movies
that were released in the previous year. Sort them by
rating (G, PG, PG13, and R). Is the mean revenue for
movies the same regardless of rating?
3. Technology Use the data collected in data project 3 of
Chapter 2 regarding song lengths. Consider only three
genres. For example, use rock, alternative, and hip
hop/rap. Conduct an analysis of variance to determine if
the mean song lengths for the genres are the same.
4. Health and Wellness Select 10 cereals from each of
the following categories: cereal targeted at children,
cereal targeted at dieters, and cereal that Ô¨Åts neither of
the previous categories. For each cereal note its calories
per cup (this may require some computation since
serving sizes vary for cereals). Use analysis of variance
to test the claim that the calorie content of these
different types of cereals is the same.
5. Politics and Economics Conduct an anonymous
survey to obtain your data. Ask the participants to
identify which of the following categories describes
them best: registered Republican, Democrat,
Independent, or not registered to vote. Also ask them to
give their age. Use an analysis of variance to determine
whether there is a difference in mean age between the
different political designations.
6. Your Class Split the class into four groups, those
whose favorite type of music is rock, whose favorite is
country, whose favorite is rap or hip hop, and whose
favorite is another type of music. Make a list of the ages
of students for each of the four groups. Use analysis of
variance to test the claim that the means for all four
groups are equal.

1. The ANOVA produces a test statistic of F  3.06, with
a P-value of 0.059. We would fail to reject the null
hypothesis and Ô¨Ånd that there is not enough evidence
to conclude that the color of a person‚Äôs clothing is
related to people‚Äôs perceptions of how intelligent the
person looks.
2. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that the
purpose of the study was to determine if the color of a
person‚Äôs clothing is related to people‚Äôs perceptions of
how intelligent the person looks.

Too Much or Too Little?
Suppose a manufacturer of ketchup wishes to check the bottling machines to see if
they are functioning properly. That is, are they dispensing the right amount of ketchup
per bottle? A 40-ounce bottle is currently used. Because of the natural variation in the
manufacturing process, the amount of ketchup in a bottle will not always be exactly
40 ounces. Some bottles will contain less than 40 ounces, and others will contain more
than 40 ounces. To see if the variation is due to chance or to a malfunction in the manu-
facturing process, a runs test can be used. The runs test is a nonparametric statistical
technique. See Statistics Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of this chapter. This chapter
explains such techniques, which can be used to help the manufacturer determine the
answer to the question.
Introduction
Statistical tests, such as the z, t, and F tests, are called parametric tests. Parametric tests
are statistical tests for population parameters such as means, variances, and proportions
that involve assumptions about the populations from which the samples were selected.
One assumption is that these populations are normally distributed. But what if the popu-
lation in a particular hypothesis-testing situation is not normally distributed? Statisticians
have developed a branch of statistics known as nonparametric statistics or distribution-
free statistics to use when the population from which the samples are selected is not
normally distributed. Nonparametric statistics can also be used to test hypotheses that do
not involve speciÔ¨Åc population parameters, such as m, s, or p.
For example, a sportswriter may wish to know whether there is a relationship between
the rankings of two judges on the diving abilities of 10 Olympic swimmers. In another
situation, a sociologist may wish to determine whether men and women enroll at random for
a speciÔ¨Åc drug rehabilitation program. The statistical tests used in these situations are non-
parametric or distribution-free tests. The term nonparametric is used for both situations.
The nonparametric tests explained in this chapter are the sign test, the Wilcoxon
rank sum test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the runs test.

In addition, the Spearman rank correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, a statistic for determining the
relationship between ranks, is explained.

Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Nonparametric Methods
As stated previously, nonparametric tests and statistics can be used in place of their para-
metric counterparts (z, t, and F) when the assumption of normality cannot be met. However,
you should not assume that these statistics are a better alternative than the parametric statis-
tics. There are both advantages and disadvantages in the use of nonparametric methods.
Advantages
There are Ô¨Åve advantages that nonparametric methods have over parametric methods:
1. They can be used to test population parameters when the variable is not normally
distributed.
2. They can be used when the data are nominal or ordinal.
3. They can be used to test hypotheses that do not involve population parameters.
4. In some cases, the computations are easier than those for the parametric counterparts.
5. They are easy to understand.
Disadvantages
There are three disadvantages of nonparametric methods:
1. They are less sensitive than their parametric counterparts when the assumptions of
the parametric methods are met. Therefore, larger differences are needed before the
null hypothesis can be rejected.
2. They tend to use less information than the parametric tests. For example, the sign
test requires the researcher to determine only whether the data values are above or
below the median, not how much above or below the median each value is.
3. They are less efÔ¨Åcient than their parametric counterparts when the assumptions of
the parametric methods are met. That is, larger sample sizes are needed to overcome
the loss of information. For example, the nonparametric sign test is about 60% as
efÔ¨Åcient as its parametric counterpart, the z test. Thus, a sample size of 100 is
needed for use of the sign test, compared with a sample size of 60 for use of the
z test to obtain the same results.
Since there are both advantages and disadvantages to the nonparametric methods, the
researcher should use caution in selecting these methods. If the parametric assumptions
can be met, the parametric methods are preferred. However, when parametric assumptions
cannot be met, the nonparametric methods are a valuable tool for analyzing the data.
The basic assumption for nonparametric statistics is that the sample or samples are
randomly obtained. When two or more samples are used, they must be independent of
each other unless otherwise stated.
Ranking
Many nonparametric tests involve the ranking of data, that is, the positioning of a
data value in a data array according to some rating scale. Ranking is an ordinal variable.
For example, suppose a judge decides to rate Ô¨Åve speakers on an ascending scale of 1 to
10, with 1 being the best and 10 being the worst, for categories such as voice, gestures,
logical presentation, and platform personality. The ratings are shown in the chart.

Many times, the data are already ranked, so no additional computations must be done.
For example, if the judge does not have to award points but can simply select the speak-
ers who are best, second-best, third-best, and so on, then these ranks can be used directly.
P-values can also be found for nonparametric statistical tests, and the P-value
method can be used to test hypotheses that use nonparametric tests. For this chapter, the
P-value method will be limited to some of the nonparametric tests that use the standard
normal distribution or the chi-square distribution.

of a median for a speciÔ¨Åc sample. When using the sign test, the researcher hypothesizes the
speciÔ¨Åc value for the median of a population; then he or she selects a sample of data and
compares each value with the conjectured median. If the data value is above the conjectured
median, it is assigned a plus sign. If it is below the conjectured median, it is assigned a
minus sign. And if it is exactly the same as the conjectured median, it is assigned a 0. Then
the numbers of plus and minus signs are compared. If the null hypothesis is true, the num-
ber of plus signs should be approximately equal to the number of minus signs. If the null
hypothesis is not true, there will be a disproportionate number of plus or minus signs.
Test Value for the Sign Test
The test value is the smaller number of plus or minus signs.
Objective 
Test hypotheses,
using the sign test.
2
For example, if there are 8 positive signs and 3 negative signs, the test value is 3.
When the sample size is 25 or less, Table J in Appendix C is used to determine the criti-
cal value. For a speciÔ¨Åc a, if the test value is less than or equal to the critical value
obtained from the table, the null hypothesis should be rejected. The values in Table J
are obtained from the binomial distribution. The derivation is omitted here.
Example 13‚Äì1

she sells per day is 40. A random sample of 20 days yields the following data for

Step 3
Compute the test value. Count the number of plus and minus signs obtained in
step 2, and use the smaller value as the test value. Since there are 3 plus signs
and 15 minus signs, 3 is the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. Compare the test value 3 with the critical value 4. If the
test value is less than or equal to the critical value, the null hypothesis is
rejected. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected since 3  4.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is enough evidence to reject the claim that the
median number of snow cones sold per day is 40.

Example 13‚Äì2
Age of Foreign-Born Residents
Based on information from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median age of foreign-born
U.S. residents is 36.4 years. A researcher selects a sample of 50 foreign-born U.S.
residents in his area and Ô¨Ånds that 21 are older than 36.4 years. At a  0.05, test the
claim that the median age of the residents is at least 36.4 years.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: MD  36.4 (claim)
and
H1: MD  36.4
Step 2
Find the critical value. Since a  0.05 and n  50, and since this is a 
left-tailed test, the critical value is 1.65, obtained from Table E.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since the test value of 0.99 is greater than 1.65, the
decision is to not reject the null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the claim that
the median age of the residents is at least 36.4.
In Example 13‚Äì2, the sample size was 50, and 21 residents are older than 36.4. So
50  21, or 29, residents are not older than 36.4. The value of X corresponds to the
smaller of the two numbers 21 and 29. In this case, X  21 is used in the formula; since
21 is the smaller of the two numbers, the value of X is 21.
Suppose a researcher hypothesized that the median age of houses in a certain munic-
ipality was 40 years. In a random sample of 100 houses, 68 were older than 40 years.
Then the value used for X in the formula would be 100  68, or 32, since it is the smaller
of the two numbers 68 and 32. When 40 is subtracted from the age of a house older than
40 years, the answer is positive. When 40 is subtracted from the age of a house that is
less than 40 years old, the result is negative. There would be 68 positive signs and 32 neg-
ative signs (assuming that no house was exactly 40 years old). Hence, 32 would be used
for X, since it is the smaller of the two values.
Paired-Sample Sign Test
The sign test can also be used to test sample means in a comparison of two dependent
samples, such as a before-and-after test. Recall that when dependent samples are taken
from normally distributed populations, the t test is used (Section 9‚Äì4). When the condi-
tion of normality cannot be met, the nonparametric sign test can be used, as shown in
Example 13‚Äì3.

Ear Infections in Swimmers
A medical researcher believed the number of ear infections in swimmers can
be reduced if the swimmers use earplugs. A sample of 10 people was selected,
and the number of infections for a four-month period was recorded. During the Ô¨Årst
two months, the swimmers did not use the earplugs; during the second two months,

they did. At the beginning of the second two-month period, each swimmer was
examined to make sure that no infections were present. The data are shown here. At


From Table J, with n  9 (the total number of positive and negative signs; the
0 is not counted) and a  0.05 (one-tailed), at most 1 negative sign is needed
to reject the null hypothesis because 1 is the smallest entry in the a  0.05
column of Table J.
Step 3
Compute the test value. Count the number of positive and negative signs
found in step 2, and use the smaller value as the test value. There are 2
negative signs, so the test value is 2.
Step 4
Make the decision. There are 2 negative signs. The decision is to not reject the
null hypothesis. The reason is that with n  9, C.V.  1 and 1  2.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that
the use of earplugs reduced the number of ear infections.

When conducting a one-tailed sign test, the researcher must scrutinize the data to
determine whether they support the null hypothesis. If the data support the null hypoth-
esis, there is no need to conduct the test. In Example 13‚Äì3, the null hypothesis states that
the number of ear infections will not be reduced. The data would support the null hypoth-
esis if there were more negative signs than positive signs. The reason is that the before
values XB in most cases would be smaller than the after values XA, and the XB  XA val-
ues would be negative more often than positive. This would indicate that there is not
enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The researcher would stop here, since there
is no need to continue the procedure.
On the other hand, if the number of ear infections were reduced, the XB values, for
the most part, would be larger than the XA values, and the XB  XA values would most
often be positive, as in Example 13‚Äì3. Hence, the researcher would continue the proce-
dure. A word of caution is in order, and a little reasoning is required.
When the sample size is 26 or more, the normal approximation can be used in the
same manner as in Example 13‚Äì2. The steps for conducting the sign test for single or
paired samples are given in the Procedure Table.
Section 13‚Äì2 The Sign Test
679
13‚Äì9
Procedure Table
Sign Test for Single and Paired Samples
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
Step 2
Find the critical value(s). For the single-sample test, compare each value with the
conjectured median. If the value is larger than the conjectured median, replace it
with a positive sign. If it is smaller than the conjectured median, replace it with a
negative sign.
For the paired-sample sign test, subtract the after values from the before
values, and indicate the difference with a positive or negative sign or 0, according
to the value. Use Table J and n  total number of positive and negative signs.
Check the data to see whether they support the null hypothesis. If they do, do
not reject the null hypothesis. If not, continue with step 3.
Step 3
Compute the test value. Count the numbers of positive and negative signs found in
step 2, and use the smaller value as the test value.
Step 4
Make the decision. Compare the test value with the critical value in Table J. If the
test value is less than or equal to the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results.
Note: If the sample size n is 26 or more, use Table E and the following

ConÔ¨Ådence Interval for the Median
The conÔ¨Ådence interval for the median of a set of values less
than or equal to 25 in number can be found by ordering the data
from smallest to largest, Ô¨Ånding the median, and using Table J.
For example, to Ô¨Ånd the 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval of the true
median for 17, 19, 3, 8, 10, 15, 1, 23, 2, 12, order the data:
1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 23
From Table J, select n  10 and a  0.05, and Ô¨Ånd the
critical value. Use the two-tailed row. In this case, the
critical value is 1. Add 1 to this value to get 2. In the ordered
list, count from the left two numbers and from the right two
numbers, and use these numbers to get the conÔ¨Ådence
interval, as shown:
1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 23
2  MD  19
Extending the Concepts
Always add 1 to the number obtained from the table before
counting. For example, if the critical value is 3, then count
4 values from the left and right.
For Exercises 21 through 25, Ô¨Ånd the conÔ¨Ådence interval
of the median, indicated in parentheses, for each set of data.

5. Click [OK].
The P-value is 0.0075. Reject the null hypothesis.
13‚Äì3
The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test
The sign test does not consider the magnitude of the data. For example, whether a value
is 1 point or 100 points below the median, it will receive a negative sign. And when you
compare values in the pretest/posttest situation, the magnitude of the differences is not
considered. The Wilcoxon tests consider differences in magnitudes by using ranks.
The two tests considered in this section and in Section 13‚Äì4 are the Wilcoxon rank
sum test, which is used for independent samples, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
which is used for dependent samples. Both tests are used to compare distributions. The
parametric equivalents are the z and t tests for independent samples (Sections 9‚Äì1 and
9‚Äì3) and the t test for dependent samples (Section 9‚Äì4). For the parametric tests, as stated
previously, the samples must be selected from approximately normally distributed popu-
lations, but the only assumption for the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests is that the population
of differences has a symmetric distribution.
In the Wilcoxon tests, the values of the data for both samples are combined and then
ranked. If the null hypothesis is true‚Äîmeaning that there is no difference in the population
distributions‚Äîthen the values in each sample should be ranked approximately the same.
Therefore, when the ranks are summed for each sample, the sums should be approximately
equal, and the null hypothesis will not be rejected. If there is a large difference in the sums of
the ranks, then the distributions are not identical, and the null hypothesis will be rejected.

Make the decision. Reject the null hypothesis if the test value is less than or
equal to the critical value. In this case, 3 	 2; hence, the decision is not to
reject the null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that
there is a difference in the number of shoplifting incidents. Hence, the security
increase probably made no difference in the number of shoplifting incidents.
The rationale behind the signed-rank test can be explained by a diet example. If the
diet is working, then the majority of the postweights will be smaller than the preweights.
When the postweights are subtracted from the preweights, the majority of the signs will
be positive, and the absolute value of the sum of the negative ranks will be small. This
sum will probably be smaller than the critical value obtained from Table K, and the null
hypothesis will be rejected. On the other hand, if the diet does not work, some people will
gain weight, other people will lose weight, and still other people will remain about the
same weight. In this case, the sum of the positive ranks and the absolute value of the sum
of the negative ranks will be approximately equal and will be about one-half of the sum
of the absolute value of all the ranks. In this case, the smaller of the absolute values of
the two sums will still be larger than the critical value obtained from Table K, and the
null hypothesis will not be rejected.

Interesting Fact 
Nearly one in three
unmarried adults lives
with a parent today.

When n  30, the normal distribution can be used to approximate the Wilcoxon dis-
tribution. The same critical values from Table E used for the z test for speciÔ¨Åc a values
are used. The formula is
where
n  number of pairs where difference is not 0
ws  smaller sum in absolute value of signed ranks
The steps for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test are given in the Procedure Table.

Pain Medication
A researcher decides to see how effective a pain medication is. Eight subjects were asked to
determine the severity of their pain by using a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very minor and
10 being very severe. Then each was given the medication, and after 1 hour, they were asked
to rate the severity of their pain, using the same scale.

The Kruskal-Wallis Test
The analysis of variance uses the F test to compare the means of three or more popula-
tions. The assumptions for the ANOVA test are that the populations are normally distrib-
uted and that the population variances are equal. When these assumptions cannot be met,
the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, sometimes called the H test, can be used to
compare three or more means.

In this test, each sample size must be 5 or more. In these situations, the distribution
can be approximated by the chi-square distribution with k  1 degrees of freedom, where
k  number of groups. This test also uses ranks. The formula for the test is given next.
In the Kruskal-Wallis test, you consider all the data values as a group and then rank
them. Next, the ranks are separated and the H formula is computed. This formula approx-
imates the variance of the ranks. If the samples are from different populations, the sums
of the ranks will be different and the H value will be large; hence, the null hypothesis will
be rejected if the H value is large enough. If the samples are from the same population,
the sums of the ranks will be approximately the same and the H value will be small;
therefore, the null hypothesis will not be rejected. This test is always a right-tailed test.
The chi-square table, Table G, with d.f.  k  1, should be used for critical values.

Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: There is no difference in the number of infections in the three groups of
hospitals (claim).
H1: There is a difference in the number of infections in the three groups of
hospitals.

Step 2
Find the critical value. Use the chi-square table (Table G) with d.f.  k  1,
where k  the number of groups. With a  0.05 and d.f.  3  1  2, the
critical value is 5.991.
Step 3
Compute the test value.
a. Arrange all the data from the lowest value to the highest value and rank
each value.

Therefore,
Step 4
Make the decision. Since 5.346 is less than the critical value of 5.991, the
decision is to not reject the null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the claim that
there is no difference in the number of infections in the groups of hospitals.
Hence the differences are not signiÔ¨Åcant at a  0.05.

This formula is algebraically equivalent to the formula for r given in Chapter 10, except
that ranks are used instead of raw data.
The computational procedure is shown in Example 13‚Äì7. For a test of the signiÔ¨Å-
cance of rs, Table L is used for values of n up to 30. For larger values, the normal distri-
bution can be used. (See Exercises 24 through 28 in the exercise section.)
Example 13‚Äì7
Bank Branches and Deposits
A researcher wishes to see if there is a relationship between the number of
branches a bank has and the total number of deposits (in billions of dollars) the
bank receives. A sample of eight regional banks is selected, and the number of branches
and the amount of deposits are shown in the table. At a  0.05 is there a signiÔ¨Åcant
linear correlation between the number of branches and the amount of the deposits?

The Spearman Rank Correlation CoefÔ¨Åcient 
and the Runs Test
The techniques of regression and correlation were explained in Chapter 10. To determine
whether two variables are linearly related, you use the Pearson product moment cor-
relation coefÔ¨Åcient. Its values range from 1 to 1. One assumption for testing the
hypothesis that r  0 for the Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient is that the populations from which
the samples are obtained are normally distributed. If this requirement cannot be met, the
nonparametric equivalent, called the Spearman rank correlation coefÔ¨Åcient (denoted
by rs), can be used when the data are ranked.
Rank Correlation CoefÔ¨Åcient
The computations for the rank correlation coefÔ¨Åcient are simpler than those for the
Pearson coefÔ¨Åcient and involve ranking each set of data. The difference in ranks is found,
and rs is computed by using these differences. If both sets of data have the same ranks,
rs will be 1. If the sets of data are ranked in exactly the opposite way, rs will be 1. If
there is no relationship between the rankings, rs will be near 0.
Historical Note

Karl Pearson,
developed the
Spearman rank
correlation in the early
1900s. Other

The Runs Test
When samples are selected, you assume that they are selected at random. How do you
know if the data obtained from a sample are truly random? Before the answer to this
question is given, consider the following situations for a researcher interviewing 20 peo-
ple for a survey. Let their gender be denoted by M for male and F for female. Suppose
the participants were chosen as follows:
Situation 1
M M M M M M M M M M F F F F F F F F F F
It does not look as if the people in this sample were selected at random, since 10 males
were selected Ô¨Årst, followed by 10 females.
Consider a different selection:
Situation 2
F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M
In this case, it seems as if the researcher selected a female, then a male, etc. This selec-
tion is probably not random either.
Objective 
Test hypotheses,
using the runs test.

Section 13‚Äì6 The Spearman Rank Correlation CoefÔ¨Åcient and the Runs Test
703
13‚Äì33
Finally, consider the following selection:
Situation 3
F F F M M F M F M M F F M M F F M M M F
This selection of data looks as if it may be random, since there is a mix of males and
females and no apparent pattern to their selection.
Rather than try to guess whether the data of a sample have been selected at random,
statisticians have devised a nonparametric test to determine randomness. This test is
called the runs test.
A run is a succession of identical letters preceded or followed by a different letter or no
letter at all, such as the beginning or end of the succession.
For example, the Ô¨Årst situation presented has two runs:
Run 1:
M M M M M M M M M M
Run 2:
F F F F F F F F F F
The second situation has 20 runs. (Each letter constitutes one run.) The third situation has
11 runs.
Run 1:
F F F
Run 5:
F 
Run 9:
F F
Run 2:

Run 3:

The test for randomness considers the number of runs rather than the frequency of
the letters. For example, for data to be selected at random, there should not be too few or
too many runs, as in situations 1 and 2. The runs test does not consider the questions of
how many males or females were selected or how many of each are in a speciÔ¨Åc run.
To determine whether the number of runs is within the random range, use Table M in
Appendix C. The values are for a two-tailed test with a  0.05. For a sample of 12 males

Gender of Train Passengers
On a commuter train, the conductor wishes to see whether the passengers enter the train
at random. He observes the Ô¨Årst 25 people, with the following sequence of males (M)
and females (F).
F F F M M F F F F M F M M M F F F F M M F F F M M
Test for randomness at a  0.05.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: The passengers board the train at random, according to gender (claim).
H1: The null hypothesis is not true.
Step 2
Find the number of runs. Arrange the letters according to runs of males and
females, as shown.

There are 15 females (n1) and 10 males (n2).
Step 3
Find the critical value. Find the number of runs in Table M for n1  15, 
n2  10, and a  0.05. The values are 7 and 18. Note: In this situation the
critical value is found after the number of runs is determined.
and 8 females, the table values shown in Figure 13‚Äì4 mean that any number of runs from
7 to 15 would be considered random. If the number of runs is 6 or less or 16 or more, the
sample is probably not random, and the null hypothesis should be rejected.
Example 13‚Äì9 shows the procedure for conducting the runs test by using letters as
data. Example 13‚Äì10 shows how the runs test can be used for numerical data.

Ages of Drug Program Participants
Twenty people enrolled in a drug abuse program. Test the claim that the ages of the
people, according to the order in which they enroll, occur at random, at a  0.05.
The data are 18, 36, 19, 22, 25, 44, 23, 27, 27, 35, 19, 43, 37, 32, 28, 43, 46, 19, 20, 22.
Solution
Step 1
State the hypotheses and identify the claim.
H0: The ages of the people, according to the order in which they enroll 
in a drug program, occur at random (claim).
H1: The null hypothesis is not true.
Step 2
Find the number of runs.
a. Find the median of the data. Arrange the data in ascending order.
18 19 19 19 20 22 22 23 25 27 27
28 32 35 36 37 43 43 44 46
The median is 27.
b. Replace each number in the original sequence with an A if it is above the
median and with a B if it is below the median. Eliminate any numbers that
are equal to the median.
B A B B B A B A B AAAAAA B B B
c. Arrange the letters according to runs.

Step 3
Find the critical value. Table M shows that with n1  9, n2  9, and a  0.05,
the number of runs should be between 5 and 15.
Step 4
Make the decision. Since there are 9 runs and 9 falls between 5 and 15, the
null hypothesis is not rejected.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the hypothesis
that the ages of the people who enroll occur at random.
The steps for the runs test are given in the Procedure Table.
Step 4
Make the decision. Compare these critical values with the number of runs.
Since the number of runs is 10 and 10 is between 7 and 18, do not reject the
null hypothesis.
Step 5
Summarize the results. There is not enough evidence to reject the hypothesis
that the passengers board the train at random according to gender.

Excel does not have a procedure to compute the Spearman rank correlation coefÔ¨Åcient.
However, you may compute this statistic by using the MegaStat Add-in available on your CD.
If you have not installed this add-in, do so, following the instructions from the Chapter 1 Excel
Step by Step.
1. Enter the rating scores from the example into columns A and B of a new worksheet.
2. From the toolbar, select Add-Ins, MegaStat>Nonparametric Tests>Spearman
CoefÔ¨Åcient of Rank Correlation. Note: You may need to open MegaStat from the
MegaStat.xls Ô¨Åle on your computer‚Äôs hard drive.
3. Type A1:B8 in the box for Input range.

8 sample size
0.707 critical value .05 (two-tail)

Since the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient 0.643 is less than the critical value, there is not enough
evidence to reject the null hypothesis of a nonzero correlation between the variables.
Summary
‚Ä¢ In many research situations, the assumptions (particularly that of normality) for the
use of parametric statistics cannot be met. Also, some statistical studies do not
involve parameters such as means, variances, and proportions. For both situations,
statisticians have developed nonparametric statistical methods, also called
distribution-free methods. (13‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ There are several advantages to the use of nonparametric methods. The most
important one is that no knowledge of the population distributions is required.
Other advantages include ease of computation and understanding. The major
disadvantage is that they are less efÔ¨Åcient than their parametric counterparts when
the assumptions for the parametric methods are met. In other words, larger sample
sizes are needed to get results as accurate as those given by their parametric
counterparts. (13‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ This list gives the nonparametric statistical tests presented in this chapter, along
with their parametric counterparts.

a.
For serum cholesterol, test H0: median  220 mil-
ligram percent (mg%).
b.
For systolic pressure, test H0: median  120 mil-
limeters of mercury (mm Hg).
c.
For IQ, test H0: median  100.
d.
For sodium level, test H0: median  140 mEq/l.
2. From the Data Bank, select a sample of subjects. Use
the Kruskal-Wallis test to see if the sodium levels of
smokers and nonsmokers are equal.
3. From the Data Bank select a sample of 50 subjects.
Use the Wilcoxon rank sum test to see if the means
of the sodium levels of the males differ from those of
the females.
Too Much or Too Little?‚ÄîRevisited
In this case, the manufacturer would select a sequence of bottles and see how many bottles
contained more than 40 ounces, denoted by plus, and how many bottles contained less than
40 ounces, denoted by minus. The sequence could then be analyzed according to the number of
runs, as explained in Section 13‚Äì6. If the sequence were not random, then the machine would
need to be checked to see if it was malfunctioning. Another method that can be used to see if
machines are functioning properly is statistical quality control. This method is beyond the
scope of this book.

the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. You are to rank the
countries from highest to lowest. Gold medals are
highest, followed by silver, followed by bronze. There
are many different ways to rank objects and events.
Here are several suggestions.
a.
Rank the countries according to the total medals won.
b.
List some advantages and disadvantages of this
method.
c.
Rank each country separately for the number of
gold medals won, then for the number of silver
medals won, and then for the number of bronze
medals won. Then rank the countries according to
the sum of the ranks for the categories.
d.
Are the rankings of the countries the same as those
in step a? Explain any differences.
e.
List some advantages and disadvantages of this
method of ranking.
f.
A third way to rank the countries is to assign a
weight to each medal. In this case, assign 3 points

Clean Air
1. The claim is that the median number of days that a
large city failed to meet EPA standards is 11 days
per month.
2. We will use the sign test, since we do not know
anything about the distribution of the variable and we
are testing the median.
3. H0: median  11 and H1: median 	 11.
4. If a  0.05, then the critical value is 5.
5. The test value is 9.
6. Since 9 	 5, do not reject the null hypothesis. 
7. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the
median is not 11 days per month.
8. We cannot use a parametric test in this situation.

School Lunch
1. The samples are independent since two different
random samples were selected.
2. H0: There is no difference in the number of calories
served for lunch in elementary and secondary
schools.
H1: There is a difference in the number of calories
served for lunch in elementary and secondary
schools.
3. We will use the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
4. The critical value is 1.96 if we use a  0.05.
5. The test statistic is z  2.15.
6. Since 2.15  1.96, we reject the null hypothesis
and conclude that there is a difference in the number
of calories served for lunch in elementary and
secondary schools.
7. The corresponding parametric test is the two-sample
t test.
8. We would need to know that the samples were normally
distributed to use the parametric test.
9. Since t tests are robust against variations from normality,
the parametric test would yield the same results.

Pain Medication
1. The purpose of the study is to see how effective a pain
medication is.
2. These are dependent samples, since we have before and
after readings on the same subjects.
3. H0: The severity of pain after is the same as the
severity of pain before the medication was
administered.
H1: The severity of pain after is less than the severity
of pain before the medication was administered.
4. We will use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
5. We will choose to use a signiÔ¨Åcance level of 0.05.
6. The test statistic is ws  2.5. The critical value is 4.
Since 2.5  4, we reject the null hypothesis. There is
enough evidence to conclude that the severity of pain
after is less than the severity of pain before the
medication was administered.
7. The parametric test that could be used is the t test for
small dependent samples.
8. The results for the parametric test would be the same.

2. We will use the Kruskal-Wallis test.
3. H0: There is no difference in the heights of waterfalls on
the three continents.
H1: There is a difference in the heights of waterfalls on

4. We will use the 0.05 signiÔ¨Åcance level. The critical
value is 5.991. Our test statistic is H  0.01.
5. Since 0.01  5.991, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a
difference in the heights of waterfalls on the three
continents.
6. The corresponding parametric test is analysis of
variance (ANOVA).
7. To perform an ANOVA, the population must be
normally distributed, the samples must be independent
of each other, and the variances of the samples must
be equal.

Tall Trees
1. The biologist is trying to see if there is a relationship
between the heights and diameters of tall trees.
2. We will use a Spearman rank correlation analysis.
3. The corresponding parametric test is the Pearson
product moment correlation analysis.
4. Answers will vary.
5. The Pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is r  0.329. The
associated P-value is 0.353. We would fail to reject
the null hypothesis that the correlation is zero. The
Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is rs  0.115.
We would reject the null hypothesis, at the 0.05
signiÔ¨Åcance level, if rs 	 0.648. Since 0.115  0.648,
we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the correlation
is zero. Both the parametric and nonparametric tests
Ô¨Ånd that the correlation is not statistically signiÔ¨Åcantly
different from zero‚Äîit appears that no linear rela-
tionship exists between the heights and diameters of
tall trees.

The Monty Hall Problem
On the game show Let‚Äôs Make A Deal, host Monty Hall gave a contestant a choice of
three doors. A valuable prize was behind one door, and nothing was behind the other two
doors. When the contestant selected one door, host Monty Hall opened one of the other
doors that the contestant didn‚Äôt select and that had no prize behind it. (Monty Hall knew
in advance which door had the prize.) Then he asked the contestant if he or she wanted
to change doors or keep the one that the contestant originally selected. Now the question
is, Should the contestant switch doors, or does it really matter? This chapter will show
you how you can solve this problem by simulation. For the answer, see Statistics
Today‚ÄîRevisited at the end of the chapter.
Introduction
Most people have heard of Gallup and Nielsen. These and other pollsters gather infor-
mation about the habits and opinions of the U.S. people. Such survey Ô¨Årms, and the U.S.
Census Bureau, gather information by selecting samples from well-deÔ¨Åned populations.
Recall from Chapter 1 that the subjects in the sample should be a subgroup of the sub-
jects in the population. Sampling methods often use what are called random numbers to
select samples.
Since many statistical studies use surveys and questionnaires, some information
about these is presented in Section 14‚Äì2.
Random numbers are also used in simulation techniques. Instead of studying a real-
life situation, which may be costly or dangerous, researchers create a similar situation in
a laboratory or with a computer. Then, by studying the simulated situation, researchers
can gain the necessary information about the real-life situation in a less expensive or
safer manner. This chapter will explain some common methods used to obtain samples
as well as the techniques used in simulations.

Common Sampling Techniques
In Chapter 1, a population was deÔ¨Åned as all subjects (human or otherwise) under study.
Since some populations can be very large, researchers cannot use every single subject, so
a sample must be selected. A sample is a subgroup of the population. Any subgroup of
the population, technically speaking, can be called a sample. However, for researchers to
make valid inferences about population characteristics, the sample must be random.
For a sample to be a random sample, every member of the population must have an
equal chance of being selected.
When a sample is chosen at random from a population, it is said to be an unbiased
sample. That is, the sample, for the most part, is representative of the population. Con-
versely, if a sample is selected incorrectly, it may be a biased sample. Samples are said to
be biased samples when some type of systematic error has been made in the selection of
the subjects.
A sample is used to get information about a population for several reasons:
1. It saves the researcher time and money.
2. It enables the researcher to get information that he or she might not be able to
obtain otherwise. For example, if a person‚Äôs blood is to be analyzed for cholesterol,
a researcher cannot analyze every single drop of blood without killing the person.
Or if the breaking strength of cables is to be determined, a researcher cannot test to
destruction every cable manufactured, since the company would not have any
cables left to sell.
3. It enables the researcher to get more detailed information about a particular
subject. If only a few people are surveyed, the researcher can conduct in-depth
interviews by spending more time with each person, thus getting more information
about the subject. This is not to say that the smaller the sample, the better; in fact,
the opposite is true. In general, larger samples‚Äîif correct sampling techniques are
used‚Äîgive more reliable information about the population.
It would be ideal if the sample were a perfect miniature of the population in all char-
acteristics. This ideal, however, is impossible to achieve, because there are so many human
traits (height, weight, IQ, etc.). The best that can be done is to select a sample that will be
representative with respect to some characteristics, preferably those pertaining to the study.
For example, if one-half of the population subjects are female, then approximately one-
half of the sample subjects should be female. Likewise, other characteristics, such as age,
socioeconomic status, and IQ, should be represented proportionately. To obtain unbiased
samples, statisticians have developed several basic sampling methods. The most common
methods are random, systematic, stratiÔ¨Åed, and cluster sampling. Each method will be
explained in detail in this section.
In addition to the basic methods, there are other methods used to obtain samples.
Some of these methods are also explained in this section.
Random Sampling
A random sample is obtained by using methods such as random numbers, which can be
generated from calculators, computers, or tables. In random sampling, the basic require-
ment is that, for a sample of size n, all possible samples of this size have an equal chance
of being selected from the population. But before the correct method of obtaining a ran-
dom sample is explained, several incorrect methods commonly used by various
researchers and agencies to gain information are discussed.
Objective 
Demonstrate a
knowledge of the
four basic sampling
methods.
1

One incorrect method commonly used is to ask ‚Äúthe person on the street.‚Äù News
reporters use this technique quite often. Selecting people haphazardly on the street does
not meet the requirement for simple random sampling, since not all possible samples of a
speciÔ¨Åc size have an equal chance of being selected. Many people will be at home or at
work when the interview is being conducted and therefore do not have a chance of being
selected.
Another incorrect technique is to ask a question by either radio or television and have
the listeners or viewers call the station to give their responses or opinions. Again, this
sample is not random, since only those who feel strongly for or against the issue may
respond and people may not have heard or seen the program. A third erroneous method
is to ask people to respond by mail. Again, only those who are concerned and who have
the time are likely to respond.
These methods do not meet the requirement of random sampling, since not all pos-
sible samples of a speciÔ¨Åc size have an equal chance of being selected. To meet this
requirement, researchers can use one of two methods. The Ô¨Årst method is to number each
element of the population and then place the numbers on cards. Place the cards in a hat
or Ô¨Åshbowl, mix them, and then select the sample by drawing the cards. When using this
procedure, researchers must ensure that the numbers are well mixed. On occasion, when
this procedure is used, the numbers are not mixed well, and the numbers chosen for the
sample are those that were placed in the bowl last.
The second and preferred way of selecting a random sample is to use random num-
bers. Figure 14‚Äì1 shows a table of two-digit random numbers generated by a computer.
A more detailed table of random numbers is found in Table D of Appendix C.
The theory behind random numbers is that each digit, 0 through 9, has an equal prob-
ability of occurring. That is, in every sequence of 10 digits, each digit has a probability
of 
of occurring. This does not mean that in every sequence of 10 digits, you will Ô¨Ånd
each digit. Rather, it means that on the average, each digit will occur once. For example,
the digit 2 may occur 3 times in a sequence of 10 digits, but in later sequences, it may
not occur at all, thus averaging to a probability of .
To obtain a sample by using random numbers, number the elements of the popula-
tion sequentially and then select each person by using random numbers. This process is
shown in Example 14‚Äì1.
Random samples can be selected with or without replacement. If the same member
of the population cannot be used more than once in the study, then the sample is selected
without replacement. That is, once a random number is selected, it cannot be used later.

Note: In the explanations and examples of the sampling procedures, a small popula-
tion will be used, and small samples will be selected from this population. Small popu-
lations are used for illustrative purposes only, because the entire population could be
included with little difÔ¨Åculty. In real life, however, researchers must usually sample from
very large populations, using the procedures shown in this chapter.

Using the random numbers shown in Figure 14‚Äì1, Ô¨Ånd a starting point. To
Ô¨Ånd a starting point, you generally close your eyes and place your Ô¨Ånger
anywhere on the table. In this case, the Ô¨Årst number selected was 27 in the
fourth column. Going down the column and continuing on to the next column,
select the Ô¨Årst 10 numbers. They are 27, 95, 27, 73, 60, 43, 56, 34, 93, and 06.
See Figure 14‚Äì2. (Note that 06 represents 6.)

Since the numbers 95, 73, 60, 56, and 93 are too large, they are disregarded.
And since 27 appears twice, it is also disregarded the second time. Now, you
must select six more random numbers between 1 and 50 and omit duplicates,
since this sample will be selected without replacement. Make this selection by
continuing down the column and moving over to the next column until a total
of 10 numbers is selected. The Ô¨Ånal 10 numbers are 27, 43, 34, 06, 13, 29, 01,
39, 23, and 35. See Figure 14‚Äì3.

Thus, the governors of these 10 states will constitute the sample.
Random sampling has one limitation. If the population is extremely large, it is time-
consuming to number and select the sample elements. Also, notice that the random num-
bers in the table are two-digit numbers. If three digits are needed, then the Ô¨Årst digit from
the next column can be used, as shown in Figure 14‚Äì4. Table D in Appendix C gives Ô¨Åve-
digit random numbers.

Systematic Sampling
A systematic sample is a sample obtained by numbering each element in the population
and then selecting every third or Ô¨Åfth or tenth, etc., number from the population to be
included in the sample. This is done after the Ô¨Årst number is selected at random.

Speaking of 
Statistics
Should We Be Afraid of Lightning?
The National Weather Service collects
various types of data about the weather.
For example, each year in the United
States about 400 million lightning strikes
occur. On average, 400 people are struck
by lightning, and 85% of those struck
are men. About 100 of these people die.
The cause of most of these deaths is not
burns, even though temperatures as
high as 54,000¬∞F are reached, but heart
attacks. The lightning strike short-circuits
the body‚Äôs autonomic nervous system,
causing the heart to stop beating. In
some instances, the heart will restart on
its own. In other cases, the heart victim will need emergency resuscitation.
The most dangerous places to be during a thunderstorm are open Ô¨Åelds, golf courses, under trees, and near water,
such as a lake or swimming pool. It‚Äôs best to be inside a building during a thunderstorm although there‚Äôs no guarantee
that the building won‚Äôt be struck by lightning. Are these statistics descriptive or inferential? Why do you think more men
are struck by lightning than women? Should you be afraid of lightning?

The procedure of systematic sampling is illustrated in Example 14‚Äì2.

Chapter 14 Sampling and Simulation
14‚Äì8
Example 14‚Äì2
Television Show Interviews
Using the population of 50 states in Example 14‚Äì1, select a systematic sample of 10 states.
Solution
Step 1
Number the population units as shown in Example 14‚Äì1.
Step 2
Since there are 50 states and 10 are to be selected, the rule is to select every
Ô¨Åfth state. This rule was determined by dividing 50 by 10, which yields 5.
Step 3
Using the table of random numbers, select the Ô¨Årst digit (from 1 to 5) at
random. In this case, 4 was selected.
Step 4
Select every Ô¨Åfth number on the list, starting with 4. The numbers include the
following:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14   
The selected states are as follows:
4
Arkansas
29
New Hampshire
9
Florida
34
North Dakota
14
Indiana
39
Rhode Island
19
Maine
44
Utah
24
Mississippi
49
Wisconsin
The advantage of systematic sampling is the ease of selecting the sample elements.
Also, in many cases, a numbered list of the population units may already exist. For exam-
ple, the manager of a factory may have a list of employees who work for the company,
or there may be an in-house telephone directory.
When doing systematic sampling, you must be careful how the items are arranged on
the list. For example, if each unit were arranged, say, as
1. Husband
2. Wife
3. Husband
4. Wife
then the selection of the starting number could produce a sample of all males or all females,
depending on whether the starting number is even or odd and whether the number to be
added is even or odd. As another example, if the list were arranged in order of heights of
individuals, you would get a different average from two samples if the Ô¨Årst were selected
by using a small starting number and the second by using a large starting number.
StratiÔ¨Åed Sampling
A stratiÔ¨Åed sample is a sample obtained by dividing the population into subgroups,
called strata, according to various homogeneous characteristics and then selecting
members from each stratum for the sample.
For example, a population may consist of males and females who are smokers or
nonsmokers. The researcher will want to include in the sample people from each group‚Äî
that is, males who smoke, males who do not smoke, females who smoke, and females

who do not smoke. To accomplish this selection, the researcher divides the population
into four subgroups and then selects a random sample from each subgroup. This method
ensures that the sample is representative on the basis of the characteristics of gender and
smoking. Of course, it may not be representative on the basis of other characteristics.

Step 3
Determine how many students need to be selected from each subgroup to
have a proportional representation of each subgroup in the sample. There are
four groups, and since a total of eight students is needed for the sample, two
students must be selected from each subgroup.
Step 4
Select two students from each group by using random numbers. In this case,
the random numbers are as follows:
Group 1
Students 5 and 4
Group 2
Students 5 and 2
Group 3
Students 1 and 3
Group 4
Students 3 and 4

The major advantage of stratiÔ¨Åcation is that it ensures representation of all popu-
lation subgroups that are important to the study. There are two major drawbacks to
stratiÔ¨Åcation, however. First, if there are many variables of interest, dividing a large pop-
ulation into representative subgroups requires a great deal of effort. Second, if the vari-
ables are somewhat complex or ambiguous (such as beliefs, attitudes, or prejudices), it is
difÔ¨Åcult to separate individuals into the subgroups according to these variables.
Cluster Sampling
A cluster sample is a sample obtained by selecting a preexisting or natural group,
called a cluster, and using the members in the cluster for the sample.
For example, many studies in education use already existing classes, such as the sev-
enth grade in Wilson Junior High School. The voters of a certain electoral district might
be surveyed to determine their preferences for a mayoral candidate in the upcoming elec-
tion. Or the residents of an entire city block might be polled to ascertain the percentage
of households that have two or more incomes. In cluster sampling, researchers may use
all units of a cluster if that is feasible, or they may select only part of a cluster to use as
a sample. This selection is done by random methods.
There are three advantages to using a cluster sample instead of other types of sam-
ples: (1) A cluster sample can reduce costs, (2) it can simplify Ô¨Åeldwork, and (3) it is con-
venient. For example, in a dental study involving X-raying fourth-grade students‚Äô teeth
to see how many cavities each child had, it would be a simple matter to select a single
classroom and bring the X-ray equipment to the school to conduct the study. If other sam-
pling methods were used, researchers might have to transport the machine to several
different schools or transport the pupils to the dental ofÔ¨Åce.
The major disadvantage of cluster sampling is that the elements in a cluster may not
have the same variations in characteristics as elements selected individually from a pop-
ulation. The reason is that groups of people may be more homogeneous (alike) in speciÔ¨Åc
clusters such as neighborhoods or clubs. For example, the people who live in a certain
neighborhood tend to have similar incomes, drive similar cars, live in similar houses,
and, for the most part, have similar habits.

Chapter 14 Sampling and Simulation

Other Types of Sampling Techniques
In addition to the four basic sampling methods, other methods are sometimes used.
In sequence sampling, which is used in quality control, successive units taken from
production lines are sampled to ensure that the products meet certain standards set by the
manufacturing company.
In double sampling, a very large population is given a questionnaire to determine
those who meet the qualiÔ¨Åcations for a study. After the questionnaires are reviewed, a
second, smaller population is deÔ¨Åned. Then a sample is selected from this group.
In multistage sampling, the researcher uses a combination of sampling methods.
For example, suppose a research organization wants to conduct a nationwide survey for
a new product being manufactured. A sample can be obtained by using the following
combination of methods. First the researchers divide the 50 states into four or Ô¨Åve
regions (or clusters). Then several states from each region are selected at random. Next
the states are divided into various areas by using large cities and small towns. Samples
of these areas are then selected. Next, each city and each town are divided into districts
or wards. Finally, streets in these wards are selected at random, and the families living on
these streets are given samples of the product to test and are asked to report the results.
This hypothetical example illustrates a typical multistage sampling method.
The steps for conducting a sample survey are given in the Procedure Table.

because the very mechanisms employed 
to help contestants actually lead them 
astray.
Multiple-choice questions are one 
such offender, as alternative answers 
seem to make test-takers ignore gut 
instincts. To learn why, researchers at 
Southern  Methodist  University (SMU) 
gave two identical tests: one using 
multiple-choice questions and the other 
fill-in-the-blank. The results, recently 
published in the Journal of Educational 
Psychology, show that test-takers were 
incorrect more often when given false 
alternatives, and that the longer they 
considered those alternatives, the more 
credible the answers looked.
‚ÄúIf you sit and stew, you forget that 
you know the right answer,‚Äù says Alan 
Brown, Ph.D., a psychology professor at 
SMU. ‚ÄúTrusting your first impulse is 
your best strategy.‚Äù
Audiences can also be trouble, says 
Jennifer Butler, Ph.D., a Wittenberg 
University psychology professor. Her 
recent study in the Journal of Personality 
and Social Psychology found that 
contestants who see audience partic-
ipation as peer pressure slow down to 
avoid making embarrassing mistakes. But 
this strategy backfires, as more contem-
plation produces more wrong answers. 
Worse, Butler says, if perceived peer 
pressure grows unbearable, contestants 
may opt out of answering at all, ‚Äúthinking 
that it‚Äôs better to stop than to have your 
once supportive audience come to believe 
you‚Äôre an idiot.‚Äù

In this study, the researchers
found that subjects did better on
Ô¨Åll-in-the-blank questions than on
multiple-choice questions. Do
you agree with the professor‚Äôs
statement, ‚ÄúTrusting your Ô¨Årst

Applying the Concepts 14‚Äì1
The White or Wheat Bread Debate
Read the following study and answer the questions.
A baking company selected 36 women weighing different amounts and randomly assigned them
to four different groups. The four groups were white bread only, brown bread only, low-fat white
bread only, and low-fat brown bread only. Each group could eat only the type of bread assigned to
the group. The study lasted for eight weeks. No other changes in any of the women‚Äôs diets were
allowed. A trained evaluator was used to check for any differences in the women‚Äôs diets. The results
showed that there were no differences in weight gain between the groups over the eight-week period.
1. Did the researchers use a population or a sample for their study?
2. Based on who conducted this study, would you consider the study to be biased?
3. Which sampling method do you think was used to obtain the original 36 women for the
study (random, systematic, stratiÔ¨Åed, or clustered)?
4. Which sampling method would you use? Why?
5. How would you collect a random sample for this study?
6. Does random assignment help representativeness the same as random selection does? Explain.

Surveys and Questionnaire Design
Many statistical studies obtain information from surveys. A survey is conducted when a
sample of individuals is asked to respond to questions about a particular subject. There
are two types of surveys: interviewer-administered and self-administered. Interviewer-
administered surveys require a person to ask the questions. The interview can be con-
ducted face to face in an ofÔ¨Åce, on a street, or in the mall, or via telephone.
Self-administered surveys can be done by mail or in a group setting such as a classroom.
When analyzing the results of surveys, you should be very careful about the interpre-
tations. The way a question is phrased can inÔ¨Çuence the way people respond. For example,
when a group of people were asked if they favored a waiting period and background check
before guns could be sold, 91% of the respondents were in favor of it and 7% were against
it. However, when asked if there should be a national gun registration program costing
about 20% of all dollars spent on crime control, only 33% of the respondents were in favor
of it and 61% were against it.
As you can see, by phrasing questions in different ways, different responses can be
obtained, since the purpose of a national gun registry would include a waiting period and
a background check.
When you are writing questions for a questionnaire, it is important to avoid these
common mistakes.
1. Asking biased questions. By asking questions in a certain way, the researcher can lead
the respondents to answer in the way he or she wants them to. For example, asking a
question such as ‚ÄúAre you going to vote for candidate Jones even though the latest
survey indicates that he will lose the election?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúAre you going to vote for
candidate Jones?‚Äù may dissuade some people from answering in the afÔ¨Årmative.
2. Using confusing words. In this case, the participant misinterprets the meaning of the
words and answers the questions in a biased way. For example, the question ‚ÄúDo
you think people would live longer if they were on a diet?‚Äù could be misinterpreted
since there are many different types of diets‚Äîweight loss diets, low-salt diets,
medically prescribed diets, etc.
Objective 
Recognize faulty
questions on a survey
and other factors that
can bias responses.
2

Section 14‚Äì2 Surveys and Questionnaire Design
737
14‚Äì19
3. Asking double-barreled questions. Sometimes questions contain compound
sentences that require the participant to respond to two questions at the same
time. For example, the question ‚ÄúAre you in favor of a special tax to provide
national health care for the citizens of the United States?‚Äù asks two questions:
‚ÄúAre you in favor of a national health care program?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you favor a tax
to support it?‚Äù
4. Using double negatives in questions. Questions with double negatives can be
confusing to the respondents. For example, the question ‚ÄúDo you feel that it is not
appropriate to have areas where people cannot smoke?‚Äù is very confusing since not
is used twice in the sentence.
5. Ordering questions improperly. By arranging the questions in a certain order, the
researcher can lead the participant to respond in a way that he or she may otherwise
not have done. For example, a question might ask the respondent, ‚ÄúAt what age
should an elderly person not be permitted to drive?‚Äù A later question might ask the
respondent to list some problems of elderly people. The respondent may indicate
that transportation is a problem based on reading the previous question.
Other factors can also bias a survey. For example, the participant may not know any-
thing about the subject of the question but will answer the question anyway to avoid
being considered uninformed. For example, many people might respond yes or no to the
following question: ‚ÄúWould you be in favor of giving pensions to the widows of un-
known soldiers?‚Äù In this case, the question makes no sense since if the soldiers were
unknown, their widows would also be unknown.
Many people will make responses on the basis of what they think the person asking
the questions wants to hear. For example, if a question states, ‚ÄúHow often do you lie?‚Äù
people may understate the incidences of their lying.
Participants will, in some cases, respond differently to questions depending on
whether their identity is known. This is especially true if the questions concern sensitive
issues such as income, sexuality, and abortion. Researchers try to ensure conÔ¨Ådentiality
(i.e., keeping the respondent‚Äôs identity secret) rather than anonymity (soliciting unsigned
responses); however, many people will be suspicious in either case.
Still other factors that could bias a survey include the time and place of the survey
and whether the questions are open-ended or closed-ended. The time and place where a
survey is conducted can inÔ¨Çuence the results. For example, if a survey on airline safety
is conducted immediately after a major airline crash, the results may differ from those
obtained in a year in which no major airline disasters occurred.
Finally, the type of questions asked inÔ¨Çuences the responses. In this case, the con-
cern is whether the question is open-ended or closed-ended.
An open-ended question would be one such as ‚ÄúList three activities that you plan to
spend more time on when you retire.‚Äù A closed-ended question would be one such as
‚ÄúSelect three activities that you plan to spend more time on after you retire: traveling;
eating out; Ô¨Åshing and hunting; exercising; visiting relatives.‚Äù
One problem with a closed-ended question is that the respondent is forced to
choose the answers that the researcher gives and cannot supply his or her own. But there
is also a problem with open-ended questions in that the results may be so varied that
attempting to summarize them might be difÔ¨Åcult, if not impossible. Hence, you should
be aware of what types of questions are being asked before you draw any conclusions
from the survey.
There are several other things to consider when you are conducting a study that uses
questionnaires. For example, a pilot study should be done to test the design and usage of the
questionnaire (i.e., the validity of the questionnaire). The pilot study helps the researcher to
pretest the questionnaire to determine if it meets the objectives of the study. It also helps the
researcher to rewrite any questions that may be misleading, ambiguous, etc.
Unusual Stat
Of people who are
struck by lightning,
85% are men.

If the questions are being asked by an interviewer, some training should be given to
that person. If the survey is being done by mail, a cover letter and clear directions should
accompany the questionnaire.
Questionnaires help researchers to gather needed statistical information for their
studies; however, much care must be given to proper questionnaire design and usage;
otherwise, the results will be unreliable.
Applying the Concepts 14‚Äì2
Smoking Bans and ProÔ¨Åts
Assume you are a restaurant owner and are concerned about the recent bans on smoking in
public places. Will your business lose money if you do not allow smoking in your restaurant?
You decide to research this question and Ô¨Ånd two related articles in regional newspapers.
The Ô¨Årst article states that randomly selected restaurants in Derry, Pennsylvania, that have
completely banned smoking have lost 25% of their business. In that study, a survey was used
and the owners were asked how much business they thought they lost. The survey was
conducted by an anonymous group. It was reported in the second article that there had been
a modest increase in business among restaurants that banned smoking in that same area. Sales
receipts were collected and analyzed against last year‚Äôs proÔ¨Åts. The second survey was
conducted by the Restaurants Business Association.
1. How has the public smoking ban affected restaurant business in Derry, Pennsylvania?
2. Why do you think the surveys reported conÔ¨Çicting results?
3. Should surveys based on anecdotal responses be allowed to be published?

Simulation Techniques and the Monte Carlo Method
Many real-life problems can be solved by employing simulation techniques.
A simulation technique uses a probability experiment to mimic a real-life situation.
Instead of studying the actual situation, which might be too costly, too dangerous, or
too time-consuming, scientists and researchers create a similar situation but one that is
less expensive, less dangerous, or less time-consuming. For example, NASA uses space
shuttle Ô¨Çight simulators so that its astronauts can practice Ô¨Çying the shuttle. Most video
games use the computer to simulate real-life sports such as boxing, wrestling, baseball,
and hockey.
Simulation techniques go back to ancient times when the game of chess was invented
to simulate warfare. Modern techniques date to the mid-1940s when two physicists, John
Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, developed simulation techniques to study the behav-
ior of neutrons in the design of atomic reactors.
Mathematical simulation techniques use probability and random numbers to create
conditions similar to those of real-life problems. Computers have played an important
role in simulation techniques, since they can generate random numbers, perform exper-
iments, tally the outcomes, and compute the probabilities much faster than human
beings. The basic simulation technique is called the Monte Carlo method. This topic is
discussed next.
The Monte Carlo Method
The Monte Carlo method is a simulation technique using random numbers. Monte
Carlo simulation techniques are used in business and industry to solve problems that are
extremely difÔ¨Åcult or involve a large number of variables. The steps for simulating real-
life experiments in the Monte Carlo method are as follows:
1. List all possible outcomes of the experiment.
2. Determine the probability of each outcome.
3. Set up a correspondence between the outcomes of the experiment and the random
numbers.
4. Select random numbers from a table and conduct the experiment.
5. Repeat the experiment and tally the outcomes.
6. Compute any statistics and state the conclusions.
Before examples of the complete simulation technique are given, an illustration is
needed for step 3 (set up a correspondence between the outcomes of the experiment and
the random numbers). Tossing a coin, for instance, can be simulated by using random
numbers as follows: Since there are only two outcomes, heads and tails, and since each
outcome has a probability of , the odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) can be used to represent
a head, and the even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8) can represent a tail.
Suppose a random number 8631 is selected. This number represents four tosses of a
single coin and the results T, T, H, H. Or this number could represent one toss of four
coins with the same results.
An experiment of rolling a single die can also be simulated by using random numbers.
In this case, the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can represent the number of spots that appear on
the face of the die. The digits 7, 8, 9, and 0 are ignored, since they cannot be rolled.

Here‚Äôs how to score bowling:
1. There are 10 frames to a game or line.
2. You roll two balls for each frame, unless you knock all the pins down with the first ball (a strike).
3. Your score for a frame is the sum of the pins knocked down by the two balls, if you don‚Äôt knock down all 10.
4. If you knock all 10 pins down with two balls (a spare, shown as      ), your score is 10 pins plus the number
4. knocked down with the next ball.
5. If you knock all 10 pins down with the first ball (a strike, shown as      ), your score is 10 pins plus the 
5. number knocked down by the next two balls.
6. A split (shown as 0) is when there is a big space between the remaining pins. Place in the circle the number
6. of pins remaining after the second ball.
7. A miss is shown as ‚Äî.

When two dice are rolled, two random digits are needed. For example, the number
26 represents a 2 on the Ô¨Årst die and a 6 on the second die. The random number 37 rep-
resents a 3 on the Ô¨Årst die, but the 7 cannot be used, so another digit must be selected. As
another example, a three-digit daily lotto number can be simulated by using three-digit
random numbers. Finally, a spinner with four numbers, as shown in Figure 14‚Äì10, can be
simulated by letting the random numbers 1 and 2 represent 1 on the spinner, 3 and 4 rep-
resent 2 on the spinner, 5 and 6 represent 3 on the spinner, and 7 and 8 represent 4 on the
spinner, since each number has a probability of of being selected. The random numbers
9 and 0 are ignored in this situation.
Many real-life games, such as bowling and baseball, can be simulated by using ran-
dom numbers, as shown in Figure 14‚Äì11.

Snoring
According to the CDC, the chance that a person snores while sleeping is 20%. Use
random numbers to simulate a sample of 20 people and identify those who snore.
Solution
Now 20% is 
, so one out of every Ô¨Åve people snores while sleeping. Using random
digits, select 20 single numbers and assign 1 and 2 as people who snore and 3 through 9
and 0 as people who do not snore. (Note: You can use any two digits for those who
snore.) Then the 1s and 2s represent people who snore; 0 and 3 through 9 represent those
who do not snore.

Outcomes of a Tennis Game
Using random numbers, simulate the outcomes of a tennis game between Bill and Mike,
with the additional condition that Bill is twice as good as Mike.
Solution
Since Bill is twice as good as Mike, he will win approximately two games for every
one Mike wins; hence, the probability that Bill wins will be , and the probability that
Mike wins will be . The random digits 1 through 6 can be used to represent a game Bill
wins; the random digits 7, 8, and 9 can be used to represent Mike‚Äôs wins. The digit 0 is
disregarded. Suppose they play Ô¨Åve games, and the random number 86314 is selected.
This number means that Bill won games 2, 3, 4, and 5 and Mike won the Ô¨Årst game.

Example 14‚Äì7
Selecting a Key
A person selects a key at random from four keys to open a lock. Only one key Ô¨Åts. If the
Ô¨Årst key does not Ô¨Åt, she tries other keys until one Ô¨Åts. Find the average of the number
of keys a person will have to try to open the lock. Try the experiment 25 times.
Solution
Assume that each key is numbered from 1 through 4 and that key 2 Ô¨Åts the lock.
Naturally, the person doesn‚Äôt know this, so she selects the keys at random. For the
simulation, select a sequence of random digits, using only 1 through 4, until the digit 2
is reached. The trials are shown here.

Summary
‚Ä¢ To obtain information and make inferences about a large population, researchers
select a sample. A sample is a subgroup of the population. Using a sample rather than
a population, researchers can save time and money, get more detailed information,
and get information that otherwise would be impossible to obtain. (14‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ The four most common methods researchers use to obtain samples are random,
systematic, stratiÔ¨Åed, and cluster sampling methods. In random sampling, some
type of random method (usually random numbers) is used to obtain the sample. In
systematic sampling, the researcher selects every kth person or item after selecting
the Ô¨Årst one at random. In stratiÔ¨Åed sampling, the population is divided into

746
Chapter 14 Sampling and Simulation
14‚Äì28
subgroups according to various characteristics, and elements are then selected at
random from the subgroups. In cluster sampling, the researcher selects an intact
group to use as a sample. When the population is large, multistage sampling (a
combination of methods) is used to obtain a subgroup of the population. (14‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ Researchers must use caution when conducting surveys and designing questionnaires;
otherwise, conclusions obtained from these will be inaccurate. Guidelines were
presented in Section 14‚Äì2. (14‚Äì2)
‚Ä¢ Most sampling methods use random numbers, which can also be used to simulate
many real-life problems or situations. The basic method of simulation is known as
the Monte Carlo method. The purpose of simulation is to duplicate situations that
are too dangerous, too costly, or too time-consuming to study in real life. Most
simulation techniques can be done on the computer or calculator, since they can
rapidly generate random numbers, count the outcomes, and perform the necessary
computations. (14‚Äì3)
Sampling and simulation are two techniques that enable researchers to gain
information that might otherwise be unobtainable.

The Monty Hall Problem‚ÄîRevisited
It appears that it does not matter whether the contestant switches doors because he is given a
choice of two doors, and the chance of winning the prize is 1 out of 2, or . This reasoning,
however, is incorrect. Consider the three possibilities for the prize. It could be behind door A,
B, or C. Also consider the fact that the contestant has selected door A. Now the three situations
look like this:
Door
Case
A
B
C
1
Prize
Empty
Empty
2
Empty
Prize
Empty
3
Empty
Empty
Prize
In case 1, the contestant selected door A, and if the contestant switched after being shown
that there was no prize behind either door B or door C, he‚Äôd lose. In case 2, the contestant
selected door A, and Monty will open door C, so if the contestant switched, he would win the
prize. In case 3, the contestant selected door A, and Monty will open door B, so if the contestant
switched, he would win the prize. Hence, by switching, the probability of winning is and the
probability of losing is . The same reasoning can be used no matter which door you select.
You can simulate this problem by using three cards, say, an ace (prize) and two other
cards. Have a person arrange the cards in a row and let you select a card. After the person turns
over one of the cards (a nonace), then switch. Keep track of the number of times you win. You
can also play this game on the Internet by going to the website http://www.stat.sc.edu/~west/

1. Explain why two different opinion polls might yield
different results on a survey. Also, give an example of
an opinion poll and explain how the data may have been
collected.
2. Use a computer to generate random numbers to simulate
the following real-life problem.
In a certain geographic region, 40% of the people
have type O blood. On a certain day, the blood center
needs 4 pints of type O blood. On average, how many
donors are needed to obtain 4 pints of type O blood?
1. Business and Finance A car salesperson has six
automobiles on the car lot. Roll a die, using the numbers
1 through 6 to represent each car. If only one car can be
sold on each day, how long will it take him to sell all the
automobiles? In other words, see how many tosses of
the die it will take to get the numbers 1 through 6.
2. Sports and Leisure Using the rules given in Figure 14‚Äì4
on page 725, play the simulated bowling game. Each
game consists of 10 frames.
3. Technology In a carton of 12 iPods, three are defective.
If four are sold on Saturday, Ô¨Ånd the probability that at
least one will be defective. Use random numbers to
simulate this exercise 50 times.
4. Health and Wellness Of people who go on a special
diet, 25% will lose at least 10 pounds in 10 weeks. A
drug manufacturer says that if people take its special
herbal pill, that will increase the number of people who
lose at least 10 pounds in 10 weeks. The company
conducts an experiment, giving its pills to 20 people.
Seven people lost at least 10 pounds in 10 weeks. The
drug manufacturer claims that the study ‚Äúproves‚Äù the
success of the herbal pills. Using random numbers,
simulate the experiment 30 times,  assuming the pills
are ineffective. What can you conclude about the result
that 7 out of 20 people lost at least 10 pounds?
5. Politics and Economics In Exercise Section 2‚Äì3,
problem 2 shows the numbers of signers of the
Declaration of Independence from each state. A student
decides to write a paper on two of the signers, who are
selected at random. What is the probability that both
signers will be from the same state? Use random
numbers to simulate the experiment, and perform the
experiment 50 times.

The White or Wheat 
Bread Debate
1. The researchers used a sample for their study.
2. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that we
might have doubts about the validity of the study, since
the baking company that conducted the experiment has
an interest in the outcome of the experiment.
3. The sample was probably a convenience sample.
4. Answers will vary. One possible answer would be to use
a simple random sample.
5. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that a list
of women‚Äôs names could be obtained from the city in
which the women live. Then a simple random sample
could be selected from this list.
6. The random assignment helps to spread variation
among the groups. The random selection helps to
generalize from the sample back to the population.
These are two different issues.

Smoking Bans and ProÔ¨Åts
1. It is uncertain how public smoking bans affected
restaurant business in Derry, Pennsylvania, since the
survey results were conÔ¨Çicting.
2. Since the data were collected in different ways, the
survey results were bound to have different answers.
Perceptions of the owners will deÔ¨Ånitely be different
from an analysis of actual sales receipts, particularly
if the owners assumed that the public smoking bans
would hurt business.

3. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that it would
be difÔ¨Åcult to not allow surveys based on anecdotal
responses to be published. At the same time, it would
be good for those publishing such survey results to
comment on the limitations of these surveys.
4. We can get results from a representative sample that
offer misleading information about the population.
5. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that
measurement error is important in survey sampling in
order to give ranges for the population parameters that
are being investigated.

Simulations
1. A simulation uses a probability experiment to mimic a
real-life situation.
2. Simulation techniques date back to ancient times.
3. It is deÔ¨Ånitely cost-effective to run simulations for
expensive items such as airplanes and automobiles.
4. Simulation testing is safer, faster, and less expensive
than many real-life testing situations.
5. Computer simulation techniques were developed in the
mid-1940s.
6. Answers will vary. One possible answer is that some
simulations are far less harmful than conducting an
actual study on the real-life situation of interest.
7. Answers will vary. Simulations could have possibly
prevented disasters such as the Hindenburg or the 1986
Space Shuttle disaster. For example, data analysis
after the Space Shuttle disaster showed that there was
a decent chance that something would go wrong on
that Ô¨Çight. See http://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html

A‚Äì1 Factorials
A‚Äì2 Summation Notation
A‚Äì3 The Line
A‚Äì1
Factorials
DeÔ¨Ånition and Properties of Factorials
The notation called factorial notation is used in probability.
Factorial notation uses the exclamation point and involves
multiplication. For example,
5!  5  4  3  2  1  120
4!  4  3  2  1  24
3!  3  2  1  6
2!  2  1  2
1!  1
In general, a factorial is evaluated as follows:
n!  n(n  1)(n  2)    3  2  1
Note that the factorial is the product of n factors, with the
number decreased by 1 for each factor.
One property of factorial notation is that it can be
stopped at any point by using the exclamation point. For
example,
5!  5  4!
since
4!  4  3  2  1
 5  4  3!
since
3!  3  2  1
 5  4  3  2!
since
2!  2  1
 5  4  3  2  1
Thus,
n!  n(n  1)!
 n(n  1)(n  2)!
 n(n  1)(n  2)(n  3)!
etc.
Another property of factorials is
0!  1
This fact is needed for formulas.
Operations with Factorials
Factorials cannot be added or subtracted directly. They
must be multiplied out. Then the products can be added or
subtracted.
Example A‚Äì1
Evaluate 3!  4!.
Solution
3!  4!  (3  2  1)  (4  3  2  1)
 6  24  30
Note: 3!  4!  7!, since 7!  5040.
Example A‚Äì2
Evaluate 5!  3!.
Solution
5!  3!  (5  4  3  2  1)  (3  2  1)
 120  6  114
Note: 5!  3!  2!, since 2!  2.
Factorials cannot be multiplied directly. Again, you must
multiply them out and then multiply the products.
Example A‚Äì3
Evaluate 3!  2!.
Solution
3!  2!  (3  2  1)  (2  1)  6  2  12
Note: 3!  2!  6!, since 6!  720.
Finally, factorials cannot be divided directly unless they
are equal.

In division, you can take some shortcuts, as shown:
Another shortcut that can be used with factorials is
cancellation, after factors have been expanded. For
example,
Now cancel both instances of 4!. Then cancel the 3  2 in
the denominator with the 6 in the numerator.

Summation Notation
In mathematics, the symbol  (Greek capital letter sigma)
means to add or Ô¨Ånd the sum. For example, X means
to add the numbers represented by the variable X. Thus,
when X represents 5, 8, 2, 4, and 6, then X means 
5  8  2  4  6  25.
Sometimes, a subscript notation is used, such as
This notation means to Ô¨Ånd the sum of Ô¨Åve numbers
represented by X, as shown:
When the number of values is not known, the unknown
number can be represented by n, such as
There are several important types of summation used in
statistics. The notation X 2 means to square each value
before summing. For example, if the values of the X‚Äôs are 
2, 8, 6, 1, and 4, then
The notation (X)2 means to Ô¨Ånd the sum of X‚Äôs and then
square the answer. For instance, if the values for X are 2, 8,
6, 1, and 4, then
Another important use of summation notation is in
Ô¨Ånding the mean (shown in Section 3‚Äì1). The mean 
is
deÔ¨Åned as
For example, to Ô¨Ånd the mean of 12, 8, 7, 3, and 10, use the
formula and substitute the values, as shown:

The Line
The following Ô¨Ågure shows the rectangular coordinate
system, or Cartesian plane. This Ô¨Ågure consists of two axes:
the horizontal axis, called the x axis, and the vertical axis,
called the y axis. Each axis has numerical scales. The point
of intersection of the axes is called the origin.
Points can be graphed by using coordinates. For example,
the notation for point P(3, 2) means that the x coordinate is
3 and the y coordinate is 2. Hence, P is located at the
intersection of x  3 and y  2, as shown.
Other points, such as Q(5, 2), R(4, 1), and S(3, 4),
can be plotted, as shown in the next Ô¨Ågure.
When a point lies on the y axis, the x coordinate is 0, as
in (0, 6)(0, 3), etc. When a point lies on the x axis, the y
coordinate is 0, as in (6, 0)(8, 0), etc., as shown at the top 
of the next page.

Two points determine a line. There are two properties
of a line: its slope and its equation. The slope m of a line
is determined by the ratio of the rise (called y) to the
run (x).
For example, the slope of the line shown below is , or
1.5, since the height y is 3 units and the run x is 2 units.

m  rise
run  y
x
The slopes of lines can be positive, negative, or zero.
A line going uphill from left to right has a positive slope. A
line going downhill from left to right has a negative slope.
And a line that is horizontal has a slope of zero.
A point b where the line crosses the x axis is called the
x intercept and has the coordinates (b, 0). A point a where
the line crosses the y axis is called the y intercept and has
the coordinates (0, a).
Every line has a unique equation of the form y  a  bx.
For example, the equations
y  5  3x
y  8.6  3.2x
y  5.2  6.1x
all represent different, unique lines. The number
represented by a is the y intercept point; the number
represented by b is the slope. The line whose equation is
y  3  2x has a y intercept at 3 and a slope of 2, or . This
line can be shown as in the following graph.

If two points are known, then the graph of the line can
be plotted. For example, to Ô¨Ånd the graph of a line passing
through the points P(2, 1) and Q(3, 5), plot the points and
connect them as shown below.
Given the equation of a line, you can graph the line by
Ô¨Ånding two points and then plotting them.
Example A‚Äì8
Plot the graph of the line whose equation is y  3  2x.
Solution
Select any number as an x value, and substitute it in the
equation to get the corresponding y value. Let x  0.

Now select any other value of x, say, x  2.
y  3  2x  3  2(2)  7
Hence, a second point is (2, 7). Then plot the points and

Given two dependent events A
and B, the previous formulas for
conditional probability allow you
to Ô¨Ånd P(A and B), or P(B A).
Related to these formulas is a
rule developed by the English
Presbyterian minister Thomas
Bayes (1702‚Äì1761). The rule is
known as Bayes‚Äô theorem.
It is possible, given the
outcome of the second event in
a sequence of two events, to
determine the probability of
various possibilities for the Ô¨Årst
event. In Example 4‚Äì31, there
were two boxes, each containing
red balls and blue balls. A box
was selected and a ball was
drawn. The example asked for
the probability that the ball
selected was red. Now a
different question can be asked: If the ball is red, what is
the probability it came from box 1? In this case, the
outcome is known, a red ball was selected, and you are
asked to Ô¨Ånd the probability that it is a result of a previous
event, that it came from box 1. Bayes‚Äô theorem can enable

you to compute this probability and can be explained by
using tree diagrams.
The tree diagram for the solution of Example 4‚Äì31 is
shown in Figure B‚Äì1, along with the appropriate notation
and the corresponding probabilities. In this case, A1 is the
event of selecting box 1, A2 is the event of selecting box 2,
R is the event of selecting a red ball, and B is the event of
selecting a blue ball.
To answer the question ‚ÄúIf the ball selected is red, what
is the probability that it came from box 1?‚Äù two formulas
(1)
(2)
can be used. The notation that will be used is that of
Example 4‚Äì31, shown in Figure B‚Äì1. Finding the
probability that box 1 was selected given that the ball
selected was red can be written symbolically as P(A1 R). 
By formula 1,

Historical Notes
Thomas Bayes was
born around 1701
and lived in London.
He was an ordained
minister who dabbled
in mathematics and
statistics. All his
Ô¨Åndings and writings
were published after
his death in 1761.
Objective B-1
Find the probability of
an event, using Bayes‚Äô
theorem.

By formula 2,
P(A1 and R)  P(A1) . P(R A1)
and
P(R)  P(A1 and R)  P(A2 and R)
as shown in Figure B‚Äì1; P(R) was found by adding the
products of the probabilities of the branches in which a red
ball was selected. Now,
P(A1 and R)  P(A1) . P(R A1)
P(A2 and R)  P(A2) . P(R A2)
Substituting these values in the original formula for 
P(A1 R), you get
Refer to Figure B‚Äì1. The numerator of the fraction is the
product of the top branch of the tree diagram, which
consists of selecting a red ball and selecting box 1. And the
denominator is the sum of the products of the two branches
of the tree where the red ball was selected.
Using this formula and the probability values shown in
Figure B‚Äì1, you can Ô¨Ånd the probability that box 1 was
selected given that the ball was red, as shown.
This formula is a simpliÔ¨Åed version of Bayes‚Äô theorem.
Before Bayes‚Äô theorem is stated, another example is
shown.

Example B‚Äì1
A shipment of two boxes, each containing six telephones,
is received by a store. Box 1 contains one defective phone,
and box 2 contains two defective phones. After the boxes
are unpacked, a phone is selected and found to be defective.
Find the probability that it came from box 2.
Solution
STEP 1
Select the proper notation. Let A1 represent box 1
and A2 represent box 2. Let D represent a
defective phone and ND represent a phone that is
not defective.
STEP 2
Draw a tree diagram and Ô¨Ånd the corresponding
probabilities for each branch. The probability
of selecting box 1 is , and the probability of
selecting box 2 is . Since there is one defective
phone in box 1, the probability of selecting it is .
The probability of selecting a nondefective phone
from box 1 is .
Since there are two defective phones in box 2,
the probability of selecting a defective phone from
box 2 is , or ; and the probability of selecting a
nondefective phone is , or . The tree diagram is
shown in Figure B‚Äì2.
STEP 3
Write the corresponding formula. Since the
example is asking for the probability that, given 
a defective phone, it came from box 2, the
corresponding formula is as shown.

Solution
STEP 1
Select the proper notation. Let B1, B2, B3, and B4
represent the boxes and 100 and 1 represent the
values of the bills in the boxes.
STEP 2
Draw a tree diagram and Ô¨Ånd the corresponding
probabilities. The probability of selecting each
box is , or 0.25. The probabilities of selecting
the $100 bill from each box, respectively, are

tree diagram is shown in Figure B‚Äì3.

In Example B‚Äì2, the original probability of selecting
box 4 was 0.25. However, once additional information was
obtained‚Äîand the condition was considered that a $100 bill
was selected‚Äîthe revised probability of selecting box 4
became 0.455.
Bayes‚Äô theorem can be used to revise probabilities of
events once additional information becomes known. Bayes‚Äô
theorem is used as the basis for a branch of statistics called
Bayesian decision making, which includes the use of
subjective probabilities in making statistical inferences.

The following procedure may be used to replace the
cumulative area to the left procedure shown in Section 6‚Äì1.
This method determines areas from the mean where z  0.
Finding Areas Under the Standard Normal
Distribution
For the solution of problems using the standard normal
distribution, a four-step procedure may be used with the use
of the Procedure Table shown.
STEP 1 Sketch the normal curve and label.
STEP 2 Shade the area desired.
STEP 3 Find the Ô¨Ågure that matches the shaded area from
the following procedure table.
STEP 4 Follow the directions given in the appropriate
block of the procedure table to get the desired 
area.
Note: Table B‚Äì1 gives the area between 0 and any z score
to the right of 0, and all areas are positive.
There are seven basic types of problems and all seven
are summarized in the Procedure Table, with appropriate
examples.

Chapter 1
It is important to emphasize that statistical studies use
random variables and the values of the variables are called
data. Since data can be used in different ways, statistics can
be divided into two main branches, descriptive statistics and
inferential statistics. The two branches can be illustrated to
the class with examples selected from newspapers and
magazines.
A very important requirement of a statistical study is to
deÔ¨Åne the population and select a random sample. These
concepts should be introduced, and then, if desired, students
can be referred to Chapter 14, which contains more
information on the selection process. It should be pointed
out that inferential statistics is based on probability theory.
Since statisticians use data, the various types of data and
the measurement levels should be explained. Again, real-life
examples can be selected from newspapers and magazine
articles.
Two types of statistical studies are explained here. Students
should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of
observational and experimental studies. Newspaper and
magazine articles can be used to illustrate each type of study.
A brief explanation of the uses and misuses of statistics is
presented in Chapter 1.
Chapter 2
It is important to emphasize that the reason data are
organized into a frequency distribution is to enable the
researcher to make sense out of seemingly random
occurrences. Once data are organized, they can be studied
for various patterns and information. Also, a frequency
distribution is used to draw various statistical graphs and is
used in computing descriptive statistical measures, such as
means and standard deviations.
When you are teaching the histogram, frequency polygon,
and ogive, explain to students that the histogram and ogive use
the class boundaries on the x axis and the frequency polygon
uses class midpoints. Stress that the points for the ogive are
plotted at the upper class boundaries, except for the Ô¨Årst point
whose frequency is zero. Instructors wishing to teach scatter
plots along with the other graphs in this chapter can teach
Section 10‚Äì1 here.
Stem and leaf plots have been moved from Chapter 3 to
Chapter 2.
Chapter 3
The purpose of Chapter 3 is to explain the basic descriptive
measures that are used in statistics. They can be divided into
three groups:
1. Measures of average (mean, median, and mode).
2. Measures of variation (range, variance, and standard
deviation).
3. Measures of position (percentiles, deciles, and quartiles).
Before teaching this chapter, the instructor may wish to
teach the summation notation section found in Appendix A:
Algebra Review. In addition, students should be made aware
that the measures of central tendency will usually be different
for the same data, and that each measure has a speciÔ¨Åc
purpose.
Students should know that there are differences between
the population variance and the unbiased estimate of the
variance. For those students who have statistical calculators,
the two different keys should be explained.
Students sometimes have difÔ¨Åculty understanding what is
meant by the standard deviation. It helps to explain that for
many data sets, most of the values fall within 2 standard
deviations on either side of the mean. A better approximation
is given by Chebyshev‚Äôs theorem.
Section 3‚Äì3 explains position measures. Note that there
are several different ways to compute the percentile ranks for
individual data. The method presented is consistent with the
computation of the median. Procedures for Ô¨Ånding percentiles
for grouped data have been omitted in this textbook; instead,
graphic methods are used. The relationship between the
cumulative frequency graph and the percentile graph should
be pointed out to students.
Finally, a graphic technique called the boxplot can be used
to describe a data set that is too small to be represented by a
histogram. Two boxplots drawn on the same axes can also be
used to compare two data sets.
Chapter 4
Students should be made aware that probability is used as a
basis for inferential statistics. It is important to emphasize the
concept of a sample space and the basic probability rules and
to distinguish among three types of probabilities. The addition,
multiplication, and complementary rules build on the basic
probability rules.
This chapter includes the counting rules. These rules are
helpful in determining the number of outcomes in a sample
space in order to compute probabilities. Section 4‚Äì5 shows
how to use the counting rules along with the probability 
rules.
In teaching this chapter, most professors will want to
review the factorial notation given in Appendix A unless
students have covered it in a previous course. Also emphasize
the difference between doing something when repetitions are
allowed and when they are not allowed, and the difference
between a permutation and a combination. Some students will
have difÔ¨Åculty making this distinction at the end of the chapter.
Explain that when order is important, such as in license plates,
ID numbers, or street addresses, you should use the
multiplication rule or the permutation rules.
Chapter 5
It is important to teach the binomial distribution (Sections 5‚Äì1
through 5‚Äì3). These are necessary prerequisites for later
Instructor‚Äôs Section Teaching Tips
IS‚Äì2
Teaching Tips

sections on hypothesis testing. Section 5‚Äì4, on the multinomial,
Poisson, and hypergeometric distributions, can be omitted at
the instructor‚Äôs discretion.
Chapter 6
In Chapter 6, it is important to emphasize the characteristics
of the theoretical normal distribution and to show that it
can be used as a model for real-life variables that are
approximately normally distributed. Using these properties
and the Procedure Table, students can solve all problems
involving Ô¨Ånding areas under the normal distribution.
Applications of the normal distribution to real-life variables
involve transforming these variables to z values and using the
Procedure Table.
Section 6‚Äì4 explains the central limit theorem, which will
lead to hypothesis testing in Chapter 8.
Section 6‚Äì5 explains how the normal distribution can be
used to approximate a variable that has the binomial
distribution.
Since many applications of statistics require a distribution
to be normal, several methods can be used to determine
whether a distribution is normal. It should be emphasized that
no real-world distribution is perfectly normal.
Chapter 7
Many statistical procedures involve making estimates. To
reinforce this, the instructor can have students bring in
examples of estimates from newspaper and magazine articles.
In most cases, the estimate given will look like a point
estimate; however, most editors omit the conÔ¨Ådence interval.
For example, if an estimate is 7  2 years, it will be reported
as 7 years.
Be sure to point out that the more conÔ¨Ådent you wish to
be, the larger the interval should be. There are ways to reduce
the size of the interval without changing the level of
conÔ¨Ådence, for example, by increasing sample size.
Chapter 8
The hypothesis-testing procedure is difÔ¨Åcult for many students,
since it involves many different concepts. It is important to
explain that you can never be 100% sure of the correctness of
the results when samples are used.
In teaching this chapter, it is helpful to explain generally
what is happening, then follow this explanation by using
speciÔ¨Åc examples. Be sure to emphasize that the claim could
be either the null or alternative hypothesis and relate the level
of signiÔ¨Åcance to the central limit theorem.
The two methods of hypothesis testing are explained in this
chapter. Both methods use Ô¨Åve basic steps. With the advent of
computers and calculators that can compute the P-value
quickly, this method is being used more frequently than in the
past. Explain that when one is Ô¨Ånding P-values from Tables F,
G, and H, only approximate interval values can be used. In the
examples and exercises, the speciÔ¨Åc P-value obtained from a
calculator has been given with the interval.
Since P-value intervals for the t and chi-square tests are
somewhat difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd from the table, you may want to
have students use technology for these exercises or use the
traditional method for hypotheses testing.
It is important to show students how to use the chi-square
table and to emphasize that the variance test can be one- or
two-tailed. The one-tailed test can be either right or left. When
testing a right-tailed hypothesis, students should use the right
side of the table and the speciÔ¨Åc value, for example, 0.05.
When testing a left-tailed hypothesis, the students should use
the left side of the table and Ô¨Ånd the 1  a value. For example,
if a  0.05, the 1  0.05, or 0.95, column should be used.
For a two-tailed test, the area must be split. For example,
if a  0.05, you should use the 0.025 and 0.975 columns.
Chapter 9
Once students have mastered Chapter 8, this chapter becomes
a continuation of the concepts of hypothesis testing. One
difÔ¨Åculty students encounter is that there are Ô¨Åve different
formulas for testing differences. It is important to emphasize
the different situations and which test is appropriate in
each case.
Section 9‚Äì2 explains the F test for comparing two variances.
This section is somewhat difÔ¨Åcult for students. This section can
be taught with the ANOVA material in Chapter 12; however,
the students would need to be told whether the variances are
equal for the exercises in Section 9‚Äì3.
Chapter 10
It is important to stress that many real-life variables are
related in some way. Using correlation and regression
techniques, statisticians can determine the nature of the
relationship. Examples of relationships found in newspapers
and magazines can be used in a discussion of the topics
involved, such as the strength and type of the relationship.
Students should understand that if the graph is cut off, the
y intercept value may not be appropriate when the regression
line is plotted.
A brief explanation of extrapolation, lurking variables,
marginal change, least-squares line, residuals, and inÔ¨Çuential
observations has been added to this chapter.
Chapter 11
Emphasize that the variance test shown in Chapter 8 can be
one- or two-tailed, but the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test and the
independence test are always right-tailed.
Chapter 12
It is important to make students aware that they should use the
analysis of variance when testing the equality of three or more
means. Also emphasize that the ANOVA will not specify where
the difference lies. After a signiÔ¨Åcant F, they can perform the
Scheff√© or Tukey test to determine where the difference lies.
There are many other tests that can be conducted after the F
test, but they are beyond the scope of this book.
Instructor‚Äôs Section Teaching Tips
IS‚Äì3

Chapter 13
The important point to emphasize in this chapter is that the
parametric statistics require the assumption of normality of the
data. When this assumption cannot be met, the corresponding
counterpart, nonparametric statistics, can be used to test similar
hypotheses. In most cases, however, larger sample sizes are
needed to obtain the same results as with the parametric
counterparts. Students should know that there is not complete
agreement among statisticians as to the use of nonparametric
statistics.
Chapter 14
There are two main topics in Chapter 14: sampling and
simulation. Both topics use random numbers. For sampling,
the instructor can explain the basic methods and have students
actually select samples from a small population, then compute
the mean of the variable being sampled. The instructor can
have each student read his or her mean aloud to see how
close it is to the actual population mean. This is an excellent
introduction to the central limit theorem presented in
Chapter 6. The mean of the sample means can be computed,
and if the class is large, the students will see how close this
mean is to the population mean.
The purpose of the second half of this chapter is to enable
students to understand the nature of statistical simulation.
Again using random numbers and sampling, the students will
see how close the means found by simulation techniques are
to the theoretical means computed mathematically.
In addition to the two main topics, a third topic on surveys
and questionnaires has been added. This topic will help
increase the statistical literacy of the students.

The standard deviation is unchanged when a speciÔ¨Åc
number is added to or subtracted from each data value.
If each data value is multiplied by a number, the
standard deviation increases by the number times the
original standard deviation. For division, the standard
deviation is divided by the number.
g. When the same number is added to or subtracted from
each data value, the mean will increase or decrease by
that number, but the standard deviation will remain
unchanged. When each data value is multiplied by
the same number, the mean or standard deviation will
be equal to that number times the original mean or
standard deviation. When each data value is divided
by the same number, the mean or standard deviation
will be equal to the original mean or standard
deviation divided by that number.

52. 0.678; yes the event is a little more likely to occur than
not since the probability is about 68%.
53. No, since P(A  B)  0 and does not equal P(A)  P(B).
54. No, since P(CD)  P(C).
55. Enrollment and meeting with DW and meeting with MH
are dependent. Since meeting with MH has a low
probability and meeting with LP has no effect, all
students, if possible, should meet with DW.
56. a. The events are dependent, and the commercial hurts
sales since the probability that a person buys the
product is less than 0.35.
b. The events are independent; hence, the commercial has
no effect.
c. The events are dependent, and the commercial helps
since the probability that a person buys the product is
higher than 0.35.

1. A point estimate of a parameter speciÔ¨Åes a particular
value, such as m  87; an interval estimate speciÔ¨Åes a
range of values for the parameter, such as 84  m  90.
The advantage of an interval estimate is that a speciÔ¨Åc
conÔ¨Ådence level (say 95%) can be selected, and one can
be 95% conÔ¨Ådent that the interval contains the parameter
that is being estimated.
2. The standard deviation of the population must be known,
or it must be estimated or speciÔ¨Åed in terms of E. Sample
size must be speciÔ¨Åed, and the degree of conÔ¨Ådence must
be selected.
3. The margin of error is the likely range of values to the
right or left of the statistic that may contain the parameter.
4. A 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval means one can be 95%
conÔ¨Ådent that the conÔ¨Ådence interval will contain the
parameter being estimated.
5. A good estimator should be unbiased, consistent, and
relatively efÔ¨Åcient.
6.
7. For one to be able to determine sample size, the margin of
error and the degree of conÔ¨Ådence must be speciÔ¨Åed and
the population standard deviation must be known.

P-value is extremely small, it is not given.
Exercises 8‚Äì1
1. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference
between a parameter and a speciÔ¨Åc value or that there is
no difference between two parameters. The alternative
hypothesis states that there is a speciÔ¨Åc difference
between a parameter and a speciÔ¨Åc value or that there is a
difference between two parameters. Examples will vary.
2. A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected
when it is true. A type II error occurs when the null
hypothesis is not rejected when it is false. They are related
in that decreasing the probability of one type of error
increases the probability of the other type of error.
3. A statistical test uses the data obtained from a sample to
make a decision about whether the null hypothesis should
be rejected.
4. A one-tailed test indicates the null hypothesis should
be rejected when the test statistic value is in the critical
region on one side of the mean. A two-tailed test indicates
the null hypothesis should be rejected when the test statistic
value is in either critical region on either side of the mean.
5. The critical region is the range of values of the test
statistic that indicates that there is a signiÔ¨Åcant difference
and the null hypothesis should be rejected. The noncritical
region is the range of values of the test statistic that
indicates that the difference was probably due to chance
and the null hypothesis should not be rejected.
6. H0 represents the null hypothesis; H1 represents the
alternative hypothesis.
7. a, b
8. When the difference between the sample mean and the
hypothesized population mean is large, then the difference
is said to be signiÔ¨Åcant and probably not due to chance.
9. A one-tailed test should be used when a speciÔ¨Åc direction,
such as greater than or less than, is being hypothesized;
when no direction is speciÔ¨Åed, a two-tailed test should be
used.

1. Testing a single mean involves comparing a sample mean
to a speciÔ¨Åc value such as m  100; testing the difference
between two means involves comparing the means of two
samples, such as m1  m2.
2. When both samples are larger than or equal to 30, the
distribution will be approximately normal. The mean of
the differences will be equal to zero. The standard
deviation of the differences will be
3. The populations must be independent of each other, and
they must be normally distributed; s1 and s2 can be used
in place of s1 and s2 when s1 and s2 are unknown, but
a t test must be used.

18.
1  0.278; 
2  0.26; 0.0961  p1  p2  0.1319.
The interval does not support the claim that there is a
difference because 0 is contained in the interval and thus
allows for the possibility that no difference exists.
19. 0.0631  p1  p2  0.0667. It does agree with the
Almanac statistics stating a difference of 0.042 since
0.042 is contained in the interval.
20. No, p1 could equal p3.

1. A scatter plot should be drawn, and the value of the
correlation coefÔ¨Åcient should be tested to see whether 
it is signiÔ¨Åcant.
2. 1. For any speciÔ¨Åc value of the independent variable x,
the value of the dependent variable y must be normally
distributed about the regression line.
2. The standard deviation of each of the dependent
variables must be the same for each value of the
independent variable.
3. y  a 	 bx

5. It is the line that is drawn through the points on the scatter
plot such that the sum of the squares of the vertical
distances from each point to the line is a minimum.
6. r would equal 	1 or 1.
7. When r is positive, b will be positive. When r is negative,
b will be negative.
8. They would be clustered closer to the line.
9. The closer r is to 	1 or 1, the more accurate the
predicted value will be.
10. If the value of r is not signiÔ¨Åcant, no regression should be
done. Any regression line is meaningless.
11. When r is not signiÔ¨Åcant, the mean of the y values should
be used to predict y.
12. Not signiÔ¨Åcant so no regression should be done.

Exercises 11‚Äì1
1. The variance test compares a sample variance with a
hypothesized population variance; the goodness-of-Ô¨Åt test
compares a distribution obtained from a sample with a
hypothesized distribution.
2. The degrees of freedom are the number of categories
minus 1.
3. The expected values are computed on the basis of what
the null hypothesis states about the distribution.
4. The categories should be combined with other categories.
5. H0: 82% of home-schooled students receive their
education entirely at home, 12% attend school up to
9 hours per week, and 6% spend from 9 to 25 hours per
week at school. H1: The proportions differ from those
stated in the null hypothesis (claim). C.V.  5.991; 
x2  31.75; reject. There is sufÔ¨Åcient evidence to
conclude that the proportions differ from those stated by
the government.
6. H0: The methods used by workers to combat midday
drowsiness are equally distributed among the Ô¨Åve
categories (claim). H1: The methods are not equally
distributed among the Ô¨Åve categories. C.V.  7.779; 
d.f.  4; x2  13.83; reject. There is enough evidence
to reject the claim that the methods used are equally
distributed over the categories. An employer could plan

Exercises 12‚Äì3
1. The two-way ANOVA allows the researcher to test the
effects of two independent variables and a possible
interaction effect. The one-way ANOVA can test the
effects of only one independent variable.
2. The main effects are the effects of the independent
variables taken separately. The interaction effect occurs
when one independent variable affects the dependent
variable differently at different levels of the other
independent variable.
3. The mean square values are computed by dividing the
sum of squares by the corresponding degrees of freedom.
4. One computes the F test value by dividing the mean
square for the variable by the mean square for the within
(error) term.

Since all three means for the home types for subcon-
tractor A are greater than the three means for subcon-
tractor B and the differences are not equal, there is an
ordinal interaction. Hence, it can be concluded that there
is a difference in means for the subcontractors and home
types. In addition, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant interaction
between subcontractors and home types.

Since the means for exercise program I are both smaller
than those for exercise program II and the vertical
differences are not the same, the interaction is ordinal.
Hence you can say that there is a difference for exercise
and diet, and that an interaction effect is present.

1. Nonparametric means hypotheses other than those using
population parameters can be tested; distribution-free
means no assumptions about the population distributions
have to be satisÔ¨Åed.
2. When the assumptions for the parametric methods cannot
be met, statisticians use nonparametric methods.
3. Nonparametric methods have the following advantages:
a. They can be used to test population parameters when
the variable is not normally distributed.
b. They can be used when data are nominal or ordinal.
c. They can be used to test hypotheses other than those
involving population parameters.
d. The computations are easier in some cases than the
computations of the parametric counterparts.
e. They are easier to understand.
The disadvantages are as follows:
a. They are less sensitive than their parametric
counterparts.
b. They tend to use less information than their parametric
counterparts.
c. They are less efÔ¨Åcient than their parametric
counterparts.

10. rs  0.8857; H0: r  0 and H1: r  0; C.V.  0.886.
Very close! There is not a signiÔ¨Åcant relationship between
the number of books published in 1980 and in 2004 in
the same subject area. Since r is not signiÔ¨Åcant, no
relationship can be predicted 20 years from now. 
Even if r is signiÔ¨Åcant, you should not make a prediction
for 20 years from now. That would be extrapolating.
11. rs  0.624; H0: r  0 and H1: r  0; C.V.  0.700;

15. H0: the number of cavities in a person occurs at random
and H1: the null hypothesis is not true. There are 21 runs;
the expected number of runs is between 10 and 22.
Therefore, do not reject the null hypothesis; the number of
cavities in a person occurs at random.
16. H0: the numbers occur at random and H1: the null
hypothesis is not true. There are 14 runs. Since the
expected number of runs is between 8 and 20, do not
reject. The numbers occur at random.
17. H0: the purchases of soft drinks occur at random and
H1: the null hypothesis is not true. There are 16 runs, and
the expected number of runs is between 9 and 22, so do
not reject the null hypothesis. Hence the purchases of soft
drinks occur at random.
18. H0: the integers generated by a calculator occur at random
and H1: the null hypothesis is not true. There are 13 runs,
and the expected number of runs is between 7 and 17, so
the null hypothesis is not rejected. The integers occur at
random.
19. H0: the seating occurs at random and H1: the null
hypothesis is not true. There are 14 runs. Since the
expected number of runs is between 10 and 23, do not
reject. The seating occurs at random.
20. H0: the gender of the shoppers in line at the grocery store
is random (claim) and H1: the null hypothesis is not true.
There are 10 runs. Since the expected number of runs is
between 6 and 16, the null hypothesis should not be
rejected. There is not enough evidence to reject the
hypothesis that the gender of the shoppers in line is random.
21. H0: the number of absences of employees occurs at
random over a 30-day period and H1: the null hypothesis
is not true. There are only 6 runs, and this value does not
fall within the 9-to-21 range. Hence, the null hypothesis
is rejected; the absences do not occur at random.
22. H0: the days customers are able to ski occur at random
(claim) and H1: the null hypothesis is not true. There are
5 runs. Since this number is not between 9 and 20, the
decision is to reject the null hypothesis. There is enough
evidence to reject the claim that the days customers are
able to ski occur at random.

Exercises 14‚Äì1
1. Random, systematic, stratiÔ¨Åed, cluster
2. Samples can save the researcher time and money. They
are used when the population is large or inÔ¨Ånite. They are
used when the original units are to be destroyed, such as
in testing the breaking strength of ropes.
3. A sample must be randomly selected.
4. Random numbers are used to ensure every element of the
population has the same chance of being selected.
5. Talking to people on the street, calling people on the
phone, and asking your friends are three incorrect ways of
obtaining a sample.
6. Over the long run each digit, 0 through 9, will occur with
the same probability.
7. Random sampling has the advantage that each unit of the
population has an equal chance of being selected. One
disadvantage is that the units of the population must be
numbered; if the population is large, this could be
somewhat time-consuming.
8. Systematic sampling has an advantage in that once the
Ô¨Årst unit is selected, each succeeding unit selected has
been determined. This saves time. A disadvantage would
be if the list of units was arranged in some manner so that
a bias would occur, such as selecting all men when the
population consists of both men and women.
9. An advantage of stratiÔ¨Åed sampling is that it ensures
representation for the groups used in stratiÔ¨Åcation;
however, it is virtually impossible to stratify the
population so that all groups are represented.
10. Clusters are easy to use since they already exist, but it is
difÔ¨Åcult to justify that the clusters actually represent the
population.
