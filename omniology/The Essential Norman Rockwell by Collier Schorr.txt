THE ESSENTIAL
NORMAN ROCKWELL
by Collier Schorr
Everyone knows Norman Rockwell.
But how many remember that this artist
of home-and-hearth Americana was one
of the first artists to champion civil rights?
From the man who brought us canvases of
exuberance and joy, we are amazed at what
awaits us beneath the rosy surface.
Meet the extraordinary creator of:
Scenes from our everyday lives—the
first dentist visit, the Thanksgiving
dinner, the battlefields of war, the

to people of color. Norman Rockwell was not only in tune with the
times, he was far ahead of them.
In the debate over whether Rockwell
was a "true" artist or a "mere" illustrator (ahem! some of the world's
greatest art has come from illustrators), the more important discussion
ought to focus on Rockwell as a conduit for expressing our individual
right to freedom and happiness. That's the skinny on Rockwell's greatness.
But How did he do it?
More than any other popular
artist of his
time, Rockwell took a
stand—and a public one, at that—against prejudice, bigotry, inequality,
and against the stereotypes that keep us from living the lives we desire
and that bully us into being people we are not. But he did not take this
stand at the beginning of his
life.
He grew into this boldness after
years of emerging, like the rest of us, from youthful innocence into
empathy based on
life experience.
Even though Rockwell spent his
early years painting mild-mannered, amiable scenes, he had no
fear,
later in his career, of attaching his name to more controversial subjects
when the truth was less than rosy.
In short, he grew as an artist and as
a human being.
Sure, he painted schoolgirls and dentists and grandmas

and athletes. But he also evoked the America of the 1920s as it roared
into the Great Depression—a country of poverty and frustration, of
hopes gone sour and dreams destroyed by war, of families who clung
together through good times and bad because family was all they had.
Then he went on to paint heart-breaking scenes of racial prejudice.
A Country in Flux
Rockwell changed as America changed, and the legacy of his extraor-
dinary talent
is that we now have a panoramic view of the behaviors
and concerns that characterized the lives of many Americans throughout
the 20
th century.
It's all there—the quaint little prom dances alongside
the chilling resistance to desegregation—the comedy and drama, conflict
and harmony, ambition and despair. Here is Rockwell in full color for
you
to
puzzle
over and
enjoy—a pop-culture icon who
expresses
America's spirit and preoccupations, for better or for worse. Though
critics have often called
it corny, Rockwell's
art resonates with the
masses. At the same time, it leads us to wonder what's going on beneath
the cheery surface of all those smiling children and cute little puppy dogs.
How About You?
When someone mentions Rockwell, what do you think of?

Does your Thanksgiving table look different? Perhaps. But the under-
lying mood
is probably closer than you think to the one captured by
Rockwell. The magic and legacy of this much-loved artist
is that he
painted what we want to remember about ourselves, our childhoods, our
families, and about American
life and values in the 20
th century—or
what we wish our lives had been like when we were growing up.
The Big Cahuna of Illustration. ..and More!
Norman Rockwell (1894-1978)
is an American institution.
We're
familiar with his work because we've seen
it so often. His images of
home and hearth, family and patriots, small-town life and outings to
the country are so "knowable" and so likeable that we feel comfortable
and utterly enchanted with them.
Regardless of what the critics say,
his art resists simplistic and superficial classification.
Even though Rockwell was
a well-known
public
figure, he was a
private man
and
is
not
easily pigeonholed. You
think you know
about
this American
one-of-a-kind,

Which of the following are TRUE or FALSE?
Norman Rockwell:
admired the drip paintings ofJackson Pollock
made several trips to Paris, seeking the inspiration of Modern art
was a genuinely nice, unpretentious man
dropped out of high school
hobnobbed with the rich and famous
was born and bred in New York City
painted works collected by Steven Spielberg and Ross Perot
suffered from depression
The answers?
All eight are true, even if his reason for dropping out of high
school was to enroll in art school, and even if some of his childhood
was lived in the suburbs north of Manhattan.
Pardonnez-moi, Art World
You've probably had the perplexing experience of standing next
to
someone in a museum who carries on as if he/she's an art expert, right?
"This is Picasso's Blue Period," they'll say, when looking at Majolie, a
Cubist painting made
after the end of his Blue Period. Well guess

what? Sometimes "important" art critics at major news-
papers carry on this way, too. With Rockwell, the big
debate
has
always
been:
Was he an
"artist" or an
"illustrator?" The traditional distinction has been that
illustrators
are hired to
skillfully execute other peoples
visions (such as an author's story line or an advertiser's
creative campaign), whereas the artist expresses his/her
own talent and executes works that are true only to the
artist's own inner need to create.
While Rockwell did indeed think of himself as an illus-
trator—and called himself that in his 1960 bestselling
memoir, My Adventures
as an
Illustrator—that's
not
what the real debate
is about here.
Instead, you'll find
art critics who blow him off as an irrelevant hack-for-
hire who painted what his magazine editors told him to
paint and had no particular vision or creative force that
uplifted and inspired viewers. Huh???
Critics seem to forget that Rockwell's creations have
delighted millions of people, year after year, both during
his
lifetime and long
after
his death
in
1978. So
it
comes back to the tired argument that critics think they
know better than the public—that a critic's eye is more
discerning than
a
factory worker's
heart.
Rockwell's
Three Ladies
Gossiping, 1929

critics maintain that he endlessly repeated the same old tired images of
"All
is well in the world," a kind of flawless, perfect family unit in
which order, authority, and correct behavior rule the day. While there
is some truth to this, Rockwell amounts to much, much more, as you
will see.
Great Art vs. New Art
From about 1980 onward, it has not been cool for "true" art lovers to
show enthusiasm for Norman Rockwell. His reputation as an artist has
been battered in a kind of high-art vs. low-art war that began in the
late 1940s and early 1950s, when Rockwell was at the height of his
popularity and when art-world critics were thrilled with the work of
Modern artists—in particular, those who were experimenting with the
innovative new Abstract Expressionism
(also
called AbEx, or The
New York School). The major AbEx painters were Jackson Pollock
(1912-1956), Robert Motherwell (1915-1951), Willem de Kooning
(1904-1997), and Franz Kline (1910-1962).
While the
latter were
dripping and
pouring
and
squooshing
paint
onto
their
canvases,
Rockwell was capturing the America of his time, a world of changing
social customs and emerging technologies and increasingly complex
family relationships, set against a backdrop of a massive move from
rural America
to
the
big
cities
and
industrialized
milieux.
If the
Modern
painters
distorted
the human
figure beyond
recognition,
Rockwell profiled
it in
all
its humanity.
His admirers felt warm and

safe when they viewed his art.
His work had an emotional impact on
them and instantly brought smiles to their faces.
Before Abstract Expressionism, American art was essentially pictorial.
Subject matter was recognizable and often told a story by expressing
realistic details. When the Abstract Expressionists came along, critics
praised them for creating the first original movement ofAmerican art—
which
critics
also considered the only truly modern body of work
produced in America. In doing so, they hexed Norman Rockwell, rel-
egating him to the Land of Corn (as in corny) and to the Netherworld
of Commerce. Their enchantment with the New was like putting on
blinders: As the century progressed, they looked straight ahead, always
applauding the "next new thing," yet not always seeing the forks in the
road and the parallel paths. Norman Rockwell was on a parallel path
and made extraordinary works that rival some of the best of the AbEx
artists. Yet he was considered an irrelevant holdover from some remote
past. That's why, ever since the 1950s, the art world has had a kind of
stony silence about him.
With
a
roll of the eyes and a "knowing"
glance to each other, art experts and academics banish him to the ranks
of low-end nostalgia.
Never Fear, Rockwell is Here!
Well watch out, art world, 'cause Norman Rockwell is back—and he's
proving to be an artist of considerable longevity and impact.
Scenes

from his paintings are re-enacted in such Stephen Spielberg movies as
Saving Private Ryan, and his style continues to tap a rich and respon-
sive chord in millions of viewers. If Rockwell were not beloved by a
vast public, we would not see his images on products at Bed, Bath &c
Beyond or in the in-flight magazine of American Airlines.
How do you feel about Rockwell? Perhaps you bristle at the art-world's
condescension
( "he occupies no place in art history") and will savor your
stroll through this book, enjoying the images and smiling at the world
captured in them.
But maybe you'll agree with the
critics that this
artist is "merely" an illustrator.
Whichever path you
choose, go with your gut when you look at
Rockwell's art.
Forget about the shoulds and shouldn'ts.
See whether
you feel happier, wiser, or emotionally uplifted by it. Does it make you
smile or feel sad? Ask yourself why you like or dislike
it, whether you
consider Rockwell a creative talent or merely a skilled craftsman. Is his
work the result of inspiration or instruction? See if he changes the way
you view the world or causes you to ask questions you hadn't thought
of before. And remember: While Rockwell is a great springboard for
the debate on art vs. craft, the secret behind his longevity is that his
paintings are emotionally honest and radiate the kind of love and con-
nectedness among people that we all long for.

Sound Byte:
"We have a new-born Rockwell who can no longer be looked at with
sneering condescension and might well become an indispensable part ofart
history.
—ROBERT ROSENBLUM, art historian,
Artforum/Bookforum, Summer 1998
In the final years of his life, Rockwell seemed to have slipped quietly
out of the "liberated" lives of Americans. The Vietnam War shattered
America's national confidence and Woodstock tossed old values into
the mud. Although Rockwell was then painting
socially conscious
themes with sublime sensitivity, his career and his art were more or less
dismissed for the last 15 years of his life.
But he is back and you'll soon see why. There is much to love here and,
significantly, a lot more than meets the eye. For starters, Rockwell is:
A superb draftsman and a consummately skilled painter
An
artist with
a flawless sense of composition and
color, whose
designs
use
the
allotted
spaces with

The Great Plains Hit the Jack Pot
By JOHN BIRD
Should Husbands Be Baby-Sitters?

The next time a Rockwell painting comes up for auction at Sotheby's
or Christie's, watch what happens when the bidding starts. The very
critics who poo-poo Rockwell will gasp at the prices.
Not a Picturesque Family
And so the story begins:
Norman Rockwell comes into the world on
February 3, 1894 in a back bedroom of a brownstone on 103rd Street
near Amsterdam Avenue
in New York City. The Upper West Side
neighborhood at this time
is on the northern fringe of respectability,
but
it's what the Rockwells can afford.
His family
is not exactly the
image of the family he will later portray in his paintings. Norman's
father, Jarvis Waring Rockwell (known as Waring, or Potty),
is the
office manager of a textile firm where he started his career as an office
boy. The handsome Waring has fussy habits and an aura of gentility,
apparently
passed down
from
his
upper-middle-class
family
of
successful New York City coal dealers and rug manufacturers. This
upbringing also seems to have contributed to an aloofness that keeps
his two boys at arm's length.
Norman's mother, Nancy "Baba" Hill,
is one of 12 children from a
family that came to America shortly after the Civil War. Her father, a
mediocre
artist, was
a
hard-drinking, down-on-his-luck painter of
pet portraits and of sentimental over-the-sofa paintings (called "pot-
boilers").
For these paintings, he
relied on
his children to
assist in

OPPOSITE
painting the water, trees, moon, and stars. In this quaint little assembly
line, Hill would paint the central subject and pass the canvas on to the
kids, who would each paint a portion of it. According to Rockwell,
Grandfather Hill "painted in great detail—every hair on the dog was
Easter Morning
...
,
1959
carefully drawn, the tiny highlights in the pig's eyes could be clearly seen."
Little
is known about Baba beyond the
fact that she and Potty are
religious, that she often retreats for long periods of time to her dark-
ened bedroom with wet cloths on her forehead, and that she takes
great pride
in her English
ancestry. She discourages Norman from
following in his grandfather's footsteps, lest they lead him to failure
and
alcoholism.
Baba's
melange of mysterious
illnesses
stunt
the
Rockwells' family life. There
is evidence that she suffers from clinical
depression, and, if true, this might explain the "disappearances" that
force the whole family to live in boarding houses in New York City and
Westchester County for extended periods of time, due to her inability
to care for the family.
FYI:
Religion—The Rockwells were a religious family and the boys were
sent to sing
in church choirs.
Normally choirboys were paid a small fee,
but the ever-pleasant Mrs. Rockwell wouldn't hear of
it.
Later, Rockwell's
work referred to the Bible and was often associated with a "good Christian"
ethic; but as an adult, he did not go to church.
It did not interest him, as
we can see from the expression on the father's face in Easter Morning.

The Worst of Times is the Best to Draw
Since the Rockwells own two phonograph records by the great tenor
Enrico Caruso, they acquire a reputation in the neighborhood as being
"cultured folk." Waring sketches—actually, he copies—paintings and
drawings from magazines of the day Most evenings, after the dishes
are cleared from the dining-room table, he reads to Norman and his
older brother, Jarvis, from the picturesque novels of Charles Dickens
(1812-1870). Norman
sketches
the
Dickensian
characters
as
he
imagines
them,
and
later
recalls
having
intense
feelings
for
"the
variety, sadness, horror, happiness, treachery, and twists and turns of
life: the sharp impressions of dirt, food, inns, horses, streets." It is often
pointed out that Rockwell paints with
oils the way Dickens paints
with words. Dickens implanted in the
artist a desire to record every
number on a watch dial, every pore in a nose, and every dot in a polka-
dot blouse.

FYI: Family notoriety—Rockwell's full name, Norman Percevel Rockwell,
was the choice of his Anglophile mother. (Jarvis was named after his father.)
Baba claimed unbroken descent from one Norman Percevel, who
is said
to have kicked revolutionist Guy Fawkes down the stairs of the Tower of
London
in 1605 while Fawkes was jailed for plotting to blow up the Houses
of Parliament. "Remember, Norman Percevel," the artist later recalled
his mother exhorting,
"it's spelled with an e;
/ and a are common."

City vs. Country
Norman spends
his
first nine rears
in New York Citv, loathing the
grimy streets and dingy buildings and trash-strewn vacant lots of his
neighborhood. When we think of Rockwell and vouth,
it's usually
Boy Scouts that come to mind.
Yet he did not have the picturesque
boyhood he
so poignantly describes
later in
his work.
The young
Rockwell was pigeon-toed, wore corrective shoes, had narrow shoulders
and a trail, skinny neck, and today wouldVe been considered a ch
nerd.

the streetscape evolves into a profound distaste for life in large cities.
You can take the boy out of the city and you can take the city out of
the boy Looking at Rockwell's down-home subject matter, it's almost
incomprehensible that he lived in large cities for most of his childhood
and
a good part of his adulthood. What accounts
for his exquisite
affinity for country kids and small-town families seems to be the string
of happy summers boarding with farm families in upstate New York,
fueled by a rich imagination for idealizing life as it might be.
Sound Byte:
"I guess I have a bad case ofthe American nostalgiafor the clean, simple
country life as opposed to the complicated world ofa city....I would not
have dwelt so long upon these summers I spent in the country as a child,
except that I think they had a lot to do with what Ipainted later on....
The view oflife I communicate in my pictures excludes the
sordid and ugly. Ipaint life as I would like it to be.
"
—Norman Rockwell
Besides soaking up the smells of hay and grass and sun-roasted barn
siding, the best parts of Rockwell's personality emerge when he gets to
the country. He loves the open and expressive faces of country people,
faces
that
"fit better into my kind of picture than
city people ['s]."
At the end of the summers, he comes back to the
city with frogs

and turtles he's caught—and when, inevitably, a couple of
months later he finds them floating dead in the fishbowl,
he grieves for the death of that summer.
At age 9, to Norman's great pleasure, the family moves to
the town of Mamaroneck, in Westchester County, north
of Manhattan. Suddenly the crowded
streets and dark
alleys of the big city are replaced by green grass and trees.
These opened-up vistas will be the backdrops in his early
paintings of young boys' lives.
A Nerd before
it was Fashionable
Norman is the typical second son who grows up watching
his older brother become the best athlete in school. While
Jarvis
is a "boy's boy," Norman sees himself a "a lump, a
long skinny nothing, a bean pole without the beans." The
word lump may refer to the prominent Adam's apple in his
skinny neck. He sings in church choirs— St. Luke's and
then the Cathedral of St. John the Divine—and lives in
dread of being called Percy. On the street, he pulls a sleeve
down over one hand to garner sympathy or he feigns a limp
so that people will feel sorry for him.
But while Jarvis can win any sports tournament he enters,
Norman can draw on command and does so, much to the
The Holdout, 1959

joy of his peers, who shout out different subjects at will.
In 1908, at
14, Rockwell decides to become an illustrator.
He makes the two-
hour trolley and subway trip to New York City twice a week to take
classes
at the [William Merritt] Chase School of Fine and Applied
Art. A year later, as a high school sophomore, he drops out at mid-
year and enrolls at the National Academy School, where he engages
in copying plaster casts. The fact that the school
is free comes as an
enticement to the impoverished art student, whose menial teenage odd
jobs do not yield enough to pay for tuition anywhere.
After a strenuous program of drawing from plaster casts eight hours a
day, six days a week, he switches to the Art Students League ofNew
York, co-founded by Norman's hero, the great American book illus-
trator Howard Pyle (1853-1911), known
for
his
lush,
historically
accurate portraits of damsels and pirates. There, Rockwell's destiny is
sealed: He
is now convinced
that he made
the
correct
choice
in
becoming an illustrator.
Happy
at
last, Norman
studies anatomy with Charles Bridgeman
(1864-1943) and
illustration with Thomas Fogarty (1873-1938),
who imparts his vision that illustrators must capture "an author's words
in paint." (Fogarty encourages Rockwell to "step over the frame, Norman,
over the frame and live in the picture.") He teaches devotion to detail
and
authentic rendering of detail.
If a
story describes
a character
riding the train to Poughkeepsie, Fogarty insists that the illustrator

actually ride the train and paint a view from the train window exactly
as
it is exists.
By the time Rockwell leaves the League, he understands that his job
as an illustrator
is to convey as much information as possible and to
highlight the nuances that will either draw a reader further into a story
or will itself become a complete tale. Instinctively, he feels an allegiance
to the "consumer" of his work, the reader of the book or magazine.
The Hot Illustrators: Pyle and Gibson
The Art Students League, still on West 57th Street in New York City,
is acknowledged to have been a true pioneer in training illustrators. As
early
as
the
1880s,
the school recognized
the
career opportunities
presented by the strong growth of illustrated weeklies and monthlies
and by the advertising revenues that fueled these publications. Howard
Pyle's
skills
and
his
fire-the-imagination
style
of childrens' book
illustration—especially of stories rich in history or legend—did as much
as anything to advance the reputation of illustrators.
The
other
popular
League-trained
illustrator
was
the
well-born
Charles Dana Gibson (1867-1944),
a master of black-and-white
drawing best known for his Gibson Girls. The GGs were archetypal
Anglo-Saxon exemplars of American womanhood: confident,
flirta-
tious, elegant, and beautiful. They often appeared bare-shouldered and
wearing wide black velvet choker bands around their womanly necks.

Gibson eventually abandoned his frustrated aspiration to be regarded
as a fine artist and instead worked toward raising the artistic reputation
of illustrators, including his own, of course.
FYI: Rockwell's part-time jobs—Like most impoverished students, Rockwell
found odd jobs to keep himself afloat. Among others, he appeared as an
extra
in productions at the Metropolitan Opera; he carried the paints of
actress Ethel Barrymore, an amateur painter; and he worked a mail route.
Pyle, the "historian with a brush," is the artist Rockwell studies most
and idolizes as a student.
But he also admires the work of illustrator
J. C. (Joe) Leyendecker (1874-1951), painter and sculptor Frederic
Remington (1861-1909), American ex-patriot artists James Abbott
McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), John Singer Sargent (1856-1925),
the
English-born Arthur Rackham
(1867-1939), and
the many
Flemish and Dutch painters of the 15th through mid- 17th century
whose acute attention to the smallest detail never overrode their sense
of composition.
The precocious Rockwell comes on the scene when Pyle
is near the
end of his life and Gibson is at the peak of his popularity. By the time
Rockwell
is fully launched in the early 1920s, the mass-market pub-
lishers and advertisers hold the power to make or break the careers of
individual artist-illustrators.

THE HEYDAY OF AMERICAN ILLUSTRATION
The Golden Age of American
Illustration began
in the 1880s and ended about 1930. Before
1900,
illustrators thought of themselves as peers of autonomous fine
artists. The question of
who paid—patronage—had not been forced by fine-art
loyalists.
But around the turn of the
century, illustrators began to lose stature. What caused the change? The money, of course! The
explosive growth of mass-market publishing, especially of weekly and monthly magazines, and
of space advertising in those magazines created a huge need for accessible art that helped sell
magazines by illustrating stories and by tempting the fast-growing consumer class to buy what-
ever was pictured
in the advertisements. Then,
as now, ad revenues supported magazines.
Magazines paid their best illustrators very well, and the common perception was that illustrators
had struck a Faustian bargain: They traded
in their integrity and independence in exchange for
fees paid by greedy commercial businesses. To illustrate for advertisers was to invite scorn from
noncommercial
artists. By the end of World War
I, most
illustrators recognized that their art
would never achieve the status of fine art, though many of them—including Rockwell—longed
to be taken seriously and suffered a sort of jilted-lover syndrome.
ILLUSTRATION AND ADVERTISING
The rise of mass-market illustrated print media—and most especially of general-interest maga-
zines targeted at women readers—can be attributed to the growth of an educated middle class
in the late 19th century.
In the first ten years of Rockwell's
life, such magazines as The Saturday
Evening Post, Collier's, Ladies' Home Journal, Life, and Cosmopolitan appeared and developed
loyal audiences.
Advertising agencies had come into being
in the 1860s, although newspaper
and poster advertising can be traced back to the beginning of the 19th century. But
it wasn't
until the late 1870s that ad agencies did much more than act as brokers between advertiser and
publisher. As the national economy shifted from a primary base (producing what was needed to
feed, shelter, and clothe Americans) to one based on consumerism, magazine publishing and the
advertising industry became interdependent: Advertising revenues supported the publishers,
and
publishers
offered
a
perfect
vehicle
to
promote
consumption.
Through
advertising,
consumerism was "sold" to those who had the means and the time to participate. The entwined
fortunes of advertising and publishing persist to this day, but now photography
is the illustration
of choice and print
is only one of several powerful media for advertising.

BACKTRACK:
YOUTH CULTURE
Between the turn of the
century and about 1915,
America discovered
Childhood and Youth. The
Victorian middle-class legacy
of "children should be seen
and not heard" gave way to
the belief that children and
teenagers did indeed have
something to say and were
worth adult investment in
their futures as good citizens
and responsible, self-sufficient
consumers. Boy's Life,
American Boy, Youth's
Companion, and
St. Nicholas
magazines concentrated on
boys and young men.
Groups such as Girl Guides
in England, Boy Scouts
of America, Girl Scouts
of America, and National
4-H Club came into
being between 1910
and 1925, reinforcing a
national commitment to
young people.
Youth Culture, an American First
Thomas Fogarty, aware of Rockwell's need for funds,
helps get him his first paid professionaljob in late 1910,
illustrating a Christmas booklet. (Rockwell, an Episco-
palian, pretends he
is Roman Catholic to obtain the
job.)
The Rockwell family moves back to New York
City in 1912, and before long, the artist receives $150
to make 10-12 drawings for a book for children, Tell-
Me-Why Stories about Mother Nature. Believing himself
to be on a
roll, Rockwell and another student rent a
"studio" in the
attic of a brownstone on Manhattan's
Upper West Side. His first surviving oil painting dates
from this year. What the teenagers fail to notice is that
the lower floors
are
a whorehouse. When Norman's
father points this out, the guys move back home.
His gig at Tell-My- Why Stories gets Rockwell noticed
by the editor of Boy's Life magazine, who quickly makes
him, at age 19, its art director.
It's an exciting time in
New York:
Grand Central Terminal opens the same
year (1913) and the New York art world is host to the
now-famous Armory Show,
the
first
exhibition
in
America of modern European and American art. In three
American
cities, the show draws more than 300,000

paying viewers who are anxious to see for themselves what the big fuss
concerning Modern art is all about. These viewers, accustomed to the
traditional, representational works of artists such as Norman Rockwell
with instantly recognizable human subjects and dramatic narrative
are astounded by the radical new and perplexing forms of art. Over-
night, the New York art world
is wrenched from
its artistic traditions
and flung into Modernism. (The roots of critical disdain for Rockwell
can be traced to this atmosphere of "Let's throw old-fashioned art out the
window andfind something new. ")
The Urge to Succeed
While serving as art director of Boy's Life, Rockwell continues to con-
tribute to such publications as St. Nicholas, Everyland, Youths Companion,
American Boy, and the Handbook ofCamping. In 1915, his family moves
to New Rochelle, home to many celebrated illustrators, including J. C.
Leyendecker and Charles Dana Gibson. To save money and time from
the commute, Rockwell and
his new
friend,
celebrated
cartoonist
Clyde Forsythe,
rent
a studio that had once belonged to Frederic
Remington. Here, in
this
frigid, corrugated-metal icebox, Rockwell
struggles with
his wavering self-confidence, determined
to make
a
name for himself as an illustrator of publications for adults. (Ironically,
he
will always
paint
kids, because he
loves
to paint
kids.) As
an
inspiration to himself, he paints the number "100%" in gold leaf on the
top crossbar of his easel and devises a rating system for his paintings:
35


"Excellent" is the top score and "bad" is the bottom. He then implores
Forsythe—who is a few years older and less intimated by the whirl of
the commercial world—to make a brutally honest appraisal of each of
his paintings and drawings.
In return, Rockwell howls with laughter
opposite
as he reviews Forsythe's comic strips.
Ties, 1954
I Want
it all. ..and
I want
it Now!
Rockwell's art directorship at Boys Life magazine, while still a teenager
himself, is significant. He is chronologically part of the Youth Culture,
though
he
positions
himself
as
a
spectator-cum-illustrator. While
other illustrators may have been happy with an art directorship at such
an early age, Rockwell tires of it quickly. He knows that churning out
black-and-white illustrations for kids' publications
is a dead end.
Hitting the Big Time
Adjusting
his
sights upward, he
targets The Saturday Evening Post,
edited by George Horace Lorimer
(1868-1937),
"the
great Mr.
Lorimer," whom Rockwell reveres and fears. Forsythe encourages and
goads Rockwell to prepare some sketches to show Mr. Lorimer and
the Posts art director, Walter H. Dower. Norman buys a new gray
herringbone suit and a black hat for his March 1916 trip to the Curtis
Publishing Company headquarters
in
Philadelphia. The
sight of a
behatted, bespectacled beanpole with a huge wooden box (not a baby

buggy this time) is enough to get him an audience with Dower. By the
time Rockwell leaves his interview, the Post has purchased two covers
and commissioned three more.
Marriage #1
On his way back to New Rochelle, emboldened by a check for $150 in
his pocket, he travels to Atlantic City, where he promptly calls "the
cutest girl" he has ever dated, Irene O'Connor, and asks for her hand
in marriage. The schoolteacher accepts. He later calls to ask that she
wire him some money: In all his excitement, he has spent his bankroll.
(Of Rockwell's three marriages, this one will be the
least
fulfilling.
The half-hearted union will last 14 years and will find the couple living
separately on more than one occasion before they finally divorce.)
Sneering Bullies
Rockwell's first Post cover appears on May 20, 1916. (The last one will
run on December 14, 1963 and will be Rockwell's 232nd cover for the
magazine.) Entitled Boy Pushing a Baby Carriage (see page 25)
sometimes called Salutation—it shows two "boy's boys" taunting a third
one who pushes a wicker peramulator, dressed in a suit and wearing
gloves and a bowler hat that is secured to his jacket with a lapel-button
bar pin. (One of Rockwell's
all-time
favorite models,
a boy named
Billy Paine, posed for all three characters.) The boy's face is the picture

of pain and humiliation. We feel sorry for him, because his baseball-
playing tormenters mock him for being dressed up and pushing a carriage.
Rockwell helps us reach back to remember the bullies in our childhood
and how it felt to be taunted for doing something that seemed like the
right thing to do.
Notice Rockwell's attention to details:
the baby's
foot, a bottle sloshing with milk, a missing tooth in one of the taunters,
and a flower in the well-dressed boy's buttonhole.
FYI:
Rockwell's titles—Rockwell's paintings are often known by more
than one title. This
is because Rockwell often used descriptive language to
"name" his paintings—as in Girl at the Mirror or The Art Critic—rather than
give them precise titles. The painting on the jacket of this book, for example,
is often called Going and Coming (Rockwell's son Tom uses this title), while
the official title for
it at the Norman Rockwell Museum
in Stockbridge,
Massachusetts,
is The Outing. Often Rockwell's editors named his paintings.
Rockwell's first Post cover runs at the same time as President Woodrow
Wilson announces his support for women's suffrage. In the same year,
feminist Margaret Sanger is jailed for opening a birth control clinic in
Brooklyn,
and
the
French
painter,
Claude Monet
(1840-1926),
begins his great Impressionist mural cycle of Waterlilies (Nympheas).

young love rounding out
his
repertoire. Until Rockwell
paints
the
Posh first color cover in 1926, his covers are always two colors (black
and red). These early covers have great consistency:
People are isolated against a simple backdrop or setting.
Rarely do more than three characters occupy a composition.
There
is no "depth of field." Characters seem to float in a shallow
box or on the painting's surface.
A theme
is always being acted out: an insult, a crush, naughtiness,
the day's work, or a Rockwell favorite, gossip.
The upper section of a circle often frames the top of the picture,
along with two thick horizontal black rules (lines). The use of the
half circle profiles the
figures
in the
illustration and accentuates
the drama
taking
place.
It was
also commonly
seen
in
news-
paper photography
in those
days. You can
see these techniques
in Ouija Board.

"My methodical working habits used to bother me....I never missed a meal.
I used to think Ipainted with my stomach instead ofmy soul and brain.
I've always kept regular hours, eaten three meals a day. It used to worry
me something terrible.
—Norman Rockwell
Have Idea, Will Paint
A successful artist, illustrator or otherwise, must come up with a lot of
ideas, and the best of them will include come elements common to
human experience. Rockwell knows that everyone worries about their
own problems and that his Post covers can— indeed, must—unite people
in their concerns and interests. His specialty is to encourage people from
various backgrounds to recognize pieces of their own lives in each scenario
he creates. Humor is crucial, since it relaxes people even when the subject
is serious. But underneath the gag there has to be some pathos, something
that readers identify with. Rockwell realizes that a joke about a sad subject
keeps us looking longer. In a way, he practices a static version of the
television sitcom, where a laugh keeps a dour situation from taking over.
The Far-from-Great War
A year after his Rockwell's
first Post cover appears, the U.S. enters

World War
I
(1914-18),
fought
mainly
in
Europe
between the Central Powers and the Allies. As horrific
as
it
is, war becomes for Rockwell his broadest, if not
most challenging, subject. Everyone
is affected by the
Great War, and yet there
is a daily cornucopia of new
themes to be found in newspapers and newsreels.
In
1917,
he
reads
about
the
French
cheering
the
American doughboys, so he does the scene as a cover.
For
authenticity,
he
relies
on
the
photojournalists'
images,
filtering and rearranging
details
to come up
with an accurate, if not actual, vision—and tempering it
with his own gentle sympathies.
To
get
his
paintings
to
press
before
illustrators
for
competing magazines turn in
theirs, Rockwell some-
times works twenty hours
straight
(except
for those
three
meals).
Not
withstanding
his
interest
in
war-related
covers,
Rockwell
continues
to
produce
more light-hearted
fare, such
as Two Men Courting
Gir/'s Favor (see page 44), that remind nervous readers
of life's simpler joys.
BACKTRACK:
AMERICAN GENRE
PAINTERS
Rockwell
is one of a line of
artists called American Genre
painters who chronicled
ordinary American
life (read:
ordinary American people)
with affection, occasional
nostalgia, and not a
little
romanticism. Winslow Homer
(1836-1910) was but one of
the painters who preceded
Rockwell. American artists
admired engravings of the
detail-driven work of such
English painters as David
Wilkie (1785-1841), whose
influence
is apparent in the
work of German genre painter
Wilhelm Leibl (1844-1900)
and the French artist Alphonse
Le Gros (1838-191 1). The
Genre tradition forms a
clan within the larger tribe
of Realist painters of the late
19th and 20th century whose
other clans include Realism
and American Scene Painting,
an umbrella term sheltering
Regionalism and Social Realism.

Guilt Sets In
In spite of his war-painting binges, he begins to doubt
the
size
of his
patriotic
contribution. This prompts
Rockwell
to
volunteer
for
the
U.S.
Navy.
His
first
attempt
is unsuccessful, since he
is seventeen pounds
underweight. So he packs himself with doughnuts and
gains enough weight
to pass the physical exam. His
tour of duty in Charleston, South Carolina is less than
arduous and not very long (1917-18). During this time,
he paints insignia on airplanes and otherwise maintains
the appearance of the fleet. (Many of his fellow seamen
are amused to find that the gawky ship-hull decorator
is a celebrated Post artist.)
Two days a week, he works for Afloat and Ashore,
his
camp's
newspaper,
and
creates
advertisements
for
Perfection oil heaters, Fiske bicycle tires, Overland cars,
Jell-O, and Orange Crush. The Navy allows Rockwell
to do his own work as long as
it bears some relation to
naval
life, such
as
his Post cover of a
sailor showing
another sailor a picture of his girl, and a cover for Life
magazine of a group of smiling (of course)
soldiers,
sailors, and marines.
BACKTRACK:
AMERICAN SCENE PAINTING
Wouldn't you expect to find
Norman Rockwell
in a move-
ment called American
Scene Painting? Yet he
is not
included, for two reasons. He
was an artist firmly settled
in
the American Genre tradition,
(see Backtrack on p. 43),
and his subjects were neither
specifically Regionalist
(think Grant Wood's American
Gothic) nor Social Realist
(summon to mind the down-
trodden populations of
Ben Shahn's paintings and
illustrations). American Scene
was a quasi-isolationist
response to the French mod-
ernism that was taunting the
American art scene
in the
1920s.
It had already gotten
its name by 1924 and the
tradition continued into the
1940s with a robust America
First that included paintings
as elegant and site-specific as
Edward Hopper's Nighthawks
of 1942. With the onset
of World War
II, every-
thing changed.

Norman Rockwell
c. 1919
Men with Men
Rockwell's stint in the Navy actually proves to be a wonderful time for
opposite
him. He holds his own in the midst of a masculine world, despite his
usual feelings of inadequacy and unmanliness. Swearing, brawling, and
bar-hopping offer the artist a first-hand look at rituals of male bond-
ing, which had fascinated him from early on, but always from the
distance of an observer.
(Think of the "brotherhood of young boys"
images.) A few days before the Armistice
is signed on November 11,
1918, Rockwell receives
a discharge. He
returns home
to Irene
in
New Rochelle and resumes work with his regular clients: Colliers, Life,
Leslies Judge,
Country
Gentleman,
Literary
Digest,
Peoples
Popular
Monthly, Farm and Fireside, and Popular Science. His painting for the
Post Christmas issue inaugurates a tradition of Christmas covers that
will continue for many years.
Ahhhh...Money and Fame
Rockwell's images
immediately
strike
a chord with
the American
people and before long he begins to enjoy the rewards of money and
public recognition. Bolstered by new resources, he can now afford to
live in more affluent circumstances, surrounded by celebrated illustrator
colleagues. He indulges in tennis, golf, and bridge, and buys snazzy
sports
clothes. Prohibition
raises
its
head,
and,
like any connected
socialite, Rockwell finds himself a bootlegger and parties into the next
48


decade. (Later, he will write contritely that the behavior of adults
at
that time threatened
the
stability of the
children he
painted, who
would often complain of their parents' frivolity.)
Feeding the Gods
New Rochelle had become
a bedroom community for a number of
America's most
successful
illustrators. Howard Pyle had once
lived
there.
J. C. Leyendecker and his brother Frank, the reigning illustrators
in advertising and creators of the Arrow Shirt Man, as shown on page
33, share a fancy place in New Rochelle.
(J. C. Leyendecker was gay
and it is alleged that the model for the Arrow Shirt Man ads was his
lover.)
J. C. and Rockwell become the celebs of the Post in an era when
the magazine is giddy with success for offering "a portrait of American
success,
lavish,
powerful, abundant"
(according
to
Post biographer,
Jan Cohn).
After years of driving past the Leyendecker mansion, the Rockwells
summon the courage to invite the brothers over to dinner. Anxious to
impress, Norman and Irene hire
a chef. They figure everyone loves
turkey, and even though
it's
July, they plan
a Thanksgiving
feast.
Tragedy strikes when the chef drops the turkey in the dining room, but
instead of creating a catastrophe, the hilarity of it paves the way to a
wonderful 25-year relationship between Rockwell and the Leyendecker
brothers. In between exclaiming how much he loves turkey, J. C. adds
50

that
"a turkey—browned
to
a turn and steaming—is
one of the hardest things to paint. That quality of crisp-
ness and juiciness rolled into one is almost impossible to
render on a canvas."
Rockwell eventually takes up the
turkey-painting challenge to perfection in his Freedom
from Want (see pages 11 and 80).
The Camera
Though Rockwell paints from
live models, he breaks
the
traditional
"no-photo"
law
while
painting
an
American Magazine cover
in May 1921. The
reason?
He is required to paint a little boy yawning, which sounds
like a simple act—except the little boy has to hold his
yawn for more than 30 seconds. The magazine runs a
small story inside telling how Rockwell himself poses
for the yawn photograph, since he
is unable to get his
young model to stay alertly posed once the boy is tired.
This
is the
first known use of a camera in Rockwell's
work and he will grow to enjoy the freedom
it gives
him,
as well
as
its usefulness
in recording landscapes
and backgrounds for his illustrations. The camera also
enables him
to
capture
the
expressions he wants by
posing himself with exaggerated expressions for snap-
shots that he will then later show to his models.

Restless Traveler
Given his peaceful temperament, his fierce love of work, and his dyed-
in-the-wool Americanness, it's surprising that Rockwell makes periodic
escapes to foreign locales, usually when he feels his work and life are
getting stale—or when he feels down on himself, which is often. The
first trip abroad
is to South America in 1922, at the invitation of an
advertising client, Edison Mazda. The next year, anxious to flee his
less-than-happy
marriage
and
stale-studio
syndrome,
he
sails
for
France without Irene and spends weeks traveling in France and Italy
with an old friend from the League and his new wife. Modernity is all
around him, as is some of the best art from Western culture. Rockwell
feels pulled in three directions: He wants to catch up with other artists
and be modern; he derives great pleasure from studying works of the
Old
Masters;
yet
he
feels most comfortable with
realism
and
American subject matter.

Oarsman, 1921
Sex and More Sex
Just before leaving Paris for the United States, Rockwell enrolls in an
art school, the Academie Calorossi, where J. C. Leyendecker had been
a
star pupil. A fellow
illustrator, Cole Phillips (1880-1927), who
prides himself on his rare ability to paint pretty girls, bluntly insults
Rockwell with, "Old men and boys. Haven't you got any guts?
You're
young.
Haven't you got any sex?
For Lord's
sake!" But Rockwell

steadfastly wishes to paint only what he excells
at.
So
what if he is less gifted than Phillips or Gibson at paint-
ing pretty girls?
Sidestepping the Modern
This
is
a crucial moment for him, since
his
art
is
at
a
crossroads
and
he
is
staring down
the maw
of
Modernism. After eavesdropping on some "bohemian
[looking] Americans," he picks up the tip that color is
important: A new approach
to
color, he
thinks, will
make him more contemporary.
But back
at
the
Post,
Mr. Lorimer
rejects
the
first
"modern" cover Rockwell shows him. This
is
a signal
to
Rockwell
that
he
should
stay
the
course
of his
immensely popular
illustrations.
It
is only
in periods
of crisis and self-doubt that he tends to wander.

THE SATURDAY
EVENING POST
Hobo and Dog
1924
With so much early success in life, Rockwell spends the
next
fifty years worrying that he might no longer be
able to come up with the goods. (The eminent psycho-
analyst, Erik Erikson, whom Rockwell later consults,
explains that "artists like Rockwell, who are very serious
and intense about their work, often tend to be greatly
worried by the fact that they can't ever be sure of what
they are doing.")
A Hot Property
Other magazines want what Rockwell has and they
make seductive offers. In 1924, Liberty magazine offers
him work at double his Post income, which creates a
crisis
for
Rockwell. He
presents
his
quandary
to
Lorimer and
is asked what he'd rather do. Rockwell
responds, "I'll stay with you, Mr. Lorimer," whereupon
Lorimer immediately doubles his salary.
FYI: Norman Rockwell was fond of his name. And as his popularity
increased, so did his signature.
It grew from Norman Rockwell to NORMAN
ROCKWELL. "Make
it as large as you like," said Lorimer, "but not larger
than the title of the magazine."
Sometimes his signature appears in
handwritten script; at other times,
it looks like a corporate logo that has
been stamped onto the canvas.

Good Scout
The
Post may have made Rockwell
a
star, but
the Boy Scouts of
America, founded when Norman was 16 years old, are his passion. His
chance to be a good Scout comes in 1924, when he creates his first Boy
Scout calendar. From 1924 to 1974, in all but two years, he will paint
calendars
for the organization.
At
this
stage
in Rockwell's
career,
calendar art
is big business, since
it's an easy way for companies to
advertise their image. But after World War II, their popularity wanes
as the public's fondness for photography replaces "the quaintness of
drawings."
Boys, not Girls
Rockwell's predilection for painting boys instead of girls lasts a long
time. Perhaps
it's an opportunity to enact the
carefree boyhood he
longed for and never had. But he
is aware that this preference places
him in a delicate situation: "For days I'd hang about the grade schools
at recess, peer over the fences into backyards, haunt the vacant lots, and
stop little boys on the street, turning them around and sideways to see
if they were the type I wanted." Today, of course, this kind of behav-
ior might raise an eyebrow; but then, only girl models required a chap-
erone, and Rockwell's reputation for clean American fun was so spic
and span that even girls could pose on their own. His favorite subjects,
in descending order, are boys, old people, girls, and teenagers.

Posing His Models
Rockwell uses children and animals with and without the benefit of a
camera or a photographer to take the pictures for him. Through trial
and error, he evolves a few tricks for "posing" his models:
A chicken: Pick it up, rock it back and forth a few times. When you
put it down, it will stand still for five minutes.
A duck: You position the duck just where you want it and then you
nail it to the floor. As a farmer once told a squeamish Rockwell (the
city boy): "You could pound a railroad spike in the web of his foot
and he wouldn't blink an eye."
A child: Since you are not allowed to spin children around or nail
them to the floor, you can pay them 50 cents an hour. For boys who
are less eager and less patient than girls, Rockwell suggests making
a
pile of nickels, then moving one onto the boy's
pile every 10
minutes to show how his pay is adding up.
A dog: Get an old one.
Reality check:
Flush with success, Rockwell
is 33 years old and
is a
member of The Larchmont Yacht Club and The Bonnie Briar Country
Club.
The undisputed King of Covers, he builds himself a $23,000
studio and lives the suburban highlife. And yet he is unhappy.

FYI:
Rockwell's depression—The word depression
is not part of
Rockwell's painting vocabulary, though he
is from time to time afflicted
with the malady himself. To look at his work, one would hardly know that
the artist
is melancholy, or that an economic depression
is sweeping
through America, or that Hitler has set up concentration camps in Europe,
or that soldiers and civilians have lost limbs.
Rockwell doesn't paint the
rural poor.
If a boy has no shoes
in a Rockwell painting,
it simply means
that he has time to run free
in the fields.
Rockwell's critics have a heyday
with this apparent one-sided representation of life, but for the artist
it
reflects his wishful thinking for a better life and a desire to give people
what perhaps they have never experienced—a sense of peace.
Bye, Bye, Mrs. American Pie
Between 1927 and 1929, a lonely Rockwell makes two solo escapes to
Europe, staying at some of the continent's grander hotels. Back home,
the stock market has crashed and the socially perky Irene Rockwell,
rarely interested in her husband's work, has fallen in love with some-
one
else. After 14 years of marriage, the promoter of family
life
is
divorced from his wife in 1930.
Miserable, he moves to the fittingly named apartment building, Hotel
des Artistes, on 67th Street off Central Park West, in New York City.
D% BitingMan

He is a bachelor once again and unhappy. In an effort to get away from
1928
it all, he travels to Los Angeles and meets up with his old friend Clyde
59

Forsythe.
Rockwell hangs out with the Hollywood crowd and paints
a number of celebrities, including the actor Gary Cooper, who is being
made up that day on the set of a Western.
Marriage #2
While the Southern California sun and fun draw Rockwell out of his
funk, it is a date with Mary Barstow, a schoolteacher he will marry in
April 1930, that makes the trip a success. He and Mary will remain
devoted partners until her sudden death in 1959.
FYI:
After their marriage, Rockwell paints Mary with
in a wistful pose
for a Post cover (on p. 61) that depicts a husband and wife at breakfast.
Mary soon receives a letter from a friend, offering condolences. From the
picture, she had assumed that Mary
is
in a terribly unhappy marriage!
The happily remarried Rockwell finds the early 1930s not as easy as
the 1920s had been. He himself points to one work, a Post cover from
January 18, 1930, where he had actually painted three legs on a boy—
sign that he was in the middle of an emotional and artistic breakdown.
Back to Paris
By 1932, he is yet again in the midst of a harsh funk and sets out once
more to Paris in search of inspiration, this time with Mary and his

newborn son, Jerry (Jarvis), at his side. He has heard about the artistic
innovations that have come from the studios of Braque and Picasso
over the past 20 years. He sees good works by the Futurists, Expres-
sionists, and Surrealists, and
is amazed by the whirling vortex of pos-
sibilities. For a wildly successful artist, Rockwell remains disheartened
that he cannot be counted among the avant-garde. He tries "modern"
paintings, but everything he submits to his loyal publishers is rejected.
Sound Byte:
"My best efforts were some modern things that looked like very lousy Matisses.
Thank God I had the sense to realize they were lousy and leave Paris.
—Norman Rockwell, to Rufus Jarmen of
The New Yorker
After seven unfruitful months of experimentation, Rockwell takes his
family home. The frantic pace of coming up with complex covers for
the Post weighs heavily on him, so Rockwell decides to look for illus-
trating work other than Boy Scout calendars and magazine covers. His
second child, Tom Rockwell,
is born in 1933.
Tom and Huck
The sun shines in 1935, when he begins his extraordinary illustrations
for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He goes to Hannibal, Missouri,
63

certain that no previous Tom and Huck illustrators have ventured there,
and tours the actual sites that inspired Mark Twain, sucking up details.
He even goes so far as to buy old clothes from some of Hannibal's
residents. (In the same year, he does a cover of a mother introducing her
son to his teacher. But he inadvertently dresses his characters in cloth-
ing from the 1870s. This picture gets the dander up of a lot of school-
teachers who feel Rockwell has portrayed them as dowdy old pusses.)
Sound Byte:
"I've made it a rule never tofake anything, always to use, ifpossible,
authentic props and costumes. Ifeel that no matter what the quality
ofmy work

Art for the Walls
Rockwell's passion for authentic costuming hits an all-time high in
1937 when he commissions a tailor to make a set of military uniforms.
The painting he wants them for—actually a mural—is Yankee Doodle
for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey.
Rockwell's one and only
mural is not for a public building. He does not need the money. In fact,
his fortunes are little affected by the Great Depression. He accepts the
Inn's commission and paints his Yankee Doodle theme animated by (you
guessed
it) detail and lively interaction of the characters. The mural's

BACKTRACK:
MURALS IN AMERICA
Murals had been for centuries
a standard part of interior
decoration, especially in
public places.
Ironically,
murals and posters resurged
as favored media
in the
mid-1 930s because of the
Great Depression. As part
of his New Deal, President
Roosevelt created a number
of social-welfare programs
beginning
in 1935, including
the Social Security Act
and the Works Progress
Administration (WPA). One
of the WPA's several arms,
the Federal Arts Project,
employed out-of-work artists
to paint murals in public
buildings. Artists such as
Jackson Pollock
(1912-1956),
Willem de Kooning
(1904-1997), and
Arshile Gorky (1904-1948)
were sustained through
very hard times by such
commissions.
pomp-and-circumstance earnestness gives it a look that
borders on historical camp.
The Old Guard Falls Away
When George Lorimer retires as editor of the Post in
1936, Rockwell loses his most ardent supporter. Wesley
Stout takes over, and Rockwell's always-just-below-the
surface insecurities
rise to the top. Lorimer had been
quick to
let Rockwell know where he stood. Stout
is
hard to read and even harder to please: a pair of shoes
has to be painted two or three times before Stout accepts
a painting as finished. This change occurs in the same
year as the Rockwells' third and last son, Peter, is born.
It's a busy time in the world. The year 1937 sees two
million Germans
visit
a
Nazi-sponsored
exhibition,
"Degenerate
Art," which
includes
Van
Goghs
and
works by German Expressionists, Dadaists, Surrealists,
and Cubists. Another show, "Great German Art," which
runs concurrently, shows nationalistic images in a mus-
cular, realistic Socialist style and draws only 60,000 vis-
itors. In America, the Golden Gate Bridge opens in San
Francisco; Spam is introduced to the market; and Frank
Lloyd Wright (1869-1959) designs Fallingwater,

a modern masterpiece of domestic architecture in rural Pennsylvania.
It's also the year in which Picasso paints his famous anti-war canvas,

against
the

of
Guernica, a town sacred to the independent-minded Basques of Spain.
Get Over
It!
Rockwell's
1921
experiment with
self-photographing had been an
isolated one. But with three little boys in the house, the camera comes
in handy for capturing
all the cute candid moments. For
artists of
Rockwell's generation, using a camera bordered on plagiarism.
Still,
Rockwell finds a move to photography necessary. First, models are get-
ting harder and harder to find. Second, if he wants to show "ordinary
people," it works better to take their pictures than to ask them to pose
for whole days at a time. Third, photography gives him a chance to
play with angles of view. (An art director had told Rockwell that his
models all looked like they were sitting on chairs placed exactly ten feet
away from the artist.)
By 1937, he feels at ease with the camera—even liberated by it—and
now uses it as an integral part of his process. Even so, he feels like he's
fudging, and when visitors come to the studio he puts the photographs
out of sight.
Rockwell's principles of photography-in-the-service-of-art are:
Happy Birthday,
Miss Jones
(aka Teachers
Birthday), 1956

1. He uses an average of 100 photos to make his sketches.
2.
Photographs are only to be used as aids.
3.
Photographs enable portraiture when the sitter is a busy person.
4.
Photographs help him capture a certain desired lighting.
How is his art affected? Compare for yourself paintings from before
and after 1937. You will find that:
Silhouetting disappears.
There is more specific detail in backgrounds, especially in depicting
buildings.
He employs a more cinematic approach to the composition, which
suggests action occurring outside the pictorial frame.
There
is greater variety in
his use of perspective and of smaller
spaces within spaces.
Sound Byte:
"All in all, Ifeeljustified in using photographs. Not so cleanlyjustified,
however, that I don t squirm and grin sheepishly when someone mentions
it. But I don't think
it's changed my work. I challenge anybody to show me
when I started to use photographs.
I've always been known as The Kid
with the Camera Eye."
—Norman Rockwell

With their oldest boy only six years old, the Rockwells set
out in 1938 for another trip abroad, this time to England.
The country lanes of Oxford make him long for a more
rural home
base.
After
their
return,
the
Rockwells
purchase a summer home in Arlington, Vermont, close to
a
number

illustrators
and
artists,
including
Grandma Moses
(1860-1961). One
summer
later,
delighted with their new locale, they make a permanent
move to Arlington.
Willie Gillis, We Really Knew Ya
Rockwell may be in rural heaven, but clearly he
is aware
that a war
is being fought overseas.
World War
II
is
a
turning-point experience for Rockwell, who is 45 years old
when Germany invades Poland. During the next six years
of that
horrible war, Americans
rely heavily on photo-
graphs
for
their information about the
grisly battlefield
scenes.
Rockwell, who
spurns
the
photo-documentary
approach,
creates
instead the character of an appealing,
all-purpose GI, whom he tags Willie Gillis, through whom
the
artist can
explore
the theme of leaving and coming
home.
GI's
are
the working
stiffs of the World War

military.
Without a commission and rarely self-enlisted,
typical
GIs

communities and shipped off to Europe like cattle. Rockwell's Willie
Gillis
is
the boy next
door,
the
mother's
son, the
sister's
brother.
(Actually, he
is Bob Buck, a boy Rockwell spots as his ideal model at
the local Grange Hall.) Willie's short frame and gosh-and-golly face
encourage the protective instincts of women (magazine readers). The
story of Willie Gillis also gives Rockwell a chance to develop a theme
in successive Post covers, something he has not been able to do for
many
years. The theme of leaving and coming home
is
artfully,
even tenderly, explored in a total of eleven Willie Gillis Post covers,
including Willie's departure, peeling potatoes for his fellow soldiers,
picking up a CARE package, consuming the "Home Town News," and
finally returning home and
to
college on the GI
Bill.
Rockwell's
intention
is to humanize the war, to aid and comfort families with sons
and daughters who are "over there," to acknowledge the whole range of
human
sacrifice, and generally to bolster morale on the home front
during the war. Willie Gillis becomes so real for Americans that they
write to Rockwell asking for the young man's address.
In Packagefrom Home, Rockwell shows a sensitive, more touching
side of war, if such a thing exists. He has little interest in depicting the
harsher realities of military service, perhaps out of a sense of sympathy
for the families left behind. He seeks an image of the war that brings
some measure of comfort to family members waiting nervously in
America for their loved ones' return.

back home the daily routine of soldiering and leaves the bloodshed to
the photojournalists.
Rockwell creates these paintings against a back-
drop of a very busy year for Americans: The

in
the
United
States; Mount
Rushmore
„
'
th
R'
National Monument in South Dakota
is opened to the public; Pearl

is
attacked by the Japanese; and Orson Welles makes
his
monumental film noir, Citizen Kane.
To show his sensitivity to the war effort and his awareness that war is
brutal, Rockwell creates Lets give him Enough and On Time,
(see
page 75), an unusually stark poster for the artist, both thematically and
in its tone. The threatening title and anonymity of the figure create a
dark, menacing view of the war. The poster is less about Rockwell and
his vision than about the state of things during the war. The violent
slash of yellow that tears into the dark night resembles a Hollywood
movie poster.
It is as macho as Rockwell gets.
Rosie, We Love Ya'
Willie Gillis's female counterpart, Rosie the Riveter, seen only once, is
the iconic cover image for the Post issue of May 29, 1943. Muscular
and powerful, she
is posed like Michelangelo's prophet Isaiah in the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, with a huge riveting gun lying across her
lap, an elbow and forearm resting on her black lunch pail (marked with
the name ROSIE), her dark-blue bib overalls decorated with a line of

patriotic
buttons, and
her
loafered
feet tromping
a
dirty copy of
Hitler's Mein Kampf. The backdrop of the painting is the American
flag, a sure sign from Rockwell that the growing importance ofwomen
during wartime America
is a good thing for the country, a source of
strength to the nation. While Rockwell may have painted more famous
women in his career, none has more notoriety or
is a greater crowd-
pleaser than Rosie, an Everywoman for America.

as

ensconced in the safety of his home (he
is too old to serve) while the
country is engaged in a gut-wrenching global war, Rockwell longs to
contribute something substantial that will aid the war effort. At 3:00
AM on the night ofJuly 16, 1942, Mary Rockwell awakens from a deep
sleep to find her husband wide awake, excited about an idea that has
just occurred to him: He will create a series of illustrations for the U.
S.
government
based
on
President
Roosevelt's
"Four
Freedoms"
speech, his annual address
to Congress that year: they will include
Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Fear, and
Freedom from Want (see pages 80-81). The four images in tandem
will unite Americans in their common goal of democracy for all.
Freedom From Want is the universally recognized portrait ofAmericana.
It is the single most representative image of a kind of America known

around the world as the apple-pie-eating, turkey-carving, wishbone-
splitting, granny-knitting home.
It is one of Rockwell's most beloved
paintings, but, ironically, his least favorite of the suite.
Freedom ofSpeech features a man with a simple quest:
the right to be
heard. The model Rockwell uses for this image bears some resemblance
to the actor Gregory Peck, who portrays the freedom-championing
lawyer Atticus Finch in the movie To Kill a Mockingbird. The simplicity
in which Rockwell pictures the ability to be heard reminds one of the
actor Jimmy Stewart's earnest proclamations in the movie Mr. Smith
Goes
to
Washington. Note the deep black rectangle
that frames
the
speaker's face. Without it, the speaker would blend into the crowd.
Freedom of Worship is the most difficult of the quartet, since religion
is a tricky subject to paint.
Rockwell
is afraid of stereotypes, yet he
wants
to show freedom of religion
for
all
people. His
use of the
extreme close-up conveys a message of urgency and intimacy.
Freedom from Fear is, for many viewers, the most comforting of the
four, yet many critics find
it strangely smug, as if this portrait of an
American couple tucking their children safely into bed fuels American
isolationism.
("We dont have
to worry
like
the Brits do about being
bombed. ") This is not Rockwell's intent.

Big ideas create big problems, and, for a time, it seems
that Rockwell cannot give his Freedoms away. He goes
from governmental agency to agency, sketches in hand,

accept
his
donation. The
Pentagon turns Rockwell away with his four treasures,
arguing that they don't have time for posters just now.

Meanwhile, back in Vermont, Rockwell experiences every artist's worst
nightmare:
His studio tragically burns to the ground in 1943. Gone
are 30 paintings and many decades' accumulation of props and costumes.
Rockwell's
only known comment
is, "There
goes my
life's work."
But the fire might be seen as a blessing in disguise, since
it provides
Rockwell the impetus to rid himself of the baggage of almost 30 years
and orient himself to the future. At 49, the artist must reluctantly start
anew.
Instead
of painting
the
days
of yore,
he now
decides
to
capture the more contemporary world around him, even if it's
still a
little rural.
After the War
Prior to World War II, Rockwell had said (and many historians would
agree) that there was no separation between the past and the present;
there was only one continuous flow. Yet the experience of World War
II and the burning of his Arlington studio interrupted the flow of
Rockwell's
life and
his connection
to the
past. Looking back with
nostalgia to an epoch of innocence seems a luxury not quite appropriate
in the immediate postwar years, when individuals and
families
are
constructing new lives and America is coming to grips with its status as
a superpower in a new age.

burned to ashes. Instead of turning back, Rockwell focuses on archetypal
everyday activities taking place in small-town America: the country
school, the small-town newspaper office; the rural family doctor, even
the agricultural agent. The mandatory camera takes the place of the
old costume collection, documenting what the doctor wears and what
instruments he keeps out on the table.
At the Post, the times they are a-changin'. Ken Stuart becomes the new
art editor at the Post and sets the tone for a new direction: the literal

portrait of America, a collective portrait that includes
everyone. Stuart believes the Post covers have become
stale and stereotyped and decides
that the magazine
needs to find innovative ways of expressing the energy
and complexity of postwar America. Rockwell is asked
to paint what he
really wants to say and not what he
thinks the new editor and art director expect from him.
His work now focuses more on the cultural environ-
ment
of the
events
he
shows. He gradually
replaces
theater with mood and emotion.
A fine example of this new style is Shujfletons Barber-
shop, the April 29, 1950 cover of the Post and one of
Rockwell's most memorable images. In this painting, a
series
of windows
and
doors
creates
four
separate
spaces. The dramatic lighting (courtesy of the camera)
turns
a
homey
barber
shop
into
a
sanctuary.
Rockwellian details are plentiful here: the crack in the
window,
a missing drawer, the chipped baseboard,
a
mug in the sink which signals the last shave of the day.
The

of
the
musicians
is
everything
Rockwell loves about
life
in
a small town, but
their
humanity saves the picture from being saccharine. The

But the bright ochre tones in the background warm the heart of most
viewers. The novelist John Updike liked
it enough to hang a copy of
it in his office bathroom.
FYI: A business boo-boo— In 1948, Rockwell co-founded the Famous
Artists School, a correspondence course that promised instruction and
response from teachers the likes of Rockwell. "Draw Me!" read the head-
line
in the full-page ads next to a caricatured profile of a woman. Famous
Artists School was so successful that
it failed: Students signed on and
stayed on longer than the co-founders thought they would, and
it cost
the artists more to critique their students than revenues could support.

find themselves increasingly tormented by their struggle with alco-
holism (Mary) and depression (Norman). In 1952, he paints a portrait
of President Eisenhower, thus beginning a tradition of painting pres-
idents and first ladies every four years.
Finally, in 1953, the couple can
no longer continue to battle their individual illnesses. In search of help,
they look to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
90

A New Direction on the Horizon
Stockbridge is the American town most identified with Rockwell. He
and Mary move there in 1953 to facilitate their medical treatment, and
Rockwell has the good fortune to meet psychoanalyst Erik Erikson
(b. 1902) there. The analyst, whose clinical specialty includes research
on "identity crisis" and on racial prejudice, treats Rockwell for depression
and has a great influence on the artist's choice of subject matters in his
paintings of the 1950s and 1960s. Stockbridge might just have easily
been dreamed up by Rockwell, for it is a true small hometown. After
living many years in big cities and rural settings, Rockwell now finds a
steady road, thriving on light, non-intrusive social contact and enjoying
the
chitchat with
local shopkeepers and farmers. As newcomer
in
town, he becomes Stockbridge.
Having been told by Lorimer not to include "colored people" in his
paintings,
Rockwell
feels
held
back
in
his
desire
to
depict
all
Americans, regardless of race.
Erikson's 1950 book, Childhood and
Society, develops the argument that black children who grow up in a
white
(ergo,
racist)
society end up hating themselves and suffering
from loss of identity. Rockwell knows, from first-hand experience, that
blacks are discriminated against: A few years earlier, an editor at the
Post painted over a significant detail in one of Rockwell's paintings
without informing the
artist—a not-so-subtle form of racism
that
causes Rockwell to be wary of the white establishment.


The Rockwells purchase a Federal- style house with carriage house (for
his studio) in 1957, at the same time as the artist is attacked in Atlantic
Monthly magazine for ignoring Modern Art and for being irrelevant.
Mary dies suddenly of a heart attack in 1959, but Rockwell stays on
and oversees the formation of the original Norman Rockwell Museum.
Marriage #3
A year later, the Post serializes his memoirs, as told to his son Tom, and
they are published the same year in book form as My Adventures as an
Illustrator. In 1961, he marries Molly Punderson,
a retired school-
teacher whom he meets in a class on modern poetry He just loves those
schoolteachers, doesn't he?
One More Look at the Moderns
For every ten people who have heard of Jackson Pollock and his drip
paintings, more than 1,000 know Norman Rockwell and his Christmas
cards. Rockwell loves the mass appeal of his work, but also enjoys the
art ofJackson Pollock, who died in 1956. In yet another attempt to try
his hand at modern art, Rockwell creates a painting, The Connoisseur,
in 1962, in which a curious viewer stares at a drip painting
that hangs
on a museum wall—and that looks strangely similar to a canvas that
Pollock might have created. (Not surprisingly, Rockwell makes several
drip paintings in his studio to learn what the process feels like.) The

painting is a wry comment on art snobs who express contempt for any-
thing that is not trendy or in vogue. The work is also an act of homage
to the AbEx painter Rockwell most admires.
Though he is a product of an older generation, Rockwell adapts aston-
ishingly well to change. He rides into the 1960s, ready for renewal. He
and John
F. Kennedy get on splendidly, and Rockwell paints several
portraits of the
president. (He
also
paints
Presidents
Eisenhower,
Nixon, Johnson,
and
Reagan
and
presidential
aspirants
Adlai
E.
Stevenson, Barry Goldwater, Robert F. Kennedy, and Hubert Humphrey.)
With
the emotional support of his physician and
the
staff at
the

with the Post after 47 years.
His final cover for them
is published on
December 14, 1963.

No sooner does he leave the Post and its cheery world of middle-class
white America than he is snapped up by Look magazine in 1964. They
encourage him to focus on social and political issues, and no where
is
this better expressed than
in
his painting about school integration,
The Problem We All Live With (on the next page). In the first part of
his career (while working for the Post), Rockwell portrays an America
coping with the bittersweet realities of day-to-day life.
In the second
part, he becomes an activist against racism and a supporter of space
exploration, the Peace Corps, and of worldwide efforts to bring about
harmony among people. That's
a remarkable
feat for someone who
was under orders
at the Post (from Mr. Lorimer)
to paint African
Americans only as servants. While it is a popular thing to paint the first
American landing on the moon, it is a courageous thing to paint deseg-
regation, as in New Kids in the Neighborhood (pages 100-101), and
bloodshed in Mississippi, as shown in Southern Justice (page 102).
FYI: According to son Tom Rockwell, his father was most committed
to two major causes: the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and
civil rights for
African Americans. Working for these causes brought the artist
enormous gratification.
In the early 1970s, Rockwell's stock with the
art community drops
even
further. The
critics
perceive him
as being old-fashioned and
passe, and pan the 60-year retrospective of his work at New York's

The Essential Norman Rockwell
Rockwell was a Horatio Alger figure, driven by a need to work work
work and by an ambition to excel, to compete intensely with himself.
Like
the
original Horatio Alger, Jr.
(1832-1899), known
for
his

him
this
kind of success. He was
principled,
orderly, and
logical.
Ironically, he was also haunted by insecurity about his ability to paint
well and to keep coming up with good ideas.

He was
a figurative painter—that
is, a painter of people. No other
subject ever got his attention. He observed the individual with a keen
eye, and was a quiet and profound observer of human nature. He lived
much of his life during America's age of innocence, and he lived long
enough
to
see
its plunge into violence and turmoil. He knew that
humankind has
a dark
side, but he chose
never
to
depict rage
or
brutality, only the results of it. He meant his work to bring out the best
in us—to mirror kindness, tolerance, humor, and trust in one another,
so that we might connect as members of a harmonious human family.
Paradoxically,
Rockwell's
art
transcends
its human
subject
matter,
balanced compositions, perfected drawing and painting techniques,
and
the
countless
details
of America's
material
culture,
precisely
because it celebrates these things. In freezing the telling moments and
in "proving" that they actually happened by including lifelike objects
from our
daily
existence,
Rockwell's
paintings and drawings, book
illustrations and magazine covers, remind us that everything is always
changing, that nothing lasts forever or even longer than an instant.
This moment is all there
is, and it is priceless.

A Special Greatness
Part of the
fascination with—and importance of—Rockwell
as an
artist is that in significant ways, the content ofhis work evolved over time.
opposite
(The word content is used here to mean not just the subject matter of
a
picture—for example,
a bashful teenage boy with
flowers
for
his
date—but the way the subject
is interpreted and how that interpreta-
tion contributes to the larger meaning of a picture.) Rockwell was far
more in tune with the times he lived through than we sometimes give
him credit for. He acutely observed sociological and societal shifts and
changes for nearly 50 years, and he recorded and explained the changing
expressions of his country's middle-class values in a number of thematic
categories, including:
school-age boys and girls; dating and courtship
behaviors; women as women; home and family; marriage; sports and
leisure; work life and careers; the military.
Young Girls and Women
Throughout
his
life, Rockwell was
a shrewd, empathic observer of
gender, especially female. For a man with no sisters and a mother who
was paralyzingly depressed, he had a deep and subtle comprehension
of what it was like to be a young girl—the expectations placed on her;
her absorption or rejection of "feminine" behavior; passages of self-doubt
and self-knowledge. From Girl Running with Wet Canvas, shown on p.

have looked at that age) to Girl at Mirror, we see the
artist's sympa-
thetic understanding of what
girls and young women had
to do
to
gain
approval, and what happened
to them when they bucked the
expectations. Clearly, Rockwell enjoyed the tomboys.
Rockwell was sensitive to the psychic pain of teenagers, and he was a
master commentator on
the agony and
the
ecstasy of dating and
courtship. The mirror he held up to a still-innocent and cultural iso-
lationist American generation of 1917 with his Post cover Two Men
Courting Girl's Favor (p. 44) reflects a universal and visceral discomfort:
The girl is torn between the suave man and the tentative young man
who approaches her with a dance card. In fact, Rockwell may be at his
best when
it comes to the subject of women.
Certainly his treatment
ofwomen as women shows how far he was able to stretch and how he
appreciated (and did not resent) the ways women can and do take
charge. He painted women from newlyweds to grandmothers, from
professionals to blue-collar workers, and they're invariably the stable
center, the ingenious fixer, the positive pole. Whether they are work-
ing at home or in the world, Rockwell
is in touch with their interior
lives. His interpretations run from stereotypes ofwhat women indulge
in (that would be gossip) to raucous celebrations of their power.
Home Sweet Home?
Rockwell clearly idealized middle-class family and home life. He saw
109

Christmas

home as the place, the heart of American lives. He also watched families
evolve from an era of multi-generational, one-marriage expectations to
an era on the brink of the Vietnam War. While he acknowledged his
preference for harmonious family
life, he documented the pressures
that families felt and the upheavals that beset them through two World
Wars.
His take was always upbeat and positive. No point in spread-
ing pain and suffering, gloom and doom. The closest he ever came to
admitting to the existence of the Great Depression was Hobo and Dog
(p. 56), the Post cover for January 12, 1929.

Pride in the Military
Norman Rockwell held the military in the highest regard. This was as
true of World War I as it was of World War II.
His patriotism found
some of its purest and most idealized and heroic expression in portraits
of soldiers, sailors, and marines. He was equally at ease in showing the
ordinary
draftee
foot
soldier and
the
field
nurse
in off-moments.
What seemed to inspire him was the willingness of young people to
make an unconditional sacrifice to defend freedom. By showing ordi-
nary men and women slogging through their chores and relishing the

packages and letters from home, Rockwell acknowledged
everyone's sacrifice and suffering, without painting blood
and gore.

The Artist Arrives
What remains
to be done
is
to honor Rockwell the
artist, the man who, in an age when many artists painted
for themselves and about themselves, stayed faithful to
what he knew he did superbly well:
paint for others
and about others. This vocational decision meant that
he had to resolve the conflict between what his patrons
(magazine editors, publishing houses, institutions such
as the Boy Scouts of America) offered him and finding
the outer limits of his innate artistic vision and creativity.
In a sense, he chose We over
7,
service over stardom.
Paradoxically, he became
a
star
in
his
lifetime, and
because he was a great artist, his art
is coming into a
new and more refined focus.
So what do you think? Is he an artist or an illustrator?
The decision is yours. But in the meantime, millions of
grateful viewers say, "Thank you, Norman Rockwell."
