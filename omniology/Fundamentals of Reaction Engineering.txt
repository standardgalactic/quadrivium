Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL REACTOR DESIGN
1.1 Introduction 
We seek to design reaction vessels, i.e. chemical reactors, where a particular chemical reaction (or set of 
reactions) is carried out. The first decision we take involves the configuration of the reactor and its mode of 
operation. This means we must decide what reactor type (and reactor shape) to select and whether it would be 
advantageous to operate in batch or continuous mode.  
Other design decisions regarding the new reactor will be affected by a multiplicity of factors. To arrive at an 
appropriate design, we need information on the reaction kinetics and the required daily output. For relatively 
small daily production rates, we need to choose between batch and continuous operation, while, large 
throughputs usually require operation in continuous mode. If the reaction is rapid, we would need short 
residence times in the reactor. This might imply the use of high fluid velocities or small reactor dimensions, or 
a combination of the two. 
If we choose continuous operation, we still need to select the type of reactor to design and use. We will 
primarily focus on tubular reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). We will then need to size the 
reactor. Together with the throughput requirement and available flow rates, the data will allow us to calculate 
the residence time and help us decide on the shape of the reactor calculate the required size.
The operating temperature and pressure are usually selected on the basis of the kinetics of the reaction and 
whether the reaction gives off heat (exothermic) or requires a heat input to proceed (endothermic). We will 
also need to know initial reactant concentrations available to us. Depending on how the problem is presented, 
some of these operating conditions may have already been specified or we may have to specify these 
parameters as part of the design process. 
Criteria for choosing between batchwise and continuous operation:  Batch operation 
For small production rates (like pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs etc) of say a few tons/day, batch operations are 
generally more flexible and economical.  Batch operations tend to require smaller capital expenditure than 
corresponding continuous processes, especially when the required production is of relatively low tonnage.  
However, quality control may be a problem, as replicating identical conditions in each batch may prove 
problematic. It is commonly said that no two vats of dye have exactly the same colour.  
Criteria for choosing between batchwise and continuous operation: Continuous 
operation
Continuous operation is eventually adopted in most large-scale chemical processes. Its advantages include the 
ease of using on-line control systems and diminished labour costs owing to the elimination of many operations 
such as emptying and filling of reaction vessels. Whilst the use of advanced control systems usually requires 
greater capital outlay, it enables greater constancy in reaction conditions and improved product quality 
control. However, designing a continuous reactor requires accounting for the state of flow. Not all molecules 
going through a reactor will necessarily have the same residence time, or the same time-temperature or 
concentration histories. Compared to a corresponding batch process, this may lead to significant differences in 
average reaction rates and overall yields. To summarize, the “right” set of decisions for designing a chemical 
reactor will depend on numerous technical factors as well as the interplay between capital costs and operating 
costs. Many other factors may have a role including extraneous factors such as company design habits, 
supplier preferences, etc.

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
1.2 General mass balance for isothermal chemical reactors 
In order to introduce the basic types of chemical reactors, their modes of operation and basic flow patterns, we 
will first consider them under isothermal conditions. This means that we will, at first, neglect heat release (or 
uptake) by the reaction. We will also neglect heat transfer between parts of the reactor and/or heat exchange 
with the surroundings. 
The material balance for a reactant can be written in a general form applicable to any type of reactor.  For a 
time element 't and a volume element (of the reactor) 'VR the principle of the conservation of mass may be 
formulated as:

(Eq. 1.1) 
The third term of Eq. 1, involving “Mass of reactant converted…” will have the form “r ('VR) ('t)” . In this 
expression, “r” is defined as the rate of disappearance of a given reactant per unit volume of reactor, per unit 
time. It is useful to check each time whether you are given the rate in terms of formation or disappearance of 
a particular component. 'VR is defined as the “volume element” and 't, the time element being considered. 
We will next consider how this equation applies to particular reactor types. If concentrations and the 
temperature are uniform throughout the reactor, the volume element can be taken as the whole reactor. This is 
the case for stirred batch and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) described below. If however, 
concentrations change as a function of position within an isothermal reactor, then the mass balance equation 
would take the form of a differential equation. We will encounter this type of analysis, when we examine mass 
balances of tubular reactors.
1.3 Mass balances for isothermal batch reactors  
Batch reactor operation is fundamentally an unsteady state process; we expect all variables to change with 
time. All materials are charged into a batch reactor at the outset and no withdrawal is made until the reaction 
has reached the degree of completion desired. The mixture in the reactor volume, VR, is generally well stirred. 
This means that concentrations and the temperature may be assumed to be uniform at every point within the 
reactor. We will initially only consider isothermal reactors. However, we note that, in an actual reactor, the 
temperature may also change with time. The volume may be kept fixed (constant volume), or may be varied 
during the reaction to keep the pressure constant.
If the reactor volume VR is filled with reactant “A”, the mass balance for component “A” over the volume VR,
over the time period  to ( +

 (MANA )t        -

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
A few things to remember
Unless externally arrested (say by quenching), a homogeneous chemical reaction would be expected to 
proceed either (a) until equilibrium is reached, or, (b) in the case of an irreversible reaction, until the reactants 
are exhausted. The time necessary for achieving a given degree of reaction, say from NAO o  NA  is found 
from integrating the mass balance equation.

1.4 Continuous operation: Tubular reactors & the plug flow assumption 
Tubular reactors are mostly used for gas phase reactions although liquid phase applications are also common. 
The NO-oxidation reaction, a step in the production of HNO3 from NH3 ,
2NO + O2 o  2NO2
is an example of reactions carried out in tubular reactors. Tubular reactions are also widely used for catalytic 
reactions, where the reactor is filled with catalyst. The syntheses of methanol and ammonia are common 
examples. 
CO + 2H2 U  CH3OH
N2 + 3H2
 2NH3
U
In such reactors, there is a steady movement of reagents along the length of the tubular vessel. During steady 
state operation, concentrations at any given point in the reactor may be assumed not to change with time. In 
this type of reactor, no attempt is normally made to induce mixing between elements of fluid.  
Mass balances for tubular reactors in steady state operation:  Once again, we will first 
consider the material balance for an isothermal reactor. A formal mass balance over a differential volume 
element requires that we know (or assume) patterns of fluid behaviour within the reactor. The simplest set of

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
assumptions about the behaviour of the fluid in a tubular reactor is the ‘Plug Flow Assumption’ (PFA), also 
known as ‘piston flow’.
The plug flow assumption: The flow rate and fluid properties (P,T, composition) are assumed to 
be uniform over any cross section normal to the motion of the fluid, leading to the term “piston 
flow”. We assume that axial mixing by convection or diffusion may be neglected. 
Figure 1.2 A “plug” of fluid in a tubular reactor 
Good radial mixing may in fact be obtained when operating at relatively high flow rates, for example at 
Reynold’s Number values of Re ~ 104. Axial mixing may be realistically neglected when the length/diameter 
ratio approaches ~ 50. At this stage we will assume the reactor to be isothermal so we can describe reactor 
performance through the material balance alone. In the analysis of non-isothermal reactors, which will be 
examined later on in this book, the material balance equation is coupled with the energy balance equation.  
Implications of the Plug Flow Assumption (‘PFA’): Over any cross-section normal to the reactor 
axis, i.e. within any piston or ‘plug’ of fluid, all properties of the reacting mixture are assumed to be uniform. 
These properties include the mass flow rate, the flow velocity, the pressure, the temperature and the 
composition. Each plug of fluid is assumed to spend the same length of time as all others, in passing through 
the reactor. Each plug of fluid is similarly assumed to go through the same temperature, pressure and 
concentration histories. Thus, a plug of fluid may be viewed as a small batch reactor, passing through the 
tubular reactor without interacting with the preceding or succeeding plug of fluid. Diffusion relative to bulk 
flow is neglected. It is also important to remember that axial temperature gradients do not in themselves 
violate the PFA. However, we will postpone the treatment of non-isothermal reactors to a little later in the 
book.
The tubular reactor mass balance using the plug flow assumption: It is convenient to perform 
the material balance over the reactor on a mass basis.  Volume or moles are not necessarily conserved. At 
steady state, the mass balance over a single reactant A is given as follows.  [Holland & Anthony, 1979] 
(MA nA )V      -   (MA nA)V+'V      -     MA rA 'VR       =   0

This is the material balance equation for a tubular reactor assumed to be operating in plug flow. It is also 
sometimes called the “design equation”. Many students forget the (-) sign in this equation. Care must be taken 
not to! Clearly for the case where the mass balance is carried out over a product component “B”:

Note that the calculation of the reactor volume using the plug flow assumption gives no information about the 
corresponding length/diameter ratio.  
Similar expressions can readily be derived for fixed bed catalyst reactors (FCBR), where the volume of 
reactor is replaced by the weight of catalyst. In such cases, the reaction rate is expressed in terms of 
“moles/(wt-cat) (time)”. Note, again, that the use of both expressions (i.e. empty tube & FBCR) is limited by 
the applicability of the PFA.

ascertained empirically. For example, in Eq. 1.18 the exponent ‘n’ is not necessarily equal to the 
stoichiometric coefficient ‘a’of Eq. 1.17.

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
1.4.1 Integration of the tubular reactor mass balance equation (plug flow 
assumption)
Step 1:  Consider a case where the reaction rate expression is written in terms of concentrations. The rate 
expression must be re-cast in terms of molar flow rates (nA, nB etc) rather than concentrations. The equation
A
A T
n
C v
 
is well worth remembering. It will come up time and again. In this equation, nA  is the molar flow rate with 
units of “moles sec-1”, CA the concentration of “A” with units of “moles vol-1” and vT is defined as the total 
volumetric flow rate through the reactor, with units of vol s-1. The mass balance equation can now be written 
as:

(Eq.1.19)
Step 2: We have already seen that for continuous reactors, the equation    
nA = nA0 (1-xA)
(Eq. 1.14) 
defines the fractional conversion, xA. When the total volumetric flow rate, vT, is constant throughout the 
reactor, i.e. when the density or molar volume of the reacting mixture can be assumed constant as it travels 
down the reactor, we can write: 
A

          CA = CA0 (1-xA)


Clearly, if vT is not constant, 
A0

 and the equation “CA = CA0 (1-xA)” is no longer valid. 
In general, changes in vT may be safely neglected when dealing with liquid phase reactions. However, for gas 
phase reactions where the number of moles changes (as in the reaction A o B + C) and/or when the axial 
temperature, and therefore the molar volume changes, the change in vT as a function of position must be taken 
into account. In fact, vT must be expressed in terms of nA or whatever other variable (such as the conversion, 
xA) is selected for tracking the progress of the reaction. We will presently cover that particular case in some 
detail.
Step 3: If vT may be assumed constant throughout the reactor, the term involving vT can be taken out of the 
integrand.

(Eq. 1.21) 
Step 4: The rate expression also contains a reaction rate constant ‘k’, which is a sensitive function of the 
temperature. Typically, k is proportional to an exponential in the temperature: e-E/RT.  Thus the integration 
indicated above cannot be carried out simply, unless we are able to assume “k” to be a constant, that is, unless 
the system is assumed to be isothermal. When the temperature changes with the conversion, the design 
equation (i.e. the material balance) must be coupled with an energy balance equation and solved 
simultaneously. We will see how we deal with such problems a little later in this text. Meanwhile, the 
assumption of isothermal operation may be considered as valid when the heat evolved during (or absorbed by) 
the reaction may be neglected.  
Let us assume for present purposes that both vT and k are constant for this reaction, throughout the reactor. For 
a first order reaction, assuming the exponent n to have a value of unity, the integration is straightforward:

1.4.2 Volume Change Upon Reaction in Isothermal Tubular Reactors 
In gas phase reactions at constant pressure, changes in the total number of moles with increasing conversion 
give rise to changes in volume. This affects the gas velocity and the total volumetric flow rate. Consider the 
reaction,
A o 2S,
(Eq. 1.24) 
where “A” and “S” are gases. The total volumetric flow rate, vT , would change as a function of conversion, 
and also, as a function of position within the reactor. Postulating a simple reaction rate expression, rA = kCA = 
, we can write the material balance (design equation) for an isothermal tubular reactor and integrate:

   .
(Eq. 1.19) 
For this type of reaction, vT is not a constant with respect to nA and cannot be taken out of the integrand in Eq. 
(1.19) as a constant. Instead, the molar flow rate, nA, and the total volumetric flow rate, vT, are expressed in 
terms of xA (the fractional conversion), by using the relationships given below. Allowing that there may be 
some product S and also some inert gaseous component ‘I’ in the mixture entering the reactor:
nI        =       nI0                                                           for the inert component
nA
=       nA0   –   nA0 xA
for the reactant
(Eq. 1.25)
nS        =       nS0  +  2 nA0 xA
for the product
-----------------------------------
nT       =       nT0 +   nA0xA
nT is the total molar flow rate as a function of the local conversion
We now need an expression relating the molar flow rate to the total volumetric flow rate. In cases where the 
pressure is not very high, using the ideal gas law as the thermodynamic equation of state is usually 
appropriate.
                                                                     PvT = nTRT

Thus far, we have assumed the pressure drop, 'P, through the reactor to be negligible. Unless high pressures 
are used (say above 10 or 20 bar) and the pressure drop is significant, pressure effects are usually dwarfed by 
the effect of variations in the temperature. Neglecting 'P is not permissible, however, in many catalyst packed 
reactors, where it constitutes a significant fraction of the total pressure. 
We then require another equation relating the internal total pressure either to the conversion or, more usually, 
to the position variable within the reactor. In this case we need to consider resorting to numerical procedures, 
to solve the pressure (momentum) equation and the material balance, and eventually the energy balance, 
simultaneously.

neglected, we get:

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
Also remember: In principle, most reactions produce a change in volume. However, it is usually 
a good first approximation to take 'V = 0 for liquid phase reactions. Clearly 'V = 0 is also 
strictly correct for ideal gases reacting with no overall change in the number of moles.
1.5   Continuous operation: Continuous stirred tank reactors & the 
perfect mixing assumption 
A stirred tank reactor can be operated as a steady flow reactor (CSTR), as a batch reactor, or in semi batch 
mode. The latter is the case of fermenters, where a gas (usually air) is bubbled through liquid in the stirred 
tank. The common key feature in all these cases is the assumption that mixing is immediate and complete. 
In an ideal CSTR, the composition, temperature and pressure of the reaction mixture are
all assumed to be uniform everywhere in the vessel. These properties are assumed to be
identical to the properties of the reaction mixture at the exit of the reactor. When these
assumptions hold, the rate of reaction is expected to be uniform and constant throughout
the vessel and may be evaluated at the temperature, pressure and composition of the
product stream.

(Eq. 1.39) 
The average residence time in a CSTR is defined as W {VR/vT.
Mixing:  A fair approximation to perfect mixing is not difficult to achieve in an ordinary CSTR, provided the 
fluid phase is not too viscous. In the laboratory, if an injected pulse of dye is distributed uniformly throughout 
the tank in a time much shorter than the average residence time of fluid in the tank, then the CSTR can 
probably be considered as ‘well mixed’. 
Lower overall reaction rates compared to tubular reactors: The “perfect mixing” assumption 
implies that the inlet reactant concentration rapidly (if the mixing is “perfect”, immediately) drops to the 
concentration level of the mixture in the tank and in the outlet stream. In other words, the concentration 
driving force is quickly reduced to that in the product stream. This stepwise and rapid drop in concentration 
directly reduces the reaction rate. In general, the average rate of reaction in a CSTR is lower than, say, a 
tubular reactor with the same inlet concentration of reactants as the CSTR.   
For the same reactor volume, therefore, the CSTR would give lower conversions. The relatively lower 
conversion in CSTRs – compared to tubular reactors – is a fundamental property, arising from the “perfect” 
mixing. The same phenomenon may also be described in terms of a higher proportion of by-pass of reactant in 
CSTRs. Clearly, in the absence of adequate mixing, bulk streaming between the inlet and outlet of the CSTR 
would make losses in conversion even greater.  
Conversely, due to relatively lower reactant concentrations in the CSTR, the CSTR volume required for an 
equal conversion as a tubular reactor would need to be larger than the tubular reactor. As we will see later on, 
it is sometimes advantageous to have several smaller CSTR’s in series, in order to reduce bypass loss and 
increase conversion.

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
Some advantages of CSTRs: Despite adverse factors like lower reaction rates, lower conversions and 
lower product concentrations, CSTRs are frequently used in industry, mostly for liquid phase reactions. They 
are easy and relatively cheap to construct. The greater volumes necessary for equal conversion, compared to 
tubular reactors, is comparatively less important as an economic factor, particularly in the case of atmospheric 
pressure tanks, made of inexpensive materials such as mild steel. Other advantages include easy temperature

ular reactor. As 
hown in Figure 5, for equal conversions, the reactant concentration within the CSTR would be similar to the 
ere high pressure vessels are involved, the 
dditional cost associated with using large volumes and indeed of having several reactors in series may be 
significant. We will consider these points in more detail later on. 
The perfect mixing assumption requires that fluid entering the vessel is instantaneously mixed with the fluid 
already present and that the time during which the new material passes through intermediate concentrations is 
short, effectively zero. For most types of kinetics, this stepwise dilution results in the average reaction rate 
being much smaller than if the same feed materials were allowed to react batchwise or in a tub

concentration at the termination of the process in a batch reactor or at exit of a tubular reactor. 
We have already seen that for the same conversion, a larger CSTR volume is required compared to a tubular 
reactor. Using several tanks in series can diminish the necessary increase in reactor volume and the attendant 
cost of having several tanks in series is usually acceptable. Wh

We will show that as the number of perfectly mixed reactor stages is increased, the exit concentration from the 
last reactor tends to approach the outlet concentration of a plug flow reactor, which has a total volume equal to 
the sum of the volumes of the perfectly mixed reactors. In fact we will show that the conversion in an infinite 
number of CSTR’s in series approaches that of a tubular reactor operating in plug flow.

Introduction to Chemical Reaction Design
An expression for the concentration of component A in the effluent stream from the last reactor in a series of 
N reactors of equal volume is developed as follows. For simplicity, we will assume the mass density and the 
total volumetric flow rate vT to be constant. We will also assume a 1st order chemical reaction, that all the 
reactors have equal volumes VR and that all the reactors operate at the same temperature. The reaction rate 
constant k will therefore have the same value in every reactor. The design equation for the 1st reactor can now 
be written as:

The start-up/shutdown problem for a CSTR normally operating at 
steady state 
The dynamic (i.e. non-steady state) behaviour of chemical reactors is an important area of study on its own. 
This type of analysis provides the basis for the design of control systems for reactors during normal operation 
as well as during the start-up and shut down stages. As an introduction to the subject, we will study a simple 
but useful problem: that of a step change in inlet concentration during isothermal steady state operation. We 
will see that start-up/shut down problems may be handled by using similar methods. Of its kind, this is 
probably the simplest problem to solve.  
CSTR mass balance with an accumulation term: This is no longer a steady-state problem. We 
carry out a material balance on component A, over the volume VR over the time period 't:

In Eq. 1.58, the bars indicate averaging over the time interval 't, and NA(t) is defined as the total number of 
moles of component A in the reactor at time t. We will work with a simple reaction rate expression: rA = k CA.
We will assume VR and vT to be constant. Note that in general, it is necessary to write as many material 
balance equations as there are components with independently changing chemical concentrations. Remember 
that the inlet flow rates (and/or concentrations) of the various reactants are not necessarily related. For a 
simple reaction, A
Products, it is possible to get by with a single mass balance equation.

The starting point of the problem is a CSTR operating at steady state. At t = t0 , a step change is assumed to 
take place in the inlet concentration from nA0,ss to nA0. Now the question we must ask is: “How will the outlet
molar flow rate of the reactant change with time?” Defining

The solutions are: nA, complementary = C1e -E t and nA, particular = C2 (const), where
nA = nA,c + nA,p and C1 and C2
are arbitrary constants. Substituting the particular solution into the differential equation, we get:

which denotes the new steady state exit molar flow rate of A. In fact, we would like to deal with finite lengths

For 
t = 3W  
e-t/W  = e -3W/W | 0.05 
 
t = 5W  
e-t/W = e -5W/W | 0.007 
Hence, after three to five residence times, the outlet stream from the CSTR approaches the steady state values 
quite closely.

Reactor Design for Multiple Reactions
CHAPTER 2 
REACTOR DESIGN FOR MULTIPLE REACTIONS 
2.1 Consecutive and parallel reactions 
In complex mixtures, the reaction leading to the desired product may be one of a number of parallel or 
consecutive reactions taking place. For example, during the partial oxidation of ethylene, the desired product 
is ethylene oxide. However, in a parallel reaction, ethylene may also directly combust, giving CO2 and H2O.
In addition, once formed, ethylene oxide may also further oxidize to CO2 and H2O, through a consecutive
reaction. [Holland & Anthony, 1979]

Definitions of Yield, Overall Selectivity and Point Selectivity: Two parameters indicating the 
extent of desired performance are the production rate of ethylene oxide and its concentration in the reaction 
products. Since there are several possible outcomes of the set of reactions, we cannot assume the production 
rate of ethylene oxide to be necessarily directly related to the total amount of ethylene consumed.

Reactor Design for Multiple Reactions
Yield: The yield of a specific product is defined as the fraction of reactant converted to that product.  
Defining “x” as the conversion, the total fractional conversion of a reactant A would be written as 
xtotal = xX + xY ,
where xX is the fractional conversion of “A” to “X” and xY is the fractional conversion of “A” to “Y”.
Selectivity: The selectivity needs to be defined for each product separately. In this case, the overall 
selectivity to form X is defined as 
. When there are more than two products to consider, it 
is also possible to define the selectivity in terms of a pair of products, or a group of products. For the purposes 
of this text, we will stay with the simple definitions used above. If our pair of parallel or consecutive reactions 
is assumed to take place at constant volume, the selectivity can also be defined in terms of the concentrations 
of the components involved. In this case:

Point selectivity: The point selectivity at a particular point within the reactor refers to the local or 
instantaneous ratio of the rate of production of one product to the total rate of production of all products. In 
batch reactors, where we ordinarily assume perfect mixing, reaction related parameters do not vary with 
position inside the reactor. However, reaction parameters will vary as a function of time. Where we have just 
two products, X and Y, we can write the point selectivity in a batch reactor as:  

 

X
p
X
Y
( dC
/ dt )
S
dC
/ dt
dC / dt
 

(Eq. 2.1)
These derivatives are evaluated at a specified time during the reaction. In a tubular reactor assumed to be at 
steady state, however, the point selectivity would be a function of position within the reactor, and not a 
function of time.   
X

p
X
R

( dC

S
( dC


(Eq. 2.2)
This equation represents the expression for the point selectivity at steady state, where the system does not 
change with time. Instead, the derivatives are evaluated at a specified position within the reactor.
The number of possible combinations of simultaneous (parallel) and consecutive reactions is large. We will 
consider several simple examples. 
2.2 
Simple Consecutive reactions: Applications to reactor types 
2.2.1 
Isothermal batch reactors 
Consider the pair of consecutive liquid phase reactions 
                             A
X                r1 = rA = k1CA                         (Reaction 1)                                   (Eq. 2.3)
o
  XoY                r2 = rX = k2CX
(Reaction 2)
(Eq. 2.4)
In this reaction scheme, “X” is produced through Reaction 1 and consumed through Reaction 2. We next write 
rate expressions for the formation and consumption of the three species involved (i.e. A, X and Y):
A

 r  = k C
(Eq. 2.5)
(Eq. 2.6)

r  = k C  - k CX

r  = k C
(Eq. 2.7)
The net rate of formation/removal of the intermediate product “X” is expressed by Eq. 2.6, where the rate of 
removal of “X” from the system (forming the final product “Y”) is subtracted from its rate of formation of “X”
by the reaction of “A”. Let us derive an expression for the number of moles of A, X and Y in the batch reactor, 
as a function of time. We have already derived:

Note the similarity between the equations derived for the batch and PFR reactors. This is because, volume 
elements in plug flow may be thought of as small batch reactors travelling down the length of the tubular 
reactor.
2.2.3    Consecutive reactions: isothermal CSTR reactors

Where the rate of Reaction 1 is given by r1 = k1CA and the rate of Reaction 2 is given by r2 = k2CA. We define 
N1 and N2 as the number of moles of A reacted through Reaction 1 (rate constant k1) and Reaction 2 (rate 
constant k2) respectively. Then, NX = NX0 + N1(t) and NY = NY0 + 2N2(t). Note that in general k1 z  k2. Indeed, 
if k1 = k2 then 2 moles of “Y” would be produced for each mole of “X” formed and “A” consumed and the 
reaction would be simply written as 2A
 X + 2Y. Note that in either case, the net rate of disappearance of 
“A” is given by rA =  r1 + r2  .

2.3.1 Parallel reactions: Isothermal batch reactors 
If both reactions are irreversible, the material balance around reactant “A” remains the same as in the case of a

In this integration, the lower limits n10 and n20 were assumed to be zero. As in the case of batch reactors, this 
does not necessarily imply that CX0 and CY0 are = 0. Using Eq. 2.62 we can write:
nA = nA0 – n1 – n2 = nA0 – n1 {1 + k2 / k1}
,

(Eq. 2.70)
When the reaction orders are mixed, life is not so simple, since it is no longer possible to rely on Eq. 2.69. In 
all of these three simple cases, we dealt with first order reactions taking place in isothermal reactors. 
2.4 
Effect of temperature on relative rates of parallel reactions 
We have seen how, for equal reaction rate orders, the ratio of moles formed by any reaction, to the moles of A 
reacted by the reference reaction is equal to the ratio of the rate constants (See Eqs. 2.50 and 2.69).

(Eq. 2.71)
where EA1 and EA2 denote the energy of activation of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 respectively. According to Eq. 
2.71, if EA1 > EA2, an increase in temperature will lead to an increase in the rate of Reaction 1 relative to the 
rate of Reaction 2.
If the temperature is increased and (' E1  > ' E2), then

is expected to increase 
It is important to note that this conclusion is independent of the type of reactor employed. In cases where not 
all reactions are first order, i.e. when “mixed” reaction orders are involved, the yield of one product over the 
other can be increased by altering the temperature as shown above or by altering the relative concentration of 
reactants.  For a case where 
                                                     AoX    ;    r1 =  k1CA

we can show, by going through a similar derivation that

. Thus maintaining a high 
concentration of “A” would favour the production of product “Y” over product “X”. It appears therefore that 
when the “useful” reaction is of higher order than the “wasteful” reaction, improvement of the yield of 
“useful” product is favoured by increasing the reactant concentration. Conversely, if the useful reaction is of 
lower order, the yield is favoured by reducing the reactant concentration. The economics of the slowed-down 
reaction may be such that a higher yield may offset the lower speed of reaction – but this would need to be 
checked separately. 
2.5 How relative rates of reaction can affect the choice of chemical 
reactors [Denbigh & Turner, 1984] 
When the desired reaction is of high order, batch or tubular processes would favour formation of the desired 
product, compared to reaction in a CSTR. This is because, given similar feed concentrations, batch and tubular 
reactors operate at higher average reactant concentrations. If for quite different reasons, there are grounds for 
choosing a CSTR, the yield can be improved (although not quite as much as in a batch or tubular reactor) by 
increasing the number of tanks in the reactor sequence.  For a fixed number of tanks, the yield can also be 
improved by making reactor volumes progressively larger (Figure 2). This has the effect of increasing the 
average residence time (to allow more conversion) as the concentration driving force diminishes. 
Figure 2
Increasing the number of tanks in the reactor sequence.  The yield can also be improved for a fixed 
number of tanks by making their capacities progressively larger.

Reactor Design for Multiple Reactions
Figure 3 Where the desired reaction is of the lower order, the concentration of reagent should be kept as low 
as possible. The use of CSTR’s has advantages over the use of batch or tubular reactors. Only a small 
number of tanks in series is used and the first is made relatively large. 
If the desired reaction is of the lower order, the concentration of reagent should be kept as low as possible. 
This can be achieved by the obvious step of reducing the reagent concentration of the feed solution.  If 
outright dilution cannot be practiced due to subsidiary considerations, such as the cost of solvent recovery, the 
use of CSTR’s would have advantages over the use of batch or tubular reactors. In such a case, the reagent 
concentration is never high, especially if only a small number of tanks in series is used and if the first is made 
relatively large.

The same effect may be obtained by operating a type of process in which successive small increments of the 
reactant are added at a small rate compared to the reaction rate, so as to keep the concentration of reagent low.  
The method could be applied to batch, tubular, or CSTR reactors. 
2.6  Extents of reaction: definitions and simple applications 
[Alpay, 2001] 
We have so far dealt mostly with simple reaction rate expressions and relatively simple reaction schemes, in 
order to introduce the basic concepts of reactor design without letting complicated rate expressions get in the 
way. The definition of the fractional conversion serves well enough for tracking the progress of such simple 
chemical reactions and reaction schemes. Whilst we will continue to use the same terminology in the rest of 
this text, there is a more general system of definition that enables tracking the progress of complex sets of 
reactions. The ‘extents of reaction’ concept is useful in setting up simultaneous ordinary differential 
equations, describing the behaviour of more complex systems.  
Consider the chemical reaction: 
aA + bB + cC ... 
  xX + yY + zZ...
o
(Eq. 2.72)
In a batch reactor, the fractional conversions would be expressed as

Non-Isothermal Reactors
CHAPTER 3 
NON-ISOTHERMAL REACTORS
3.1 Energy balance equations: Introduction 
[Holland & Anthony, 1979] 
Except for rare cases where isothermal behaviour may be reasonably assumed, chemical reactions either 
absorb or release energy, usually in the form of heat. The reaction process thus tends to change the 
temperature of the reacting medium. Furthermore, rates of reaction change rapidly with changing reaction 
temperatures.  
A
A
r
k C
k(T ) C
 
 
A
(Eq. 3.1) 
where k(T) normally depends exponentially on the temperature: k0 exp{-Ea/RT}. In designing reactors, it is 
important to keep close track of temperature distributions and the release or uptake of energy by the reacting 
system. 
In designing non-isothermal reactors, material balance equations 
derived for isothermal reactors remain unchanged. 
However, material balances alone are not sufficient to describe the behaviour of non-isothermal reactors. 
The reaction rate depends on the local temperature. Energy balance equations must be 
formulated to keep track of heat exchange and temperature variations. The material 
balance equations and the energy balance equation must then be solved together.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-

Non-Isothermal Reactors
Due to the exponential dependence of the reaction rate constant on the temperature, the coupling of mass and 
energy balance equations usually requires the solution of simultaneous non-linear differential equations.
The energy balance equation: The energy equivalents of the net heat absorbed by, and the net work 
done by, the system must be taken into account. The following is a general statement of the energy balance 
equation, which also applies to unsteady-state operation.

The terms on the right hand side of Eq. 3.3 denote the internal energy, the kinetic energy and the potential 
energy, respectively; all terms have units of energy/mass. (KE)m denotes the kinetic energy due to the motion 
of the fluid and the superscript “m” implies that the quantity is expressed on a ‘mass’ basis. Similarly (PE)m
denotes the work required to raise a unit mass of fluid a given distance above a specified datum level against 
the force of gravity. The total enthalpy per unit mass of fluid may now be expressed as:

case, the reacting fluid) on the environment, and w as the mass flow rate, in units of mass per unit time. The 
shaft work is defined as positive when work is done by the system on the environment.

Q is negative if heat is exported from the system. In its present form, this equation is too general for using in 
an ordinary reactor design problem. We need to simplify Eq. 3.5 before we can make it work in practice. 
When a quantity of energy is considered to be “negligible”, it means the effect is 
small relative to other energy effects associated with the system. We usually compare 
these with heat effects associated with the chemical reaction(s). 
Changes in kinetic and potential energy: The form of Eq. 3.5 implies that we do not deal in 
absolute total energies, but in energy differences. For example, the kinetic energy related to the motion of 
mass through the reactor may itself be large, e.g., due to the high velocity of the reaction mixture. Generally 
however, changes in kinetic energy, due to changes in velocity in the reactor etc., would be relatively small.  
Similarly changes in potential energy, related to gravity effects of the streams entering and leaving the reactor 
may usually be neglected. In other words, although the kinetic energy and potential energy related terms 
themselves may be numerically large, it is usually safe to neglect, i.e. consider the associated changes to be 
relatively small. Thus

Shaft work: A system that has work done on it experiences the conversion of mechanical energy to internal 
energy, U. This is the energy associated with the structures and molecular motions of molecules. In a CSTR, 
the ‘shaft work’ done by the system (i.e. fluid) on the environment is normally associated with energy effects 
involving stirring.
Strictly, we must take account of the mechanical energy that the stirrer imparts to the reaction mixture. In 
practice however, the amount of energy involved is usually negligible, compared to reaction related heat 
effects. Usually, amounts of energy absorbed or released by chemical reactions are much larger. One 
exception would be the case of stirring of a very viscous liquid, where large amounts of energy may be 
involved. The energy equivalent of the work done by the stirrer on ordinary reacting mixtures is therefore 
usually neglected. The energy balance equation for a CSTR at steady state now becomes.

Clearly, at steady state, w (the mass flow rate) is constant. Generally it is more practical to work with an 
equation written in terms of molar flow rates rather than mass flow rates.  Also, in thermodynamic tables, 
enthalpies are usually given on a molar basis, rather than a mass basis. Defining H as the average enthalpy per

(Eq. 3.8)
where {nT0H}0 is evaluated at reactor inlet conditions and nTH at reactor outlet conditions. A common way of 
expressing Q is,
Q = U A (T – TC),
(Eq. 3.9)
where T is the reactor temperature and TC the temperature of the heat transfer medium. Eventually, depending 
on the reactor configuration, different formulations of this equation may be required. However, at this stage, 
what we really need is a way of recasting the terms {nT0H}0 and nTH in a form that is more readily usable. 
Once again, it is useful to recall that heat coming into the system is defined as positive and heat leaving the 
system is defined as negative. In what follows, we will assume that heats of mixing and pressure effects on the 
enthalpy are negligible. In practice, this amounts to assuming that we are dealing with perfect gases and ideal 
solutions. We can now write

We have, thus far, neglected effects due to changes in kinetic and potential energy and shaft work and we

(nil at steady state) 
where the subscript ‘0’ in Eq. 3.12 refers to the reactor inlet conditions. 
In a “non-isothermal CSTR,” the temperature is uniform everywhere within the reaction zone. 
Non-isothermal behaviour in a CSTR refers to differences between the feed temperature (T0)
and the reaction temperature (T), the heat absorbed or released by the chemical reaction and 
to heat exchange between the reactor and the surroundings.
In Eq. 3.12, the difference between the first two terms on the left hand side implicitly contains information on 
the sensible energy exchanges due to differences between the feed temperature (T0) and the reaction 
temperature (T), as well as any energy absorbed or released by the reaction. We will now recast Eq. 3.12 in a 
form which distinguishes between these two effects. 
We have already seen in Chapter 1 that for any single component “i”, the mass balance in a CSTR may be 
written as ni0 – ni = VR ri , where ri is defined in terms of the disappearance of component “i”. Let us substitute 
ni = ni0 – VR ri into the energy balance (Eq. 3.12).

(Eq. 3.14)
Taken together with the perfect mixing assumption, for an exothermic reaction, the first term represents the 
sensible heat absorbed by the feed stream, to bring it up to the reactor temperature. If the reactor is operating 
at a temperature below that of the feed stream, the first term would represent the heat given off by the feed 
stream. The reaction mixture would then absorb heat from the feed stream and the material in the feed stream 
would cool down to the reactor temperature. The second term represents the heat released (or absorbed in an 
endothermic reaction) by the chemical reaction. Q represents the heat added to or withdrawn from the CSTR 
by heat exchange.  
For an exothermic reaction, it is thus convenient to look at the first term as heat removed from system by flow. 
The second term is the heat generated by the reaction and Q is the heat withdrawn from the reactor. 
Conversely, for an endothermic reaction, it is convenient to look at the first term as heat carried into the 
reactor by the feed stream (i.e. by flow). The second term then represents the heat absorbed by the reaction 
and Q is the heat added to the reactor. We can further simplify the energy balance equation by using the 
equation:

(Eq. 3.23)
Broadly, the first term in this equation may be viewed as heat removal (or addition) by flow. The second term 
corresponds to the heat released (or absorbed) by the chemical reaction. Finally the third term, Q, represents 
heat removal (or addition) to the system by heat exchange. This simplified equation allows rapid preliminary 
calculations to be carried out in designing non-isothermal CSTRs. 
3.3  Multiplicity of steady states in non-isothermal CSTR’s 
[Denbigh & Turner, 1984] 
In non-isothermal CSTR calculations, the interplay of heat removal by flow, the heat released by the chemical 
reaction and the heat added (or removed) by ordinary heat transfer may give rise to a multiplicity of steady 
states. The analysis requires comparing the magnitudes of the three terms in Eq. 3.23. Consider an irreversible 
first order chemical reaction carried out in a CSTR, A oR+S. For ease of discussion, we will assume that the 
reaction is exothermic.

value of T cannot cause Qg to increase. 
The heat removal term: The heat removal term is made up of the sum of two terms: the sensible heat 
exchange term, Q, and heat removal by flow:  
Qrem = Q (due to heat exchange) + Q (due to flow).

The intersection of the two lines represents the simultaneous solutions of the mass and energy balance

and negative for endothermic reactions ('Hr > 0). It may also be noted that the shape of the material balance 
remains unchanged for exothermic and endothermic reactions.

position of the simultaneous solution. 
The treatment for a simple 1st order irreversible reaction is thus relatively easy. It would get considerably more 
complicated even for the simple reversible reaction A

. In any case, the basic design problem consists of 
finding “the most desirable” intersection of the mass and energy balances.  In this simple case the parameters 
which we can readily modify are yA0 (= nA0/nT0)and W (= VR/vT)

are carried out numerically, the variation of 'Hr and Cpi with temperature can be taken into account in 
straightforward fashion.
For simpler calculations, we will assume, as before that the heat capacity of the reaction mixture may be 
considered as approximately constant over the temperature and concentration changes envisaged.

The material balance equation for a tubular reactor – assuming plug flow: In the case of a 
single reaction taking place, the energy balance equation can be solved, coupled to a single material balance 
equation. Assuming plug flow, the material balance equation (the “design equation”) is written as:

Even for the simplest rate expressions, the simultaneous solution of Eqs. 3.48 and 3.49 usually requires 
resorting to numerical solution methods. In order to calculate concentration and temperature profiles along the 
length of the reactor, the equations must be combined with the initial conditions (in this case, the reactor inlet 
conditions). In the simplest cases, it is easier to work by assuming 'Hr and Cp to be independent of the 
temperature.  
Dividing the energy balance equation (Eq. 3.48) by the mass balance equation (Eq. 3.49), we derive the 
equation for the “operating line”, on the xA versus T plane:

This is the equation for the operating line, subject to the set of assumptions listed above. It is linear for

For CSTRs the intersection of the material and energy balance lines allows 
pinpointing the operating point, whereas, in a tubular reactor, temperatures and

Reversible Reactions in Non-Isothermal Reactors
4.1.1 Deriving the van’t Hoff Equation 
 
We know from laboratory experiments that if during a single reaction, we plot ln k against 1/T, where T 
denotes the absolute temperature, in the first approximation we obtain an (almost) straight line. If the line 
bends significantly, it is safe to infer that we do not have a simple, single reaction. The reaction mechanism 
may be changing with temperature or there may be interference from mass transfer effects. In catalytic 
reactions, which we will study later on in this book, when the slope decreases at higher temperatures, we look 
for diffusion limitations.  
 
The activation energy of a chemical reaction is defined by the slope of this straight line:

Integrating, we get the Arrhenius equation:

where R denotes the gas constant [= 8.314 J mol-1 K-1 (or  kJ kmol-1 K-1) =  0.08314 bar m3 kmol-1 K-1].  
 
The Arrhenius equation is consistent with simple Collision Theory. k0 is viewed as the product of the collision 
rate (largely independent of molecular species) and a steric factor, the value of which varies widely with the 
chemical species being considered. The exponential term

viewed as the fraction of collisions that are energetic enough to lead to reaction. Values of Ea usually range 
between 4 u 104 and 2 u 105 kJ kmol-1.

Reversible Reactions in Non-Isothermal Reactors
4.1.2 How does the equilibrium constant change with temperature? 
 
When the temperature rises, does Keq increase or decrease? Inspecting the form of the equation reveals 
straightforward trends. For endothermic reactions ('Hr > 0), when the temperature rises, the equilibrium 
constant Keq increases. Meanwhile, for exothermic reactions ('Hr < 0), Keq decreases as the temperature rises. 
Clearly both rate constants increase with increasing temperature. What this means is that for increasing 
temperatures, when 'Hr < 0 , k2 increases faster, relative to k1. Note that the van’t Hoff equation is entirely 
independent of reactor related considerations.  
 
We can also test for trends in the value of Keq by integrating the van’t Hoff equation:

For endothermic reactions ('HR > 0), we find once again that as the temperature increases, Keq , the 
equilibrium constant increases, whereas for exothermic reactions ('HR < 0), Keq decreases as the temperature
rises.

These trends are entirely independent of chemical reactor design. We next turn to the implications of the van’t 
Hoff equation for the design of chemical reactors. 
 
4.2 Reactor design for reversible endothermic reactions

forward reaction, as the temperature rises.

Reversible Reactions in Non-Isothermal Reactors
When considering the cost of atmospheric pressure reactors, the reactor volume is not usually a critical 
parameter. If, however, we are dealing with high-pressure reactors, it is important to keep to a reasonably 
small volume in order to limit construction costs. This in turn suggests that we would wish to operate at high 
reaction rates. 
 
Thus, when carrying out reversible-endothermic reactions (Figure 4.1) and indeed irreversible reactions, it 
would be sensible to operate at the highest possible temperature that is consistent with the durability of the 
materials of construction and also staying well clear of excessive by-product formation through accelerating 
side reactions. 
4.3  Reactor design for reversible exothermic reactions
 
With reversible exothermic reactions, the combination of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters means that 
increasing temperatures give rise to decreasing net forward reaction rates. This may seem a little counter-
intuitive. Let us go back to Eq. 4.13:

.                                                           (Eq. 4.13) 
For exothermic reactions, “'HR < 0” means that Ea2 is greater than Ea1. Thus, as the temperature rises, the 
term “exp{-Ea2/RT}” increases in magnitude faster that the term “exp{-Ea1/RT}”. This is why the ratio k1/k2 
(=Keq) diminishes with rising temperature. Plotting xA vs T, we find that the equilibrium conversion decreases 
with increasing temperature. 
 
 
Figure 4.2 Qualitative sketch of the equilibrium conversion xA,eq vs. T for a reversible exothermic reaction 
 
As already discussed, when working with irreversible or reversible-endothermic reactions, high reaction rates 
can be achieved by raising the temperature to as high a level as is safe and practical. But when working with 
reversible-exothermic reactions, the choosing operating conditions is less straightforward. In designing a 
reactor, it is necessary to take account of two competing effects. First, both the forward and reverse rates of 
reaction increase with rising temperature, so the kinetics is favoured by increasing the reaction temperature. 
However, equilibrium limitations are more restrictive at higher temperatures. In other words, the maximum 
attainable conversion, xA,eq takes on smaller values with increasing temperature. This is because, with 
increasing temperature, the reverse reaction picks up speed faster than the forward reaction so equilibrium, 
where the net rate of reaction is zero, is approached sooner. Let us look at the xA vs. T diagram for a reversible 
exothermic reaction in greater detail.

Figure 4.3 Several features of the xA vs. T diagram
 
At constant reaction rate (Figure 4.3), the conversion initially rises rapidly with increasing temperature and 
then begins to fall – due to the faster rising rate of the reverse reaction. The characteristics of the reversible-
exothermic reaction can be better understood by following a horizontal (constant conversion) line in Figure 
4.3. At low temperatures, the reaction rate would be low but would initially increase with rising temperature 
as we move towards the right in Figure 4.3, i.e. towards higher temperatures. At the other extreme, the 
intersection of the constant xA-line (horizontal line) with the equilibrium line xA,eq represents the point where 
the net reaction rate rA is zero. Moving from left to right, between these two extremes, the reaction rate passes 
through a maximum.

Reversible Reactions in Non-Isothermal Reactors
 
Thus, for reversible exothermic reactions, there exists an ‘optimum’ operating temperature (corresponding to 
the maximum reaction rate) for a fixed conversion. The line through these maxima gives a trajectory of 
maximum reaction rates as a function of the conversion, which we will call “the locus of maximum reaction 
rates” and discuss in the next section. It is important to remember that the present discussion is independent of 
the design of any particular type of reaction vessel. 
 
4.3.1 The Locus of Maximum Reaction Rates 
We will next derive an equation for the locus of maximum reaction rates for a simple reversible-exothermic 
reaction

For a given conversion, the reactor volume would therefore be a minimum if the temperature of operation is 
selected to be that corresponding to the maximum reaction rate.  
 
Both the constant rate lines in Figure 4.3 and the locus of maximum reaction

4.5 Reversible-exothermic reaction ('Hr < 0): “inter-stage cooling” and 
“cold-shot cooling”
We would like to take advantage of the fact that at higher temperatures, the reaction rate is higher. We would 
also like to exploit the fact that at lower temperatures, (while the reaction rate is low) the concentration 
driving force and attainable conversions are greater compared to operation at higher temperatures. Essentially 
we would like to operate on the locus of maximum reaction rates, moving towards lower temperatures as the 
conversion increases. 
 
However applying continuous cooling along the optimum reaction path would be impractical. A more 
practical option is to stage the reaction in such a way that each successive stage operates at a lower 
temperature to achieve a higher overall conversion. We will discuss two frequently used methods: “inter-stage 
cooling”, and, “cold shot cooling”. Both methods are used in industry to tackle problems involving reversible 
exothermic reactions. Typical applications include the methanol synthesis (

CO
2H
CH OH

) and 
ammonia (
2

N


o
) synthesis reactions. These reactions are carried out at high pressure, 
between 70 – 300 bar depending on the catalyst used. In the following treatment, for simplicity, each stage 
will be assumed to operate in adiabatic mode. Note that the discussion applies to tubular reactors as well as 
CSTRs, although we will select our examples from CSTR operation.

4.5.1 
Inter-stage cooling 
 
An inter-stage cooled reactor system consists of a series of catalyst chambers.  In each of the reactor stages, 
the temperature rises from inlet to outlet. Heat-exchangers (inter-stage coolers) are placed between the reactor 
stages, where the temperature is reduced without affecting the composition of the process stream.

Figure 4.6 Schematic diagram of two reactors in series. The first heat exchanger heats the feed stream from 
Tf to the reactor inlet temperature T0. After “Reactor I” the temperature T1 is dropped to T2 before entering 
“Reactor II”.  
 
The operating line of a single-reactor does not naturally follow a trajectory that shadows the locus of 
maximum reaction rates. In fact it cuts across that trajectory. By subdividing the reactor into a number of 
stages and removing heat from the reaction mixture after each reactor stage, the temperature is forced lower 
before the stream enters the next vessel. This allows working closer to the locus of maximum rates (see Figure 
4.7). Clearly the larger the number of steps, the closer the trajectory of the system would approach the 
theoretical optimum. An inordinately large increase in the number of inter-stage coolers, however, would tend 
to increase construction costs. We would need to determine the optimum number of reactor stages.

constant, to within the accuracy of the equation. Note that we still need to solve the mass and energy balance 
equations in order to calculate actual size of the reactor or amounts of catalyst to be used.

Figure 4.7 An inter-stage cooled reactor system consists of a series of adiabatic catalyst chambers.  In each 
of the reactor stages, the temperature rises from inlet to outlet. Then an interstage cooler cools the reaction 
stream to a pre-determined temperature.
 
In designing reactor systems with interstage cooling, one important question that must be addressed is how the 
reactor stages should be sized. Should all the temperature differences ('T) between inlet and outlet be equal? 
Or is there some optimum distribution of 'T’s? The latter would imply the existence of an optimum in the 
number of reactor stages and (in the case of catalytic reactions) an optimum distribution of mass of catalyst 
between the reactor stages.  
  
Usually, the first stage is designed to be smaller than subsequent stages. This is because the concentration 
driving force is larger, i.e. the conversion is as yet low.  A large amount of heat is released in the initial stages 
of the reaction because rates are fast due to the large concentration driving force. However, there is no single 
“correct” answer. The system is clearly complex and the optimum to be arrived at would depend on the type 
of objective function(s) that are adopted. 
 
4.5.2    Cold shot cooling 
Inter-stage cooling requires expensive heat exchange equipment and generates low grade energy from high 
grade energy. Another method of controlling the reaction temperature and conversion in the vicinity of the 
maximum reaction rate line involves splitting the inlet stream and injecting some of the cold feed into the 
system further down the line.

feed material which is at Tf – in this case the ambient temperature. “Cold shot” injection is repeated after the 
second stage. D is the fraction of feed stream that is retained for “cold-shot”s. Unlike the case of inter-stage 
cooling however, mixing cold feed with the inter-stage process stream has the effect of not just cooling the 
mixture but also adding fresh reactant and changing the process stream composition.

equations are accurate to within the limits allowed by the approximations made in deriving them. 
 
The adiabatic operating trajectories will rarely be linear but deviations may be ignored at the 
price of usually small errors. By contrast, in tubular reactors non-adiabatic operating lines 
cannot be expected to behave linearly.

Reversible Reactions in Non-Isothermal Reactors
 
In actual practice, “cold shot” cooling is a convenient method for carrying our reversible exothermic reactions. 
There are no costly inter-stage heat exchangers. However, for the same number of stages, it cannot result in 
quite such a large limiting conversion as can be obtained by the use of inter-stage cooling. The streams 
entering the second and subsequent stages have shorter average residence times in the reactor system. The 
price paid for omitting the inter-stage heat-exchangers is some reactant by-pass, which leads to lower possible 
overall conversions. 
 
The xA vs T graphs for the two modes of operation do not contain information on reactor 
volumes or catalyst bed sizes. Calculating reactor volumes requires the simultaneous solution of 
the material balance equation(s) and the energy balance equation. 
 
Generally, with a reasonable choice for values of the inlet temperatures into the various stages, one can 
considerably lower the reactor volume from that which would have been necessary for a single stage. Does 
this necessarily make multistage operation always preferable to simple, single stage operation? Not always. 
There is no single, simple solution to reactor optimisation in reversible exothermic reaction-reactor design. 
One would usually work with an economic objective function.  But economic data [price forecasting, size of 
markets, elasticity of demand etc] are fickle guides at best.  If equipment costing is to be made the important 
determinant in the objective function, multi– bed reactor systems enter the scales with complicated control 
equipment, added costs of inter-stage cooling etc. 
 
The minimum amount of catalyst alone is an unsuitable objective function. Choice of the minimum mass of 
catalyst for a fixed number of stages is a reasonable objective but inter-stage cooling comes at a cost.  
 
For CSTRs it is possible to operate each stage ON the locus of maximum reaction rates.  For 
tubular reactors, every point on the operating line corresponds to a point within the reactor.  
 
In tubular reactors, the decision about where to stop [i.e. end] each reactor stage must be taken carefully. 
Either side of the maximum-line corresponds to lower reaction rates than the maximum.  Generally half way 
between the “optimum” line and the equilibrium line turns out to be a reasonable place to stop.  Clearly one 
must avoid approaching the equilibrium line very closely, where the reaction rate dwindles down to zero.

Effect of Flow Patterns on Conversion
CHAPTER 5 
EFFECT OF FLOW PATTERNS ON CONVERSION 
5.1  Introduction 
The plug flow and continuous stirred tank models represent the two extremes in idealised flow regimes. The 
plug flow regime assumes total segregation between fluid elements, while the CSTR model represents total 
and instantaneous mixing. In CSTRs, the assumed (“ideal”) total and rapid mixing gives rise to a broad 
distribution of residence times of the fluid elements in the reactor. In this Chapter, we will derive an equation 
for such residence time distributions. Elements of “non-ideal” flow, such as fluid by-pass and stagnant pockets 
give rise to further broadening of the residence time distribution. Clearly, conversions within fluid elements 
are affected by the time available for reaction. Differences in conversion between fluid elements leaving the 
reactor will result from differences in residence time. A spread of residence times is not an advantage and 
tends to require, for the same conversion, a larger reactor than would otherwise be the case. 
In many industrial reactors, flow distributions do not necessarily approximate to either one of the two idealised 
models (PFR or CSTR). However, such reactors can sometimes be modelled by borrowing elements from 
both. For example, simple fluidised-bed reactor models borrow from the CSTR model for the emulsion phase 
and from PFRs for the bubble phase. 
5.2  Discussing the plug flow assumption 
Radial velocity profiles: The plug flow assumption implies that all fluid elements move through the 
reactor at the same velocity. All fluid elements are therefore assumed to have the same residence time (W) in 
the reactor. In reality, when fluids flow through pipes, radial velocity profiles range from parabolic (in laminar 
flow) to a flatter profile for turbulent flow. The distribution of velocities causes different fluid elements to 
travel through the reactor at different residence times, leading to a distribution. The plug flow assumption 
entirely ignores these velocity profiles. Nevertheless, in many instances, the PFA may be used with small 
corrections or modifications, particularly when length/diameter rations are large.  
Radial temperature profiles: Since reaction rates are very sensitive to the temperature, the plug flow 
assumption (PFA) breaks down completely, if radial temperature gradients are set up during the operation of a 
tubular reactor. It is then no longer possible to assume that “concentrations and reaction rates are uniform 
everywhere within the plug of fluid”. In such cases, deviations from the PFA are great and use of the PFA is 
no longer tenable. In such cases, two dimensional reactor models, taking account of radial variations, must be 
used.
In themselves, axial temperature gradients do not violate the plug flow assumption, although it is usually 
difficult to retain the plug flow assumptions in the relatively realistic modelling of non-isothermal reactors. 
Possible cases where the PFA may be retained are (a) when the reactor diameter is small enough that radial 
gradients may be neglected or (b) adiabatic reactors, in cases where radial velocity profiles do not necessarily 
give rise to radial temperature gradients. In any case, caution is advised before plug flow assumptions are 
retained for non-isothermal reactors.

Effect of Flow Patterns on Conversion
5.3  Defining residence time distributions  
Residence time distributions (RTD) provide a method for evaluating the effect of flow patterns within reactors 
on levels of chemical conversion. This section discusses how residence time distributions can be determined 
and used to estimate reactor performance. Experimentally, the most common way to determine the RTD of a 
reactor is by injecting an inert tracer material into the reactor as a ‘pulse-signal’ or as a “step change” or as 
“periodic-signal”. The concentration of the tracer leaving the reactor can then be measured at the outlet, to 
provide a measurement of the residence time distribution inside the reactor.  
Choosing a tracer is not simple. The tracer should not affect the flow and should be inert but totally miscible 
within the reaction mixture. Typical materials used as tracers include dyes in organic solutions, which are 
distinguishable by visible colour or by UV-absorption, salt solutions, distinguishable by electrical conductivity 
in aqueous streams or radioactive materials such as 14C-tagged compounds. Helium has been used as tracer for 
the gas stream in a catalytic cracking plant of an oil refinery. During the same batch of experiments, 
radioactive tracers were used for the catalyst flowing from the reactor to the generator and back again. 
Radioactive tracers would now be considered a safety hazard and be no longer acceptable.  
5.3.1 RTD in an ideal CSTR [Metcalfe 1997] 
“Total and instantaneous stirring” in a CSTR implies that as soon as a fluid element (or pulse of tracer) is 
injected into the reactor, we expect it to distribute itself uniformly throughout the reaction zone. In “ideal” 
CSTRs, the exit stream is assumed to have the same composition as the reaction mixture within the reaction 
zone. It follows that the exit stream will have the highest possible concentration of material from the tagged 
fluid element (or pulse of tracer) at the outset of the experiment (i.e. t = 0). Thereafter, the tracer concentration 
in the main reactor would be diluted with the inlet stream and the concentration of tracer in the exit stream 
would be expected to gradually decay to zero.
Consider N moles of tracer introduced as a pulse into the reactor inlet at time, t = 0.  The perfect (‘total and 
instantaneous’) mixing assumption requires that at t = 0, the tracer should be uniformly distributed inside the 
reactor. The initial concentration of tracer at t = 0 is given by

5.3.2 The ideal PFR [Metcalfe 1997]
The plug flow assumption requires that a fluid element, or a pulse of tracer, entering the reactor at time t=0,
exit from the reactor at exactly t= W  (=VR/vT). This corresponds to a pulse of tracer, which is introduced during 
an infinitesimally short time (‘instantaneously’) and does not mix with fluid elements running ahead or behind 
it, within the reactor.

where ‘a’ is any constant. 
In actual tubular reactors, not all fluid elements travel at the same speed. This is due to a number of factors. In 
the case of laminar flow, the parabolic velocity distribution causes dispersion around the spike shown in 
Figure 5.4. In turbulent flow, a narrower velocity distribution also causes dispersion around the average 
residence time. Tracer mass exchange with stagnant pockets also tends to broaden the residence time 
distribution. In packed beds, the fluid holdup causes a delay for some of the fluid elements. Mass transfer 
between stagnant pockets and the main flow stream contributes to dispersion. Straightforward diffusion 
between ‘plugs’ of fluid also contributes to the broadening of the residence time distribution. 
Calculation of average residence times ( W ): In complicated reactor systems, where modelling the 
residence time distribution can be difficult (and possibly inaccurate), the RTD can always be measured 
experimentally. Once we derive the RTD theoretically or determine it experimentally, the average residence 
time for any system may be calculated from:

Mathematically, this is defined as “the first moment of the distribution”. The average residence time is simply 
the individual residence time for each fluid element multiplied by the fraction of the total amount of dye 
present in that element, summed over all elements. For an ‘ideal’ CSTR:

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-I
CHAPTER 6 
THE DESIGN OF FIXED BED CATALYTIC REACTORS-I 
 
 
6.1 Introduction 
 
Catalysts are used for increasing the speed or altering the course of chemical reactions. To slow down a rate of 
reaction, what we use is called an “inhibitor”. Ideally, a catalyst remains unchanged, whilst enhancing the 
speed of a chemical reaction. In practice, however, catalysts may be altered by “poisoning”, which is the 
strong chemical adsorption of species that block active sites. Catalysts may also be altered physically, by 
“sintering”, which causes loss of surface area within the porous structure. Catalysts may also be deactivated 
by “fouling”, that is by depositing semi-inert (e.g. carbonaceous) solids on active sites.  
 
The useful lives of catalysts are determined by the intensity of these effects. A naphtha hydro-
desulphurization catalyst, commonly used in oil refineries, may retain sufficient activity to be kept on line for 
months or, at times, for one or several years. Meanwhile, fouling in fluid catalytic crackers is rapid and the 
catalyst would need to be regenerated on a time scale of usually less than a minute. 
 
Catalysts are used to increase the rate of a reaction by providing reaction pathways with 
lower energies of activation. In the context of multiple reactions, enhancing some 
pathways over others is capable of altering the overall selectivity of the process. 
 
Many common catalysts consist of an active component (e.g. nickel oxide) that is impregnated onto a porous 
matrix such as alumina or silica. The internal (pore) surface area of such catalysts is far greater than the 
external surface area. For example, ordinary non-porous sand may have a surface area of 1 m2/gm, whereas 
typical catalysts would have surface areas in the range of 50 – 300 m2/gm. Some specialized active carbons 
have surface areas as high as 1,000 m2/gm.  
 
It is important that reactants are able to diffuse into catalyst pores and products diffuse back out again. As the 
effective diffusivity of many species in catalyst pores is low, catalyst pellets are usually quite small. 
Characteristic dimensions are of the order of millimetres or, rarely, up to 1 cm in diameter. Most pellets are 
prepared in the form of cylindrical or spherical pellets, due to the relative ease of extrusion; however, the 
pellets may adopt any shape at all.  
 
A fixed bed catalytic reactor (FBCR) is commonly a tubular reactor packed with catalyst pellets. For reaction 
to take place, reactants must diffuse from the stream of fluid flowing through the reactor, towards the catalyst 
pellets. Reaction takes place, mostly on internal (pore) surfaces. Product molecules diffuse back into the bulk 
fluid stream. In any given volume element of the reactor, therefore, there are concentration gradients that drive 
reactants towards catalyst pellet surfaces and similarly move products away from catalyst pellets. In 
calculating – or deriving expressions for – the overall reaction rate, these concentration driving forces and 
diffusion resistances must be taken into account, alongside the intrisic (i.e. surface) reaction rate.  
 
In this Chapter, we will first discuss the design of isothermal fixed bed catalytic reactors (FBCR). As a flow 
model, “plug flow” may still apply in designing FBCRs, if we can reasonably assume that we have radially 
uniform temperature and concentration profiles.  
The rate expressions for catalytic reactions can still be expressed in terms of “kmol/(time u volume)”. 
However, what we are really interested in is the volume filled with catalyst and more specifically the actual 
amount of catalyst used in the reactor. The catalyst packing density is usually known and the rate expression 
can be, and usually is, recast in terms of

The major difference between isothermal homogeneous reactors and isothermal packed catalytic reactors is 
that concentrations may vary between the bulk of the fluid stream and external catalyst particle surfaces. 
Concentrations may also vary within catalyst pellets, often continuously, giving rise to intra-pellet 
concentration gradients. Unlike homogeneous reactors, therefore, we can no longer assume that concentrations 
are uniform within small volume elements. Instead we need new ways of developing mass balance equations.  
 
The use of catalysts to enhance reversible reactions does not affect or shift the 
equilibrium point. It simply enables approaching equilibrium more rapidly. 
6.2 Mass transport between the bulk fluid phase and external catalyst 
surfaces in isothermal reactors [Smith, 1981]
 
In a FBCR, the “bulk” stream of reactant-bearing fluid moves from inlet to exit, through a matrix of packed 
catalyst. In order to model mass transport processes around a catalyst pellet, we assume the pellet to be 
surrounded by a stagnant film of gas (or liquid). Initially, we will assume the catalyst pellet to be isothermal.

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-I
Transport resistances may give rise to appreciable differences in concentration between the bulk fluid stream 
and catalyst particle surfaces. These gradients usually result from continuous changes. However, defining a 
stagnant film enables assigning the concentration differences to a specific location.  
 
We postulate the following steps for an isothermal chemical reaction occurring in the presence of a catalyst 
pellet. In Table 1, Steps 3,4 and 5 (above) are usually lumped together as the surface reaction rate (rsurface) or 
the intrinsic reaction rate. This is to be distinguished from the rate of reaction at external pellet conditions, 
sr (the intrinsic reaction rate at external surface conditions). The two are not always equal.  
 
Step 1 
Diffusion of reactants from the bulk fluid stream, through the stagnant film, to external surfaces of 
the pellet. 
Step 2 
Transport of reactants from external pellet surfaces to the interior of the catalyst pellet by pore 
diffusion.
Step 3 
Adsorption of reactants onto active sites within the pores of the catalyst pellet. 
Step 4 
Chemical reaction on internal pellet surfaces, between adsorbed molecules or between adsorbed 
molecules and molecules in the gas phase. Surface migration (surface diffusion) is possible but 
usually difficult to characterize.  
Step 5 
Desorption of products from internal catalyst pellet surfaces
Step 6 
Outward pore diffusion of products from the interior of catalyst pellet to external pellet surfaces. 
Step 7 
Film diffusion of products from external surfaces of the pellet to the flowing bulk fluid stream.

methods for estimating mass transfer coefficients from existing correlations. 
 
When a sequence of events takes place in several successive steps, the overall process 
can proceed no faster than the rate of the slowest step. At steady state, the rate of each of 
the seven steps will be equal to each other. If the slowest step is very much slower than the 
rest, it is called the “rate limiting step”; its rate determines the overall rate. 
 
 
6.3  Defining effectiveness factors – for isothermal pellets [Smith, 1981] 
 
Figure 6.1 shows the concentration profile within the catalyst pellet,
, in schematic form. As reactants 
diffuse towards the centre of the pellet, they are gradually consumed and their concentrations decrease. The 
reaction rate within the pellet is, therefore, not uniform; it is a function of position.

The rate of chemical reaction per pellet is needed in order to integrate over the reactor; this enables calculating 
the reactor volume and the conversion. However, when we try to calculate the rate of chemical reaction per 
pellet, the distribution of reaction rates over the pellet radius gives rise to mathematical complications. To 
simplify the problem, we define an “effectiveness factor”, as a global measure of intra-particle diffusion 
resistance within the pellet.

In Equation 6.4, pr is defined as the “global” reaction rate; it is the rate per unit mass of pellet. sr is the rate of 
reaction rate evaluated at external pellet surface conditions. These definitions allow us to express the rate per 
pellet in terms of external pellet surface conditions and an effectiveness factor.

Later on in this chapter, we will introduce methods for deriving expressions for calculating effectiveness 
factors. We will also show how external pellet surface conditions can be expressed in terms of bulk fluid 
stream conditions. Combined with the effectiveness factor, this information will enable deriving expressions 
for the overall chemical reaction rate per pellet, pr , in terms of local bulk stream conditions. The global rate 
can then be integrated over the whole reactor, to calculate the total conversion in the reactor, or (given the 
conversion) the reactor volume. 
 
More formally, the effectiveness factor is defined in the form of an integral over the particle volume, of the 
ratio of the real reaction rate over the rate of reaction at surface conditions.

not the surface concentration of reactant, in the sense of being the concentration of an adsorbed species. Also 
note that while we have initially assumed isothermal behaviour, the implicit dependence of k on the 
temperature is clear. 
 
At steady state, the overall rate of reaction, pr , is equal to the net flux of reactant reaching the pellet surface. 
In other words, at steady state,

6.3.2  How does rA,p fit into the overall design problem?
 
In Chapter 1, we derived the isothermal mass balance (design) equation for a homogeneous reaction, assuming 
plug flow in a tubular reactor.

When the reactor is packed with catalyst and plug flow is assumed, we can use a modified form of this 
equation. In designing a catalytic reactor, we keep track of the catalyst packed volume, or the total weight of 
catalyst, and not the total volume of the reactor. This last statement assumes that no homogeneous reaction is 
taking place in the unpacked spaces of the reactor. It is usually a good working assumption, although there are 
exceptions. The volume of catalyst packed reactor is directly related to the weight of catalyst through the 
relationship:

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-I
 
Eqs. 6.19 and 6.20 implicitly ignore the presence of catalyst pellets  as discreet particles. It 
assumes that reaction intensity is uniform within particular volume elements. Thus, it is 
implicitly assumed that the reaction takes place in “pseudo-homogeneous” mode. This is a 
simplifying assumption.

Figure 6.3 (a) When the process is controlled kinetically, i.e. when reaction is slower than diffusion, the 
concentration gradient across the external stagnant film tends to flatten. (b) When external diffusion is slower 
than chemical reaction, a concentration gradient is set up across the stagnant film. This is called external 
diffusion control. 
 
Resistance to mass transfer within a porous catalyst matrix is normally greater than diffusion resistance 
through the stagnant film, which is a gaseous (or liquid) medium. When diffusion from the bulk fluid to the 
external catalyst surface is limiting, the stagnant film concept would have all external resistance to diffusion 
concentrated in the stagnant film. If external diffusion is limiting, intra-particle diffusion would also be slow 
and provide the limiting step, in respect of the overall reaction rate. In these cases, the designer must take both 
external and internal diffusion resistances into account. The possibility of a system where external diffusion is 
controlling, in coexistence with negligible “internal” diffusion resistance (i.e. an effectiveness factor K # 1) 
may be discounted. Note that the algebra of the equation

gets progressively more complicated as the reaction rate expressions get more realistic. 
 
In order to relate the isothermal effectiveness factor to the overall reactor design 
problem,
1. We equate net mass transfer to/from the catalyst pellet with the amount of 
    reaction taking place within the pellet  
2. Express the result in terms of the bulk concentration(s) of reactant(s) 
3. Use a flow model (e.g. plug flow) to integrate over the whole reactor 
 
 
 
 
6.3.3 What happens if we ignore external diffusion resistances?
Activation energies of chemical reactions are usually larger than activation energies for diffusive processes, 
often by a factor of four or more. Reaction rate constants are normally exponentially dependent on the 
temperature. Compared to reaction rate constants, mass transfer coefficients (km) are less sensitive to changes 
in temperature; often they turn out to be approximately linearly dependent on the temperature.  
 
If resistance to diffusion between the bulk stream and external particles surfaces is (wrongly) neglected, the 
calculated activation energy for the lumped reaction-diffusion process would inevitably not solely reflect the 
activation energy of the chemical reaction. If the measured kinetic constant also contains a diffusional 
contribution, and this was overlooked, what we would in effect be doing is lumping together two contributions 
with differing activation energies. In other words, we would write the rate expression as

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-I
If external transport is thus erroneously ignored, the log k versus 1/T plot does not give a straight line. The 
slope begins to diminish and the line bends at higher temperatures, where the overall rate is increasingly 
controlled by the rate of diffusion.  
6.4 Isothermal effectiveness factors [Smith, 1981; Froment & Bischoff, 1990] 
Catalyst pellets may be prepared in any shape or size. The mathematical expressions derived for effectiveness 
factors depend on the geometry of the pellet. In this section, we will show how such expressions are derived 
for the effectiveness factor of a “flat-plate” catalyst pellet in detail. The more common derivation for spherical 
pellets is found in most textbooks; that derivation will also be summarized. 
6.4.1 The isothermal effectiveness factor for a flat-plate catalyst pellet 
Consider the chemical reaction

 taking place within a "flat slab" catalyst pellet with intrinsic 
reaction rate rA = k CA. We will assume (i) ideal gas behaviour, (ii) a two-component (i.e. binary) system and 
(iii) equimolar counter diffusion, where the molar flux of component “A” is denoted by NA. Fick’s law of 
diffusion is then given by:

where De denotes the effective diffusivity of the reactant A through the porous matrix. In the following 
derivation, we postulate a “no flux” boundary condition. This is used to express axial symmetry; i.e. the other 
side of the boundary would show the mirror image of the concentration profile.

We assume the surface area of the flat plate “D”, normal to the plane of diffusion, to be large, so that edge 
effects do not affect the material balance.

We perform a mass balance over the volume element “D 'z”. Note that CA is the concentration of reactant 
“A” in the gas layer near the internal catalyst pellet surfaces; it is not the surface concentration of reactant, in 
the sense of adsorbed species. We may view CA as an “in flight” concentration. At steady state, the material

Table 2. Effectiveness factors and Thiele moduli for three catalyst pellet geometries 
 
 
For non-zero order reactions in isothermal pellets, examination of the forms of K in Table 2 shows that the 
value of the effectiveness factor changes between zero and unity. 
                                                                          0 d K d 1                                                                       (Eq. 6.53) 
In all three cases (Table 2), the Thiele modulus turns out to be proportional to 
; the ratio of reaction 
rate constant over the effective diffusivity is repeated. When De >>k, diffusive processes are far faster than 
the rate at which reactant is being consumed by the reaction. When reaction processes are much slower than 
diffusive processes, the process is said to be “kinetically controlled”. For an isothermal pellet, this is the case 
where 
is small and K tends to unity (K | 1). In this case, we expect to observe reactant concentrations and 
reaction rates to be relatively uniform over the pellet radius and close to values observed at external particle 
surfaces.

e
k / D
)
 
Conversely, when k >> De, ) tends to large values and K becomes much smaller than unity (K << 1). When 
reaction processes are much faster than diffusive processes, the process is said to be “diffusion controlled”. 
This is the case when reactive processes are far faster than rates at which diffusive processes can replenish the 
supply of reactant. In this case, much of the reactant is consumed, immediately it contacts the catalyst pellet. 
Most reaction takes place, therefore, near the periphery of  the catalyst pellet. Concentration gradients within 
the pellet are sharp, and most reactant molecules are consumed near the periphery of the pellet.  
 
 
For isothermal pellets and non-zero order chemical reaction, K varies between zero and unity (0 d Kd 1). 
When De >> k then
has small values and K tends to 1; the process is kinetically controlled (i.e. no diffusion limitation). 
)
When k >> De then
 takes on large values and K tends to zero; the process is then said to be diffusion-controlled. 
)
 
When the temperature of an (isothermal) catalyst pellet rises, we expect the intrinsic reaction rate at external 
surface temperatures (rs = k Cs) to increase. We have seen in Table 2 that the effectiveness factor for any 
geometry is proportional to>
. Since k rises exponentially with the temperature but De increases more 
slowly, an increase in temperature signals an increase in the Thiele modulus (irrespective of catalyst 
geometry) and a corresponding decrease in the effectiveness factor (see Figure 6.5). The global rate of 
reaction, rp, would also be expected to increase with the rising temperature but less rapidly than rs, since 
rp=(Kp)u(rsn) with increasing temperature.

For similar values of the Thiele modulus, the values of K based on different geometries are quite close. This

Can we make the three curves coincide by making an appropriate change of variable? This would be useful, 
when we tackle catalyst pellets of other geometries, in particular when dealing with awkward catalyst 
geometries, such as randomly shaped (e.g. crushed) pellets. We would also like to handle different and in 
particular awkward reaction rate orders and expressions with the same approach.

Figure 6.8 Isothermal effectiveness factor for three geometries plotted against the generalized Thiele 
modulus. The dots indicate some of the empirical findings. Note that the scatter is of the same order of 
magnitude as the divergence between the lines. 
 
 
When the speed of the reaction is significantly greater than the speed of diffusion within a catalyst pellet,  
k > De, and the Thiele Modulus is large (> 5-10), the effectiveness factor can be approximated by, K # (1/)). 
 
This treatment was formulated only for first order reaction rate orders. The difference between values of K for 
different pellet shapes is larger in the intermediate zone 
 for non-first order reactions and particularly 
with Langmuir-Hinshelwood type reaction rate equations.

6.5 Effectiveness factors for reaction rate orders other than unity
         [Froment & Bischoff, 1990] 
 
One way to deal with non-first order reaction rate expressions is to run through similar sets of derivations each 
time. In other words, we would solve differential equations analogous to Eqs. 6.30 and 6.31 for each case. To 
simplify matters, we will show, instead, how a generalized or normalized modulus can be defined, which 
attempts to account for all non-first order cases.  
 
We have already seen that different pellet geometries can be handled by defining a new modulus:

6.6 Criteria for determining the significance of intra-particle diffusion 
  
resistances [Froment & Bischoff]
When the reaction rate constant is (or constants are) not known from laboratory kinetic experiments, 
cannot 
be calculated. Developing criteria, therefore, for the significance of pore diffusion limitations independent of 
reaction rate constants would be useful. One simple test involves performing experiments with two sizes of 
catalysts. Using Eq. 6.74 and assuming that k and De are similar for the two cases and that Z=VP/Sx, we get

Note that De may not be the same for the two cases, if he smaller pellet is made by cutting a larger one, as it 
usually is. The reason for this difference is that most pellets are prepared by impregnation of the active 
material. For large pellets the process is not necessarily uniform over the pellet radius. Ignoring this potential 
mishap for the time being and using Eq. 6.4 (i.e. that

6.7 Simultaneous mass & energy transport from the bulk fluid phase to 
external catalyst surfaces [Smith, 1981; Froment & Bischoff, 1990] 
 
Let us now examine situations where we have temperature as well as concentration gradients between the bulk 
stream and pellet surfaces. We will also examine the case of non-isothermal catalyst pellets. In what follows, 
we will define the temperature and concentration gradients between the bulk fluid phase and external catalyst 
pellet surfaces as 'TEXT and 'CEXT. If these gradients are significant, equations describing external and intra-
pellet transport rates will be coupled and solved together.  
 
We will also assume that the external surface of a catalyst pellet is uniformly accessible to heat and mass 
transport, to and from the bulk fluid phase. Strictly – no real system totally conforms to the assumption of 
uniform accessibility, but this assumption considerably simplifies the problem at hand. We will also assume 
that the thickness of the concentration and thermal boundary layers have constant values over the entire 
catalyst pellet surface. In such a system, the transport behaviour determined in the absence of chemical

Eq. 6.96 can be used for an initial estimate of whether the external temperature gradient around the pellet 
is significant. If the pellet surface temperature is greater (or smaller) than the bulk temperature by 5-8 °C 
or more, it is necessary to use the pellet temperature (and not the bulk temperature, which is easier to 
measure) in calculating reaction rates.

If the mass flow rate, G, is low, it would cause the mass transfer coefficient, km , to be relatively small, which

In laboratory experiments designed for measuring kinetic constants, it is essential for the data be independent 
of external diffusional resistances. (Internal diffusion resistances are minimized by using the smallest possible 
pellet size.) This requires Cb a Cs at the highest temperature of the range where the kinetic constant is required. 
One way of realizing such conditions is to keep the mass flow rate, G, large. This causes turbulence in the 
system, enhancing mass transfer to and from catalyst surfaces.

The (Cb a Cs) condition must be achieved at the highest temperature because, as the temperature is increased, 
the rate of reaction increases faster than the rate of diffusion. That is why diffusional control usually kicks in 
at higher temperatures. If diffusional resistances are negligible at the highest operating temperature, they 
would be even less severe at lower temperatures. 
 
If (Cb a Cs) is achieved at the highest experimental temperature, then 
measurements of the kinetic constants may be considered independent of 
external diffusional resistances over the whole of the temperature range.

The two differential equations (Eqs. 6.100 and 6.102) must be solved numerically. We will illustrate the

The solution of the system of equations shows contours [cf. Smith, 1981, p. 502, Fig. 11-13] for the 
effectiveness factor for a non-isothermal pellet plotted against the modified Thiele modulus, for a range of 
values of E and J = 20. Clearly, E = 0 traces the line for an isothermal pellet; values of E < 0 trace contours for 
endothermic reactions.  
The contours indicate that the value of K no longer ranges simply between zero and unity. During exothermic 
reactions, heat generated inside the pellet may give rise temperature increases inside the pellet; thermal 
conduction rates are never instantaneous, so temperatures may rise compared to the surface. Values of K >1 
represent higher rates of reaction inside the pellet compared to the surface. Since reactant concentrations are 
higher at the surface of the pellet, K >1 arises due to higher temperatures boosting the rate inside the pellet. 
Large increases in internal temperatures due to highly exothermic reactions may cause deactivation by 
sintering; they may also give rise to undesired side reactions which would reduce selectivity. 
The contours also show that for certain values of the parameters, three possible values of K can be calculated; 
in other words, multiple solutions are possible due to the non-linear heat generation curve. Only the highest

. For many industrial applications E is a small number; typically E  0.1. Since the thermal 
conductivities of solids, including porous solid matrices are high, for standard catalysts at steady state 
conditions, 'Tmax in catalyst pellets is usually not very large. Usually external heat and mass transfer 
resistances have a more significant effect on reaction rates. The multiple steady-state behaviour deduced from 
the calculations is therefore not likely to be observed in common catalytic reactions.  
 
For highly exothermic reactions such as hydrogenation, however, 'Tmax may be quite significant. In one 
example, the hydrogenation of benzene, which has a heat of reaction of about  210 kJ mol-1 gives rise to a 
maximum temperature rise of about 35 °C from the centre to the surface of the pellet. This is a gradient that 
would affect the reaction rate quite significantly, without giving rise to pellet instability.

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-II
CHAPTER 7 
THE DESIGN OF FIXED BED CATALYTIC REACTORS-II 
 
7.1 Introduction 
 
In Chapters 1 and 3, we derived the material and energy balances, respectively, for homogeneous reactions 
taking place in tubular reactors.

                                       (Eq. 3.47) 
To derive these equations, (i) plug flow was assumed, (ii) changes in kinetic and potential energy and shaft 
work were neglected, and, (iii) the enthalpies of mixing and the effect of pressure changes on the enthalpy 
were also neglected. Qualitative temperature and concentration profiles in isothermal, adiabatic and “non-
adiabatic/non-isothermal” tubular reactors have been presented in Figure 3.9. 
 
For fixed bed catalytic reactors (FBCRs), the mass balance equation takes the form

where rp is the global rate of reaction of reactant “A” per unit mass of catalyst, with units of

When the pressure drop across the catalyst bed is significant (e.g. ~10 % of total pressure), 'p needs to be 
taken into account. In that case, the position variable is usually defined as the distance from the inlet rather 
than the reactor volume or catalyst bed volume. We will see below how we can account for changes in 
pressure along the length of the reactor.  
 
7.1.1 Energy balance equation for FBCR
         [Denbigh & Turner, 1984; Froment & Bischoff, 1990]

 the average heat capacity of component “i” over the relevant 
temperature range. We also saw in Chapter 3 that we can usually simplify the energy balance equation by 
assuming that the total heat capacity of the reacting mixture is approximately constant, i.e. that it is a weak 
function of the conversion. For simplicity, we can assume the total heat capacity over the relevant conversion 
interval to be approximately constant:

                               (Eq. 7.4)
In this equation Q takes on the units: 
. For adiabatic operation, Q = 0. When the 
reaction is exothermic, it is often necessary to remove heat. In Chapter 3 we saw that heat can be removed 
from the reaction mixture by inter-stage cooling and that the temperature rise may be controlled by means of 
cold-shot cooling. Another common way is to remove heat through the external walls of the tubular reactor. 
The temperature rise may also be controlled by adding an inert diluent, such as nitrogen or steam, to the 
reaction stream to serve as a heat sink. Conversely the diluent may be used as a source of heat in endothermic 
reactions. To control the temperature rise during highly exothermic reactions, e.g. the oxidation of SO2, or the 
partial oxidation of phthalic anhydride, reactor tubes are designed with relatively small diameters (2 – 5 cm).

7.1.3 The pressure drop (momentum balance) equation: Formally, this is where a momentum 
balance would fit into the set of equations describing the reactor. For packed beds, in practice, semi-empirical 
equations are used to calculate the pressure drop 'p. If the pressure drop is relatively small, a mean value for 
the total pressure is used in calculations. 
 
To calculate the pressure drop, we will introduce the Ergun equation here which has two terms corresponding 
to slow and fast flow. There are many equations which can be used for estimating pressure drops in packed 
beds. For a packed bed with void fraction H, the Ergun equation may be written as

SUMMARY: Equations 7.4, 7.6 and 7.7 describe a 1-dimensional reactor model, where we account for 
temperature and concentration changes in a single (axial) dimension. The model implicitly assumes plug 
flow: radial temperature and concentration gradients have been neglected. For adiabatic reactors, Q=0. 
When Q z 0, the reactor is said to operate in “non-isothermal/non-adiabatic” (NI-NA) mode. To take radial 
temperature and concentration gradients into account, we need to consider the radius as a second 
independent variable, in addition to axial distance from the reactor inlet. The material and energy balances 
then become partial differential equations.

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-II
When a reactor operates in “non-isothermal/non-adiabatic” (NI-NA) mode and heat is removed from the 
walls, it is almost impossible to suppress radial temperature gradients. In these cases, setting up 1-dimensional 
(i.e. plug flow) models may still provide a useful first approximation to modeling more complicated reactors. 
In these cases, the temperature gradient is assumed to be concentrated in a thin film near the outside edge of 
the catalyst bed.

This equation gives the rate per unit mass of catalyst, or in the case of rV the rate per reactor volume. It does 
not account for the presence of discreet catalyst particles as a separate domain, with its own boundary 
conditions etc. In fact the model equations are analogous to those of a homogeneous model. The set of 
equations [6.11, 7.14, 7.16 and 7.17] is said to describe a “pseudo-homogeneous reactor model”. We will next 
describe more complex reactor models formulated using the same “pseudo-homogeneous” behaviour 
assumption for FBCR models. “Heterogeneous” models for FBCR design are beyond the scope of this text.

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-II
 
Table 7.1 summarizes some of the basic types of FBCR models that can be formulated, depending on the 
phenomena included in the calculations. In general, it may appear tempting to formulate models that take into 
account all the multiple phenomena we are aware of. However, some of these may not affect the behaviour of 
the reactor significantly; axial mass dispersion is usually one such effect. Others, such as radial mass 
dispersion in contexts where radial temperature gradients are significant, may play a crucial role in estimating 
conversions in the reactor. However, in all cases, care must be taken to quantify the considered effect with a 
level of accuracy that would help in arriving at a more realistic result. If we are unable to quantify a certain 
effect, we may still keep it in our model, for sensitivity analysis. Let us briefly review the meaning of each 
element in Column I of Table 7.1.

7.3 Elements of Column I in Table 7.1
Each of the listed elements refers to a phenomenon that might be significant for predicting/estimating the 
performance of the reactor. 
 
Heat removal from the wall: An important parameter in non-isothermal, non-adiabatic reactors. When 
modeling 1-dimensional NI-NA reactors, radial temperature uniformity must be assumed. In these cases, as 
indicated in Figure 1, an average reactor temperature is assumed and the remaining temperature variation is 
ascribed to the heat transfer boundary. 
Axial heat flow: As may be inferred from Eq. 7.4, this term refers to heat axially transported by the flowing 
reaction mixture. It does not refer to heat conduction due to the axial temperature gradient, which is a second 
order effect. If included, the latter effect would be expressed in terms of Fourier’s law of heat conduction. 
 
Radial heat conduction: Is relevant to 2(or more)-dimensional models, which we will briefly introduce 
below. It’s inclusion serves to even out radial temperature gradients. Neglecting this effect would lead to the 
overestimation of radial temperature gradients, which may distort reaction rates, particularly for highly 
exothermic reactions. 
 
The axial pressure drop, 'P: High pressures are normally used in chemical reactors to enhancing the 
reactivity of gaseous reactants, by increasing the concentration driving force. When the packed catalyst bed is 
long or pellet sizes are small, the pressure drop across segments of the reactor bed may be significant. This has 
the effect of changing the reaction rate. To a first approximation, 'P may be calculated using the Ergun 
equation (Eq. 7.7) or similar semi-empirical equations. 
 
Axial mass dispersion: This term refers to diffusion of reactant, caused by axial concentration gradients. 
Strictly, this effect violates the plug flow assumption, although, the magnitude of the effect is minor. We 
usually expect reactor sizing calculations to be thrown off target by probably less than 10 %. Effects relating 
to inaccuracies in the kinetic constants would have a more important effect. In reactor modeling, this effect 
would be characterized by Fick’s law type terms and an effective diffusivity which is determined empirically.  
 
Radial mass dispersion: This effect is relevant to 2(or more)-dimensional models, which we will briefly 
introduce below. Its inclusion serves to even out radial concentration gradients, which become significant 
when temperature inequalities along the radius give rise to faster depletion of reactants in high temperature 
zones. Neglecting this effect would lead to the underestimation of reaction rates in hotter zones, since radial 
mass dispersion helps replenish reactant by diffusion from cooler zones with higher reactant concentrations. 
 
As an example of how we can relate to Table 7.1, let us have a brief look at the set of equations we derived 
above for a non-isothermal reactor: Eq. 7.4 (energy balance), Eq. 7.6 (mass balance) and Eq. 7.7 (momentum 
balance – pressure drop). Within the framework of Table 7.1, this reactor model would be classed as either 4C 
or 4E, depending on whether Q is assumed to be zero (adiabatic) or non-zero (NI-NA).  
 
Taking account of axial mass dispersion, the mass balance equation for a 1-dimensional reactor, may be 
written as:

where 
is defined as the effective axial diffusivity of the reactant in the packed bed. Eq. 7.8 reduces to Eq. 
7.6, if the superficial velocity “u” is assumed to be constant and axial dispersion is neglected (i.e. 
=0). In 
terms of the matrix shown in Table 7.1, Eq. 7.8 corresponds to the mass balance equation of (i) 5A if the 
reactor is isothermal, (ii) 5C if the reactor is adiabatic, and, (iii) 5E, if the reactor is NI-NA.

7.4 
Two-dimensional FBCR models 
So far we have only considered 1-dimensional FBCR models, where the only independent variable considered 
is the axial distance from the reactor inlet. With a single independent variable, the resulting material and 
energy balances are ordinary differential equations. In order to take radial temperature and concentration 
gradients into account, we would need to consider the radius as a second independent variable.  This leads to 
the formulation of partial differential equations.  
 
1-dimensional NI-NA reactor models require considerably less numerical effort compared to 2-dimensional 
models. As we have seen, however, once heat removal from the reactor wall is introduced, we have to make 
some rather crude approximations regarding the radial temperature profile, in order to use 1-dimensional 
models. In highly exothermic reactions such as partial oxidation of hydrocarbons or the oxidation of SO2, 
where wall cooling is used, radial temperature and concentration gradients cannot be ignored. 
 
As a relatively extreme but relevant example, during the oxidation of SO2 (to SO3 – to eventually make 
sulphuric acid) a central hot-spot temperature in the catalyst bed was observed as 520 qC whilst the reactor 
wall was maintained at 197 qC. For a quick calculation, taking 500 qC as the hot spot temperature and the 
energy of activation Ea as 
J kmol-1, the ratio of the reaction rate constants at the two temperatures is 
calculated as

7.4.1 Co-ordinate system for 2-dimensional FBCRs  
 
When radial temperature and or concentration gradients significantly affect FBCR reactor behaviour, we 
normally assume axial symmetry, and use a 2-dimensional coordinate system.

Inclusion of radial heat and mass transfer phenomena in the calculations requires us to define effective radial 
thermal conductivity and radial diffusivity coefficients: Oe,r and De,r. The use of the term “effective” here 
means that the coefficients are not inherent properties of the fluids flowing through the reactor. Instead, they 
characterize the effect (i.e. heat or mass transfer) that arises from the combination of the fluid and the porous 
catalyst bed built up of stacked pellets. Clearly, using erroneous values of these coefficients would lead us to 
error. Thus, the inclusion of additional phenomena into our model requires that we know the values of the 
coefficients that characterize these phenomena to a degree of accuracy that would allow us to simulate reactor 
behaviour to a level that constitutes an improvement compared to entirely ignoring the phenomenon.

Note that in Eq. 7.10, the concentration CA(z,r) is a function of radius as well as axial distance from the reactor 
inlet. However, in this formulation, the axial superficial velocity is a function of axial distance only: u=u(z). 
Together with its boundary conditions (not discussed), this form of the material balance equation may be 
formulated for an isothermal reactor, and would represent elements “5,6 – B” in Table 7.1. Alternatively, the 
material balance equation may be coupled with an energy balance equation and solved simultaneously for an 
adiabatic reactor (“5 and 6 – D in Table 7.1) or for a NI-NA reactor (“5 and 6 – F”). Such equation systems 
need to be solved numerically. As an exercise, it may be useful to derive these equations from first principles, 
using the co-ordinate system in Figure 7.2. 
 
It may be noted that radial temperature gradients may occur without necessarily removing heat from the walls. 
This may happen if fluid near the central axis of an adiabatic reactor travels faster than fluid elements nearer 
the wall. Thus, at any reactor cross-section, the residence time of fluid traveling near the central axis would be 
less than material nearer the walls. Less reaction would have occurred in the central region. This means that a 
colder plume could travel down the center of the reactor, setting up radial temperature and concentration 
gradients. Heat would diffuse inwards whilst reactants would diffuse outwards (“3 and 5 – D” in Table 7.1).  
 
7.4.2 Example of full set of equations for a 2-dimensional NI-NA FBCR  
 
For a single reacting component and a single reaction taking place, a NI-NA, 2-dimensional fixed bed 
catalytic reactor, where the effects of axial thermal and energy dispersion are significant (“1,2,3,6-F” in Table 
7.1), the material balance equation can be written as follows:

The Design of Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactors-II
The role of radial mass diffusion in evening out radial concentration and (indirectly) temperature 
gradients has already been outlined. As radial temperature gradients are set up by heat removal from 
the reactor through the reactor walls, we expect faster depletion of reactant in the central higher 
temperature zone of the reactor. Inward radial diffusion is caused by the resulting concentration 
gradient. Axial dispersion effects are less significant and are usually ignored. 
 
Assigning numerical values to effective mass diffusivities and thermal conductivities is an inexact 
science, usually dealt with by means of existing correlations. (cf. textbooks cited in the “References” 
section.)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 
This book grew out of my course notes, which I used in teaching reactor design to chemical engineering 
students at Imperial College London for nearly thirty years. Teaching texts are not like research publications. 
Material borrowed from diverse sources creep into the lectures, almost by stealth. From a distance, it seems 
difficult to acknowledge every source I have used, although I have done my best to acknowledge them all. I 
am indebted to the authors of the books I list in the “References” section below; I have used their work 
gratefully. Let us hope there are not many that I have missed and not honoured as they deserve.
