Reﬂex Control
1.  Mary rose quickly from her bed to answer the door. This change in body 
position resulted in:
A. Increased dilation of peripheral blood vessels
B. Decreased ﬁring of the carotid baroreceptors
C. Increased parasympathetic stimulation of the SA node
D. Unchanged venous return
2. Total peripheral resistance decreases in a runner during strenuous exercise 
due to: 
 
 
A. increased parasympathetic nervous stimulation of the working skeletal 
 
    muscle
 
B. increased vasoconstriction of the large veins of the body
 
C. increased metabolites in the IS surrounding the muscle
3. If two liters of blood are lost from the body, arterial hypotension occurs. This 
can lead to the movement of ﬂuid from the tissues into the capillaries in 
response to: 
A. Higher capillary hydrostatic pressure
B. Lower capillary hydrostatic pressure
C. Higher capillary oncotic pressure
D. Lower capillary oncotic pressure
4. Does MAP (increase, decrease or remain unchanged) during anaerobic 
exercise such as weight lifting? 
 
A. Increases 
 
B. Decreases 
 
C. Remains unchanged 

Answer 1: B. Decreased ﬁring of the carotid baroreceptors
Answer 2: C. increased metabolites in the IS surrounding the muscle
Answer 3: B. Lower capillary hydrostatic pressure
Answer 4: A. Increases
