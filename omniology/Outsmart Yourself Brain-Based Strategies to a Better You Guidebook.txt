r. Peter M. Vishton is an 
Associate Professor of 
Psychology at William 
& Mary. He received his B.A. 
in Psychology and Computer 
Science 
from 
Swarthmore 
College in 1991 and his Ph.D. 
in Psychology and Cognitive 
Science from Cornell University in 1996. From 2000 to 2004, Dr. Vishton 
served as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at 
Northwestern University. He also has served as the program director for 
Developmental and Learning Sciences at the National Science Foundation 
and as a consulting editor for the journal Child Development.
Dr. Vishton has published articles in many of the top journals in the field 
of psychology, including Science, Psychological Science, Experimental 
Brain Research, Teaching of Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental 
Child Psychology. He is also the creator of the DVD What Babies Can Do: 
An Activity-Based Guide to Infant Development.
In addition to teaching, Dr. Vishton studies the perception and action 
control of both infants and adults. His interests include cognitive, 
perceptual, and motor development; visually guided action; visual

Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and 
the National Science Foundation.
Dr. Vishton has presented his research at numerous conferences and 
invited talks throughout the United States and Europe. He has found a 
variety of evidence, among both children and adults, that the nature of 
sensory processing is altered by the actions we choose to perform. In 
essence, our intention to act on something changes how we perceive it. 
Dr. Vishton’s ongoing work continues to explore how this aspect of the 
human senses develops and how the motor systems of the brain are 
involved in mediating the areas of the brain involved in perception. 
With The Great Courses, Dr. Vishton has also produced Scientific Secrets 
for a Powerful Memory, Understanding the Secrets of Human Perception, 
and Scientific Secrets for Raising Kids Who Thrive. When he isn’t exploring 
human cognition and action, Dr. Vishton enjoys spending time with his 
family, reading, and distance running. He has completed the Chicago 
Marathon twice and hopes to complete others in the future. ■

Outsmart Yourself:  
Brain-Based Strategies to a 
Better You
Scope
Over the past several decades, cognitive neuroscientists have made 
immense strides in understanding how the human brain is organized and 
how the brain mediates our behaviors. This course describes many of 
these breakthroughs and demonstrates how this knowledge can be used 
to enhance our everyday lives. 
A crucial foundation of this course is the fact that many of our decisions 
and behaviors are controlled by brain systems that function outside our 
conscious awareness. While these systems are tremendously significant 
to our everyday lives, they have many shortcomings. By hacking into 
these unconscious behavioral-control systems, we can change our 
behaviors to produce increased happiness, enhanced well-being, and 
positive outcomes.
For example, if you are eating a snack, most people presume the reason 
is that you consciously decided to eat that snack. However, many 
unconscious factors influence that decision to eat, such as how previous 
eating behaviors have influenced the neural system that controls hunger 
perception. We can consciously decide to eat or not to eat in a particular 
situation, but automatic, underlying brain systems control most of our 
behaviors. 
This course applies the knowledge of cognitive systems to a wide variety 
of topics: procrastination, bad habits, dieting, sleep, phobias, depression,

creativity, multitasking, persuasion techniques, anger, love, happiness, 
and the aging brain.
The human brain is the most impressive information-processing system 
that science has ever encountered. Much of its power comes from the 
brain’s ability to perform many processes simultaneously. As astonishing 
as it is, however, the brain has limits. This course considers one significant 
bottleneck: Your brain can make only one decision at a time. By avoiding 
multitasking and instead creating situations in which you can engage in 
monotasking, you can improve your mental performance tremendously. 
This course explores in depth the brain systems that mediate our 
emotions and considers how you can maintain and improve your close 
relationships to increase the love in your life. In addition, much has been 
learned about how your brain processes anger. By intentionally controlling 
your verbal and physical responses to that anger, you can substantially 
alter the course of your underlying emotional experience. Similarly, a few 
simple strategies can turn fear and anxiety into excitement and openness 
to new experiences. 
The human brain is a physical organ that requires particular care to 
thrive. Sleep and dreaming are critical aspects of that brain-maintenance 
process. This course outlines the details of what your brain accomplishes 
while you are asleep and what happens when you disrupt specific parts of 
that sleep process. This knowledge leads to several easy strategies that 
will improve your memory and creativity and even your happiness. Simple 
meditation and imagery practice can augment these benefits as well.
In addition to considering how you can influence the function of your own 
brain, this course also explains how you can influence the brains of the 
people around you. We present a variety of techniques that can be used to 
persuade other people. In addition to actively using these techniques, you 
should be aware that others will try to use them on you.
This course adopts a skeptical, scientific perspective throughout. Each 
year, the self-help industry produces thousands of books filled with tips

about how to boost your brain performance and achieve happiness. 
However, many of those tips are based on individual, anecdotal 
experiences rather than careful science and empirical evidence. This 
course focuses on proven scientific research and presents results from 
replicated studies. The course also suggests several strategies that 
students should use to become scientists themselves. By collecting data 
on your own experiences, you can more effectively change your behavior, 
influence your own mind, and outsmart yourself.

xperts in cognitive neuroscience and related fields have discovered 
a great deal about what our brains do when we are engaged in 
different types of behaviors. In this course, we explore many 
aspects of human thought and decision making using data and specific 
knowledge of how our brains actually work. In addition to educating you 
about how the human brain works, this course focuses on situations 
where knowledge of the brain can help with specific real-world challenges. 
Certain patterns of brain activity and associated behaviors produce better 
results than others. In these lectures, we focus on identifying these brain-
based opportunities for behaviors with better outcomes.
The Brain


The human brain is a network of about 100 billion interconnected 
neurons. The connections between those neurons—the synapses of 
the brain—number in the trillions. Everything you’ve ever seen, heard, 
thought, or done has emerged from the intricate patterns of chemical 
and electrical activity produced by the brain. 


A commonly repeated assertion is that we only use about 10 percent 
of our brains—an assertion that is almost certainly false. Scientists 
have developed a variety of techniques that are able to recognize and 
record the patterns of activity in the brain. Results of their studies 
demonstrate that even during basic, everyday tasks, nearly the entire 
brain is active. 

	
Lecture 1—Take Control of Your Automatic Brain	
5


While it is clear that humans use far more than 10 percent of the brain, 
there is some truth to the notion that we only understand about 10 
percent of what’s going on in the brain. While cognitive neuroscience 
has learned a great deal about how the brain functions, the brain itself 
remains one of the great mysteries in all of science. 


The past few decades have seen an explosion in our understanding of 
the brain and how it mediates human behavior. Technologies such as 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have made it possible 
to watch the patterns of activation associated with real-time thinking. 
The Intention-Behavior Gap


Brain research has revealed a number of circumstances where 
the most effective strategies of behavior are counterintuitive—that 
is, while conventional wisdom and common sense suggest that 
one type of behavior is the best one to pursue, data from carefully 
conducted brain-based studies suggest that the opposite is actually 
the best way to go. 


An example of a counterintuitive strategy is the following: When you 
set a challenging, long-term goal for yourself, don’t tell anyone about 
it (or tell as few people as possible). The fewer people you tell, the 
greater your chances are of actually achieving that goal. Research 
suggests that telling people about your goal won’t increase the 
chance of succeeding. On the contrary, the more people you tell, the 
less likely that you will succeed.


Peter Gollwitzer and his colleagues have conducted numerous studies 
of goal-directed behavior over the years. In one study, students 
were asked to commit to spending more time studying. In the 
control condition of that study, the students were then released and 
contacted later to assess how much extra studying they actually did. 
In the experimental condition, participants were asked to announce 
their intention to a group of their peers.

The human brain is a 
network of about 100 
billion interconnected 
neurons. The 
connections between 
those neurons—the 
synapses of the brain—
number in the trillions. 

	
Lecture 1—Take Control of Your Automatic Brain	
7


The surprising result was that the participants who made the public 
announcement of their intention were significantly less likely to 
follow through on it. In one particular experiment, they studied for 
significantly fewer hours. 


Researchers describe the difference between people’s plans and 
people’s actions as the intention-behavior gap—the all-too-common 
disparity between what we intend to do and what we actually do. 
Announcing one’s goals seems to widen that gap.
Benjamin Libet


Brain research has determined that we don’t consciously control our 
behaviors as much as we think we do. This is a counterintuitive idea, but 
it’s central to much of modern brain science. While this brain research 
is not proof against the existence of free will, some philosophers do 
question free will based on the results of certain studies. 


Neuroscientist Benjamin Libet published a number of studies 
illuminating our understanding of how the brain functions. For a 
decade, Libet had attempted to understand how the brain produces 
the conscious experience. Libet worked with a large group of patients 
who were undergoing brain surgery. For many brain surgeries, the 
patient remains awake and aware throughout much of the procedure. 


During these procedures, with the permission of the patients, Libet 
would present brief, mild electrical stimulation to particular sensory 
regions. For instance, participants in one study would receive 
stimulation to the somatosensory cortex. This region registers the 
sensation of touch for different regions of the body. 


Libet’s experiments suggested that for a patient to become conscious 
of something, 500 milliseconds (msec) of brain activity had to be 
produced—that is, half a second of brain activity. A very brief stimulus, 
such as a momentary tap on the hand, could produce activity in the 

	
8	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
brain, but if that signal was in some way interrupted before 500 msec 
had elapsed, conscious awareness of it would not occur. 
Unconscious Decision Making


The timing issue occupied many years of Libet’s subsequent research. 
In 1983, Libet conducted one of the most fascinating and influential 
studies of the human brain. A participant in this experiment would 
watch a dot moving in a circle around a clock face. The task of the 
participant was simply to watch the dot and, from time to time, flex 
his or her wrist. 


The presumption of researchers at the time was that the wrist flexion 
started with a conscious decision to move. Once that decision was 
made, a signal was sent from some part of the brain to the motor 
cortex. The motor cortex then generated a command that was 
transmitted, via the cerebellum and the spinal cord, to the muscles 
in the forearm that controlled the wrist. Scientists believed that the 
order was the conscious decision first, then the motor command, and 
then the motion itself.


Participants in Libet’s experiment were wired with a variety of 
instruments. An electroencephalograph (EEG) placed on their scalp 
allowed researchers to record the tiny electrical activities produced 
by neural activity in the brain. A separate set of sensors recorded 
when the muscles were activated and when the movement of the arm 
occurred. After each movement, the participant would report when he 
or she first became aware of the intention to act.


A very consistent pattern emerged when Libet examined the timing of 
this data. When we perform a movement like wrist flexion, the motor 
cortex builds up activity for about 500 msec prior to the onset of the 
action. When that buildup peaks, the signal is sent to the muscles, 
and the hand moves. But participants in the study only became aware 
of their decision to act about 200 msec before the action occurred. 

	
Lecture 1—Take Control of Your Automatic Brain	
9


In other words, the motor cortex starts to create the action a full 300 
msec before the participant decides to make the move. The data 
suggest that the brain makes a decision to act—but not a conscious 
one. A few hundred msec later, a message is sent to our conscious 
awareness, letting us know that the decision has been made. The 
decision has already been made before we become consciously 
aware of it. Our conscious experience of making a decision follows an 
unconscious process that is actually in control.
Alvaro Pascual-Leone 


Recent studies by Alvaro Pascual-Leone have confirmed the previous 
findings of unconscious processes. He used a technique called 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which sends a jolt of 
electromagnetic energy through the skull to the cortex and causes a 
burst of activity. If that burst is sent to the correct spot in the motor 
cortex, for example, it’s possible to make the arm twitch. 


Pascual-Leone asked participants to watch a screen and, when they 
were cued, decide whether they would twitch their left hand or right 
hand. After a delay of a few seconds, a second cue was delivered, at 
which point the participants made the movement they had decided 
to make. 


In some trials of this experiment, Pascual-Leone would deliver a TMS 
jolt to the part of the motor cortex associated with the participant’s 
chosen movement. For a few key trials in this experiment, however, 
Pascual-Leone would deliver a jolt to the part of the motor cortex 
associated with the side the participant had not selected, causing the 
wrong hand to move. 


If our conscious experience of decision making is in control, this 
reversal should feel peculiar. But most participants had a very simple 
explanation of the experience: “I just changed my mind.” The results 
of studies by Libet, Pascual-Leone, and others suggest that it doesn’t 
feel unusual when our conscious mind is not in control of our actions. 

	
10	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
The Role of Dopamine


Studies by Libet, Pascual-Leone, and others were the first to 
demonstrate that the experience of conscious decision making 
happens after the real decision—an unconscious decision—is made. 
Their results suggest that consciousness simply goes along for the 
ride. 


Therefore, if you want to outsmart yourself—to change your own 
behaviors—deciding to change your behavior is only one very small 
step toward that goal. Ultimately, to alter your behavior, you have 
to influence the systems that are in control: the automatic and 
unconscious decision-making systems.


Consider how this information is related to the counterintuitive tip: 
When you set a challenging, long-term goal for yourself, don’t tell 
anyone about it (or tell as few people as possible). The fewer people 
you tell, the greater your chances are of actually achieving that goal.
When you decide to 
undertake a major 
goal, such as running a 
marathon, you probably 
have many significant 
conscious reasons for 
doing so.

	
Lecture 1—Take Control of Your Automatic Brain	
11


For example, when you decide to undertake a major goal, such as 
running a marathon, you probably have many significant conscious 
reasons for doing so. You might admire someone else who has 
accomplished a similar goal. Perhaps you have health reasons for 
pursuing the objective, such as improving fitness. 


A key motivating factor, however, is to experience that extraordinary 
sense of satisfaction derived from picking a difficult challenge and 
then overcoming it. Whenever you set a goal and achieve it, your brain 
gives itself a positive shot of pleasure. The brain delivers a shot of the 
neurotransmitter dopamine to the nucleus accumbens—a pleasure 
center of the brain. 


If you constantly tell people about your goal, however, you 
consistently get a little bit of that sense of accomplishment, that 
pleasurable boost. In a very real sense, you reduce your drive to 
achieve the goal. 
Questions to Consider
1.	 There is evidence that we start to implement behaviors before our 
experience of consciously deciding to act. If you perform a set of 
actions that results in a crime, are you really responsible for it? 
Can you say that you didn’t really decide to commit the crime?
2.	 Many of our daily behaviors seem to be performed on autopilot—
outside our conscious focus. Are there any actions that could 
not be performed in this autopilot mode? What characterizes 
behaviors that do and do not require our conscious attention?

Lecture 2
Beat Procrastination by 
Doing Nothing
S
omewhere between 80 percent and 95 percent of people engage in 
procrastination on a regular basis. In fact, 50 percent of people report 
that they procrastinate consistently and that their procrastination 
frequently causes problems in their lives. An H&R Block survey revealed 
that procrastination-related errors cost taxpayers an average of about 400 
dollars per year. Procrastinators also report feelings of distress, anxiety, 
and guilt. In this lecture, we suggest ways to outsmart yourself and reduce 
the frequency and severity of procrastination. These tips and strategies 
are based on an understanding of how the brain functions as it makes 
decisions and how the brain responds to different types of reinforcement. 
Tip 1: Don’t Just Do Something; Stand There


To break free from the grip of procrastination, sit quietly and think for 
15 to 20 minutes about what you are going to do. This tip may seem 
counterintuitive, but there is good evidence that it works. Sitting still 
can break the cycle of delay, distraction, and time wasting. Several 
studies that include an explicit relaxation period demonstrate that this 
practice reduces the frequency of procrastination.


As we’ve already learned, a decision to do something does not 
necessarily lead to action. Something else is in control of many of our 
moment-to-moment choices and behaviors: the unconscious mind. 


Brain systems in the prefrontal cortex seem to control our intentional, 
planned behaviors. Consider what happens if this prefrontal cortex is 

	
Lecture 2—Beat Procrastination by Doing Nothing	
13
damaged. One of the most famous patients in the history of neurology 
was Phineas Gage, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in his work 
as a railroad construction foreman in the 1800s. When he was 25 
years old, there was an accident with dynamite, and a long metal rod 
went straight through his head and came out the back. 


Amazingly, Gage survived. His personality changed radically, however. 
The rod had severely damaged Gage’s prefrontal cortex. Gage 
became lazy and lost his capacity for long-term strategic planning. 
The prefrontal cortex gives us the ability to make long-term work 
plans and stick to them.


While the prefrontal cortex is vital, it is not the only system that 
regulates our decisions. Some researchers refer to an unconscious 
system of habitual, automatic behaviors that functions like an 
autopilot. The cortex participates somewhat in the release of these 
habitual, automatic behaviors, but the primary control of them seems 
to be based on circuits in subcortical regions of the brain. This 
unconscious habit system is particularly sensitive to immediate needs 
and short-term goals.
Procrastination and Anxiety


Procrastination is often associated with anxiety. A number of studies 
have found that people who tend to be more anxious in general are 
more likely to struggle with procrastination. When procrastinators 
are interviewed about the tasks they avoid, they often spontaneously 
mention tasks where they have a fear of failure. 


The amygdala is a small region of the brain located deep in the medial 
part of the temporal lobe. The amygdala is a key part of the limbic 
system of the brain, which is strongly associated with many of our 
emotional responses to various stimuli. The limbic system structures 
are small in comparison to the larger cortex structures on the top and 
outer parts of the brain, but they are highly interconnected with other 

	
14	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
parts of the brain. When you feel anxious, your entire nervous system 
changes the very nature of its function. 


Procrastination is associated with a great deal of activity; however, 
it consists of activity directed at less-important pursuits with an 
immediate reward. In fact, anxiety avoidance is a standard example of 
negative reinforcement. You feel a negative stimulus—the anxiety. You 
perform some behavior—procrastination—and the anxiety is reduced. 
This is a very easy habit to develop and a challenging one to break.


There are two main reasons that the strategy of sitting and doing 
nothing for 15 to 20 minutes is effective in reducing procrastination 
behaviors. First, intentionally doing nothing will prevent you from 
engaging in avoidance behaviors that are the real grist of the 
procrastination mill. Second, as you sit and think about the work that 
you might do, the anxiety will likely abate.
To break free 
from the grip of 
procrastination, sit 
quietly and think for 
15 to 20 minutes 
about what you are 
going to do.

	
Lecture 2—Beat Procrastination by Doing Nothing	
15
Tip 2: Avoid Choking under Pressure


A second strategy to reduce the frequency and severity of 
procrastination is to avoid feeling too much motivation to complete 
a task. Motivation is much like pressure, and too much pressure 
can lead to choking under pressure. Too much motivation can 
actually reduce the amount and quality of performance. Cognitive 
neuroscientists refer to this as the Yerkes-Dodson law. 


Imagine that you ask a group of experiment participants to shoot a 
series of basketball foul shots. You also give another group of study 
participants the same task under the same experimental conditions 
but with some extra motivation: one dollar for each successful shot. If 
people know there is some money on the line, they are likely to take 
the shots a little more seriously and probably make a few more shots. 
If you offer five dollars per shot to another group, you’re likely to get 
even better performance. In general, more motivation results in better 
performance—but only to a point.


If you bring in another group of participants and offer them 1 million 
dollars for every successful shot, they will likely not improve their 
performance above that of the five-dollar group. Ironically, the 
most likely outcome is that they will perform worse. With too much 
motivation, people choke under pressure. 


If you want to reduce your own tendency to procrastinate, it’s a good 
idea to keep the significance of your work in perspective. While your 
work may be vitally important, the sun will still rise tomorrow morning. 
Tip 3: Break Large Goals into Smaller Tasks


A third tip for reducing procrastination arises directly from the 
concept of motivation. This strategy uses the pleasure center—one 
of the subcortical unconscious control systems that live deep inside 
the brain. If you want to reduce procrastination, break any large 
project into parts. As you complete these small parts, keep track of 

	
16	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
your progress. Even if the project itself isn’t an enjoyable one, simply 
seeing yourself move closer to the finish line can produce pleasure.


Humans act because of choices made by unconscious systems within 
our brain. Rat brains seem to work in the same way, especially under 
standard laboratory conditions. Rats respond to reinforcement. If you 
give a rat food whenever it presses a lever, then it will press the lever 
more frequently in the future. 


One of the central parts of the circuit involved in processing pleasure 
is called the nucleus accumbens, located in the basal forebrain, 
tucked up underneath the cortex near the front of the brain. Many 
of the neurons found there respond to neurotransmitters called 
dopamine and serotonin. Neurotransmitters are chemical substances 
produced by the body—many in the brain itself—that influence the 
function of neurons. Sometimes neurotransmitters can be excitatory, 
which means they cause a set of neurons to become more active. In 
other situations, a neurotransmitter will be inhibitory, reducing the 
activation of a set of neurons. 


The nucleus accumbens is linked to a variety of other areas of the 
brain that motivate particular actions. If a rat is hungry, this circuit 
will drive the rat to perform behaviors that it associates within finding 
food, such as searching and sniffing. If the rat learns to associate 
pressing a bar with getting food, then when the hungry rat presses 
the bar, the nucleus accumbens will be activated, and the rat will 
experience pleasure.


Many neuroscientists who study learning and motivation describe the 
nucleus accumbens circuit as the driver of the whole system. The rat 
seeks food, water, comfort, other rats, and so on, but all its behaviors 
come back to a single motivator: the drive to release dopamine into 
the nucleus accumbens. 


Humans also have a nucleus accumbens—two of them, in fact, in 
the left and right sides of our brain—and many of our behaviors, 

	
Lecture 2—Beat Procrastination by Doing Nothing	
17
particularly unconsciously controlled behaviors, are driven by a desire 
for dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. When you are hungry and 
feel the pleasure of a delicious meal, it is your nucleus accumbens 
dopamine-related activity that gives you that pleasure. In fact, the 
dopamine-related activity is itself the pleasure.



Consider another type of activity that gives us a shot of pleasure: 
controlling and affecting the world around us. If we perform some 
action, and the action causes something we intended to come to 
pass, we experience pleasure. 
Even if a project you're 
working on isn’t an 
enjoyable one, simply 
seeing yourself move 
closer to the finish line 
can produce pleasure.

	
18	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


The desire to control the world around us is very fundamental. In 
fact, even babies seem to experience it. If you put a baby into a crib 
under a mobile that shakes from time to time, the baby will watch 
and sometimes kick her legs. If you connect her leg to the mobile so 
that the mobile shakes when she kicks her legs, the baby will continue 
to kick. Even a three-month-old baby will learn the relation between 
action and an environmental outcome in just a few minutes. 


When we decide to take on some challenge and then succeed in 
accomplishing it, we get a boost of pleasure—a shot of dopamine-
related activity in our nucleus accumbens. We don’t, however, get 
that burst of pleasure while we’re actually pursuing the goal. We get it 
when we accomplish the goal.


Think of yourself as a rat! Imagine you have a big project, one that 
has been driving you to procrastination for a while. Completing the 
project will be a huge success and gain you a sizeable reward. Think 
of your reward, for the moment, as a big pile of rat kibble. Rather than 
leave all the kibble in one big pile at the end, this tip suggests that you 
should spread it out. Arrange it in a line between your current location 
and the location where you want to be. 


As you complete small subtasks, you will earn yourself little pieces 
of kibble—and receive the associated releases of dopamine to your 
nucleus accumbens. When you achieve those subtasks, make a 
point of celebrating them. Keep feeding your pleasure centers 
enough motivation to keep yourself moving along. Stay focused on 
the same project long enough so that you achieve the significant 
goal at the end.

Questions to Consider 
1.	 Beta-blockers are medications that block the receptor sites for 
adrenaline and noradrenaline, neurotransmitters associated with 
anxiety. When people take beta-blockers, they tend to feel fewer 
effects of anxiety. Would it be effective for someone with chronic 
procrastination to take beta-blockers? 
2.	 Steve Jobs was known to yell at his computer engineers to 
motivate them. Some people work better when they receive strong 
motivation like this; the performance of others greatly declines. 
How could you decide which type of motivation is best for another 
person? Which type of motivation is best for you?

Train Yourself like a Dog
W
hile habits can seem like minor, unimportant behaviors, in fact, 
they are significant activities that deserve our attention. The 
philosopher Aristotle noted, “We are what we repeatedly do. 
Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” Jim Ryun, one the greatest 
distance runners in American history, said, “Motivation is what gets 
you started. Habit is what keeps you going.” If we can fix our habitual 
tendencies, we can fix our lives. In this lecture, we consider how we can 
use the tools of cognitive neuroscience to alter our behaviors. 
The Notepad Strategy


Consider this simple tip—one that is startlingly effective for reducing 
the frequency of a bad habit. An effective strategy for behavioral 
training is to call attention to the problem behavior whenever it 
appears. An additional step is to write down the times when this 
problem behavior occurs and then read that list at the end of the day.


Walk around with a notepad and pen. At the start of the day, write 
the date at the top of a page. Any time you engage in your problem 
behavior, don’t unduly criticize yourself . Just pull out the notepad 
and write down the time of day and a few words summarizing the 
details. If you’re trying to cut down on television, note the start and 
end time of the television watching. If you have a doughnut-eating 
habit, write down the time, place, and flavor of the doughnut. At the 
end of the day, as you are about to go to sleep, read over your list of 
incidents. Then, turn the page and put the notepad and pen away.


Many programs aimed at objectives such as smoking cessation use 
the notepad strategy as a baseline task. You start by noting how much 

	
Lecture 3—Train Yourself like a Dog	
21
you actually smoke for one week, and then you start the intervention—
perhaps chewing nicotine replacement gum or exercising to reduce 
cravings. The baseline procedure itself—simply noting the incidents—
often has a very strong effect all by itself. 


Over short spans of time, by exerting our conscious will, we can 
immediately—often drastically—alter our behavior. That explicit 
control of behavior takes continual attention and a great deal of 
mental energy, however. As we get distracted by other concerns, the 
conscious control drifts away. As it does, the unconscious control 
takes over. 


Cognitive neuroscientists have identified several few reasons for the 
success of the notepad strategy. The most basic explanation derives 
directly from our knowledge about the unconscious processes that 
control behaviors. Since these unconscious processes are often in 
control of behaviors, you may not actually be aware of how often you 
engage in a particular habit. As you see the pages of your notebook 
filling up, you will tend to eliminate some of the unconscious 
repetitions of the behavior.
Self-Control as a Muscle


Researchers have explored another technique of behavioral 
modification using the theory that self-control is like a muscle. After 
an exercise workout, the muscle will be fatigued and less useful; 
however, when it heals, it gets stronger.


The same process seems to apply to our self-control. In one set of 
experiments, conducted by a team led by Mark Muraven, participants 
were recruited and asked to refrain from eating any sweets for two full 
weeks. The participants noted whenever they ate something sweet. 
The experiment was largely successful; participants reduced their 
sweet-eating habits. However, the most interesting result emerged 
when the participants came into the lab at the end of the two weeks 
to complete a stop-signal test. 

	
22	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Participants in the stop-signal test watch a computer screen. If 
a rectangle appears on the right side of the screen, they quickly 
press a key with the right hand. If the rectangle appears on the left, 
participants quickly press a different key with the left hand. For a 
randomly selected 25 percent of the trials, however, a beep sounds 
when the rectangle appears. On those trials, and only those trials, 
participants have to ignore it and make no key press.


This sounds simple, but the test pits one part of the brain against 
another. The visuomotor system learns the task very quickly, but 
when the beep sounds, the voluntary, conscious self-control system 
has to kick in and stop things. People who are better at stopping 
themselves from hitting the keys have better general self-control. 
What’s interesting is that this self-control ability is improved after two 
weeks of avoiding sugary snacks. It seems that if you practice self-
control, you improve self control—just like a muscle.
Development of the Frontal Lobes


Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have 
characterized the location of the self-control ability in the brain. When 
people are engaged in successful stop-signal behaviors, the superior 
medial and precentral frontal cortices show greater activation. These 
frontal lobes are associated with such tasks as problem solving, 
creativity, and strategic thinking. 


The frontal lobes are also strongly associated with regulating the rest 
of the brain in impulse control and avoiding overly risky behavior. 
Areas in the frontal lobes are the latest sections to develop fully. 


In the past, neuroscientists believed that the brain was finished 
with its primary development by the late teen years; however, some 
recent work has suggested otherwise. Between 18 and 22 years of 
age, there is a surge of development in the frontal lobes. Specifically, 
there is a large increase in the production of myelin—a fatty insulating 
substance that increases neuronal efficiency. During this same period 

	
Lecture 3—Train Yourself like a Dog	
23
of time, people get much better at self-control in general. Most people 
presume that it is this increase in development of white matter that 
leads to a reduction in the high-risk, impulsive behaviors that are 
commonly associated with the teen years.
Alternative Behavioral Associations


The human brain is remarkably effective at making associative links. 
In fact, making associative links is an unconscious tendency that 
we all share and that we cannot fully turn off. If you think about 
something that you don’t want to think about, you are, in a sense, 
already thinking about it. The same process happens when we try not 
to think about engaging in some habitual behavior. Calling attention 
to the behavior will help. What’s more, your inhibitory self-control 
ability will get stronger with exercise.


Instead of turning off an existing associative link—which is 
impossible—you can create an alternative associative link and make 
it stronger. In other words, to stop a bad habit, you need to replace 
it with another behavior. The goal of this training procedure is not to 
temporarily change behavior but ultimately to change the underlying 
mental processes that drive a problematic habit in the first place. You 
need to create a new, automatic, unconscious process that will take 
the place of the problematic one.


A great deal of research supports this strategy. A study conducted by 
Marieke Adriaanse and her colleagues asked participants to identify 
situations that triggered the performance of a bad habit—for example, 
“When I feel anxious, I tend to go to the kitchen for a sugary snack.” In 
the next step, participants were asked to come up with an alternative 
behavior to pursue when the trigger showed up—for example, “When 
I feel anxious, I will eat an apple.”


The experimenters found that the focus on associating an alternative 
behavior with the trigger resulted in a greater reduction in the habitual 
behavior. The researchers also performed a variety of tests exploring 

	
24	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
how this change occurred. The researchers determined that when 
you form an alternate intention—an alternate behavioral association 
with the trigger that usually causes a bad habit—your brain changes 
its internal association structure. After forming and practicing the 
alternate association, your brain starts to process the new action 
faster. If this happens quickly enough, that new behavior will tend to 
be triggered instead of the bad habit.
Positive and Negative Reinforcement


Both positive and negative reinforcement have been proven to 
effectively shape behavior. 
•• In positive reinforcement, something pleasant gets added to your 
experience after you perform a behavior. 
Identify situations that 
trigger the performance of 
a bad habit—for example, 
“When I feel anxious, I tend 
to go to the kitchen for a 
sugary snack."

	
Lecture 3—Train Yourself like a Dog	
25
•• In negative reinforcement, something aversive gets removed after 
you perform a behavior. (Note that negative reinforcement is not 
the same as punishment.) 
•• In positive punishment, something negative is added to your 
experience after you perform a behavior. 
•• In negative punishment, something positive gets removed after 
you perform a behavior. 


In general, to promote more general and long-lasting learning, most 
research suggests that you should focus on the reinforcement side 
of things. For example, imagine that you have a bad habit of leaving 
the television on when you leave for work, and you want to lessen 
the incidence of that habit. Make a contract with yourself: Starting 
tomorrow, if you remember to turn off the television, give yourself a 
cookie when you come home. 


Remember that you are not trying to change your conscious behavior. 
You are, to use the language of a behaviorist like B.F. Skinner, shaping 
the behavior of your unconscious action control systems. The cookie 
is for that part of your brain.
Self-Administered Reinforcement


Over the course of several decades, a wide range of studies have been 
conducted on self-administered reinforcement. Students have used 
it to improve study habits. Dieters have used it to enhance healthy 
eating practices. People with phobias have used self-administered 
reinforcement to train themselves to deal with their fears. You can 
pick almost any practice, make a contract with yourself, and then 
change your behavior.


One hallmark of behavioral shaping is that it can be a slow process. 
It might be several weeks before you reach the final behavior that 
you seek. Often, behavioral scientists who use these techniques to 

	
26	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
train animals to perform complex sequences of actions will employ a 
gradual shaping process. 


While the training process is slow, the good news is that once the 
new behavior is set, unlearning the training will also function slowly. 
Eventually, you won’t have to reinforce yourself all the time; you will 
only require periodic reinforcement for good behavior.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Experiments suggest that our self-control can be increased if it is 
exercised—that is, it can be strengthened like a muscle. Should we 
train our children or grandchildren to build this self-control muscle 
from an early age? How would you do that?
2.	 Research suggests it’s easier to stop performing a bad habit if you 
replace that habit with an alternate behavior. For example, it’s easier 
to quit excess snacking if you decide to go for a walk whenever you 
feel like snacking. Do you think some replacement behaviors are 
better than others? What alternate behaviors would you suggest 
to someone who was trying to quit smoking, arguing with the kids, 
watching too much TV, or forgetting to take medication?

Lecture 4
Clean Your Kitchen, 
Improve Your Diet
A
n estimated 45 million Americans have undertaken a weight-loss 
plan within a given year. What’s more, the weight-loss industry 
accounts for about 33 billion dollars in revenue annually. Sadly, 
however, the obesity epidemic is still going strong. Roughly two out of 
three American adults are overweight or obese. In 1990, most states 
had fewer than 15 percent of adults in the obese range. Today, it’s up to 
25 percent or more. To complicate matters, obesity is associated with 
many other health consequences. In this lecture, we consider a number 
of strategies to address unconscious eating behaviors. You’ll learn how to 
establish new habits that will help you maintain a healthful eating program 
even when your conscious thoughts are directed elsewhere.
Clean Your Kitchen


If you want to reduce your snacking, clean your kitchen. 


Brian Wansink and his research team conducted a study in which 
participants were asked to accomplish a simple writing task. The 
study took place in a kitchen environment where snacks were 
provided. For half the participants, the kitchen was clean and orderly: 
Dishes were washed, trash was out of sight, and other food in the 
kitchen was put away. For the other half of the participant group, the 
kitchen was in a chaotic condition: Furniture was placed haphazardly, 
papers were strewn about, and experimenters pretended to arrive 
late and scrambled to get organized as the study began.

	
28	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Even though the study lasted only 10 minutes, the participants in the 
chaotic kitchen consumed about 53 more calories. A pound of fat 
consists of about 3,500 calories of stored energy. Extrapolating here, 
this means that an extra pound of fat would be gained for every 12 
hours spent in the chaotic kitchen.


The Wansink study indicates that eating behaviors are, at least in part, 
influenced by the cleanliness and orderliness of the kitchen. While 
unconscious decision-making systems are outside our awareness, 
they dictate what we do, especially if our conscious mind is focused 
elsewhere. 
If you want to reduce 
your unhealthful snacking 
behaviors, you should 
clean your kitchen—
especially if you are 
feeling at all stressed.

	
Lecture 4—Clean Your Kitchen, Improve Your Diet	
29
Reduce Stress Levels


Wansink and his colleagues interpret their findings in terms of 
the stress induced by a cluttered environment. In addition to the 
variable of the chaotic kitchen versus the clean one, the researchers 
also manipulated the stress levels of the participants. One third of 
participants were asked to write about a time in their lives when they 
felt chaotic and out of control. Another third of the participants were 
asked to write about a time when they felt particularly organized and 
in control. The remaining participants were asked to write about the 
last lecture that they attended.


This mood-induction technique was successful. People who wrote 
about the times they felt chaotic and out of control tended to snack 
the most; people in the neutral condition writing about the lecture 
snacked somewhat less; and people asked to write about being 
organized and in control snacked least of all.


The most interesting aspect of the study, however, was the interaction 
between two types of variables. The participants who wrote about 
feeling chaotic and out of control were affected substantially more by 
the chaotic kitchen. 


Based on this finding, we can refine the kitchen-cleaning tip: If you 
want to reduce your unhealthful snacking behaviors, you should 
clean your kitchen—especially if you are feeling at all stressed. The 
combination of feeling stressed and having a messy kitchen seems 
very likely to induce your unconscious decision-making processes to 
find and consume food.
Place Food in Opaque (Not Transparent) 
Containers


Another strategy to reduce snacking is to put your food in opaque 
(not transparent) containers. 

	
30	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Developmental scientists consider object permanence to be a 
crucial early accomplishment in the cognitive development of young 
children. Jean Piaget, often described as the father of developmental 
psychology, noticed that his infant son would reach for a favorite toy 
when it was placed in front of him. However, if Piaget covered the toy 
with a small cloth, his son would stop reaching for it. 


Piaget concluded that children lack the ability to maintain a mental 
representation of objects that they can’t see. If an object was out of 
view, according to Piaget, then to the child it was as if the object 
had simply ceased to exist. According to later research, though, this 
interpretation isn’t quite true. A variety of studies suggest that infants 
do know about objects even after they are hidden. While this later 
research indicates that children do have object permanence even at 
two or three months of age, it is still a challenge for children to initiate 
actions based on things that they can’t see.


This situation remains true even in adulthood. When snacks are 
placed out of sight, it’s not that you are unaware of them. What 
changes is your behavior. Your inner child no longer reaches for food 
that is out of sight.
Packaging Research


Raji Srinivasan and her colleagues performed a fascinating set of 
studies on how different types of packaging influence snacking 
behaviors. The researchers wanted to determine how much snack 
food was consumed by participants while they watched television. 
It’s worth noting that most snacking behavior—most estimates 
indicate about 70 percent—takes place while people are watching 
television. 


Srinivasan was doing marketing research that was designed to help 
food companies select the best packaging to encourage consumers 
to snack more, not less. But those results work for our purposes here. 
If a particular type of packaging promotes more snacking, then people 

	
Lecture 4—Clean Your Kitchen, Improve Your Diet	
31
aiming to lose weight will want to avoid that packaging. Conversely, 
if some type of container results in less consumption, we should put 
our food into that container.


In one of the experiments, participants were given colorful, sugary 
cereal to snack on while they watched television. For half the 
participants, the fruity cereal was in a transparent container; for 
the other half, it was in an opaque container. Not surprisingly, the 
participants with the transparent container ate significantly more 
sugary snacks—about 170 percent the amount that was eaten from 
the opaque containers.


The researchers also found that the package didn’t need to be 
completely transparent to generate these effects. Even if the package 
had a transparent window, that was enough. You didn’t have to see 
all the food, you just needed to see enough to spur your unconscious 
appetite processes to reach out and start snacking.
Monitor Consumption


The optimal food container for managing your consumption depends 
somewhat on the type of foods. Ultimately, the best strategy for 
reducing snacking and promoting healthful eating is to repackage 
the foods that you buy. Food manufacturers have developed a great 
deal of research and are highly motivated. They will likely have 
selected a type of packaging that will make you inclined to eat more 
of their product. 


For everything but the cookies in the Srinivasan study, opaque 
containers were best. They promoted less consumption of small 
sugary snacks and more eating of healthful—if less appealing—foods. 
The only food where transparent containers were more effective was 
with large cookies. 


The Srinivasan study suggests another strategy for reducing 
unhealthful snacking behaviors: Use containers to increase your 

	
32	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
ability to monitor how much you have eaten. Specifically, if you can do 
something to enhance your perception of how much you’ve eaten—
even when you are consciously counting or weighing things—then you 
will be more likely to stop eating sooner.
Use Smaller Plates


Human perception in general functions by comparing. The nature of 
neuronal sensory networks is to increase activation when a stimulus 
increases in strength and also to use that information to inhibit the 
activity of nearby neurons. Our sensory systems thus adapt and 
respond mostly to particular things in relation to one another rather 
than in absolute terms.


Consider the classic visual display called the Ebbinghaus illusion. 
Two central disks are identical in size. One central disk is surrounded 
by small disks; the other is surrounded by large disks. Even though 
the projection of the two central disks onto the retina at the back of 
the eye is identical in size, most people perceive the one surrounded 
by small disks as larger than the one surrounded by the large disks. 
Our perception of an object’s size is influenced by its relation to the 
images around it. 


There is a related pictorial illusion—the Delboeuf illusion—in which 
two identical disks are surrounded by different-sized circles. The 
effect of relative size applies here as well, with the disk inside the 
larger circle appearing smaller.


Some clever researchers have found that the illusion even applies 
to food. Brian Wansink and his colleagues initially demonstrated 
this effect at an ice cream social. The experimenters presented 
participants with different-sized bowls and then recorded how much 
ice cream people scooped out for themselves. They determined that 
if you are placing food on a small dish, you will stop sooner than if 

	
Lecture 4—Clean Your Kitchen, Improve Your Diet	
33
you are putting your food onto a large dish. Your perception of the 
amount of food on your plate is based on how that amount of food 
compares to the size of the overall dish.


The tip here is simple: If you are looking to cut back on your eating, 
one of the simplest, easiest strategies is to use smaller plates. 
Apply Your Comparison Capability


Consumption of sugary drinks has been identified as a strong 
contributor to our modern obesity epidemic. A 20-ounce sugary 
drink contains about 16 teaspoons of sugar. A 32-ounce sugary drink 
contains about 350 calories. What’s worse, sugary drinks don’t satiate 
hunger.


Consider this illusion if you want to reduce your intake of sugary 
drinks. Given a choice of glasses of various heights and widths, 
people will identify a tall, mostly full glass as the one holding the most 
fluid. Conversely, a very wide glass that is mostly empty appears to 
have the smallest amount. This illusion holds true even when all the 
glasses contain the same amount of fluid. 


What this illusion very directly suggests is that you should choose 
to drink out of a tall, thin glass when you drink anything but water. 
Essentially, everyone falls for this illusion; in fact, in a study by 
Wansink and his colleagues, it was found that most professional 
bartenders fall for it too.

Questions to Consider 
1.	 If you clean and organize your kitchen, you will tend to eat 
more healthfully. If you clean and organize your office or other 
workplace, how might that affect your daily life? How about 
cleaning and organizing your car?
2.	 Using small plates and utensils encourages people to serve 
themselves less food and thereby to consume less. A recent result 
suggests, however, that if you eat at a smaller table, you will 
eat more food. Why might that be? (Hint: Think about the size-
contrast illusion.)

Lecture 5
Eat Slow, Eat Small,  
Eat Smart
M
any experts agree that the best diet is one that we don’t realize 
we are on. In this lecture, we look at a variety of studies dealing 
with how the human appetite and drive systems interact with 
reasoning and decision-making systems. By examining how the brain 
mechanisms function in terms of hunger and satiation, we’ll explore how 
to create habits that support a healthful eating plan. 
Leptin and Ghrelin


If you are trying to cut down on the amount you eat, slow down during 
meals. Eat a moderate amount, and then take a break for about 20 
minutes. If you are still hungry after those 20 minutes, you can have 
more; however, many people find that they just aren’t as hungry as 
they thought they were.


Consider some of the brain mechanisms involved in regulating hunger 
and satiation. Eating behaviors influence the amount of the hormones 
leptin and ghrelin that are released in the body. Leptin is produced by 
our fat cells. Ghrelin is produced by cells that live in our intestines. 


Fat is an energy-storage mechanism. In the body, excess energy is 
converted into fat. Then, when we run low on energy, fat is converted 
back into a form that can be used to power our cells. When your 
body starts storing energy, leptin is released by the fat cells into the 
bloodstream and eventually passes into the brain. Some of the leptin 
reaches the hypothalamus in a region called the ventromedial nucleus. 

	
36	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
There, leptin binds with neuronal receptors and boosts activation of 
certain neural circuits. When these circuits are active, you feel full and 
typically stop eating. 


Ghrelin does the opposite. When your intestines finish processing 
food, they start making ghrelin. As time passes, they continue making 
more and more ghrelin. Like leptin, ghrelin makes its way to the brain, 
but ghrelin causes you to start feeling hungry again. 
The 20-Minute Break


Together, leptin and ghrelin regulate food intake; however, these 
hormones act slowly. From the time you start eating, the full impact 
of the food on ghrelin and leptin can take up to 20 minutes. If you give 
your body time to finish that process, you might find yourself quite 
satisfied with less food. On the other hand, if you eat steadily until you 
feel full, you will continue to feel more full for 20 minutes after you 
stop eating.


Most people presume that if you are receiving a strong hunger signal 
from your body, it means that you are in dire need of a great deal of 
food. That just isn’t true. If you are truly starving—that is, if you are 
cut off from food for 48 hours or more—you will feel periodic hunger, 
but most of the time the hunger signals disappear altogether. 
Eat with Men


To reduce your calorie intake, eat with men.


Molly Allen-O’Donnell and her colleagues recently performed a set of 
studies in which they observed people ordering food in restaurants. 
When women ordered food in all-female groups, they tended to order 
and consume about 833 calories. When women ate with a man in the 
group, they ordered less—about 721 calories’ worth. When there is a 
man around, women seem to eat about 13 percent less.

	
Lecture 5—Eat Slow, Eat Small, Eat Smart 	 37


Interestingly, the effect was the same for men. Eating with at least 
one male in your group seems to lead to less eating. In these studies, 
when a man ordered food with only women around, he tended to eat 
about 1,162 calories. If there were other men in the group, the men 
consumed about 952 calories—about 18 percent less. 
Positive Psychology


Much of the history of clinical psychology has focused on how to fix 
people with problems. Researchers study groups of depressed people 
or populations of anxious people. This is a model of research that 
focuses on negative situations.


A more recent body of work, however, has focused on studying 
the positive aspects of psychological well-being, rather than solely 
focusing on negatives. This school of thought, known as positive 
psychology, has revolutionized how researchers think about a variety 
If you are trying to cut 
down on the amount you 
eat, slow down during 
meals. Eat a moderate 
amount, and then take a

of different aspects of human perception, cognition, and behavior. 
The general goal is to identify people who are thriving and then study 
what factors are associated with that well-being.


For many decades, researchers have experimented with people who 
are overweight with the goal of changing their behavior so that they 
can lose excess weight. From the positive perspective, however, 
researchers spend their time studying people who are not overweight. 


When you ask people who struggle with a weight problem why they 
eat and what they choose to eat, you will get a lot of different answers: 
anxiety, boredom, depression. When you ask these questions of 
someone without a weight problem, the answers are much shorter and 
stunningly obvious: “I eat when I’m hungry.” “I stop eating when I’m no 
longer hungry.” “I think about what I feel like eating, and then I eat it.”
When Hungry, Eat; When Not Hungry, Don’t Eat


Following is a weight-loss strategy on which both modern cognitive 
neuroscience and nutritional science clearly agree: If you are 
hungry, you should eat. Conversely, when you are not hungry, you 
should not eat.


This doesn’t sound like rocket science, but let’s unpack those two 
statements. If you are hungry, your body is sending you a message 
that it has changed from a mode of processing incoming energy to one 
of needing more. Restricting your calorie intake is only a short-term 
solution. Unless you are willing and able to spend all of your waking 
hours focusing on controlling your eating, you will eventually slip. 


There’s another problem with ignoring the hunger signal. The 
hormones leptin and ghrelin influence the hypothalamus, which 
regulates your internal sense of hunger. They also influence your 
body’s metabolism. If you restrict too many calories, the hunger 
hormones will actually reduce the rate at which your body burns 
energy. Too much ghrelin will also activate the mechanism that stores 

	
Lecture 5—Eat Slow, Eat Small, Eat Smart 	 39
energy in fat cells; therefore, you will use fewer of the calories that 
you eat and store more of them by enlarging fat cells.


You can fight this process with physical activity, but unless you are 
planning to go to extremes, exercise can often prove to be a losing 
battle. Humans are too efficient at acquiring energy from our foods for 
exercise to work on its own. What’s more, if you start a new exercise 
program, you will burn more calories, but the hunger system in your 
brain will be further stimulated. If you don’t also regulate food intake, 
a number of studies have found that eating rises to meet the amount 
of extra calories burned.
Monitor Your Internal Set Point


A number of neuroscientists have proposed that the human brain 
regulates body weight based on an internal set point. It’s like a 
thermostat that regulates the temperature by turning on the heat or 
the air conditioning to keep the temperature relatively constant—only 
this thermostat regulates your weight and uses hunger to maintain 
your weight. 


Your body seems built to do this, but there are ways to hack the 
system and get around this internal regulation process. Eat when you 
are hungry. If you don’t, then your unconscious regulatory systems 
will simply compensate and wait until you aren’t paying attention.


When you are hungry, eat a small snack, preferably one that is rich in 
protein and/or high in fiber. There is much research supporting these 
eating habits. One of the best examples is a study in which people 
were given servings of various foods of equal caloric value. After they 
finished, the participants rated how full they felt and how much it had 
reduced their hunger. The foods that win this competition are always 
high in fiber and protein. The losers are always foods highest in sugars 
and fats. Even if you consume the same number of calories, foods high 
in sugar and fat influence that leptin-ghrelin system to a lesser degree, 
resulting in less change in your perception of how hungry you are.

	
40	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
Reinforce Positive Associations


As you alter your eating plan, several crucial areas of the human brain 
will come to the rescue. The most notable of these is the orbitofrontal 
cortex, located near the front of your brain just above your eyeballs. 
This area is activated by many different types of decision-making 
behaviors and especially by decisions about food. 


There are strong connections between the orbitofrontal region and 
areas of the brain associated with hunger. In fact, when you are 
hungry, this area of the brain is primed for activation. When any food-
related stimulus appears, the orbitofrontal cortex reacts, but if you 
are hungry, it responds a great deal. This area of the brain seems to 
be a major player in decisions about what looks good to eat.


It should be said that humans are impressively omnivorous. Every 
time we eat, our body does a little data collection. It encodes the 
flavors, textures, smells, and even the social context in which the 
meal occurred. Then, after the food goes into the digestive tract, 
it waits to find out what happens. If you happen to feel nauseated 
after eating, then your brain—in cooperation with your orbitofrontal 
cortex—concludes that those flavors, textures, smells, and social 
context should be avoided in the future. If, on the other hand, there 
is an agreeable outcome—that is, if the body gets a boost of energy 
and feels satisfied—then a positive association is made with the food.


As you eat a food repeatedly, your brain forms associations with it 
just as it does with any other experience. If you are reinforced for 
any behavior, then you will be more likely to perform it again in the 
future. If you are punished, then you will be less likely to perform 
that behavior in the future. This flavor-preference learning system is 
always at work, every time you eat.


There are many healthful foods that you can teach your brain to 
crave. When you are hungry, satisfy your hunger with something 
healthful. Every time you give your body that pleasurable experience 
of satisfying your hunger, you will appreciate the food you used to 

	
Lecture 5—Eat Slow, Eat Small, Eat Smart 	 41
do so just a little bit more. If you do so long enough, you will almost 
certainly have an experience where you get a craving—a hunger-
induced craving—for a healthful food. 
Questions to Consider 
1.	 You are headed to a dinner party and are worried that you will 
overeat. What might you do before arriving at the party to make 
that overconsumption less likely?
2.	 Both men and women tend to eat less at restaurants if at least 
one of their dinner companions is male. What factor(s) might be 
responsible for this effect? Is there any way to use those factors to 
produce healthier eating even if there isn’t a male companion?

Lecture 6
The Myth of Multitasking
O
ne of the greatest powers of the human brain is that it can perform 
many different processes in parallel. While modern computers 
are, in some respects, much faster and more accurate than the 
human brain in terms of sequential operations, artificial intelligence is only 
just beginning to approximate the extraordinary parallel processing that 
the human brain performs. In this lecture, however, we explore the “thrill of 
monotasking”—the sense of focus and clarity that comes from performing 
only one task at a time. Monotasking can expand the brain’s capabilities, 
speed up reaction times, improve memory, enhance creativity, and even 
boost IQ. What’s more, there are hidden costs to multitasking, in both the 
short and long term. 
Classic Research on Multitasking


Today, there is significant research on task attention that assesses 
how well humans do and do not multitask, along with some fascinating 
work examining how the brain implements multitasking behaviors. 
However, a large body of older literature explores just how many 
tasks someone can learn to do at the same time.


In a classic experimental study, expert typists were given a document 
to type. At the same time, the experimenters played an audio 
recording of a voice reading some text aloud. The job of the typists 
in this study was to verbally shadow that audio recording. (Verbal 
shadowing is a task in which you repeat what the speaker says while 
he or she is talking.) 


It turns out that this was an easy task for an expert typist. Expert 
typists can type quickly and accurately while simultaneously 

	
Lecture 6—The Myth of Multitasking	
43
performing verbal shadowing. It seems that the typing is so automatic 
that the typist can devote attention to the shadowing, and both 
activities can proceed at the same time. 


Imagine that the typist practiced the verbal shadowing over the course 
of several weeks or months. Presumably, the typist would eventually 
become expert at typing and verbal shadowing. If the typists became 
expert enough, they may be able to add a third, fourth, or fifth task. 
Brain Utilities


It’s helpful that the human brain is so effective at multitasking 
because our modern world demands it. There is actually a feeling of 
pleasure that many people describe associated with multitasking. It 
can be invigorating to push your mind and body up near its maximum 
capacity for processing information. 


The problem is that when researchers carefully assess people’s 
functioning during multitasking, significant reductions in performance 
are found. Perhaps most troubling is the fact that people are unaware 
of the drop in performance. While we feel as if we’re doing our best 
work, we are actually performing poorly. 


The older research using the expert typists, cited above, hinted 
at some of the problems with multitasking. The typists could type 
written material while verbally shadowing; however, if the typists had 
to type dictated words, then the task became tremendously difficult. 


It seems that there are certain limits to how well we can process 
different information streams simultaneously. The human brain can 
perform many operations in parallel, but there are bottlenecks in that 
processing. Certain brain utilities that are essential to performing 
many behaviors can perform only one task at a time.


The problems with multitasking emerge directly from the bottlenecks. 
You might feel as if you are performing more than one task at a

describe associated with 
multitasking. It can be invigorating 
to push your mind and body up

processing information.

	
Lecture 6—The Myth of Multitasking	
45
time, but the research demonstrates that you are rapidly switching 
between two or more tasks to create the illusion of simultaneously 
performing two tasks at one time. That switch takes time and, it turns 
out, requires a substantial amount of brain resources to accomplish.
Information-Processing Bottlenecks


Many studies comparing multitasking and monotasking involve giving 
a group of participants a particular task, such as writing or solving a 
set of problems. Half the participants engage in monotasking. The 
other half of the participants execute the same task and also engage 
in a monitoring task. The group that multitasks always performs 
substantially worse than the monotasking group.


Hal Pashler has performed studies on the information-processing 
bottlenecks in the brain. A hallmark of many of his experiments is just 
how simple the tasks are. He demonstrates that even if you set up 
a pair of very simple tasks, if they both require the same underlying 
processing utility, then multitasking will produce clear differences in 
performance. 


In one study, researchers asked people to make two simple decisions 
at the same time. Every few seconds, the participants’ computer 
emits a tone. If it’s a high-pitched tone, they press a key with the left 
index finger. If it’s a low-pitched tone, they press a key with the left 
middle finger. In the second task, a letter appears on screen. If it’s the 
letter A, participants press a key with the right index finger. If it’s the 
letter B, they press a key with the right middle finger. 


Somehow, these two tasks together are much more difficult than 
either of them individually. The reason is that the two tasks hit one 
of the key bottlenecks in your brain’s information-processing system. 
Pashler also found that even when study participants were given a 
great deal of practice with the two tasks, the processes never got as 
fast as when the participant was engaged in a single-task condition. 

	
46	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


We can alternate between two tasks quickly, and with practice, that 
alternation can become very efficient, but there is never a time when 
the switching back and forth becomes instantaneous. What’s more, 
there is never a time when you can truly be performing two tasks at 
the same time.
Distracted Driving


Perhaps the most publicized application of multitasking research 
concerns driving while using a cell phone. Phone manufacturers and 
carmakers have addressed this problem with the hands-free cell 
phone. Although it is true that a fully hands-free system can enable 
you to keep your eyes on the road the entire time, several studies have 
found that the accident rate with hands-free cell phones is nearly as 
high as it is with handheld cell phones. The problem is multitasking.


When it comes to processing sensory information and making 
decisions about it, the human brain is limited to one decision at a time. 
No matter how expert you are at the other parts of performing a task, 
the decision aspect remains a single-task bottleneck. When you are 
pondering or responding to the statements of someone on the other 
end of a phone or text exchange, you are making a lot of decisions. 


Every time you are making one of those decisions, you are not able 
to make visuomotor action decisions about driving the car. Those 
decisions have to wait until the bottleneck is freed up. We may be 
able to alternate between two or more tasks, but the switching always 
introduces a little delay. At 60 or 70 miles per hour, a little delay can 
translate into an accident.
How the Brain Multitasks


In this section, we discuss how the brain actually implements 
multitasking, also termed rapid sequential multitask alternation. In the 
past, researchers believed that there was some sort of brain center 
responsible for multitasking. They envisioned it as a switching center 

	
Lecture 6—The Myth of Multitasking	
47
that would store information for an ongoing task that was on hold. If we 
were going to build a multitasking computer, that would be a sensible 
component to include. But the human brain doesn’t work that way.


Whenever you engage in some task, you stimulate a network of 
areas of the brain and activate a large set of circuits that perform 
the calculations needed to support the work. If it’s a spoken-
language decision-making task, then the following main areas will 
be engaged: auditory cortex areas, the Wernicke area for processing 
speech, temporal cortex memory areas responsible for holding on to 
different sentence concepts, and the frontal cortex regions involved in 
intentional decision making.


If you are also performing a task in which you are visually searching 
for something, such as a person’s face, you will activate these areas: 
occipital cortex visual regions, face recognition areas in the right 
Perhaps the most 
publicized application 
of multitasking research 
concerns driving while 
using a cell phone.

	
48	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
hemisphere, memory regions to consider where you’ve looked, and 
frontal cortex attention allocation regions to guide eye movements. 


Some of these areas are unique to one task or another. Inherently, 
however, some of the areas are involved in both tasks. As you 
repeatedly switch between the tasks, you ask these overlapping 
circuits to rapidly perform two separate actions for brief periods. That 
alternation produces interference.


If you are multitasking, then, your brain just doesn’t work as well. It 
will be more fatigued at the end of the day—which may contribute 
to the sense that you have achieved a great deal. The information 
processing that your brain will have accomplished will be of a distinctly 
lower quality, however. One small study found that if you administer 
IQ tests under conditions of typical technological distraction, there is 
a drop in scores of about 10 points. You are, in a sense, not as smart 
when multitasking as you are when you are monotasking.
Multitasking Makes You More Distractible


One line of research set out to determine if people who were 
experienced multitaskers might be better at it than those who didn’t 
regularly engage in the practice. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, 
multitaskers deal with brain challenges by getting better at task-
relevant strategies. Specifically, the researchers hypothesized that 
experienced multitaskers might be better at focusing their attention 
on the key pieces of information that are most important for each 
task and filtering out the irrelevant information. However, the results 
of these studies demonstrated exactly the opposite. When you are 
multitasking, you are generally more distractible. 


Any environment contains potential distractions. We all learn to filter 
out these distractions and to keep our minds focused on the current 
task at hand. After a great deal of multitasking, however, our ability 
to filter out distractions is negatively impacted. If you multitask on a 

	
Lecture 6—The Myth of Multitasking	
49
regular basis, simply keeping your attention on any one task becomes 
more difficult, not less.


There are a number of solutions to these challenges, but they all 
revolve around the same strategy. You should practice doing only one 
task at a time—that is, single-tasking or monotasking. Think through 
the activities you want to do and pick one. Then, to the best of your 
ability, try to block out everything else before you begin working on it. 
Questions to Consider 
1.	 “Walking desks” that enable people to work while walking on a 
treadmill have become more popular recently. Getting exercise 
while also getting work done seems like a good idea, but is this 
multitasking? And if so, will the walking hinder the performance?
2.	 If multitasking reduces human cognitive performance, why do 
people report that it feels good to engage in multitasking? Is there 
an unconscious thought system that decides what feels good? And 
if so, what information is it using here?

Future You and Better 
Decisions
T
o improve your reasoning capability and make better decisions, a 
very effective strategy is to engage in mental time travel. Having a 
brief visit with your future self as you ponder what to do can result 
in a happier, healthier, and even wealthier future you. In this lecture, we 
examine strategies derived from research that will help us make better 
decisions—for example, keep your list of options short (around six items), 
keep the consequences of decisions concrete, and make decisions about 
categories in a progressive fashion. 
Temporal Discounting


Humans have a tendency to engage in temporal discounting—that is, 
we prefer to receive rewards sooner rather than later. In fact, we will 
often choose a smaller reward sooner over a larger reward later. 


From an economics perspective, there is some value to temporal 
discounting. If someone gives you some cash today, you could invest 
it, and it might increase in value over time. While temporal discounting 
is, in principle, sensible in small amounts, hundreds of studies have 
found that the human brain uses a temporal discounting rate that is 
far too high. If we can compensate for that tendency, our reasoning 
can be substantially improved.


Humans use temporal discounting not only with money, but with a 
broader class of choices, situations, and behaviors. For example, 
consider the decision between spending the day relaxing or spending 

	
Lecture 7—Future You and Better Decisions	
51
it working. The pleasure of relaxing is the small but immediate reward 
here. Reducing our tendency to engage in temporal discounting can 
reduce the likelihood of making the wrong choice. Mental time travel 
can help.
Your Future Self


Several researchers have described the mental process of reasoning 
through a decision as a negotiation between the present you and the 
future you. In some cases, we are very willing to incur costs that must 
be paid back by another person—a future you.


Brain imaging work conducted by Dan Gilbert and his colleagues 
has revealed quite a bit about how the brain mediates these internal 
negotiations. The area of the brain crucial to this process is termed 
the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). The VMPFC has many 
connections to the amygdala and is involved in reasoning about 
emotion-laden stimuli. More recently, this region has been found to 
be heavily involved in self-referential processing. 


Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers 
determined that when people think about themselves, there is a 
substantial surge of activity in the VMPFC. About six seconds after 
that increase in activity, there is a surge of blood flow in the region. If 
the person is thinking about other people, activity in this region of the 
brain drops. 


Participants in the Gilbert study were scanned in an fMRI while 
they made judgments about how much they would enjoy a range of 
pleasant tasks. In some cases, the participants judged how much they 
would enjoy doing this task within the next 24 hours. In other cases, 
the participants judged how much they would enjoy doing the task in 
the future, defined as “this time next year.” In addition to ratings of 
how much they would personally enjoy particular tasks in the present 
and the future, participants also made ratings of how they thought 
some other person would enjoy the task.

	
52	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


The experimenters determined that when participants think 
about themselves in the present, the VMPFC is very active. When 
participants think about others, either in the present or future, this 
VMPFC activity is significantly reduced. 


Here’s the interesting part. When participants think about themselves 
in the future, VMPFC activity drops. That is, they use the same brain 
systems involved in reasoning about other people. It’s as if the brain, 
at a very fundamental level, thinks of the future you as someone else. 
Mental Time Travel


Participants in the Gilbert study also completed a temporal 
discounting test, where they were offered various pairs of rewards 
and asked to select one. They were also given the choice between 
an immediate reward with no delay and a reward in several months. 
Based on many of these preference judgments, the experimenters 
could infer a monthly temporal discounting rate for each participant.


A fascinating pattern emerges when you look at the brains of 
the people with low and high temporal discounting rates. Some 
participants were so patient that they were willing to wait a month 
for even a small increase in the reward. They showed much smaller 
reductions in VMPFC activity when they shifted from thinking about 
their enjoyment of present and future tasks. 


The impatient participants were those who were willing to wait a 
month only if the monetary reward was much greater. This impatient 
group showed very large reductions in VMPFC activity. 


The data imply that when the patient participants thought about their 
future selves versus their present selves, their brains treated them 
very much the same. Conversely, the brains of the impatient people 
thought about their future selves in much the same way that they 
thought about other people, as strangers.

	
Lecture 7—Future You and Better Decisions	
53


Future discounting behavior is a problem that leads us to nonoptimal 
reasoning and decision making. Any choice is driven by a weighing of 
the positives and negatives associated with it. If something negative is 
pushed into the future, it doesn’t actually make it any less negative. If 
we can make that negative someone else’s problem, however, then it 
does make it less of a problem for us. Unfortunately, our brains think 
of our future selves as this someone else. This illusion leads to the 
reasoning problems.


Fortunately, there are a variety of ways to outsmart yourself here—
that is, ways to outsmart your present self—as you are pondering 
what to do next. One of the easiest strategies is to take a few minutes 
to think about the immediate future—that is, engage in mental time 
travel. Travel forward in your mind to the end of the day. Look back on 
the day you spent. Consider how you would feel if you spent the day 
one way. Think about how you would feel if you made the other choice.
Make Firm Decisions


As we make choices, we take advantage of some opportunities and 
inherently leave others behind. That can be an unpleasant experience. 
It’s quite common for people to ponder the “road not taken” in their 
past. Sometimes, we resist closing doors and instead seek to keep 
our options open as much as possible. While freedom of choice is 
something we value greatly, several recent lines of research suggest 
that there is such a thing as too much freedom of choice. In fact, 
when people are given too many options, they often report being less 
satisfied with the outcome. Some refer to this as analysis paralysis. 


Consider this study by Jack Brehm. The study begins with participants 
viewing a selection of six posters of famous paintings. The participants’ 
task is simply to rank these posters from their most favorite to 
least favorite. After the participants rank the posters and fill out a 
questionnaire, the experimenter offers them a gift. The two posters 
that are offered as a gift are whichever posters the participants picked 

	
54	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
as their third favorite and their fourth favorite. As you would expect, 
most people pick the poster that was their third favorite.


The participants are sent home and, after a delay of a few days, they 
are asked to come back to the lab again and re-rank the posters. 
Something very consistent happens: The poster that they picked—the 
third favorite—moves up in the rankings. The poster that was not picked 
drops in the rankings—on average, from fourth down to fifth place. 


In other words, once you decide on some option, your brain shifts its 
future preferences to perceive whatever you have chosen as being 
more positive. Whatever options you specifically have not chosen 
seem to decline in positivity. 


If you want to be happier with the decisions you make, then you 
should make them firmly, and then stick with them. If two choices 
seem to involve the same risks, benefits, positives, and negatives, 
When people are given too 
many options, they often 
report being less satisfied 
with the outcome. Some 
refer to this as analysis 
paralysis.

	
Lecture 7—Future You and Better Decisions	
55
then greater satisfaction can be obtained by confidently staying with 
one selection.
Reduce the Options


Another way to improve your reasoning about different choices is to 
do less of it. While we have a strong desire to maximize our options in 
life, we should, whenever possible, reduce the number of options to a 
relatively small number—around six seems ideal. Across a variety of 
studies, when the choices are limited to six or fewer, human decision 
making seems to function more optimally. 


Research supporting this strategy starts with a simple study 
performed by Sheena Iyengar and her colleagues when she was a 
graduate student at Stanford University. There was a grocery store 
nearby that sold 348 varieties of jellies and jams. The experimenters 
set up a tasting booth to let people try different jams.


Half the time, the experimenters set out samples of 24 different 
jams. Half the time, the booth only had 6 jams available to try. Many 
more people stopped to try jam when there were 24 to try; however, 
when there were only 6 jams offered, the customers were far more 
likely to buy jam. With the 24-jam display, about 3 percent of visitors 
purchased jam. With the 6-jam display, 30 percent of customers 
made a purchase. 
Make Consequences Concrete; Create Categories


In addition to reducing the number of options, Iyengar and her 
colleagues also recommend making the consequences of decisions 
concrete. For example, in studies in which people are asked to 
imagine specifically what their life will be like in the future, they tend 
to save and invest more. These studies provide more evidence for the 
benefits of mental time travel. 

	
56	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Another way to proceed with reasoning about decisions and keep 
the number of choices low is to make decisions about categories in a 
progressive fashion. Say that you are deciding where to take a vacation. 
One way of narrowing your master list from hundreds to six would 
be to divide your options into categories first, such as geographic 
location. Then, choose the type of trip, such as hiking, beach, or city 
tour. Now, your original master list of hundreds of potential trips has 
been winnowed down to a small number of possibilities.


By progressing in terms of small numbers of categories, a complex 
decision can be broken into a sequence of stepwise decisions that fit 
well within the constraints of the human brain.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 When you think of the future, the brain reasons about it as if the 
future you is a different person. Are there other situations in which 
you might think of yourself as another individual?
2.	 Too much freedom of choice seems to create problems for 
human decision making. Might this also be true in terms of how 
modern people—living in the world of Internet dating—select 
romantic partners?

or most people, their level of achievement and expertise in a domain 
is not predicted by any innate characteristic—physical or mental. It 
is, however, predicted by their level of experience and training. Here, 
we argue that the difference between experts and novices is not talent 
but practice—that is, the difference is quantitative, not qualitative. In this

such as the 10,000 hours of practice, deliberate practice, the significance

It is crucial to remember that even if you fail the first few times that 
you try to master something, that is not a predictor of your potential 
ability in that realm. There have been a number of studies aimed at 
predicting how adept someone will eventually be at some set of tasks. 
We usually call them aptitude tests. An IQ test is basically an aptitude 
test for later academic performance. 


Aptitude tests are used to try to assess people’s talent, ability, or 
aptitude for various skills. The impetus behind the use of aptitude 
tests is an implicit belief that is not supported by modern research 
on expertise, however. The implicit belief is that the aspects that will 
make you expert at something are already present in you at the time 
of the initial aptitude test. 

	
58	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


The data do not support this. In the entire multi-billion-dollar industry 
that is aptitude testing, the correlations that are found between talent 
and performance are consistently very small. The SAT predicts about 
nine percent of the variance in freshman grades. That is, if you know 
a student’s SAT score, you will be about nine percent more accurate 
at predicting performance than if you just took a guess. 
10,000 Hours of Practice


Innate talent does not provide a reliable prediction of overall 
performance. Practice does. 


Obviously, the more you practice, the better you become. What is not 
obvious is that no matter how much you have practiced, additional 
practice will always continue to produce more improvement, even 
after you’ve practiced for thousands of hours. 


Anders Ericsson and his research team have conducted some of the 
most detailed research on expertise. They’ve studied experts from 
many different domains: doctors, athletes, musicians, chess players. 
Across all these varied fields, a number of trends stand out. 


One trend is that the most rapid improvements arise as you are 
starting to learn something new. That is, in your first 100 hours of 
practice, you will improve by a certain amount. In the next 100 hours, 
you will still improve but will show less of an improvement than for 
those first 100 hours. Every 100 hours, you will continue to improve 
but will improve less than the previous 100 hours. 


As this process develops, many people perceive a plateau, which can 
create a sense that you are no longer improving. But it is extremely 
clear from dozens of studies that the upward progress toward better 
performance continues. The law of diminishing returns is at work 
here. The more you improve, the more energy you need to invest to 
improve further. But the returns never diminish all the way to zero. 

	
Lecture 8—How to Become an Expert on Anything	
59


When practice time increases, however, improvement becomes more 
rapid. According to Ericsson and his colleagues, a significant measure 
is cumulative hours of practice. In general, across a remarkably wide 
range of endeavors, expertise in some domain is achieved with 10,000 
hours of practice. If you have practiced something for 1,000 hours, 
you are likely to be proficient but not an expert. Something about 
that 10,000-hour number seems to represent a level of extraordinary 
achievement of mastery. 
Deliberate Practice


A variety of researchers have studied how experts practice and work 
and identified four principles that you should follow as you seek 
mastery. Ericsson coined the term deliberate practice to define these 
four principles:
1.	 When you engage in deliberate practice, you should focus your 
attention on the work with the intention to improve—that is, to be 
When you are 
learning something 
new, the most rapid 
improvements arise in 
the beginning.

	
60	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
better after you perform the practice than you were before you 
started.
2.	 Your practice should be targeted to your current level of skill. A 
task should be difficult enough to be challenging but not so difficult 
that it is impossible. 
3.	 After you attempt something, you should have access to 
immediate, informative feedback. The only way you can know 
when you have happened onto a process that works is if you are 
told which attempts were hits and which were misses.
4.	 Repeat the third step multiple times per practice session. Go 
over the same task again and again until it is clear that you have 
achieved mastery. 


Feedback is especially significant when you are beginning a new type 
of task. Before you invest too much time practicing on your own, find 
someone who is already an expert to give you instruction. An expert 
instructor will not only speed your initial improvements in your new 
endeavor but also lay a foundation for continued improvement. 
Efficiencies in Information Processing


Some of the best cognitive neuroscience work on the development 
of expertise comes from some elegant studies performed by Isabelle 
Gauthier, Michael Tarr, and their colleagues. The researchers were 
interested in two questions: how the brains of experts differ from 
the brains of novices, and how the brains of novices change as they 
become experts. 


To address both these questions, they had to invent a novel task—
one in which all participants would be novices. The participants 
would then practice and become experts. The researchers created 
a family of 3-D structures that they called Greebles. Each Greeble 
was given a particular name and categorized as part of a particular 
family. Participants in these studies would view individual Greebles 
and attempt to guess their individual and family names. 

	
Lecture 8—How to Become an Expert on Anything	
61


Initially, of course, the participants did very poorly. The number of 
individuals and families was large enough that this task required a 
great deal of practice. At various times during this training process, 
the participants practiced while they lay inside a functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The experimenters characterized 
the participants’ pattern of brain activation as they viewed Greebles 
and attempted to identify them.


If someone’s performance is especially expert, you would expect 
that they would be harnessing tremendous brain power. You might 
speculate that the participants, as they grew faster and more accurate, 
would have developed ways to recruit more brain regions to better 
support their performance. The results were exactly the opposite.


When participants were first learning to recognize Greebles, a broad 
expanse of the visual cortex and surrounding brain regions were 
boosted in activation. As expertise was developed, however, less 
of the brain exhibited boosts in activation. The areas that remained 
active became more active, but less cortical real estate was involved.


Similar results have come from studies of other types of experts. 
For instance, Christopher Jannelle and his colleagues studied rifle 
shooters, comparing the brain activity of experts and novices. In the 
moments leading up to the trigger pull, the experts showed a marked 
increase in activity in their left hemisphere and a marked decrease in 
right hemisphere activation. For novice shooters, both hemispheres 
remained generally active. A variety of studies like this suggest that 
expert performance doesn’t involve more brain activation; rather, 
experts are more efficient at processing information. 
The Quiet Eye


Related data from studies of eye-tracking movements of experts also 
fit the theory of efficiency in information processing. Joan Vickers was 
the first to characterize this phenomenon associated with experts: the 
quiet eye.

	
62	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


As we move around in the world, our eyes jump from place to place, 
scanning our surroundings. About three times per second, on average, 
we make one of these abrupt eye movements. Most of the movements 
are controlled outside of your conscious awareness, but as you focus 
on some task, you direct your eyes to the most relevant areas.


Experts exhibit remarkably long eye fixations leading up to when they 
perform some action. As they are about to act, their eye movements 
stop—sometimes for nearly a second. This is the phenomenon of the 
quiet eye. 


Becoming an expert seems to involve moving the eyes less, not 
more. Just as the patterns of brain activity in experts suggest less 
information processing, the changes in eye-scan patterns suggest 
experts are picking up less information as well. Becoming an expert, 
it seems, is about learning where the most relevant information is and 
where it is not. 
Einstellung, or “Mechanization of Thought” 


As you practice some endeavor and attempt to become an expert and 
achieve mastery, you will naturally gather information and develop 
neural circuits to process that information. Initially, this will likely 
be done in a very conscious fashion. As you practice, however, the 
task will become more automatic and will switch from more broad 
activation and conscious control to more focused activation and 
unconscious control.


Cognitive neuroscientists have found evidence for what they call 
Einstellung, which is German for “setting” or “attitude.” For brain 
researchers, it is usually defined as a “mechanization of thought.” 


If a researcher gives participants a number of problems that can all 
be solved using basically the same technique, two things happen. 
First, the participants get adept very quickly. They might not even 
be able to articulate the trick that they are using, but their brains 

	
Lecture 8—How to Become an Expert on Anything	
63
will discover it. Second, if you give these participants a new problem, 
one that cannot be solved with this same technique, they will find the 
new problem very difficult to solve. In some studies, the experienced 
participants were worse at solving the new problems than people who 
had no practice at all.


When you start to learn a new skill, you bring tremendous mental 
flexibility with you. As you become more skilled, however, you get 
faster but also become less flexible. Therefore, at the beginning of 
your learning process, it is especially helpful to have an instructor 
to nudge you in the right direction, get you focused on sources of 
information that are the most important, and to keep distinctive biases 
you have in your initial performance from becoming problematic. 
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Talent plays some role in determining how well someone performs 
a task, but the amount of experience-based improvements can 
play a larger role. Could someone have a talent for learning new 
skills? How could you measure such a talent? How could someone 
best make use of it?
2.	 What would you recommend to parents or grandparents as they 
encourage (or perhaps discourage) a child from undertaking a 
new endeavor? How might the child’s talent, preference, and 
personality influence your recommendations?

Lecture 9
Tune Up Your Brain with 
Meditation
I
n this lecture, we suggest that you spend about 20 minutes a day 
not thinking—or rather, engaging in the “not thinking” practice called 
meditation. A wealth of evidence demonstrates that if you spend time 
in meditation, your brain will function more efficiently and you will be 
less anxious, more creative, and generally healthier. The art and practice 
of meditation is older than cognitive neuroscience by many centuries; 
indeed, it is older than science itself. Historians and anthropologists 
believe that the earliest meditation was associated with religious practice. 
As you become practiced in performing a ritual, it becomes largely 
automatic, leaving your conscious mind to think about other concerns—
or nothing at all. 
Concentration Meditation and Mindful 
Meditation


Some researchers consider two broad categories of meditation: 
concentration meditation and mindful meditation. Both types of 
meditation typically involve sitting quietly in a place that is relatively 
free of distraction. 


Concentration meditation involves focusing your mind on something 
as completely as possible. Many people focus on their breathing. 
Some focus on a particular word—a mantra—repeating it over and 
over in their mind. In concentration meditation, by focusing only on 
one thing, you stop thinking about everything else that would normally 
occupy your mind. 

	
Lecture 9—Tune Up Your Brain with Meditation	
65


Mindfulness meditation is, in some respects, the opposite of 
concentration meditation. During mindfulness meditation, you seek to 
be aware of yourself and your surroundings without thinking about 
anything in particular. This notion of not thinking is somewhat foreign 
to most people. Our brains naturally tend to wander from thought to 
related thought all the time. This flow of ideas is what psychologists 
refer to as our stream of consciousness. 
How to Meditate


Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. There should be 
a clock nearby so you can check when you think about 10 minutes 
have elapsed. Find a comfortable chair, but stay upright. Taking a nap 
won’t do the job. 


Once you are in your chair, with the clock ready, close your eyes and 
simply try to put your brain in neutral. Let your thoughts wander and 
Some researchers consider

meditation. Both types of

66	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
observe what comes up. You might find yourself drawn to think about 
a particular problem or task or future plan. Let yourself think about 
it for a few moments, but try not to get drawn into a consciously 
driven set of thoughts. Whenever you notice that happening, don’t 
panic; simply decide to stop thinking about it and set your thoughts to 
wandering again. 


When you think about 10 minutes have passed, glance up at the clock. 
If you are like most people, it won’t be very close to 10 minutes yet. 
That’s okay. Just close your eyes again and continue. What you are 
doing is one of the simplest forms of meditation. 


Try to work up to meditating for 20 minutes at a time three or more 
times per week. Experiment with both concentration meditation and 
mindfulness meditation. If one of them feels better or easier, then go 
with that, but also feel free to switch back and forth depending on 
your mood on any given day.
Measuring the Effects of Meditation


A wide range of research has assessed the nature of how regular 
meditation affects your brain. One of the most common techniques 
has been to look at how patterns of electrical activity change in the 
brain during meditation. The electroencephalograph (EEG), which 
involves placing electrodes on the scalp, makes it possible to record 
and analyze the tiny amounts of electrical activity produced by 
neurons in the brain. The EEG has very good temporal resolution but 
relatively poor spatial resolution—that is, it determines when the brain 
is active but can’t tell where the activity is in much detail. 


To see spatial patterns in the brain more clearly, a technique that 
has been used to explore how your brain activity changes when you 
meditate is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI can 
record the amount of blood flow to different regions of the brain. 
When an area becomes more active, it uses up oxygen and fuel and 
creates waste products. Blood vessels in that brain region dilate to 

	
Lecture 9—Tune Up Your Brain with Meditation	
67
enable more blood flow to deliver more resources and carry away 
waste products. By looking at the circulation patterns, we can see 
what areas of the brain become more active. 


Both EEG and fMRI methods illustrate that the meditative brain 
is very active, particularly in certain areas. The particular areas 
that are activated seem to vary with the type of meditation that is 
practiced. If you engage in meditation focused on a particular word 
or mantra, language regions are activated. If you focus on being 
aware of particular parts of the body, increases in activity are seen in 
sensorimotor regions of the cortex. 
When people engage 
in meditation, they 
report higher levels of 
everyday happiness. 

	
68	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Several studies have found that during meditation, the amygdala 
and other subcortical regions associated with emotional processing 
become more active. Several studies have found that when people 
engage in meditation, they report higher levels of everyday happiness. 
Those who meditate also report fewer problems with regulating their 
own emotions. 
A Practice from Prehistory


Many researchers believe that people have historically spent a great 
deal of time meditating—even if they didn’t call it meditation per se. 
We think of modern life as being much easier and more convenient, 
but that’s a bit of a myth.


Humans have been around for about 300,000 years, as near as 
modern paleoanthropologists can figure. For about the first 280,000 
of those years, humans survived as hunters and gatherers. Their job 
was basically to harvest food that nature produced. When food was 
plentiful, it’s estimated that people could find what they needed to 
feed themselves and their children surprisingly quickly. 


Studies of the few remaining modern hunter-gatherer societies 
suggest that the work week for ancient humans was about two and 
a half days per week, at about six hours per day. Since then, of 
course, the world has changed a great deal. We work more hours, 
we live longer, and our world is much more defined by technology. 
But our brains are basically the same as those of our prehistoric 
ancestors. 


Humans have engaged in idle—perhaps meditative—thinking for 
millennia. It seems reasonable to expect that our modern brains have 
adapted to use this idle time effectively and perhaps even to depend 
on it for regular maintenance activities. 

	
Lecture 9—Tune Up Your Brain with Meditation	
69
Increases in Gray Matter


The MRI has shown that meditation can change the anatomical 
structure of your brain. In one study, a team led by Britta Hölzel 
recruited a group of 17 people who had signed up for a meditation 
course. As a control, they recruited 17 others who did not participate 
in the course. Before the course started, all the participants visited an 
MRI facility, where the researchers conducted a high-resolution scan 
of each participant’s brain anatomy. The meditation participants then 
took their meditation course.


Over the eight-week course, the participants reported engaging 
in about 23 hours of meditation practice. After this period, the 
researchers found increases in the gray matter concentration in 
several areas of the brain. The left hippocampus showed a clear 
effect, as did the posterior cingulate cortex, the left temporoparietal 
junction, and the cerebellum. 


The brain is made up of gray matter and white matter. The white 
matter consists primarily of myelin, a fatty substance that coats the 
axon part of neurons. The white matter enhances the efficiency and 
speed of neuronal communication. 


The gray matter of the brain is everything else: dendrites, cell bodies, 
and axons. Therefore, if your brain has more gray matter, it has more 
neurons. According to the Hölzel study, meditation practice caused 
the brains of those meditating to produce more neurons and to retain 
more of them over time. 
A Boost to Brain Neurons


The regions enhanced by meditation, as shown in the Hölzel study, 
are crucial areas of the brain. 
•• The hippocampus, a highly connected structure, plays a role in a 
wide range of functions ranging from memory to reasoning about 
how to navigate through the world. 

	
70	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
•• The posterior cingulate cortex is also highly connected and is 
considered part of the brain’s default network—the area of the 
brain that is activated regardless of what you are doing, even 
when you are doing nothing at all. It is associated with emotion 
regulation and the control of general arousal. 
•• The left temporoparietal junction contains a part of the brain 
referred to as the Wernicke area, which is heavily involved in our 
ability to parse and understand both written and spoken language. 
•• The cerebellum, densely packed with neurons, is a highly 
interconnected region of the brain that plays an important role 
in the control of body movement. Other research has suggested 
that the cerebellum also participates in computations about other 
complex interrelated systems, such as coordinating responses to 
threatening stimuli. 


Overall, the Hölzel study and many like it suggest that engaging in 
meditation practice on a regular basis, over the course of even a few 
weeks, can boost the number of neurons in the brain. Humans typically 
peak in terms of the overall number of neurons in their brain around 
three years of age. For the rest of your life, that number steadily 
declines. Age-related decline in cognitive function is presumed to be 
related to this general shrinkage of the brain. 
Enhanced Performance


Studies on the Stroop effect demonstrate that meditation also seems 
to enhance the ability to filter out miscellaneous information. Some 
studies have suggested that this improvement in attentional allocation 
happens not only on a long-term basis but also even shortly after a 
period of meditation. As you spend time allowing your brain to focus 
on one particular thing or allowing it to focus on nothing at all, after 
the meditation session, you improve your ability to concentrate on 
certain information in particular. 

	
Lecture 9—Tune Up Your Brain with Meditation	
71


In general, meditation is associated with increases in concentration, 
clearer thinking, and even creativity. Focusing on nothing at all 
actually requires a great deal of concentration. As you get more adept 
at not allowing intruding thoughts to enter your mind, you may be 
improving your ability to specifically allocate your attention to things 
when you aren’t meditating.


Whether or not you adopt the practice of meditating a few times 
a week, there is good evidence that you should meditate for 10 
minutes or so as you prepare to undertake any mentally challenging 
task. If you begin by meditating for a few minutes, studies of post-
meditation performance suggest that your cognitive performance will 
be enhanced.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Widely varying types of meditation seem to produce similar 
benefits in terms of health and mental well-being. Why might this 
be? Could activities that we don’t normally think of as meditation 
have meditation-like benefits? What are the characteristics of 
those activities?
2.	 What are the key differences between mindful meditation 
and simply thinking about things? Why do you suppose these 
differences matter in terms of brain activity as well as behavioral 
outcomes?

Lecture 10
Take the Sleep Challenge
L
et’s jump right into it: You should get about eight hours of sleep 
a night, almost every night. A wide variety of data suggest that 
when we don’t get eight hours of sleep per night, our cognitive 
performance is substantially reduced. Decision making, memory, control 
of physical movements, emotional regulation, memory, and even basic 
perception become more prone to error. Tests of intelligence, creativity, 
attention, and memory all show lower performance with cumulative sleep 
deprivation. In this lecture, we consider the consequences of lack of sleep, 
examine the stages of sleep and the importance of REM sleep, suggest 
ways to combat insomnia, and explain the relevance of circadian rhythms 
and blue-light wavelengths.
Four Stages of Sleep


The most important tool in the sleep researcher’s kit is the 
electroencephalograph (EEG), which records tiny electrical signals 
produced by neurons in the brain. Circuits in the brain produce 
variations in the amplitude of our brain waves. Some brain circuits 
oscillate quickly, producing high-frequency waves; other circuits cycle 
slowly, producing low-frequency waves. The EEG captures a sum of 
all the waves.


The first thing that a sleep scientist will do with this EEG data is to 
apply a mathematical process called a Fourier transform. The process 
decomposes the signals into the underlying frequencies, revealing 
how much energy is present in the brain at different frequencies. The 
outcome of the Fourier transform is called a power function.

	
Lecture 10—Take the Sleep Challenge	
73


When you are awake, your power function has a lot of energy in the 
range of 13 to 24 cycles per second. Sleep researchers refer to energy 
in this frequency range as beta waves. This power spectrum indicates 
an active, wakeful brain. As you relax and get ready to fall asleep, the 
energy in that beta range drops, while the energy in the alpha range 
of 8 to 12 cycles per second increases. (This also happens when you 
meditate.)


As you drift off to sleep, the energy in the alpha range drops off and 
is replaced by theta waves, which are in the range of 4 to 7 cycles 
per second. As this happens, you lose consciousness and are lightly 
asleep. Sleep researchers call this stage 1 sleep. You will typically 
remain in this state for 10 to 30 minutes before shifting into stage 2 
sleep. 


As you pass into each of the four stages of sleep, your brain continues 
to produce more energy in slower frequency ranges. In the deepest 
stage of sleep, your brain will be producing a great deal of delta wave 
activity, at a frequency of fewer than 4 cycles per second.
REM Sleep


During sleep, the energy output of the brain does not change 
significantly. The waves of activity that it produces are slower 
than when you are awake, but the deeper the sleep, the higher the 
amplitude. Your brain isn’t turning off when you go to sleep; rather, 
it’s shifting into a different mode of activity.


After you fall asleep, you remain in deep, delta-wave sleep for about 
half an hour. After this, your brain begins stepping up its rate of 
activity, producing fewer delta waves and more theta and beta waves. 
Now, you are back in stage 1 sleep. At this point, a remarkable set of 
changes occurs. The activity level of the brain becomes very much 
like that of someone who is awake. Lots of energy shows up in the 
alpha range. This is called REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.

	
74	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


While the brain becomes very active at this point, the muscles in most 
of the body become deeply relaxed. The muscles that control eye 
movements are an exception. The eyes become very active, darting 
back and forth, up and down, as if rapidly scanning something. These 
rapid eye movements are the feature that give the REM sleep stage 
its name. This is also the stage at which we dream.
Significance of REM Sleep


There is a wealth of evidence that during REM sleep, your brain does 
essential work that supports regular brain function.


We tend to dream about what has happened during the recent past—
indeed, most frequently about what happened the previous day. Early 
in the evening, those dreams will tend to be very literal; later in the 
evening, the dreams tend to become more abstract. 
Your brain isn’t turning 
off when you go to sleep; 
rather, it’s shifting into a 
different mode of activity.

	
Lecture 10—Take the Sleep Challenge	
75


This replay and abstraction process is critical to optimal memory, 
high-level creativity, and problem-solving ability. What’s more, those 
memories seem to be consolidated during the following night of 
REM sleep. If you prevent someone from getting REM sleep, detailed 
memory for experiences and learning will suffer. Cognitive function 
also declines. 


Your brain needs REM sleep like it needs nutritious food. The vast 
majority of your REM sleep takes place in the last two sleep cycles 
of an eight-hour sleep session. If you reduce your sleep by a couple 
of hours a night, you might feel that you’ve still gotten most of a 
good night’s sleep. In terms of total hours, that’s correct: You’ve only 
missed out on about 25 percent of your sleep time. But in terms of 
REM sleep time, you may have cut your night down by 40 percent.
Power Napping


Napping can be destructive to REM sleep. If you nap for 90 minutes, 
you will get a full sleep cycle in, including a brief bit of REM sleep. 
However, if that reduces the amount of sleep you get the following 
night, even by a couple of hours, you will greatly reduce the total 
amount of REM sleep by as much as 40 percent.


Consider the workplace power nap, a topic that has been the subject of 
much scientific investigation over the past few decades. The thinking 
is that if people nap for 20 minutes, employers can get a lot more 
productive work out of them the rest of the day. That sounds better 
than dealing with a groggy employee performing poor (or no) work. 


The good news for power nappers is that a nap of 20 to 60 minutes 
(less than a full sleep cycle and without REM sleep) does boost 
cognitive function in many people, who demonstrate faster reaction 
times, better working memory, and enhanced problem-solving abilities. 


The bad news for power nappers is that essentially all this data has 
been collected from experiment participants who were sleep deprived. 

	
76	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
If you are sleep deprived, a power nap will help you. If you are not 
sleep deprived, then you probably won’t nap when you are given the 
opportunity—and the power nap won’t help.
Combating Insomnia


Insomnia, or trouble falling or staying asleep, is a condition that 
affects millions of people. A study by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention found that 9 million Americans are regular users 
of prescription sleep medication. A problem is that standard sleep 
medications disrupt REM sleep. What’s more, humans develop a 
tolerance to sleep medications and supplements such as melatonin.


The best way to combat insomnia is to strengthen your unconscious 
association between your bedroom and sleep. Many people who 
report problems with insomnia also perform other activities while 
sitting in bed—they watch movies, work on the computer, make calls, 
and even eat meals.


The unconscious systems that regulate your sleep associate all these 
non-sleep activities with your bed. Over time, after you change your 
associations with your bedroom, your unconscious mind will learn to 
sleep normally again. If you put a tired body into a fully dark, quiet, 
cool, comfortable space and make it lay very still for a while, it is very 
likely to fall asleep.
Circadian Rhythms


Before you go to bed, there are a few steps that you can take to 
ensure an effective night of sleep. Avoid bright lights—especially lights 
with a blue component to them—for several hours before bedtime. 
Bright incandescent or fluorescent lights are bad; computer screens 
and LED television screens are even worse. Consider how the brain 
and our eyes regulate sleep. 

	
Lecture 10—Take the Sleep Challenge	
77


First, proper sleep relies on a 24-hour timing cycle—a circadian 
rhythm—maintained by the brain, particularly the part of the brain 
that regulates sleep function. Second, the clock in your head runs 
slowly. Fortunately, that clock has a natural mechanism for setting 
the right time every day. Third, there is a great deal of blue light in 
light that doesn’t look blue.


The internal clock inside your brain is a tiny region called the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus, which contains about 20,000 neurons. 
It is located in the hypothalamus, right above the optic chiasm, the 
place where the optic nerves from your two eyes come together. 
Every evening, the clock triggers a cascade of physiological events. It 
causes the release of melatonin, a hormone that works to lower your 
heart rate and body temperature and eventually to bring on sleep. 
There is one problem with the clock: It runs a bit slow—about one 
hour slow each day.
The best way to combat 
insomnia is to strengthen 
your unconscious 
association between your 
bedroom and sleep.

	
78	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Researchers have conducted studies in which participants lived in an 
environment without external time cues, sequestered in an isolated 
basement living area. All clocks were removed, as were other time 
cues. The participants in these studies were allowed to turn the lights 
on and off whenever they wanted. When they felt it was time to go to 
sleep, they could turn the lights out and do so. 


The participants slept for about eight hours a night. However, each 
eight hours of sleep started about 25 hours after the last one started. 
The human circadian rhythm clock directed the normal sleep pattern, 
but it waited consistently longer than 24 hours from cycle to cycle.
Blue-Light Wavelengths


The suprachiasmatic nucleus has a reset mechanism: sunlight. In 
1998, researchers discovered a type of receptor in the human retina 
that is critical to this process. These receptors, called melanopsin 
retinal ganglion cells, connect almost directly from the eye, down the 
optic nerve, and then to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. 


These particular receptors are most sensitive to blue-light 
wavelengths. Sunlight—even bright-white sunlight—contains an 
evenly distributed mix of many wavelengths of light, including blue. 
When this blue-frequency light strikes the receptors, it disrupts the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus function. If you look at a computer screen, it 
greatly reduces your brain’s release of melatonin. 


On the flip side, when you wake up, first thing in the morning, you 
should look out a window at blue sky. Or if your daily schedule calls 
for you to rise before the sun, you can downregulate your melatonin 
production and wake up more quickly by staring at a computer screen 
or television. Broad-spectrum or bluish illumination, especially bright 
illumination, will reset your internal clock and get your brain active 
and on its way.

	
Lecture 10—Take the Sleep Challenge

Questions to Consider 
1.	 Studies of preindustrial sleeping behaviors have uncovered 
evidence of what is called second sleep. After going to bed around 
sunset, many people awaken around midnight, engage in singing, 
prayer, or other activities for about an hour, and then go back 
to sleep until sunrise. How does this fit with our discussion of 
healthful sleep habits?
2.	 Lack of sleep is often related to poor decision making—even about 
when to sleep. The theory is that if we don’t sleep enough tonight, 
we can simply get some extra sleep tomorrow. How might mental 
time travel be used to improve upon this problematic decision?

Boost Insights and Creativity
C
reativity may well be the most valuable product of our brain 
functions. Constant innovation is a hallmark of human history. 
Only in the last few decades have researchers studied creativity 
from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, however. In this lecture, 
we present the findings of scientific studies that support strategies to 
boost creativity. 
Remote Associates Test


To develop more creative solutions, listen to happy music. One of 
the best studies of this effect, conducted by Gene Rowe and his 
colleagues, used a type of puzzle called a remote associates test. 
In the remote associates test, you are given three words. Your task 
is to come up with a fourth word that is closely associated with all 
three. For example, say that the three words are “cottage,” “Swiss,” 
and “cake.” The related fourth word is “cheese”—creating “cottage 
cheese,” “Swiss cheese,” and “cheesecake.”


While these are simply word puzzles, a significant step in most 
creative processes is to consider how very different pieces of 
information relate to one another. 


Participants in the Rowe study were randomly assigned to one of 
three mood-induction conditions: positive, negative, and neutral. In 
the positive condition, participants listened to a jazz version of one of 
Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos. Participants in the negative condition 
listened to Prokofiev’s music score of Alexander Nevsky. For the 
neutral condition, participants read a series of facts and figures about 
Canada.

	
Lecture 11—Boost Insights and Creativity	
81


After 10 minutes engaged in one of these three tasks, participants in 
the positive condition gave higher ratings of their positive mood level; 
neutral participants were in the middle; and the negative group’s 
moods were significantly lower. Participants then engaged in the 
remote associates test. 


As you might guess, the performance tracked with the mood level. 
People who listened to the positive music answered significantly more 
remote associates test questions correctly. To the extent that this 
test taps into significant aspects of creativity, we can conclude that 
listening to happy music boosts creativity.
Eriksen Flanker Task


The Eriksen flanker task was also performed by participants in 
the three experimental mood-induction conditions. In this test, 
participants watch a computer screen and respond as quickly as 
possible to the appearance of a letter in the middle of the screen. The 
task is to focus your attention on one location on the screen and to 
ignore flanker letters. 


Listening to happy music makes you worse at this task. Listening to 
sad music, however, improves performance. The researchers argue 
that a happy mood broadens your focus of attention and makes your 
brain more open to considering a wider range of diverse information. 
Sudden Insight


Mark Beeman has studied brain activation during remote associates 
tests using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the 
electroencephalograph (EEG). Beeman was keenly interested in the 
experience of sudden insight when we try to solve complex problems.


In Beeman’s studies, whenever participants had an insight experience, 
they would press an insight button. Beeman’s analysis of the brain-
imaging data revealed that a particular region in the anterior superior 

	
82	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
temporal gyrus became very active shortly before this moment of 
insight. This area is located at the top of the right temporal lobe. 


Three-tenths of a second before participants pushed the insight 
button, a burst of high-frequency activity was emitted from the 
anterior superior temporal gyrus. This region is associated with many 
tasks involved in integrating distant semantic relations or finding 
connections between information that is only loosely related. 
Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous 
Systems


Research on the sympathetic and parasympathetic portions of our 
autonomic nervous system can help explain why happy music affects 
the brain regions associated with creativity. When we find ourselves 
in threatening, potentially dangerous situations, we activate our 
sympathetic nervous system. This prepares our body for a potential 
fight-or-flight reaction, aimed at increasing the likelihood of survival. 


When we don’t sense a threat, our body activates the parasympathetic 
nervous system and enters into a tend-and-befriend mode of 
processing. Activation of the parasympathetic system is associated 
with complex cognition and creative problem solving. 
Alternative Uses Test


Walking is associated with boosting happiness as well as creativity. 
Marily Oppezzo and her colleagues explored this phenomenon with 
a task that has often been used to assess creativity: the alternative 
uses test. In this test, participants are given four minutes to come up 
with as many different uses as they can for a common object.


Oppezzo’s group had their participants complete the remote 
associates test and the alternative uses test while participating in one 
of several experimental conditions. Some participants sat in a chair; 
others stood; some walked inside or outside; and some were pushed 

	
Lecture 11—Boost Insights and Creativity	
83
in a wheelchair. Walking significantly boosted the creativity of the 
study participants.
Stimulate Your Brain with Variety


The best creative thinkers tend to be those who engage in a wide variety 
of tasks. In typical studies, researchers have surveyed participants 
about the variety of activities they pursue. The participants then 
complete tasks such as the remote associates test and the alternative 
uses test. In general, the more varied the participants’ typical activities, 
the higher they score on tests of creative thinking. 


If you feel stuck with a particular problem or set of challenges and 
want to develop more creative solutions, try something new. Doing so 
can stimulate your brain in novel ways. 


As your senses (and body) are stimulated with a wide variety of 
different inputs, the internal state of your brain’s activation will tend to 
vary more as well. Finding a creative connection between two pieces 
of information will only happen if the brain circuits that encode those 
two pieces of information are active at the same time. If you increase 
the variety of ways in which your brain is stimulated, this increases 
the chance of sparking these unusual co-activations.
Avoid Pre-crastination


A successful strategy associated with improved problem solving and 
creative work in general is to do nothing—at least not right away. 
Simply take some time to think about the problem or your general 
goals before you seriously undertake the work of addressing them. 


Counterintuitively, doing nothing for a little while is effective advice for 
overcoming procrastination. For the purposes of creativity, however, 
there is evidence that doing nothing can also help avoid the opposite 
problem, known as pre-crastination. 

	
84	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Pre-crastination is the tendency to begin work prematurely on some 
critical task simply for the sake of getting it done and out of the way, 
even when the timing is detrimental to success. A few studies have 
found that procrastinators often come up with more creative solutions 
to problems. More thinking leads to more creativity in general. 
The Incubation Effect


Another effective strategy is to stop working and spend some time 
thinking in the midst of solving a problem or working on a creative 
project. Several studies have found evidence for the incubation 
effect. The general model of these studies is to give people a difficult 
problem to solve that will take several minutes. 
In the midst of solving a 
problem or working on a 
creative product, an effective 
strategy is to stop working and 
spend some time thinking.

	
Lecture 11—Boost Insights and Creativity	
85


In an incubation study, half the participants are randomly assigned to 
a control condition and are given several minutes to solve the problem. 
Some will solve it; some will not. The experimental group is given 
half as much time to work on the problem and then forced to take a 
break. This group is given another task to perform during that time and 
specifically instructed not to think about the problem during the break.


After the break, participants in the experimental group are allowed to 
work on the original problem. At the end of this second work phase, 
both the control and experimental participants will have had the same 
amount of time to work directly on the problem. 


In the many studies of the incubation effect, more of the experimental 
participants solve the problem than control participants. During the 
break period, although the experimental group participants aren’t 
explicitly working on the problem, many have argued that their brains 
may still be implicitly and unconsciously chipping away at the problem. 


The break period is often referred to as the time when the problem 
solution is incubating. Neuroscientists speculate that during the 
incubation period, the neuronal circuits involved in solving the 
problem remain active, continuing to search for associations and 
possible solutions. 
REM Sleep


Several studies suggest that if you include some sleep and dreaming 
in the incubation period, the effects are significantly enhanced. Denise 
Cai and her colleagues presented sleep-deprived participants with a 
set of remote associates test items along with challenging analogy 
problems. Some were answered correctly during an initial session, 
while others were not. The participants then took a nap or stayed 
awake while resting quietly for 90 minutes.


Some participants in the nap group entered the rapid eye movement 
(REM) phase of sleep, which is strongly associated with dreaming. 

	
86	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
The participants who produced REM sleep returned to the problems 
and performed significantly better than the quiet-rest group and even 
the nap participants who did not exhibit REM sleep.


Sleep research suggests that your brain enters the REM stage of 
sleep several times every night. During REM sleep, the brain partially 
replays experiences of the previous day, consolidates them into long-
term memory, and seems to find abstract relations between different 
sources of information. All this is helpful for creativity and problem 
solving. 
1 Percent Inspiration, 99 Percent Perspiration


That sudden insight that comes right before the solution to a complex 
problem is a magical experience—but it represents the end of the 
creative process, not the beginning. To be creative, you have to work 
at it very diligently. 


In fact, most successful creative people are extremely disciplined 
about when they work and even where they work. Thomas Edison 
famously said that genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent 
perspiration.


Most people think of creativity as unbridled thought and consider the 
creative process as a practice in which you simply wait for an inspired 
solution to come to mind. The tips outlined here will all help with 
creativity, but they won’t work in isolation. Even if you listen to happy 
music, incubate your thoughts across a night of sleep and dreaming, 
take a walk, avoid pre-crastination, stimulate your brain with variety, 
or give yourself time to think before you start working, you will still 
need to invest substantial effort in actively working to find creative 
ideas and solutions.

	
Lecture 11—Boost Insights and Creativity	
87
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Many creative thinkers have credited the use of particular drugs 
with boosting their creativity. How does this fit with the current 
understanding of the creative process? How does it contradict it?
2.	 Incubation research suggests that our brain unconsciously 
continues to work on solving problems even as we direct our 
attention to something else. Might it be that the mental break 
improves later performance even if there is no unconscious 
problem-solving system engaged in ongoing processing? Could an 
experiment answer this question? Does it matter in terms of how 
you use incubation to enhance your creative problem solving?

Enhance Performance with 
Imagery
W
illiam Arthur Ward famously said, “If you can imagine it, you 
can achieve it.” The human imagination is an extraordinarily 
powerful instrument. In this lecture, we explore how the brain 
makes use of mental imagery and outline the process for outsmarting 
yourself into using mental imagery to enhance your visuomotor skills, 
cognitive abilities, and even social and emotional capabilities. 
The Power of Imagination


Following is an astonishing example of what the human imagination 
can accomplish.


Imagine that you are standing with your legs about shoulder-width 
apart. Feel the pressure of the solid floor against your feet. Feel your 
body swaying back and forth, ever so slightly, the way that it usually 
does when you stand very still. In your right hand, imagine holding a 
heavy barbell. The texture of the metal is rough, and the barbell feels 
cooler than your skin where it touches your hand. 


Maintain a clear image of that in your mind. Now, imagine lifting the 
barbell all the way to your shoulder. When you’ve bent your arm as 
far as it will go, lower the barbell slowly until it’s back at your side. 
Imagine relaxing your arm. 


Note that physically you have done nothing with that arm; rather, your 
brain did a lot of work imagining what your body was doing. While 

	
Lecture 12—Enhance Performance with Imagery	
89
your brain gets a great deal of exercise, what is even more amazing is 
that your muscles get a workout as well.
The Shackell and Standing Study


Erin Shackell and Lionel Standing designed one of the best studies 
demonstrating the remarkable effects of mental imagery. Their 
research team recruited participants and tested the strength of 
their hip flexor muscles. Once the participants’ baseline strength 
had been assessed, they were randomly assigned to one of three 
conditions. 


The control participants left and returned two weeks later. Participants 
in the physical-training condition undertook a strength training 
program for their hip flexors. Participants in the mental-training 
condition were shown the hip flexor machine during the first visit, 
but they did not use it for the next two weeks. Instead, they imagined 
using it. Specifically, they imagined performing the same exercise that 
the physical-training participants actually performed.


At the end of the study, everyone returned to the gym for a repeat 
of the strength assessment. Participants in the physical-training 
group increased their performance on the strength test by 36 
pounds. Participants in the control group did not change significantly. 
Participants in the mental-training group, without ever touching the 
weight machine, improved their hip flexor strength by 32 pounds—
just a few pounds less than the physical-training group. 
The Science behind the Study


To understand the extraordinary results of the Shackell and Standing 
study, consider how your brain controls your muscles. Contraction 
of a muscle is caused by a continuous train of signals sent from 
the brain via the spinal cord to the efferent nerves embedded within 
the muscle tissue. As these neuronal signals arrive, muscle fibers 
contract.

	
90	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


The overall power that a muscle produces is a function of how big the 
muscle fibers are and how many of the muscle fibers contract. When 
you use physical training to enhance muscle strength, you increase 
how many fibers respond, and you enhance the size of the muscle 
fibers. When you fatigue and damage those muscle fibers during 
physical training, the body responds by repairing them and making 
them a little bigger than they were initially. Physical training makes 
muscles bigger.


Mental training, by contrast, doesn’t change the size of muscle fibers 
very much. Imagery, however, seems to increase the strength of the 
signals sent to the muscles. After imagery practice, when you make 
an actual movement, your motor cortex will become more active 
than it otherwise would be. A greater number of action potentials is 
conveyed to the muscles, causing a greater number of muscle fibers 
to respond when your brain calls on them to do so. The result is that 
more force is generated by the muscles. 
When you use physical training 
to enhance muscle strength, 
you increase how many muscle 
fibers respond, and you enhance 
the size of the muscle fibers.

	
Lecture 12—Enhance Performance with Imagery	
91
Imagination and Neural Processing


Many areas of the brain participate in mental-imagery processes. It 
has been known for more than a century that crucial visual processing 
takes place in the visual cortex in the occipital lobe, located in the 
back of your brain. 


There are connections from certain places on your light-sensitive 
retina to particular locations in the occipital lobe. If light is projected 
onto your eyes, a region of the visual cortex will become active. 


Stephen Kosslyn and his colleagues placed study participants in a 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner in complete 
darkness. Kosslyn then asked participants to imagine a spot of light. 
When they did, an area of the occipital lobe became active. When 
he asked them to imagine a larger spot of light, a larger area of the 
occipital lobe became active.


This basic relationship between imagination and neural processing 
has been found across a large number of domains. When you imagine 
moving your arm, the part of your cortex that is activated when you 
actually move your arm becomes active. When you imagine hearing a 
sound, activation appears in the auditory cortex.
Four Key Aspects of Imagery Practice


If you’ve ever watched a professional athlete—or even any expert—
you’ve likely seen how visual imagery is used to enhance visuomotor 
performance. Before performing, good athletes will use their 
imagination to simulate the action. Such a strategy is well supported 
by research. Performance is essentially always better when athletes 
imagine the task beforehand. 


Hundreds of studies have provided evidence for the effects of imaging 
performance. Large-scale analyses have pulled together data from 
thousands of participants and identified four key aspects of imagery 
practice. 

	
92	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
1.	 The mental rehearsal should be from a first-person perspective. 
When you imagine making a golf putt, you should mentally view it 
from the perspective of your own eyes.
2.	 The imagery should be multimodal. To get the most out of imagery, 
you want to mentally simulate the full sensory experience—
including even the parts that don’t seem directly relevant to 
performance. 
3.	 The imagery should be precise. Our mental images of things 
also contain conceptual information. Indeed, for mental visual 
images, the identity of the object is much clearer than the sensory 
information itself. 
4.	 Imagine succeeding when you perform the task. In the golf 
example, the ball should go in the hole. Mental images not only 
activate sensory and motor processing areas of the brain, but 
they also activate semantic processing. Semantic information is 
associated with labels, such as “success” and “failure.” 
The Science behind the Semantics


Patterns of activity in the sensory areas of our cortex produced by 
actual sensory input are created in a bottom-up fashion. The activity 
of sensory neurons identifies low-level features of the input and builds 
up a mental representation of the state of the outside world. 


On the other hand, patterns of activity in the sensory areas of our 
cortex produced by imagined sensory input are created in a top-down 
fashion. Our brain starts with a high-level, rough description of the 
imagined world and then activates the lower-level features that are 
associated with it. Starting with a particular high-level, semantically 
labeled description of the world is a crucial part of effective mental 
imagery.


Although imagined visual images are processed in the same regions 
of the brain as actual visual images, they aren’t the same thing. When 
we think of those parts as separate objects, they retain that identity 
in the image. Integrating them together as a unit simply doesn’t work. 

	
Lecture 12—Enhance Performance with Imagery	
93
Your mental images are images plus attached information about 
the identities and roles of the parts. For a successful visual-imagery 
practice, it’s important that your mental rehearsal of the activity 
contains that semantic label of “successful” right from the start.
Long-Term Benefits of Mental Imagery


In addition to research supporting an immediate advantage of using 
mental imagery, many studies have shown long-term benefits.


If you find yourself suffering through an injury or experiencing physical 
fatigue that prevents you from practicing or exercising, here’s how to 
improve. It’s a fact that your muscles get tired faster than your brain. 
Even when your body isn’t ready for more, the brain might be. This can 
be an especially good time to use mental practice as a supplement to 
physical practice. There is good evidence that mental imagery, used 
three or four times per week, can result in improvements in a wide 
range of different physical activities.
Therapists work 
on flexibility and 
strength of the 
affected limb, and 
over time, some 
function is typically 
recovered.

	
94	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Mental imagery may even help you to recover faster from an injury. 
An extreme case has been studied by Jennifer Stevens and her 
colleagues. They recruited patients who had suffered strokes that 
resulted in near-paralysis of the arm on one side of the body. The 
normal rehabilitation strategy for this condition takes a bottom-up 
strategy: Therapists work on flexibility and strength of the affected 
limb, and over time, some function is typically recovered. 


Stevens and her team developed a top-down strategy, in which 
participants engaged in mental-imagery exercises. They imagined 
moving the limb in ways that it could no longer move. When this 
practice was used in combination with standard rehabilitation 
techniques, participants exhibited increased recovery of motor 
function. Their limbs even got stronger when imagery was used.
Hebbian Learning


Mental imagery has the immediate effect of warming up the particular 
brain circuits that will ultimately be responsible for controlling an 
action. Because mental imagery provides low-level activation to these 
brain regions, they are able to function more efficiently when the time 
comes to perform for real.


A second, slower effect of mental-imagery practice has to do with 
refining patterns of neuronal connectivity. Everything you do is 
controlled by networks of neurons that fire in a precise, coordinated 
order. When you imagine performing a task, those neurons become 
more strongly connected to one another. 


Donald Hebb was noted for discovering that when two neurons 
become active at the same time, they tend to become more strongly 
connected to each another. Conversely, if there are two connected 
neurons and only one of them is active, then the connection between 
them tends to be weakened. This fundamental property of neurons 
has come to be known as Hebbian learning, and it has been implicated 
in nearly all experience-dependent learning that we do. 

	
Lecture 12—Enhance Performance with Imagery	
95


Hebb summarized the process with a very simple phrase: “Neurons 
that fire together, wire together.” When you engage in mental imagery, 
you are giving your neural networks extra repetitions of a behavior in 
which they can engage in this Hebbian learning process. 
Questions to Consider 
1.	 When you practice a new activity with the goal of developing 
expertise, it is critical that you get feedback on your behaviors. For 
example, after you try to make a basketball free throw, you need 
to know if your actions produced a successful shot. In imagery 
practice, however, your brain generates the outcome. How can 
both real-world and imagery practice be so beneficial?
2.	 There is strong evidence that positive imagery helps to enhance 
performance and outcomes. Some people, however, engage in 
too much imagery: They dream big but never seem to make those 
dreams a reality. How can you tell when you have engaged in too 
much imagery practice and not enough real-world action?

Overcome Your Aging Brain
B
eyond about 20 years of age, many basic aspects of human brain 
function decline. While currently there is no way to fully and 
permanently prevent this process, there are a variety of ways to 
slow the decline and even to compensate for the decline that does occur. 
The human brain seems remarkably capable of compensating for age-
related changes as long as you remain active and engaged in both routine 
as well as novel challenging behaviors. What’s more, these behaviors 
also have the potential to greatly enrich the quality of your life—and the 
function of your brain—at any age.
Age-Related Decline of Cognitive Function


Cognitive neuroscience research suggests that an effective way to 
fight age-related mental decline is to take up an activity you have 
never done before. It is best if you find the activity very challenging—
mentally and perhaps physically. Try to make it a new activity every 
month.


To understand why this is a successful strategy for countering the 
effects of aging on the brain, consider what causes the decline of 
mental function. Until you are about two years of age, your brain 
grows in both its size and the number of neurons. During early 
development, the brain is programmed to overproduce neurons. 


Then, the process during childhood and early adulthood involves the 
planned elimination of an enormous number of these neurons. This 
process, often referred to as neuronal pruning, is central to improving 
the function of the brain as we mature.

	
Lecture 13—Overcome Your Aging Brain	
97


Around 20 years of age, the human brain seems to peak in terms of 
many basic functions assessed by cognitive tests. This is the time 
when most people are fastest in reaction time and decision-making 
ability. Our capacity to alternate rapidly between two different tasks is 
best around this age. Our ability to focus our attention completely on 
one location in space while ignoring peripheral locations peaks as well. 


These peaks, however, refer only to specific tests of isolated cognitive 
faculties, such as memory, attention, and processing speed. They do 
not apply to complex behaviors, such as writing, problem solving, 
and creativity. In terms of many complex behaviors, humans usually 
continue to improve beyond 20 years of age. 
Cognitive neuroscience research 
suggests that an effective way to 
fight age-related mental decline 
is to take up an activity you have 
never done before.



While age-related decline in cognitive function is significant, it is 
smaller than we used to think. Florian Schmiedek and her colleagues 
looked in detail at cognitive function differences between younger and 
older adults. They recruited a large number of participants between 
20 and 30 years old and another group between 65 and 80 years old. 
The participants performed a variety of different cognitive tests 10 
times on 10 different days over the course of about two months. 


On memory tests, young adults scored around 0.25. Older adults 
scored around 0.15. That seems like a significant drop, but this test 
was aimed at the very peak of rapid encoding and memory abilities. 
When the task was slowed down enough, these memory differences 
became substantially smaller.


It’s also worth noting that some abilities decline much more slowly 
than others. For instance, our procedural memory—the memory 
for how to perform tasks—declines very slowly. What’s more, our 
implicit memory seems barely to decline at all. Implicit memory is our 
encoding of information and associations that seem familiar, even if 
we can’t explicitly remember where the knowledge comes from.
Brain Shrinkage and Neuronal Death


A main reason that basic cognitive faculties decline beyond 20 years 
of age is that the brain shrinks. Neurons die off faster than they are 
replaced, leaving us with a smaller brain.


The cells in your brain are organized in an extraordinarily intricate 
fashion. Your memories and skills are built into the patterns of 
connections between billions of brain cells. When new cells are added 
into this system, the process of integrating them into those existing 
circuits takes a lot of work. Those new cells have to learn to contribute 
to the existing computational system. As neurons die off, the brain 
loses some of its computational ability.

	
Lecture 13—Overcome Your Aging Brain



The human brain is remarkably robust, however. When we encode 
a memory, it’s not saved in a single place. All our memories are 
encoded across thousands—in some cases, millions—of neuronal 
cells. If a few of those cells die, the memory will still be accessible. 
If a few neurons involved in performing some skill are destroyed by 
injury, you will still be able to perform that skill. But if enough neurons 
die off, eventually the system is compromised, and the basic abilities 
measured by cognitive testing decline.


Neurons die as a result of physical injury, disease, or circulatory issues 
that prevent blood from flowing to a region of the brain. The majority 
of neuronal death, however, is a result of simple inactivity. Neurons 
exhibit bursts of electrochemical activity called action potentials that 
cause signals to be sent to neurons nearby. If one neuron receives 
enough signals from excitatory neurons around it, then that neuron 
may be excited enough to exhibit its own action potential. 


Action potentials make up the code that our brain uses to perform 
computations that support our perception, cognition, and action 
control. Those action potentials are also a critical part of the neuronal 
cells’ physiology. It’s part of how they pull nutrients and oxygen from 
the bloodstream and how they expel waste products. If a neuron 
stops exhibiting action potentials long enough, it will starve. 
Try New Activities


The best way to reduce age-related brain shrinkage is to keep your 
brain active. Physical activity—even moderate exercise like walking—
inspires neural activation and even the creation of new neurons in 
certain areas of the brain. 


One of the best ways to inspire broad-based neural activity, however, 
is to try new activities. As we become more experienced at some 
activity, our brain becomes faster and more accurate in producing the 
proper actions at the right times. As we become very expert at that 
activity, several lines of research have shown that we don’t employ 

	
100	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
more of our brain to support the activity. On the contrary, we learn 
to use less of our brain, developing specialized circuits that rapidly, 
automatically mediate the task performance. 


To maintain brain health, you need to stimulate your brain. What 
is counterintuitive is that one of the best ways to broadly stimulate 
brain activity is to take on new activities—activities for which you are 
specifically not an expert. The more challenging the task, the more 
of your brain will be recruited to support it, and the less your brain 
will shrink.
Laugh a Lot


There is good evidence that laughter helps keep your brain especially 
stimulated. A great deal of progress has been made in understanding 
our brain’s processing of humor. One of the central mechanisms is 
incongruity detection and then resolution.


As your brain identifies incongruity and then corrects its initial 
interpretation of the incongruity, it engages a remarkably wide range 
of brain areas. Language areas become more active when a stimulus 
is funny. The medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, 
precuneus, superior temporal gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus 
show similar boosts in activation. Laughter is also associated with a 
substantial release of dopamine into the pleasure circuits of the brain. 


When you watch funny movies, listen to or read funny stories, or have 
a funny conversation with a friend, your brain lights up in terms of 
widely distributed activity.
Overcome Limitations


To outsmart the aging brain, in addition to trying new activities, 
it’s important to keep performing familiar activities. As our basic 
cognitive faculties slowly decline, one of the ways we maintain 
our performance—indeed, one of the ways we often improve our 

	
Lecture 13—Overcome Your Aging Brain	
101
performance—is by developing ways to compensate for those 
losses. 


Timothy Salthouse and his colleagues conducted a study of how well 
people type as they age. Typing tests allow researchers to assess 
both overall performance and basic cognitive functions. A group of 
experienced, expert typists were recruited for the study. They visited 
the Salthouse lab and completed several different types of tests. 
The first was to type several passages as quickly and accurately as 
possible. Participants also completed a wide range of tests of basic 
cognitive, perceptual, and motor abilities related to typing. 
Laughter is associated with 
a substantial release of 
dopamine into the pleasure 
circuits of the brain.

	
102	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


The researchers determined that there is almost no effect of age in 
the actual typing speed of experienced typists. While a 70-year-old 
typist is slower in terms of cognitive and motor assessments, when 
you present these typists with a passage of text and ask them to type 
it as quickly as possible, their speed is almost identical to that of 
younger experienced typists.


Salthouse performed several clever experiments in which he 
restricted the number of characters ahead on the line of text that 
the typists were allowed to look. If you are looking only 10 characters 
ahead on the line, then if researchers block characters 15 and more 
ahead of where you are currently typing, it won’t affect you. However, 
if researchers block all the characters beyond 5 ahead of where you 
are looking, then your performance will suffer.


The experimenters found that older typists were maintaining their 
speed by looking farther ahead in the line of text than the younger 
typists. As their basic sensory and motor capacities declined, they 
discovered new strategies to overcome their limitations. 
Compensate for Cognitive Loss


In many domains, adults continue to improve in mental performance 
beyond 20 years of age. Imagine that you have developed the ability 
to perform some task at 20 years of age—for example, driving a car 
in busy city traffic. Your brain has organized itself to process the 
relevant sensory information, make strategic plans, and mediate 
your control of the vehicle. If your brain tries to do exactly the same 
thing in exactly the same way when you are 40 years old, then your 
performance of this task will be worse. 


However, if you learn to drive better by the time you are 40, you may 
be able to compensate for that basic cognitive loss. For example, you 
may learn more efficient routes to take at particular times of the day. 
You may learn to recognize earlier when pedestrians are about to walk 
into the street. You may learn that when your car makes a particular 

	
Lecture 13—Overcome Your Aging Brain	
103
noise, then pressing the accelerator won’t produce as much speed as 
it usually does. 


If the 40-year-old you is able to use these extra sources of strategic 
information well enough, you might not simply be as good as the 
20-year-old driver, you might even be better.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Much research literature on overcoming the effects of aging 
describes an ongoing battle—with physical decline on one side and 
expertise increase on the other. Performance improves beyond 
20 years of age because the expertise side is making gains. If this 
theory is correct, what does it indicate about how we should most 
effectively stave off the effects of age on the brain?
2.	 Assessments of mental decline associated with aging are overly 
influenced by the presence of early-stage dementia in older 
populations. For the great majority of the population who are 
not affected by dementia, the declines in mental performance 
are often very small. If people suspect they are declining quickly, 
however, what steps should they take to minimize future decline?

Grow Your Brain Out of 
Depression
D
epression is sometimes called the common cold of mental 
illness. Many people have suffered some level of depression at 
some point in their lives. In a survey by the National Institutes of 
Health in the United States, nearly 16 million adults reported at least one 
major depressive episode in 2014, slightly less than 7 percent of the adult 
population. If milder symptoms or shorter durations of depression are 
included, those numbers go even higher. Another reason that depression 
is considered the common cold of mental illness is that mild depressed 
feelings often go away on their own. In this lecture, we’ll explore some of 
the causes of depression and the actions you can take to help depression 
diminish more quickly. 
Effects of Exercise


A wide range of research suggests that physical activity can help 
effectively battle depression. Studies of the effects of exercise on 
depression date back to at least 1981. A large study published in 
the Archives of Internal Medicine in 1999 involved 156 participants 
who reported symptoms of major depression. The participants 
were randomly assigned to three different experimental groups: 
a medication group, an exercise group, and a group receiving both 
medication and exercise. 


After 16 weeks, about 65 percent of participants reported that their 
symptoms had been reduced to the extent that they no longer fit a 
diagnosis of major depression. The medication group reached this 

	
Lecture 14—Grow Your Brain Out of Depression	
105
state faster than the exercise-alone group, but by 16 weeks, there 
were no significant differences between the groups. Exercise seems 
to work a little more slowly than medication, but the overall effects 
seem to be about the same.


A follow-up study was conducted, in which 133 of the participants 
were recruited six months after the end of the original study. It was 
found that for the people who continued with the exercise program, 
the rate of depression was significantly lower. While exercise seems 
to work more slowly than medication over the first few weeks, the 
lasting effects of exercise seem to be substantially greater.
Homeostasis


To understand how exercise helps to boost mood and reverse the 
effects of depression, consider what causes depression. One of the 
central organizing principles of the human brain—in fact, for the 
human body in general—is homeostasis. Your brain also regulates 
your level of general arousal. If you are ever overly excited by 
surrounding stimuli, your brain will down-regulate the responses 
to new stimuli. On the other hand, if you are immersed in a sedate 
environment, then your brain will up-regulate its responsiveness.


According to most theories, depression is caused by a malfunction 
of the arousal-regulation system. If you are depressed, then your 
arousal system is set too low. When you are in a high-stimulation 
environment, the brain down-regulates its responsiveness too much. 
In a low-stimulation environment, the system doesn’t up-regulate 
enough. One theory for how this might be implemented in the brain is 
through the production of different neurotransmitters. 
Neuronal Communication Process


Periodically, a neuron produces an action potential near the cell body. 
The voltage spikes from −70 millivolts to around +40 millivolts and 
then back down again. This pulse propagates down the length of the 

	
106	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
axon portion of the neuron until it reaches its terminals. Within these 
terminals are storage sites called synaptic vesicles. Every time an 
action potential reaches one of these axon terminals, some of these 
vesicles burst open, releasing the neurotransmitter stored within 
them. 


The neurotransmitter is released into the synapse, a microscopic 
gap between one neuron and the next. The neurotransmitter diffuses 
across the gap and adheres to receptor sites on a neighboring neuron 
called the post-synaptic neuron. As the neurotransmitter adheres to 
the surface of that postsynaptic neuron, it influences the likelihood 
that it will produce an action potential of its own. 


Different neurons contain different types of neurotransmitters. Some 
are excitatory—that is, the more excitatory neurotransmitter released 
into the synapse, the more likely is the chance of a postsynaptic 
neuron action potential. Some neurotransmitters are inhibitory—that 
is, the more inhibitory neurotransmitter released into the synapse, 
the less likely is the chance of a postsynaptic action potential.
Depression is caused by a 
malfunction of the arousal-
regulation system. If you are 
depressed, then your arousal 
system is set too low.

	
Lecture 14—Grow Your Brain Out of Depression	
107


Reuptake is the final step in the neuronal communication process. 
Our brains invest a great deal of energy to produce neurotransmitters. 
Rather than use them once and then discard them, neurons recycle 
the neurotransmitter. After the neurotransmitter is released from the 
synaptic vesicles, it gets absorbed back into the synaptic vesicles. 
If the action potentials of a neuron slow down enough—or stop 
entirely—the amount of neurotransmitter in the synapse itself will 
quickly drop down close to zero.
Serotonin in the Synapse


One neurotransmitter that has been implicated in theories of 
depression is serotonin. People who suffer from major depressive 
disorder have substantially fewer serotonin receptors in their midbrain 
than do nondepressed control participants. 


The midbrain is a region that contains the hypothalamus and the limbic 
system, the region of the brain associated with emotion and mood 
regulation. It seems that part of the process that leads to depression 
involves a reduction in the sensitivity of these regions to serotonin.


When serotonin is released into the synapse, it greatly magnifies 
the effect of any action potential. It effectively strengthens the 
connections between midbrain neurons and reduces the symptoms 
associated with depression. The best evidence for the serotonin 
theory of depression is the proven effectiveness of a variety of 
serotonin-specific medications, a family of drugs that function as 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 
Function of Endorphins


Exercise can have the same effect as SSRIs on the midbrain because 
during physical activity, our brains produce extra neurotransmitters, 
such as endorphins.

	
108	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Endorphins are neurotransmitters associated with the regulation 
of pain perception. When your body is physically damaged, your 
brain computes a perception of pain. If you are running or biking, 
for example, the consistent stress placed on the muscles results 
in damage and a pain perception associated with it. This exercise-
induced damage is a positive outcome, however. As you recover from 
that damage, your muscles repair themselves and, in addition, make 
themselves stronger than they were before the exercise.


The homeostasis concept applies here as well. If you feel a consistent 
amount of pain, your brain takes steps to reduce it. Endorphins are 
released that inhibit the brain’s response to that discomfort. When 
you exercise and you fatigue and damage your muscles, your brain 
starts to produce endorphins to counteract the painful effects. When 
you stop exercising, eventually, the endorphin production drops 
again—but not immediately. For a while, those endorphins continue 
to be produced and influence the brain. The endorphins not only dull 
the physical pain of exercise but also inhibit the mental and emotional 
symptoms of depression.


In fact, a variety of other neurotransmitter systems are also 
activated by exercise. Norepinephrine, for instance, is produced 
much more during physical activity than during periods of rest. This 
neurotransmitter increases general arousal for the sake of physical 
activity. Like the endorphins, norepinephrine production continues for 
a while even after you stop exercising.
Neurogenesis


A new theory suggests a completely different pathway by which both 
exercise and SSRIs might impact depression symptoms. It may be 
that the key to reducing depression is to make more neurons.


In the 1980s and 1990s, several teams of researchers found evidence 
for adult neurogenesis—the creation of new neurons. The original 
work was done with songbirds, which typically learn new songs every 

	
Lecture 14—Grow Your Brain Out of Depression	
109
spring. As the birds undergo this seasonal learning process, their 
brains substantially change size to support this new learning. The new 
cells are created, recruited into learning circuits, and then used like 
older cells. In humans, it seems that new neurons are produced in at 
least two parts of the human brain where rapid learning takes place. 


The first area is called the striatum, a subcortical part of the brain 
that is central to implementing our responses to positive and negative 
reinforcements. This is the part of the brain where continual learning 
and restructuring takes place.


The other region where rapid neurogenesis seems to take place in 
humans is the hippocampus, the part of the brain critical to many 
significant cognitive functions. Our mental map of the surrounding 
environment seems to be implemented here, including our sense of 
where we are on that mental map. Our ability to form new long-term 
memories is implemented in the hippocampus as well. In addition, the 
hippocampus is involved in many aspects of information processing.


Neurogenesis is much rarer in people who suffer from depression 
symptoms. Several studies have found that people who suffer from 
major depression for several months actually have measurably 
smaller hippocampus regions.
Role of Inflammation


A strategy to fight off depression is to take aspirin. A number of large-
scale studies found that people who suffer from inflammation-related 
illness are more likely also to suffer from depression. Most of those 
studies have been correlational. 


Several recent studies have more directly explored the hypothesis 
that depression may result as an inflammatory disorder of the body 
as a whole. Some studies have targeted populations that did not 
exhibit depression symptoms—some of whom were prescribed anti-
inflammatory medications for reasons unrelated to depression and 

	
110	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
some of whom were not. The people who took the anti-inflammatory 
drugs exhibited lower rates of depression after taking the medications.


Taking aspirin, ibuprofen, or other anti-inflammatory drugs is worth 
a try if you find yourself struggling through an extended period of 
negative mood.
Benefits of Fermented Foods


To boost your mood when you are feeling low, try adding fermented 
foods to your diet. Fermentation is used in the production of many 
foods. In general, it involves exposing foods to a family of bacteria 
called lactobacilli. These helpful, friendly bacteria eat the starches 
To boost your mood when 
you are feeling low, try adding 
fermented foods to your 
diet. Common examples of 
fermented foods are kimchi, 
sauerkraut, and yogurt,

	
Lecture 14—Grow Your Brain Out of Depression	
111
and sugars in food and convert them into lactic acid—a sour-tasting 
substance. Common examples of fermented foods are kimchi, 
sauerkraut, yogurt, sourdough bread, tempeh, and miso.


There is a growing body of evidence that the incidence of depression 
is lower in people who regularly consume fermented foods, although 
the exact mechanism for this is still a mystery. Similar to the results of 
taking anti-inflammatory medication, however, the data on fermented 
foods seem to suggest that the effects are much larger for some 
people than others. 
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Depression is associated with emotion centers of the brain, such 
as the limbic system. How might the creation of new neurons in 
learning regions such as the hippocampus lead to improvements 
in emotional well-being?
2.	 If so many people suffer from depression, what is the origin of its 
social stigma?

Hack Your Brain to 
Unlearn Fear
A
ccording to cognitive neuroscience, we can learn to conquer 
even our most debilitating fears or phobias. Fear responses 
are learned; in most cases, fears are not innate. A phobia is an 
extreme or irrational fear or aversion. We know a great deal about how 
the brain implements learning and association of a situation with emotion. 
In this lecture, we will consider how the cognitive systems function and 
describe ways in which you can unlearn your fears and manage phobias.
Functional Fear of Heights


Fear isn’t necessarily a negative emotion. For example, most 
people have at least some fear of heights. Consider, however, the 
consequences of falling from a great height. Actually, a functional 
fear of heights is built directly into the human visual system. Dennis 
Proffitt and his colleagues have documented a fascinating depth-
perception illusion that they discovered while standing on a balcony in 
the psychology building at the University of Virginia. 


This particular balcony is about 20 feet above the ground and extends 
for much of the length of the building. In the experiment, person 
A stood on the ground below the balcony. Person B stood on the 
balcony directly above person A. Person C stood on the balcony off 
to the right side of person B. The job of person B was to ask person 
C to move gradually farther away until the distance between person B 
and person C matched the distance between person B and person A 
on the ground.

	
Lecture 15—Hack Your Brain to Unlearn Fear	
113


When person B felt that the vertical distance matched the horizontal 
distance, the experimenters measured the two distances and 
compared them. Virtually every participant dramatically overestimated 
the distance to the ground. When the experimenters repeated the 
process from the ground looking up, however, the effect went away. 


When you look down from a height, your visual system seems to 
know that vertical distances require great caution. Whatever the 
distance actually is, your automatic, unconscious visual system takes 
that value and multiplies it before passing the information on to your 
conscious perceptual system. 
Short-Term and Long-Term Memory


Emotional states are part of our system of memory encoding and 
processing. If you experience a neutral stimulus and then experience 
an extreme emotion such as terror, you will come to associate that 
stimulus with that particular emotion. 
When you look down 
from a height, your visual 
system seems to know 
that vertical distances 
require great caution.

	
114	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Human memory is often described in terms of two separate brain 
systems: short-term memory and long-term memory. When you 
perceive something in the environment, you first store it in your 
short-term memory. If you want to remember something for a long 
time, you have to transfer it from your short-term memory into your 
long-term memory. To recall the information, you summon it from 
your long-term memory back into your short-term memory. Short-
term memory is often called working memory.


When you create a long-term memory, you encode the specific 
information as well as the context in which the information was 
learned, including a number of extra yet related details. When you 
encode a long-term memory for some new piece of information, 
you capture much of the context in which that information was 
delivered.


In addition to the external context—for example, the place and time of 
day—you also encode the context of your internal state. Most relevant 
to our discussion of fears here, your internal emotional state is a part 
of that context. 
Fight-or-Flight Reaction


The human nervous system possesses fundamental mechanisms 
for regulating arousal. When your brain detects a threat, it shifts 
its resources to activating the muscles and augmenting sensory 
processing. Your heart rate and breathing become faster as blood 
is pumped to the muscles to oxygenate them. Blood vessels in the 
digestive system contract so that the oxygen and fuel there can 
be diverted elsewhere. When people experience fear, they tend to 
open their eyes widely. When you do this, you can see a little better, 
especially in the periphery. Your body is prepared for a fight-or-flight 
situation.


Fear of flying may be common because of excess carbon dioxide 
in the plane while people are boarding. Often, pilots shut down the 

	
Lecture 15—Hack Your Brain to Unlearn Fear	
115
air conditioning while the plane is being serviced and inspected 
between flights. It typically stays off until everyone is on the plane, 
but people keep breathing, taking in oxygen and exhaling carbon 
dioxide. One of the best ways to induce a fight-or-flight arousal 
response is to have someone breathe air that is rich in carbon 
dioxide. Our body’s deep-seated survival instincts take over and an 
association is formed. 


For strong phobias, you don’t necessarily have to have especially 
bad experiences to maintain or even strengthen them. If you have a 
substantial fear of flying, then if you simply think about flying, you 
will start to feel nervous. As you remember a time when a flight got 
very bumpy as you landed, your sympathetic nervous system will 
ramp up its activity. Even though nothing new has happened, the 
memory of flying will become even more strongly associated with 
the fear.
If you have a substantial 
fear of flying, then if you 
simply think about flying, 
you will start to feel 
nervous.

	
116	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
Systematic Desensitization 


Because phobias and fears, in general, are learned, we can break 
that learning cycle. Successful methods to manage fears and phobias 
involve recalling memories of fear-inducing situations and then 
weakening the associations between those memories and the fear.


One of the oldest techniques is called systematic desensitization. 
You start by calming your mind and body and willfully place yourself 
in a state of complete relaxation. Sit still, do nothing, focus on your 
breathing, and concentrate on relaxing all your muscles one at a time.


Once you are fully relaxed for 10 minutes or so, you then think about 
the source of your fear. This memory will cause you to become tense 
as the anxiety and fight-or-flight response kick in. Relax and wait for 
these to pass, and then repeat the process. Eventually, you will be 
able to think about that fear-inducing experience without feeling the 
paralyzing anxiety associated with it. 


If you can fly and stay relaxed a few times, you will have mastered your 
phobia. One way of accomplishing the desensitization process is to 
create new memories—that is, to overwrite the old ones—in which the 
external cues are associated with relaxation rather than fear. Decades 
of research support systematic desensitization for treating fears.
Reconsolidation of Memory


Recent research has produced a fascinating new way of thinking 
about desensitization and suggests a way to accelerate the process. 
This new research also has the potential to provide a much better 
understanding of how memory and fear actually function. The key 
here is to interfere with reconsolidation of a memory.


This new research starts with an innovative view of short-term and 
long-term memory. In the traditional view of memory, we perceive 
the world around us and pull that information into our short-term 
memory. Some of that information gets consolidated into our long-

	
Lecture 15—Hack Your Brain to Unlearn Fear	
117
term memories. Later, when we want to remember something, we pull 
that long-term memory back into our short-term, working memory. In 
the traditional model, what is moved to the working memory is a copy 
of the long-term memory, not the long-term memory itself. Recent 
research suggests that this is incorrect.


According to the new theory, remembering is like checking a memory 
out of a library. After you pull a memory into working memory and 
use it, you need to re-make that long-term memory again. The initial 
transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory is 
called memory consolidation. The transfer from short-term memory 
back to the long-term memory library again is called reconsolidation. 
If you don’t reconsolidate a memory—if you don’t re-make it after 
recalling it—then the memory gets lost. In fact, the very process of 
remembering something might result in its being forgotten.


There is clear evidence that when a memory is recalled from long-
term memory back into working memory, then it is placed in a state 
of flux, a state in which it can be changed or even erased.
Propranolol 


Recent studies have used the drug propranolol to rapidly reduce or 
even eliminate phobias. Propranolol is a beta-blocker medication, 
often used to treat high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, migraine 
headaches, and a variety of other ailments. Beta-blockers block 
the receptor sites for adrenaline and norepinephrine—substances 
associated with stress-based arousal. When your fight-or-flight system 
is activated, it does so on the basis of these neurotransmitters. If a 
beta-blocker is in your system, the neurotransmitters are released, 
but the ability of the neurotransmitters to affect neurons on the 
receiving side of a synapse is reduced. Propranolol is also used to 
treat many anxiety-related disorders. 


In a study recently published by Merel Kindt and her colleagues at 
the University of Amsterdam, participants were recruited who had 

	
118	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
particular phobias—for example, arachnophobia, or fear of spiders. 
Others were recruited who suffered from anxiety associated with 
some past experience—for example, painful memories of being 
mugged and assaulted at gunpoint. 


Kindt was very directly inspired by studies of memory consolidation 
and reconsolidation. She didn’t aim to eliminate the memory but to 
change its emotional associations.


In her studies, participants experienced the fear-inducing stimulus. 
Once the fear state and the memories associated with it had been 
activated as fully as possible, some participants took a dose of 
propranolol. In the days and even months after this experience, 
these patients reported a dramatic drop in their fear. It was as if the 
propranolol, by blocking the participants’ ability to fully experience 
the fear, also blocked the tendency to reconsolidate that fear into 
long-term memory. 
Talk Therapy


Another strategy that doesn’t involve propranolol may have the same 
result of managing fears and phobias: talking to someone. There is a 
wealth of evidence from clinical psychology that talk therapy produces 
a reduction in anxiety associated with fear.


There are many different types of talk therapy: Freudian 
psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, behavior therapy, cognitive 
therapy, humanistic therapy, integrative holistic therapy. As different 
as they all are, they all seem to work (although not all the time and 
not with every person). 


It might be that the benefits of talk therapy have been based on 
the reconsolidation mechanism all along. As you sit in a therapist’s 
office and have a conversation, you are relaxed. As you discuss your 
fear, you recall what has troubled you. As you reconsolidate those 
memories, over and over, while being in a relatively safe, calm 

	
Lecture 15—Hack Your Brain to Unlearn Fear	
119
environment, you will tend to weaken the associations between those 
memories and fear. As you do, you will gradually diminish the effects 
of the fear on your life.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Some recent evidence demonstrates that recalling fear-inducing 
events while under the influence of beta-blocker medications—
which reduce the brain’s fear response—can quickly reduce 
phobias. Many substances have similar relaxing effects: alcoholic 
beverages, a cup of tea, and even comfort foods like macaroni and 
cheese. Would recalling negative events while consuming these 
substances produce the same results?
2.	 Flooding is a method for treating fears in which the feared 
stimulus is continually presented to someone until the phobia 
subsides. If the process is interrupted before the phobia subsides, 
however, the intense and unpleasant experience of long-term 
exposure can increase the fear. When might flooding be an 
effective method to use, and when not? What steps should people 
take if they use this method to rapidly treat a phobia?

Use Your Body to Alter 
Your Mind
T
o a great extent, the brain controls the body. The act of waving your 
right arm, for example, is caused by a particular pattern of neural 
activity in a certain place in your brain—specifically, the motor 
cortex in your left frontal lobe. In this lecture, however, we challenge the 
assumption that the brain fully controls the body. A great deal of research 
suggests that your thought processes don’t stop when they leave the 
confines of the skull. In fact, your body influences the state of your brain 
as well. 
Facial Feedback Hypothesis 


If you are unhappy and want to feel happier, smile. In the 1970s, 
James Laird conducted studies in which he asked participants to 
contract certain muscles in their faces while they watched cartoons. 
He found that if the participants were making exaggerated smile 
expressions, then they were more likely to report that the cartoons 
were more humorous than if they did not make the smile expressions. 


This basic effect has been replicated many times. If you adopt a smile 
posture for a few minutes, you will generally report feeling more 
positive afterward. If you make a frown, then you will begin feeling bad.


Researchers refer to this as the facial feedback hypothesis. Most 
people readily accept the notion that your emotional feelings 
influence the way you act: If you are happy, you are more likely to 
smile. The facial feedback hypothesis suggest that information flows 

	
Lecture 16—Use Your Body to Alter Your Mind	
121
in the other direction as well. If the emotional centers of your brain 
detect that you’re smiling—presumably based on signals coming from 
the muscles and the brain areas that control them—then they encode 
that as evidence that you must be happy.


What’s more, smiling doesn’t just make you feel happier; it also 
seems to reduce your responses to pain or stress. Tara Kraft and 
Sarah Pressman published a study in which participants completed 
a series of challenging, stress-inducing tasks that increased the heart 
rate. Once participants finished the task, they would probably take a 
deep breath and relax as their heart rate returned to normal. When 
participants held a chopstick in their teeth, forcing a smile posture, 
the response of their heart to the stress was diminished. What’s more, 
the time it took the heart to return to baseline levels was also reduced. 


Similar studies suggest that smiling enhances the function of the 
immune system and even boosts the brain’s release of serotonin 
and endorphins. Serotonin is associated with feelings of satiation. 
Therefore, smiling can help “stress eaters” in a very direct way, 
reducing the cravings associated with that stress.
Use of Botox


If the facial feedback hypothesis is correct, then the use of Botox 
can affect emotional calculations. It has become routine for medical 
professionals to inject botulinum toxin into the skin of patients with 
the goal of producing smoother, less-wrinkled skin. Botulinum toxin 
paralyzes some muscles on the face.


In one study, participants who had received facial Botox injections 
were placed in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
scanner. This type of scanner senses the patterns of blood flow in 
the brain and can determine when different parts of the brain become 
especially active or inactive. If you look at pictures of faces and mimic 
those expressions, the emotion-processing centers of the brain will 

	
122	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
light up. Botox patients, however, produce significantly less activity in 
those emotional centers than do typical participants. 


What’s more, it seems that how you process the emotional states 
of the people around you is also affected by what you do—and don’t 
do—with your face. In a related study, experimenters asked people 
to read short text passages and judge their emotional content. 
Participants who had received general Botox treatments that reduced 
their ability to make emotion-laden facial expressions were slower at 
this task than were standard control participants.


This evidence supports the facial feedback hypothesis. The very 
nature of your emotional reasoning is based on what you do with your 
body—specifically, with your face. 
Smiling doesn’t just 
make you feel happier; 
it also seems to reduce 
your responses to pain 
or stress.

Embodied Cognition


Much of modern science considers the brain a stand-alone instrument 
for information processing, much like a monarch of the body that 
makes unilateral calculations and hands down orders. Many cognitive 
neuroscientists have adopted an alternative approach, however, 
centered around the concept of embodied cognition. 


The basic idea behind embodied cognition is that many of the 
impressive feats that we credit to our cerebrum are actually 
accomplished by a complex interaction between the brain and the 
rest of the body. Certainly, in emotional processing, that seems to be 
the case. What you do with your body—and your face in particular—
plays a significant role in how you feel. 


Consider what happens when your adopt the power pose Amy Cuddy 
and her colleagues refer to as Wonder Woman. Stand with your 
shoulders back. Your legs are spaced apart, your neck is extended, 
and your head is facing forward. As you stand like this, even for about 
two minutes, your body changes the way your brain is functioning. 
There are some unconsciously controlled systems in your brain that 
are ramping up in activity, while others are being suppressed. In just 
a few minutes, your personality actually changes; you become more 
confident and more assertive.


What’s more, if you are faced with a stressful situation 30 minutes 
after you have stood like this for two minutes, your body will react to 
the stress differently than if you had not stood like this. 
Dominant Postures


When we are faced with a stressful stimulus, such as a confrontation 
with a colleague or superior, we face two very different options. One 
strategy is to engage in the conflict. The other strategy is to back down—
to agree simply to end the argument. Even before a confrontation like 
this takes place, you can people posturing in preparation for it. The 

	
124	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
senior or dominant member of the group will tend to adopt a spread-
out posture, the back straight. 


Less-dominant people in the group will do the opposite; they will cross 
their legs and arms and hunch their shoulders. They will seem to do 
everything they can to make themselves smaller and to consume less 
of the space in the room.


For many reasons, people who seem more dominant tend to be 
treated better. They tend to get more job offers and raises; they tend 
to receive a larger share of contested resources; and they even seem 
to get better grades. If you can do something to make yourself more 
assertive and dominant, the outcomes are likely to be positive for you.
People who seem 
more dominant tend to 
be treated better and 
tend to get more job 
offers and raises.

	
Lecture 16—Use Your Body to Alter Your Mind	
125
Hormonal Changes


As with our emotional systems, it seems that our bodies play a 
significant role in mediating how we respond to others. In fact, our 
bodies seem to dictate to our brain how dominant we are.


In several classic studies performed by Cuddy’s research group 
and since replicated by several others, participants were randomly 
assigned to three experimental groups. One group spent several 
minutes standing in a power pose. A second experimental group 
adopted a nondominant pose: shoulders hunched, legs and arms 
crossed, head down. A third experimental group did neither. 


After spending several minutes in one of these three pose conditions, 
participants were then placed in a stressful situation. Those in the 
power-pose condition performed better than the nondominant posers.


A second effect, however, was even more striking. After completing 
the stressful task, the participants provided a saliva sample. The 
experimenters found that the power posers had lower concentrations 
of cortisol, a stress-related hormone. Power posers also had greater 
concentrations of testosterone, a hormone strongly associated with 
confident, dominant performance. 
The Two-String Problem


For centuries, researchers have been interested in how humans 
creatively solve problems. A classic research method called the two-
string problem can help us understand the insights that enable us to 
solve problems.


In this research, study participants enter a large room. In the middle 
of the room, two strings hang down from the ceiling. Initially, they are 
about four feet apart. On the floor nearby are a book of matches, a pair 
of pliers, and a few pieces of cotton. The task that the experimenter 
gives the participant is to touch the ends of the two strings together. 

	
126	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


This test is easy when the strings are only four feet apart. However, 
then the experimenter moves the strings farther apart, to five, six, and 
seven feet. 


Most participants quickly realize that they can extend their reach 
using the pliers on the floor. But this won’t work when the strings 
are farther apart. The solution, which most participants eventually 
discover, is that if you tie one of the strings to the pliers, it can act 
as a weight at the bottom of a pendulum. The participants then set 
one of the strings swinging, grasp the other string, and then grab the 
second string as it swings back to them. 
Keep Moving


The process of problem solving is clearly enhanced if participants 
are allowed to keep moving around as they try to solve the problem. 
If participants are instructed to sit down and think, it will take longer 
to solve the problem, and they are more likely to give up without 
actually solving it.


Alternatively, if an experimenter instructs the participants to remain 
standing and to move around while thinking, they often begin to do 
something really interesting. They will often swing an arm from side 
to side like a pendulum. Moving the body doesn’t merely get the blood 
flowing, it seems to contribute directly to finding a solution. 


A recent study suggests that even sitting in a chair reduces our 
thinking effectiveness. If you ask people to perform mathematical 
computations or come up with as many creative uses as possible for 
a brick, they will perform faster if they are standing than if they are 
sitting. If they are lying down, the performance gets much worse. 


Your brain is a significant part of your body—but it is only a part. 
Our cognition clearly seems to extend to the body as a whole. Even 
complex concepts can have connections to physical actions.

127
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Amy Cuddy and her team have focused on the use of the Wonder 
Woman pose to boost assertiveness and reduce stress reactivity. 
What other body postures might work to promote positive changes 
in mental state? Is there a happy posture? A creative posture? A 
smart posture?
2.	 Engaging in physical actions that are consistent with some mental 
state seems to change your brain. How might professional actors 
and con artists make use of these tendencies? Might professional 
actors suffer—or benefit—from performing certain roles?

Suppress—Don’t Repress—
Anger
W
hile extreme anger can create numerous problems, mild 
anger can be a valuable source of energy and motivation. 
In this lecture, we explore how we can outsmart anger and 
turn it into positive, productive action. Some of humankind’s greatest 
accomplishments began when someone became outraged over the world 
as it is, rather than as it could—or should—be.
Mirror Neurons


The next time someone is being mean to you, try an experiment. 
Be nice—be unexpectedly, shockingly nice—and see what happens. 
Research suggests that when you take this kind of action, you will 
partially take control of the emotional centers of the aggressor’s brain 
and turn off his or her ability to be unkind. 


The reasons for the effectiveness of this technique begin with the 
brain’s mirror neuron system. When you perform a movement of your 
body, you activate particular neural circuits in your motor cortex. 
What’s more, even when you simply watch someone else making that 
same motor movement, the same region of your brain will become 
active.


Mirror neurons were first discovered by a research team led by 
Giacomo Rizzolatti. The researchers described them as mirror neurons 
because the neural system was, in essence, mirroring the activities of 
another individual, as if the observer were performing the actions.

	
Lecture 17—Suppress—Don’t Repress—Anger	
129


Humans learn a great deal through imitation. If you’ve ever taught 
a child how to tie shoelaces, you likely didn’t simply describe it 
verbally. If you watch someone perform a dance a few times, even 
if you’ve never tried it yourself, you will likely be able to approximate 
it the first time you try. While you were watching the dance being 
performed, your brain was interpreting the dance by simulating your 
own performance the entire time.


There is substantial evidence for the motor theory of speech 
perception as well. When you listen to someone speaking, particular 
regions of your brain parse the sentences and derive meaning from 
them. An important step in that process is that your brain activates 
the regions that would be involved in producing the same sounds. In 
fact, there is evidence that simply listening to speech produces low 
levels of activation in your own vocal tract.
A Counterintuitive Strategy: Be Nice


Recent research suggests that the mirroring tendency isn’t limited to 
motor activities. If someone behaves aggressively toward you, your 
brain’s default response is aggression in return. When you observe 
the aggressive behavior, your brain will already be mirroring it—
priming an in-kind response.


As your brain mentally simulates performing those actions, it will 
tend to activate the associated systems. Regions of the amygdala 
associated with the sympathetic nervous system will become active—
inspiring a fight-or-flight mode. Situations in the past that have made 
you angry are associated with this information, and the circuits that 
encode this information in the frontal lobes will become active as well.


Conversely, if someone is very warm and friendly to you, your brain 
will mirror that. The parasympathetic nervous system will become 
active. Your brain will prepare itself to say words and perform actions 
that are typically linked with friendliness. Because of your mirroring 

	
130	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
brain’s pattern of activation, from a neural perspective, a friendly 
response will be easier.


This brings us back to the counterintuitive strategy of being nice to 
someone who is mean to you. When someone behaves aggressively 
toward you, you will have a natural tendency to respond in kind. Your 
brain will mirror the behavior you see and prepare to respond to 
malice with malice. Your behavior, of course, will tend to be mirrored 
by the other person’s brain, and the malice will build between the two 
of you. If you can short circuit this cycle, mean can change to nice.
Shift to a Noncomplementarity Mode


Researchers refer to our tendency to imitate one another as 
complementarity. Our behaviors tend to match the tone and content 
of the person with whom we are interacting. Fundamentally, the 
human brain is wired to interpret and respond to the actions of others.


It can be incredibly difficult to resist the unconscious complementarity 
reflex. When someone expresses anger at you, your brain is adept at 
finding connections to words and actions that are related to anger 
because anger is so firmly activated in your brain. But if you can 
respond to aggression with kind behaviors, you can often defuse 
a negative interaction. Researchers refer to this shift away from 
complementarity as noncomplementarity. 


Family counselors often use the strategy of noncomplementarity 
when dealing with couples with relationship problems. If two people 
continually argue aggressively with each another over an extended 
period of time, the aggression response will be stimulated even before 
the first word is spoken. The brain gets into a defensive posture even 
before any actual attack. Once two people are stuck in this mode 
of processing, it can be very difficult to find a way to live happily. If 
one person periodically expresses something genuinely positive and 
demonstrates real kindness to the other person, however, the vicious 
cycle can broken.

	
Lecture 17—Suppress—Don’t Repress—Anger	
131
Misdirected Anger


While extreme anger and rage can be very destructive, mild anger has 
the capacity to produce actions that result in positive outcomes. For 
example, if someone is harming you or someone you love, it is quite 
reasonable to get angry. What’s more, you shouldn’t short circuit 
that process. If you are angry and it spurs you to positive, meaningful 
action, go with it.


The problem with anger, however, is that it has an unfortunate 
tendency to get misdirected. Imagine that you have had a bad morning 
and experienced a highly unpleasant interaction with a colleague. 
Although you felt angry, it wasn’t appropriate to express it at the time; 
therefore, the anger gets repressed. Then, imagine when you get home 
later that day, you find that the dog has chewed up one of your socks. 
Your reaction at this point may be much greater than is proportionally 
appropriate—certainly much more than the poor dog deserves.
Family counselors often 
use the strategy of 
noncomplementarity when 
dealing with couples with 
relationship problems.

	
132	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


When humans get angry, we feel as if we direct our anger at a 
particular something; however, the anger doesn’t seem to remember 
that particular something very well. If another situation or individual 
taps into our established reservoir of anger, it can all come rushing 
out at the same time.
Suppression, Not Repression


When you feel anger, a variety of research suggests that you should 
suppress it, but you should not repress it. 


The theory behind some anger-management therapies is that anger 
is like a poison created by your brain. If you express that anger, 
then you let that poison out. Screaming, letting off steam, venting 
grievances, and not bottling up anger are all expressions that focus 
on the concept of catharsis. According to the theory, by engaging in 
certain actions, it may be possible to reduce or eliminate anger.


As compelling as these concepts are, recent evidence suggests that 
catharsis is a myth. In fact, particularly at certain phases during the 
process of becoming angry, expressing anger will result in more, not 
less, overall anger.


Consider this research by Brad Bushman and his colleagues. They 
began their study by recruiting participants and making them angry. 
Half the participants were randomly assigned to a catharsis condition 
and were allowed two minutes to vent their frustration by hitting a 
punching bag. The other participants simply waited for those two 
minutes.


In the testing phase of the experiments, the participants played a 
game against an opponent in another room. At various points during 
the game, the participants were given the opportunity to punish their 
opponent with loud blasts of noise. The hypothesis here was that if 
catharsis works, then attacking the punching bag should reduce the 
amount of anger left in the brains of the participants. This lower level 

	
Lecture 17—Suppress—Don’t Repress—Anger	
133
of anger should result in shorter, quieter bursts of noxious sound 
being directed at the opponents. 


Exactly the opposite result was obtained, however. Using the punching 
bag did not reduce anger; it significantly increased it.
Consciously Redirect Anger


Repression is a highly problematic approach to anger management. If 
you repress some feeling of anger, you pretend that the anger doesn’t 
exist. Many of the worst outcomes associated with misdirected anger 
come from the repression process. 


An alternative to repression is suppression of the anger. Suppression 
of an angry feeling involves resisting the urge to scream, yell, and 
fully express the anger in the most obvious way. In that sense, it is 
similar to repression. But if you are suppressing the anger, you can 
still express the anger—but without the overt, aggressive aspects 
usually associated with that expression.


Say that you are really angry. You might feel like yelling to express 
this anger. But you know, based on four decades of research on 
catharsis, that yelling will not make you less angry; on the contrary, it 
will make you more angry. The tip when you are in this situation is to 
verbally convey the same information about being angry but to do so 
in the most monotone, boring voice possible.


You are suppressing the bad aspects of the anger—the parts that will 
inspire an aggressive response on the part of the other person. Better 
still, you are making it clear what the anger is about. By keeping the 
discussion calm, both parties can use their full complement of frontal-
lobe brain tissue to resolve the problem.


Suppressing anger isn’t about pushing away the anger, it is about 
consciously redirecting the anger response away from the activities—
like shouting and cursing—that are often the most instinctual.

	
134	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
You might feel like yelling to 
express anger. Yelling will 
not make you less angry; on 
the contrary, it will make you 
more angry.

	
Lecture 17—Suppress—Don’t Repress—Anger	
135
Count to 10


Evolutionary biologists describe the systems that mediate our 
angry emotions and behaviors as very ancient and very fast. As our 
ancestors competed with others for limited resources, being able to 
generate a strong aggressive response quickly was a competitive 
advantage associated with survival. Anger is fast. Thinking—and 
calmly responding—is slow. 


There’s a time-honored anger-management strategy worth mentioning 
here that is strongly supported by research on the brain. If you feel 
a surge of anger and want to get it under control, slowly count to 10. 
Simply waiting for the slower cortical systems to catch up with the 
faster subcortical systems that mediate anger can greatly reduce 
irrational anger behaviors.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Catharsis of anger seems to work for some people if they go for 
a very long run. It’s difficult to be angry when you’re on the verge 
of exhaustion. Is this claim inconsistent with the evidence that 
catharsis is actually a myth?
2.	 The strategy of expressing anger in a monotone voice can be 
a very effective way to convey your concerns without ramping 
up your anger. It can also sound a little humorous and feel 
incongruous. If you crack a smile while conveying your anger, 
when is that likely to help the situation? When is it likely to make 
the situation worse?

How Little Things Cause Big 
Persuasion
I
n this lecture, we look at ways you can outsmart others (or realize 
how they are trying to outsmart you). Understanding the workings 
of the brain and human decision making can help enhance our own 
persuasive abilities. What’s more, by exploring how other people’s decision 
making can be influenced, you will come to better comprehend your own 
decision-making process and avoid some of the biases that affect us all.
The Reciprocity Principle


Imagine that you are selling raffle tickets. There are two possible 
scripts you can follow:
1. “Hello. My name is Peter, and I’m selling tickets for a charity raffle. 
All the raffle proceeds go to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research 
Foundation. Tickets cost 10 dollars, and every ticket gets you a chance 
to win a prize worth 10,000 dollars. How many would you like today?”
2. “Hello. My name is Peter, and I’m selling tickets for a charity raffle. 
Actually, I have these cool Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation 
pens to give out too. Here, take one! All the raffle proceeds go to 
support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Tickets cost 
10 dollars, and every ticket gets you a chance to win a prize worth 
10,000 dollars. How many would you like today?”


The more effective script is number 2. Across a wide range of studies, 
it has been found that if you offer people a gift before you ask them for 
something, they are far more likely to donate and much more likely to 

	
Lecture 18—How Little Things Cause Big Persuasion	
137
make a larger donation. What is remarkable is that the magnitude of 
the gift almost doesn’t matter. The gift can be a pen, a slice of pizza, 
a cup of coffee. The return on investment from a small gift can be 
enormous—300 percent in some studies. 


The effect of this strategy, caused by the reciprocity principle, is seen 
in many areas beyond charitable donations. A classic study of the 
reciprocity effect was conducted by Robert Cialdini and his colleagues 
using waiters and diners. Waiters gave their normal service: took 
orders, delivered food, conversed with the diners, and brought the 
bill. For half the patrons, the bill was delivered along with a single 
after-dinner mint. For the other half, the bill arrived without the mint. 
The researchers recorded the tips that the patrons left. 


The single mints resulted in a 3 percent increase in the size of the 
average tip. While that is a small increase, it was statistically very 
significant. What’s more, when the bill was delivered with two mints 
for every person at the table, the tips increased by 14 percent.


In another condition of the study, the waiters emphasized the gift-giving 
aspect of the interaction. The waiter would deliver the bill with one mint 
per person and then start to walk away. The waiter would then stop, 
turn back to the table, and say, “You’ve been really nice tonight. Here 
are some extra mints.” Now, the tips went up by 23 percent.
The “Because” Reflex


Researchers interested in persuasion—very notably Cialdini and 
his group—have elucidated a wide range of principles that seem to 
exert a powerful influence on our decision-making processes. When 
someone asks you to do something, how they ask often has a great 
deal to do with whether or not you say yes. 


The reciprocity principle is only one of many unconscious reflexes that 
operate in the human decision-making process. Consider this study of 
the “because” reflex. Experimenters went to a library where there was

In one study, when a 
restaurant bill was delivered 
with two mints for every 
person at the table, the tips 
increased by 14 percent.

	
Lecture 18—How Little Things Cause Big Persuasion	
139
a public photocopier used by students and faculty. The experimenter 
would wait until someone was using the photocopier and a second 
person was waiting to use it next. The experimenter would approach 
the waiting person and ask if he or she could use the photocopier first. 
Some people would say yes, but most people would say no. 


If the experimenter asked to go first but also gave a reason for it, 
a greater percentage of the people said yes. The third experimental 
condition of this study was the most interesting one, however. It turns 
out that the word “because” is significant in the request. The word 
“because” triggers an unconscious reflex that makes us more likely 
to say yes.
Foot-in-the-Door Technique


Consider another persuasion method called the foot-in-the-door 
technique. If you have worked as a salesperson, you might already be 
familiar with this sales technique. It gets at a central part of how the 
human brain makes decisions: How we frame the decision makes a 
lot of difference.


The basic idea of the foot-in-the-door method is to get people to say 
yes to some small request. Once you’ve done this, you can frame 
future decisions. The most frequently cited study of this phenomenon 
comes from Robert Cialdini’s group. They picked out an area near 
Phoenix, Arizona, and randomly divided houses into two groups: the 
foot-in-the-door group and a control group.


For the control group, the researchers visited each house and asked 
homeowners to participate in a new safe-driving campaign. They asked 
each homeowner if they could put a large wooden sign in the middle of 
their front yard that read “Drive Safely.” Think of an enormous wooden 
sign cluttering up the front yard. Only 20 percent said yes.


For the people assigned to the foot-in-the-door condition, the 
researchers first visited the house and asked for something very 

	
140	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
small. Homeowners would put a small card in their window reading 
“Drive Safely.” A full 76 percent said yes.


A few weeks later, the researchers visited the foot-in-the-door houses 
again. During the second visit, they asked to place the large wooden 
sign in the yard. Now, however, a much higher proportion of the 
people said yes—55 percent. By asking for the small window display 
first, the researchers yielded almost three times as many people 
willing to put in the large yard sign. 
Drive for Consistency


Cialdini and his colleagues interpret this as evidence of humans’ drive 
for consistency. While you don’t often think explicitly about who you 
are and what your values are, every time you make a decision, some 
part of your brain seems to do that.


For the people in the safe-driving study, when they said yes to 
the small window sign, it changed them. It changed their brains. It 
reinforced in them the notion that they care about driving safety. 
As they weighed the pros and cons of saying yes to the yard sign, a 
greater value was put on the self-perceived commitment to driving 
safety, and 400 percent as many people said yes.


The foot-in-the-door technique can be adapted to almost any situation 
in which you are looking to persuade someone to do something. The 
tip here is to seek an initial small commitment from someone that has 
three characteristics: voluntary, active, and public. Our unconscious 
drive for consistency is amplified if we have the sense that others are 
aware of our decisions. We have an internal drive to be perceived by 
others as principled, character-driven people.
Minimize Cognitive Dissonance


To make full use of the consistency reflex, make sure there is a 
delay between the small request and the large one. The unconscious 

	
Lecture 18—How Little Things Cause Big Persuasion	
141
process of changing our sense of who we are and what’s important 
to us seems to take at least a day. Most studies that have shown the 
largest effects have involved delays of about a week. 


Methods of persuasion that focus on the unconscious consistency 
reflex capitalize directly on our desire to minimize cognitive 
dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is a situation in which we hold 
two different contradictory beliefs or sets of information. In general, 
humans do what they can to reduce cognitive dissonance.


A state of cognitive dissonance is associated with activity in a variety 
of regions of the brain, notably the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
and anterior insula. When the person whose initial request you have 
granted makes a second, larger request, the activation in these 
regions of the brain are likely increased. You might want to say no to 
the larger request, but the disconnect between that no and your prior 
behavior would create a large amount of dissonance. 


The unpleasantness of the dissonance becomes a factor in your 
decision making. It might be unpleasant to put a giant wooden sign in 
your yard, but it might be even more unpleasant to have to deal with 
the negative feeling of cognitive dissonance.
The Personal Connection


If you want people to say yes to your requests, you should try to 
make a personal connection with them. Consider this Karen Wynn 
study of the morality of infants. Infants in her study start by choosing 
food from one of two bowls—green beans or graham crackers. Not 
surprisingly, nearly all the infants choose the graham crackers. 


The babies then watch a rabbit puppet make the same choice. 
Sometimes, the puppet chooses the same food as the child; 
sometimes the puppet chooses the green beans. The infants then 
watch the rabbit puppet attempting a task and having some trouble. 
As the rabbit is struggling with the task, another puppet comes on 

	
142	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
stage. Sometimes the second puppet helps the rabbit; in other cases, 
the second puppet hinders the rabbit.


After all of this, the babies are allowed to play with a choice of puppets. 
Two important tendencies were observed in these studies. First, if 
the rabbit chose the same food as the child, the infant expressed a 
preference for puppets that had helped the rabbit and an aversion 
to puppets that had been mean to the rabbit. If the rabbit chose a 
different food, however, the children expressed a positive preference 
for puppets that had been unkind to the rabbit.


If the rabbit is seen as “like me,” then the baby seems to want to see 
that rabbit treated well. If the rabbit is seen by the infant as “unlike 
me,” the kids seem to want to see the rabbit punished. 
If you want people to say 
yes to your requests, you 
should try to make a personal 
connection with them.

	
Lecture 18—How Little Things Cause Big Persuasion	
143


Fast forward a few decades, and you have an adult. Adults have 
learned a great deal, collected thousands of social experiences, 
acquired language, and made tremendous strides in intellectual and 
social development. But this tendency to be nice to people whom we 
perceive as “like me” is still there.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Many studies demonstrate that we tend to say yes to people who 
are “like us” more frequently than to people whom we perceive 
as “unlike us.” Which bias is right? If we perceive people as being 
like ourselves, should we resist agreeing to what they ask? Or 
should we intentionally say yes more often to people who are very 
different from ourselves?
2.	 Many charities collect the bulk of their annual donations around 
the end of the year. Given the nature of human decision making, 
what are some of the reasons for this?

Lecture 19
How Framing Changes 
Decisions
I
n this lecture, we continue our discussion of effective persuasion 
techniques and explore how an understanding of unconscious, 
automatic reflexes can help us avoid making poor decisions. The 
persuasion techniques discussed in both these lectures include the 
following: Give a gift; make your expertise salient and have someone 
else communicate that expertise on your behalf; emphasize the extent to 
which your request represents a scarce opportunity; make a small request 
first to get your foot in the door; make a large request first to make the 
second request seem smaller; and make a personal connection, highlight 
your similarity to someone, and then make your request.
Door-in-the-Face Technique


To increase the probability of persuading someone to say yes to a 
request, start by asking for something very large. People will almost 
certainly say no to the large request. Then, when you ask for a 
smaller favor, they will be more inclined to say yes. This strategy, 
the converse of the foot-in-the-door method, is called the door-in-the-
face technique. 


The best support for this technique comes from a study by Robert 
Cialdini’s research group. The experimenters stood along a busy 
walkway and asked pedestrians if they would be willing to serve as 
volunteer youth counselors. The following script was used on the 
control group: 

	
Lecture 19—How Framing Changes Decisions	
145
1.“Hello. We are recruiting people to chaperone a group of children 
from the County Juvenile Detention Center on a trip to the zoo. It 
will take about two hours of your time some afternoon or evening. 
Would you be interested in applying to help out?”


A little less than 17 percent of people said yes to request 1. Another 
group of participants was randomly selected to hear a much larger 
request:
2.“Hello. We are recruiting people to work as volunteer counselors 
at the County Juvenile Detention Center. If you volunteer, you will 
need to work for about two hours per week for a minimum of two 
years. Would you be interested in applying?” 


There were 72 participants in this study, and different versions of it 
have been run with hundreds of participants over the years. No one 
has ever said yes to request 2. 


After participants declined to volunteer for request 2, they were 
then immediately asked for the smaller volunteer commitment from 
request 1: to help out with the one-time two-hour trip to the zoo. 
The control group had said yes about 17 percent of the time. For the 
people who were first asked for the much-larger favor, however, the 
proportion who said yes skyrocketed to 50 percent. 
Reciprocity Reflex


One explanation for the success of the door-in-the-face technique is 
a contrast effect. If you anchor the participants’ notion of a standard 
request as a very large one, then a smaller request seems tiny by 
comparison. Cialdini and his group believe the explanation goes 
deeper than that, however. They argue that the unconscious reflex 
that gets triggered has to do with the discomfort that is created by 
refusing a favor. 


This phenomenon is closely related to the reciprocity reflex. When 
someone gives you a gift, it creates a social pressure—and a strong 

	
146	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
unconscious desire—to give a gift as well. When a person asks you 
for a favor, your brain activates a deep desire to say yes. You have to 
exert mental effort not to say yes. If you’ve already said no once, it’s 
that much harder to say no again. 


Cialdini’s group tested the reciprocity effect in a clever way—by 
having two different people make the initial large and the second 
small requests. If two separate people make the two requests, the 
reciprocity effect almost vanishes.
Scarcity Effect


Consider this story in Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. 
Tom Sawyer skips school to go swimming and has to whitewash Aunt 
Polly’s fence as punishment. In the events that follow, Mark Twain 
reveals himself to be a shrewd social psychologist. 


When one of the other neighborhood boys passes by, Tom pretends 
that he’s enjoying the painting task immensely. The boy asks Tom if 
he can try it. Tom refuses, insisting that only very fortunate people 
can be lucky enough to perform the task. Of course, the boy suddenly 
wants very badly the chance to paint the fence. Tom agrees to permit 
the other children in the neighborhood to paint the fence only if they 
are willing to trade various toys and trinkets for the opportunity.


Here, Mark Twain provides an excellent example of a persuasion 
principle that Cialdini’s research group calls scarcity. Most people 
think the value of something is calculated on the positive aspects of 
it. In the Tom Sawyer story, painting fences has a negative value—
usually, people get paid for painting fences. By making the opportunity 
to paint a scarce resource, the value to paint becomes a positive—
something for which the neighborhood kids will pay. 


A variety of studies demonstrate that the amount people are willing to 
pay is heavily driven by their perception of how scarce an item is. For 
example, if there are only 25 tickets left for an upcoming basketball 

	
Lecture 19—How Framing Changes Decisions	
147
game, people are willing to pay more than twice the amount for 
exactly the same seats as they would if there were more than a 
thousand tickets remaining.
Expertise Effect


In many cases where decisions require a great deal of research or 
even training, people rely on the decision making of experts. If you 
have relevant expertise, be sure that you make your expertise known 
when you prepare to make a request. 


A variety of studies suggest that expertise information can influence 
people’s decision making. Some of the experiments are quite simple. 
For instance, in some studies, participants view an advertisement for 
a new health-related product in which a spokesperson describes a 
series of benefits associated with it. 


A randomly selected group of participants watch the same person 
deliver the same advertisement, with one small change. At the beginning 
of the ad, the spokesperson mentions that he or she is a licensed 
physician with many years of experience. Not at all surprisingly, people 
indicate a greater willingness to buy the product if it is recommended 
by someone with relevant expertise. It’s no accident that many 
professionals hang their diplomas on the walls of their offices. 


There have been a range of more subtle studies that further 
characterize the expertise effect. For example, if an expert wears a suit 
and tie, people are more likely to follow their buying suggestions. If you 
want to persuade people to follow your lead, dress for the occasion.
Expertise Effect through Surrogates


A number of studies have found that the expertise effect is 
substantially stronger if the information is delivered by a surrogate. 
The boost in the effect is even greater if the information is delivered 

	
148	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
If an expert wears a suit 
and tie, people are more 
likely to follow his or her 
buying suggestions.

	
Lecture 19—How Framing Changes Decisions	
149
by someone who does not have an apparent, vested interest in the 
goals of the expert. 


One of the best examples of the expertise effect delivered by another 
person comes from a study conducted with a real estate firm. People 
frequently call the firm asking for information about properties for rent 
or sale. The firm tracks the number of calls received as well as data 
about the percentage of calls that result in a sale or rental contract.


When a prospective buyer calls, the receptionist’s original script was 
to say, “Okay, you’re interested in rental properties. Let me transfer 
you to Bob. Just one moment, please.”


The researchers in this study asked the receptionist to add a line 
about Bob’s credentials. The receptionist was instructed to say, 
“Okay, you’re interested in rental properties. Let me transfer you to 
our expert in this area, Bob. He’s been working with rental properties 
in this region for more than 12 years.” The number of calls received 
stayed the same during the course of the study, but two very notable 
increases were found. 


Fully 20 percent more of the people who called agreed to set up an 
appointment to come in and meet with the realtor. There was also a 
15 percent boost in the number of signed contracts that resulted from 
those interactions. 
Brain Activation in the Expert Effect


We know that decision-making processes are altered and people 
become more receptive to suggestions made by an expert. Consider 
how your brain changes when you are exposed to the expert effect. 


Some recent neuroimaging research by Vasily Klucharev and his 
colleagues suggests that the primary effects of the expert effect 
can be found in brain areas associated with memory. Participants in 
the Klucharev study viewed sequences of pictures while their brain 

	
150	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
activity was assessed in a functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) scanner. One picture was of a celebrity (tennis pro Andre 
Agassi, for example) and the other picture was of an object.


Sometimes the object was something about which participants would 
infer expertise on the part of the celebrity—for example, Agassi was 
followed by a picture of a tennis racket. Sometimes, the second 
picture was of an object where the celebrity would have no obvious 
expertise—for example, orange juice. After participants viewed the 
photo pairs, they went home and returned the next day. Now, they 
viewed all the object pictures without the celebrity endorser and gave 
a rating of how positively they felt about each item. 


The researchers determined that people remembered an object better 
if it was paired with an expert. What’s more, people rated the object 
more pleasing after it was paired with the celebrity. Interestingly, 
in many cases, this seems to happen even when participants don’t 
remember which celebrity was associated with an item. This is the 
expert effect.


In examining the areas of brain activation associated with the expert 
effect, we see a very interpretable pattern. Areas associated with 
memory—the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus—showed 
increased activation. These areas of the brain play a crucial role in 
converting our short-term, immediate experiences into more durable 
long-term memories.


Greater activation was also identified in the left prefrontal and 
temporal regions of the cortex. When we remember, we are relating 
the new information to what we already know. The elaboration part of 
the memory process is associated with activity in the left prefrontal 
and temporal cortices.

Questions to Consider 
1.	 Car salespeople often use a technique in which they consider a 
customer’s offer and then take it to the sales manager for final 
acceptance. Often, the sales manager asks the customer to pay a 
bit more; often, the customer does. Why does this sales technique 
work?
2.	 There is evidence that after a successful negotiation, both the seller 
and the buyer feel that they benefited from the negotiation. On 
average, both parties feel they have won. Given the nature of human 
decision making, why is this exactly what we should expect?

Lecture 20
How Language Changes 
Your Brain
I
n this lecture, we explore how language processing works in the brain. 
Words matter: The mere fact of speaking can have a strong influence 
on how you think. Words you simply imagine in your mind can affect 
your brain functions. Every day, numerous words pass through our stream 
of consciousness. By intervening in and altering the flow of that stream 
of self-talk, we can change our behaviors, our emotions, and even our 
physical health.
Language Determines Thought


Can’t find your keys? As your walk around your house looking for 
them, say the word “keys” aloud over and over again. You will be 
more likely to find them.


Kit Cho and her colleagues performed a study of how humans visually 
search for target objects among distractor objects. In some trials, the 
participant would simply search for the target object. In other trials, 
the participant would repeat the target label (such as “key” or “dog”) 
over and over again while searching. Simply saying the target word 
aloud made the search go faster.


When you say the word “keys,” your visual system changes the way 
that it processes incoming information. It becomes more sensitive to 
the visual features that are associated with keys, and you become 
faster at finding them.

	
Lecture 20—How Language Changes Your Brain	
153
Whorfian Hypothesis


A theory that has moved in and out of fashion among cognitive 
neuroscientists is the Whorfian hypothesis, sometimes called the 
linguistic relativity hypothesis. It is named for Benjamin Whorf, who 
suggested that language may determine our thoughts. 


The strongest form of this hypothesis is that you cannot think 
anything that you cannot put into words. It suggests that the language 
or languages we know comprise the system that our brain uses 
whenever it processes information. According to the strong version 
of this theory, language and thought are, in many respects, the same. 


While the strong version of the Whorfian hypothesis has largely 
disappeared from serious consideration, a weaker version of the 
Whorfian hypothesis has gone through a bit of a revival. Language 
doesn’t seem to determine or preclude what our brains can think; 
however, language very much seems to influence our brain’s 
performance in significant, measurable ways.
Broca Area


Production of language takes place in the Broca area of the brain, 
named for its discoverer, Pierre Paul Broca. Broca studied patients 
who could no longer talk after suffering a brain injury. Based on 
careful work, Broca found that the patients could still understand 
spoken and written language. The Broca area is located in the frontal 
lobe just behind the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies have 
confirmed the importance of the Broca area for language production. 


Whether you are right handed or left handed affects how your brain is 
organized for language production. For right-handed people, language 
processing causes a large increase in activity in the Broca area in the 
left hemisphere of the cortex. For right-handed people, damage to the 
right side of the brain rarely results in language deficits. Damage to 
the left side is far more likely to produce these problems. 

	
154	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


Left-handed people are a little more complicated in this regard. 
One might presume that the organization would be reversed—that 
is, lefties would exhibit language dominance on the right side. They 
don’t, however; most lefties show a more equal activation across 
the two hemispheres. The Broca areas of both hemispheres seem to 
participate more equally in language production.
Wernicke Area


Like Broca, Carl Wernicke worked with brain-injured patients. He 
found that damage near the back of the temporal lobe often produced 
a loss of the ability to comprehend written or spoken language. This 
area has come to be known as the Wernicke area. Neuroimaging 
studies have shown the same lateralization of function associated 
with the Broca area. Right-handers tend to show strong activation in 
the left hemisphere when engaged in comprehension. Lefties show a 
more balanced pattern of activation. 


Language production and comprehension are implemented by these 
two different brain regions. Given the close relation between speaking 
and listening, it is surprising how far apart the two regions are. 
Speech production is accomplished by the Broca area near the front 
of the brain, while language comprehension is accomplished by the 
Wernicke area near the back. 


The Broca area is located closer to the motor cortex in the frontal 
lobes. The motor cortex is involved in controlling voluntary 
movements, including those that produce speech. The Wernicke area 
is located very near the auditory cortex, a region of the brain devoted 
to processing incoming sounds.
External and Internal Motivation


Language affects many kinds of brain activity that might not appear 
to depend on language at all. For example, if you want to change a 
certain behavior, how you talk about that process greatly affects the 

	
Lecture 20—How Language Changes Your Brain	
155
outcome. Changing how you talk about it to others (and yourself) can 
increase your chances of succeeding. Specifically, you should use the 
word “don’t” rather than “can’t.”


Vanessa Patrick and her colleagues explored this phenomenon with 
the task of promoting healthful eating, but related studies suggest 
that the results apply to other behaviors as well. Imagine you are at a 
dinner with someone. You’ve decided to cut down on desserts. Many 
people would say, “No thank you. I can’t eat desserts anymore.” It is 
more effective to say, “No thank you. I don’t eat desserts anymore.”


Patrick and her colleagues drew from a range of research on how 
people respond to different types of motivation, whether external or 
internal. When people are motivated by external controls, they tend 
to be less consistent in their behaviors over the long term—especially 
if the external controller is absent. The phrase “I can’t do X” is 
associated with external controls. “I don’t do X” is associated with 
more robust internal controls.
Linguistic Distancing


The language we use also seems to affect our emotional responses. 
Ethan Cross and his colleagues have found that self-talk can help us 
regulate our own emotions. If you want to reduce your levels of stress 
and anxiety about a situation, refer to yourself in the third person. 
This is known as linguistic distancing.


Cross and his colleagues studied linguistic distancing in the context 
of social anxiety. In one study, they recruited participants and had 
them try to make a good first impression during a conversation with 
a stranger. The conversations were videotaped, and participants 
provided a rating of how anxious they were during the process.


The key experimental manipulation here took place before the 
videotaped conversation. Half the participants were randomly 
assigned to a first-person condition and asked to reflect on their 

	
156	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
feelings using “I” and “my.” The participants randomly assigned to 
the non-first-person condition were urged to make use of second-
person (“you”) and third-person (“he,” “she”) pronouns or to use 
their own names. 


Two clear differences emerged from the groups. The first-person 
group reported higher levels of anxiety during the interaction with the 
stranger. In addition to reporting lower levels of anxiety, the non-first-
person group performed substantially better than the first-person 
group in terms of a variety of social-performance criteria, such as 
perceived nervousness, vocal quality, and eye contact. 
If you want to change a certain 
behavior, changing how you 
talk about the process to others 
(and yourself) can increase your 
chances of succeeding.

	
Lecture 20—How Language Changes Your Brain	
157
Language and the Emotion Centers


Language areas are strongly connected to many areas of the brain, 
including the emotion centers. A couple of synapses away from the 
Wernicke and Broca areas is the limbic system. A particular emotion 
can influence the language we use; what’s more, particular words can 
influence those emotion centers.


Alison Brooks has published research using a simple linguistic strategy 
for dealing with anxiety: Restate that anxiety as excitement. When 
participants in her studies are feeling anxious, they are instructed to 
say, “I am excited.” This not only reduces the anxiety somewhat, but 
it seems to enhance performance. Anxiety and excitement are both 
states of high arousal, and so the trick is to capture that high state of 
arousal for positive purposes. 


Both anxiety and excitement are associated with diffuse frontal cortex 
activation in the brain. The primary difference is that anxiety shows 
additional activation in the amygdala and the sympathetic nervous 
system. 


Usually, when people try to reduce their anxiety, they are urged to 
become calm—to reduce activation across all the brain regions 
associated with anxiety. The Brooks method suggests instead that 
the anxious person use the power of language to alter the pattern of 
activation.
Language and Physical Fitness


The language centers of the brain seem to connect to the systems 
in your body that regulate your expenditure of calories. To be more 
physically fit, if you associate your daily physical activities with the 
word “exercise,” your fitness level will improve.


Alia Crum and Ellen Langer recruited a group of hotel room 
attendants and explained that they were interested in better 
understanding physical fitness in the workplace. For the experimental 

	
158	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
group, they presented information about the caloric expenditures 
associated with different aspects of their work. They noted that when 
you add up eight hours of work, it is clear that the attendants easily 
exceed U.S. recommendations for daily physical exercise. For the 
room attendants in the control group, researchers specifically did 
not provide information about how their work could be described as 
exercise. 


For both the experimental and control groups, a variety of 
physiological measures were taken: blood pressure, height, weight, 
percentage of body fat, waist-to-hip ratio. The experimenters then 
waited for one month and returned. The two groups didn’t change 
their eating or exercise habits outside of work.
 Language and Eating


Alia Crum, one of the researchers involved in the physical fitness 
study, found that the words you use to describe eating also have an 
effect on your sense of satiation. Participants in her study consumed 
a 380-calorie milkshake. Half the participants thought of the shake as 
an indulgent 620-calorie milkshake. Others thought of it as a sensible 
140-calorie milkshake. 


The participants who used the word “indulgent” felt more full and 
satisfied than did the group that used the word “sensible.” What’s 
even more surprising is that the body’s response to the food was 
physiologically different. The intestinal cells of the “indulgent” 
participants produced significantly lower levels of the hunger-
related hormone called ghrelin than did those of the “sensible” 
participants.

Questions to Consider 
1.	 Repeating the words “I am excited” seems to mitigate the negative 
effects of anxiety on performance. What other phrases might be 
expressed to mitigate the effects of other negative emotions? 
What phrases seem unlikely to work in this fashion?
2.	 Electronic devices that track daily activity and record exercise and 
fitness have recently become very popular. How might a personal 
activity tracker promote fitness through the language centers of 
the brain?

Lecture 21
How Your Brain Falls in Love
L
ove is perhaps the most powerful of all human emotions; in fact, the 
desire to be loved is a fundamental human drive. In this lecture, we 
consider how love is mediated by systems in the brain and examine 
what the brain looks like when it is in love. We also explore phenomena 
such as the significance of eye and pupil size, the mere-exposure effect, 
the Stockholm syndrome, and universal markers of attractiveness. 
Cognitive neuroscientists have discovered a great deal about love circuits 
in the brain, offering us a far better understanding of the implications of 
love at first sight and the potential for love addiction.
Eye and Pupil Size


Cognitive neuroscience has demonstrated that our brain captures 
information from the eyes that is significant to the incidence of 
attraction and the formation of romantic relationships. Some 
studies suggest that the ratio of eye size to ear size is a predictor 
of reproductive success. As we age through adulthood, our ears 
continue to grow, while our eyes tend to remain about the same size. 
Thus, as we get older, the eye-to-ear ratio gets progressively smaller. 
Evolution may have selectively bred us to look for potential mates 
with eyes that are especially large in relation to the rest of the face.


The pupil of the eye operates as a key mode of social communication, 
especially in potentially romantic situations. Your brain is wired to 
dilate the eye muscles when you see someone for whom you feel 
romantic attraction.


Humans are very sensitive to changes in pupil size when looking at 
another person’s face. A variety of studies have been conducted in 

	
Lecture 21—How Your Brain Falls in Love	
161
which participants were asked to view a selection of face pictures 
and rate them according to attractiveness. In many studies, faces 
with very large pupils had significantly increased ratings. Even 
participants’ ratings of how much they trust someone were increased 
when viewing people with larger pupils. Trust and love certainly tend 
to operate in tandem. 
Mere-Exposure Effect


If you want someone to love you, a brain-based strategy is to 
maximize the amount of time they spend with you. Brain-imaging 
studies have shown that particular brain systems are activated when 
you look at attractive or unattractive faces. It will be no surprise 
that systems associated with pleasure—subcortical circuits near the 
nucleus accumbens—show greater activity when you perceive a face 
as attractive. For very unattractive faces, increases appear in the 
amygdala—a region associated with negative emotions and even the 
fight-or-flight response.


As you continue to stare at an unattractive face, however, it gradually 
seems to become less distorted. That feeling of aversion dissipates. 
Over time, it starts to look much more normal. This is called the 
mere-exposure effect. The mere-exposure effect applies to almost all 
the stimuli we encounter, not just faces. Robert Zajonc demonstrated 
it with words and even line drawings. 


The mere-exposure effect stimulates the brain in many different ways. 
As stimuli are presented repeatedly to the sensory systems, the brain 
requires less and less activity to process them. Repeatedly presented 
stimuli are also generally processed more quickly than novel stimuli. 
This processing ease—or sensory fluency—may be related to the 
sense of pleasure that comes with familiarity.


Novel stimuli also tend to cause at least a slight activation of the 
sympathetic nervous system—that part of our autonomic nervous 

	
162	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
system that prepares our bodies for a fight-or-flight response. As you 
become familiar with people and places, this response is reduced. 
Stockholm Syndrome and Reaction Formation


There have been numerous documented cases of the Stockholm 
syndrome, which occurs in situations in which a captor holds 
someone hostage for an extended period of time. In some cases, the 
hostages develop an emotional attachment to—and sometimes a love 
for—their captors. 


Perhaps the most famous case of this was the 1974 kidnapping of 
Patty Hearst, a 19-year-old woman from a wealthy and prominent 
California family. Members of the Symbionese Liberation Army 
(SLA) kidnapped her from her apartment. Although Hearst had no 
political affiliation with the SLA, after her capture, she released a tape 
announcing that she had decided to change her name and join the 
SLA. She even participated in bank robberies with the group.


Hearst is not the only documented case of Stockholm syndrome. The 
term comes from a hostage situation that emerged from a failed bank 
robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973. During negotiations 
between police and the robbers, it gradually became clear that the 
hostages felt sympathy and even a strong affinity for their captors. 
At several times during the negotiations, the hostages communicated 
with the police—and in one case, the prime minister of Sweden—to 
criticize the operation and request that the robbers be set free. 


Stockholm syndrome has been described by Freudian theorists as 
a result of reaction formation. The idea here is that the mind, to 
protect itself from breakdown in a high-stress situation, changes the 
framework that it uses to interpret the surrounding situation. This 
theory would describe a hostage as initially feeling a strong hatred for 
the kidnappers. This powerful level of emotion creates an increasing 
stress on the mind and body. To reduce that stress, the mind reacts 
by focusing more on the positive aspects of the kidnappers. 

	
Lecture 21—How Your Brain Falls in Love	
163
Love at First Sight


Consider the notion of love at first sight. Most relationship-science 
experts would refer to it as lust at first sight, but the phenomenon is 
still a viable one. The idea is that you see someone and then some 
undefined feeling arises—or doesn’t. Cognitive research, however, 
suggests that real life doesn’t work that way. How attracted you are to 
someone on day 1 isn’t a perfect predictor of how attractive you will 
find them on day 7. For day 700, the connection is even weaker.


There’s an important tip here about searching for love. It sounds a 
little corny, but the data support it. You should keep an open mind 
and an open heart. Even if love at first sight doesn’t show up at all, it 
doesn’t mean that “love at thousandth sight” is not on its way.
Stockholm syndrome occurs 
in situations in which a captor 
holds someone hostage for 
an extended period of time.

Skin-Conductance Level


One of the most consistent neuroscience markers for love or 
longing is found completely outside the brain, in the skin. Your 
skin contains some water and can conduct electricity. When you 
are generally aroused by something, your body ramps up its 
activity and begins to push more water into the skin. If the process 
continues long enough, you will begin to sweat. Long before the 
sweating starts, however, this greater water concentration results in 
a lower electrical resistance. 


When you look at a picture of someone you love, your skin-
conductance level rises within a few seconds and continues rising for 
several seconds after.


At the same time, at least two other operations occur in the peripheral 
nervous system. First, the zygomatic muscles of the face become 
slightly tensed—a tension that can be measured in terms of electrical 
activity. If you place an electromyograph over the cheek muscles 
in the face, an increase in electrical activity is found. When these 
particular muscles are fully tensed, they pull the sides of your mouth 
upward into a smile. 
Love Addiction


The state of the brain in love is often studied by recording nervous-
system activity while a person thinks about or looks at a photograph 
of someone they love. The data is then contrasted with the nervous-
system activity while the person is looking at other kinds of photos. 
Helen Fisher and her colleagues have run several studies in which 
they looked at people experiencing those sensations of love while in a 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner.


The research team found activation in a variety of regions—most 
notably in the ventral tegmental area, a small region located 
near the bottom of the brain. The ventral tegmental area shares 
numerous connections with the nucleus accumbens, which is one 

	
Lecture 21—How Your Brain Falls in Love	
165
of the areas associated with desire in general—desire for food and 
water as well as a loved one. When you introduce dopamine into the 
cells in this nucleus accumbens region, the experience is of a rush 
of pleasure.


If you are hungry and you take a bite of a food you like, the nucleus 
accumbens area is activated. If you have a goal of completing a 
project and you make progress on it, the nucleus accumbens area 
is activated. What’s more, if you take a dose of cocaine, you get an 
enormous amount of activation at the nucleus accumbens. 


Cocaine is obviously an addictive drug. You might feel as if some 
people you’ve known—perhaps even yourself—are addicted to love 
When you look at a picture of 
someone you love, your skin-
conductance level rises within 
a few seconds and continues 
rising for several seconds after.

	
166	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
(or at least to the rush that they feel with a new love). This brain-
imaging work suggests that a love addiction is certainly a possibility 
because many of the same brain circuits are involved.


Many of our moment-to-moment behaviors are driven by our 
subcortical brain systems. Interestingly, while the system is activated 
by cocaine or other drive-based activities, it also becomes very active 
even before the need is met. That is, this isn’t so much a pleasure 
system of the brain; rather, it’s more of a craving system. 
Significance of Symmetry 


A great deal of research has gone into what makes certain people 
seem more attractive than others. Several universal characteristics 
have been identified. 


In a typical study, researchers recruit a group of 50 participants and 
show them all a set of 100 pictures of faces. For each picture, they 
ask the participants to rate how attractive the faces are, where 1 is 
unattractive and 10 is absolutely gorgeous. Studies like this have 
been conducted many times and have shown a remarkable amount of 
consistency. One of the very striking results from this kind of work is 
that it generalizes cross-culturally. 


Researchers have identified several characteristics that humans 
seem to favor. The closer a face is to perfectly symmetrical, the 
more attractive it will be rated. There is strong evidence that even 
young infants like symmetry. Babies will look longer at faces that are 
symmetrical than at those that are asymmetrical. 


David Buss and his colleagues have argued that symmetry is a 
basic instinct of reproductive fitness. On average, people with highly 
symmetrical features tend to live longer and be healthier. They tend 
to have fewer problems with fertility. It may be that through many 
generations of evolution, we have been bred to favor symmetry.

Questions to Consider 
1.	 Some have suggested that we place too much emphasis on 
physical attraction in our selection of romantic partners. Given 
your understanding of the brain’s process of falling in love, might 
it make sense to be somewhat shallow in this regard?
2.	 The mere-exposure effect seems to make people and things more 
attractive (or less unattractive) as the amount of time you spend 
with them increases. Might that be explained, at least in part, by 
our tendency to discover complexity and inner beauty as we spend 
more time with something or someone?

The Neuroscience of Lasting 
Love
F
alling in love is much more common than staying in love. What’s 
more, cognitive neuroscience demonstrates that falling in love and 
remaining in love involve separate and distinct brain systems. In 
this lecture, we explore the underlying neural systems that mediate 
lasting love and suggest strategies to nurture lasting love: overwhelm 
your partner with five or more positive events for every negative one, 
avoid being dismissive or aggressive in arguments, and seek exciting new 
experiences with your romantic partner.
Avoid Dismissive Behaviors


When you have an argument with your partner, don’t roll your eyes. 
This kind of dismissive behavior impacts your partner’s brain in 
consistent and negative ways. Your partner’s amygdala, for instance, 
will become more active. As it does, the negative emotions that are 
associated with that subcortical brain region will emerge, making the 
rest of the argument that much more difficult.


Long-term love and attachment are associated with oxytocin, 
a hormone produced by your brain that promotes deep social 
attachments. Amygdala activity and its associated fight-or-flight 
response weaken those bonds. If you too frequently tip the scales in 
favor of that amygdala system, love will lose. 


Moreover, oxytocin itself can influence behavior in two very different 
ways. It can promote social cohesion and cooperation, but it can also 

	
Lecture 22—The Neuroscience of Lasting Love	
169
strengthen the memory for negative events. Examples of this can be 
seen among couples who find themselves in a toxic divorce situation. 
The same oxytocin that creates love can contribute to its destruction. 
Gottman’s Approach to Arguments


John Gottman and his colleagues have done scientific research on 
how to make love last. He and his team have become celebrated 
for being able to predict—with greater than 90 percent accuracy—
which marriages will last and which will end in divorce. A key part 
of Gottman’s process is to ask the two members of the couple to 
discuss something that has been a point of disagreement. In essence, 
Gottman asks them to engage in a bit of conflict. A typical Gottman 
study involves collecting data and then waiting—in some cases, for 
several years.


After this time interval, some of the participants are still married; 
others have divorced. The research team then analyzes the data 
to see if there is anything in those records that was consistently 
present for the still-married couples that was not present for the now-
divorced couples. They determined that there are several features 
that are present for the divorced couples that are only rarely present 
for the still-married couples. The significant factors center on how 
they argue. 


An unhealthy way to start an argument is with blame and harsh 
criticism. Several processes will kick in if the argument begins this 
way. First, the blood pressure, heart rate, and skin-conductance levels 
of the recipient of the criticism will rise. His or her cognitive function 
will decline as the fight-or-flight system is activated. If the recipient of 
criticism rolls the eyes, looks away, and is dismissive of the criticism, 
then this discussion is already doomed. The marriage may be as well. 


Many other conflict-related behaviors can lead to a downward spiral 
of negativity in a close relationship. The most important strategy 
that Gottman’s research has yielded is the following: If you want to 

	
170	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
maintain a lasting romantic relationship, learn to argue without being 
sarcastic, overly critical, or dismissive of your partner.


Gottman and his colleagues have repeatedly found that marital 
arguments that involve a gentle start-up lead to better outcomes. 
An argument with a gentle start-up specifically avoids assigning 
blame. Following are examples of an unhealthy beginning and a 
gentle start-up. 
Wrong: “The problem is that he doesn’t want to spend time with the 
family. He just spends all his time working.” 
Right: “I feel unhappy that he doesn’t spend more time with the 
family. I wish that we could find a way he could spend more time with 
us, even though I understand that might involve taking some time 
away from work.”
An unhealthy way to start 
an argument is with blame 
and harsh criticism.

	
Lecture 22—The Neuroscience of Lasting Love	
171


Gottman has found that if arguments and discussions begin the right 
way, they tend to become more productive; they become more like 
group problem-solving activities.
Three Brain Systems


Three distinct brain systems are involved in falling in love and staying 
in love. Consider the three-tiered system proposed by Ruth Feldman 
and her colleagues.


The first system is associated with general sexual libido. Many 
subcortical brain systems are involved in coordinating human sexual 
behavior and regulating the hormones estrogen and androgen. 
The hallmark of this aspect of physical attraction is that it is rarely 
directed at any particular individual. This system is often mapped to 
the general term “libido.” 


A second brain system is associated with more focused romantic 
attraction. These brain areas are related to feeling the desire 
associated with a romantic attraction to one person. The system 
connected to falling in love is a dopamine-based system associated 
with the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. 


Deeper, more lasting love is associated with a third system, which is 
affected by specific brain regions and hormonal systems. The basic 
systems involved in the attachment aspects of love seem to function 
from the time that we are born, if not before. They are associated with 
two hormones: oxytocin and vasopressin. Oxytocin affects attachment 
behavior in the brain.
Impact of Oxytocin


Perhaps the strongest of human attachments is that between a mother 
and child. This attachment is heavily mediated by a large production 
of oxytocin. In circumstances in which the mother and child are 
separated for weeks after the child is born, this attachment does not 

	
172	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
form normally. It’s not that the mother will never be able to have an 
attachment and loving relationship with the child, but the intensity of 
that initial attachment relationship seems quite difficult to replace. 


The effect of oxytocin on attachment don’t stop with the mother-
child relationship, however. Oxytocin seems to cause all our strong 
attachment bonds to form with other humans. Oxytocin binds to many 
receptors in the brain, but the area most implicated in the attachment 
facets of love are located in the anterior insula, part of the outer cortical 
layer of the brain. The insula is on the side, tucked deep within one of the 
folds of that cortical sheet. The anterior cingulate cortex is an adjacent 
area of the brain with a high density of oxytocin-related receptors.


In studies of how oxytocin relates to human behavior, including 
romantic behavior, researchers take a blood sample and test for the 
density of oxytocin. The more oxytocin in the bloodstream in general, 
the more oxytocin is present in the brain as well. In fact, when people 
are involved in a new romantic relationship, they tend to produce 
higher levels of oxytocin.


Ruth Feldman and her research team conducted studies by recruiting 
people involved in a new relationship. They saved that data for six 
months and then re-contacted those participants. The greater the 
levels of oxytocin produced by the new couples, the more likely that 
they were still together six months later. There is an abundance 
of evidence that our bodies produce oxytocin as a central part of 
forming and maintaining attached romantic relationships. The greater 
the oxytocin concentration, the stronger the bond.
Seek New Experiences Together


A strategy that emerges from our understanding of the three brain 
systems affecting love is that if you want someone to fall in love with 
you, do exciting and novel things together. When we are excited by 
something—not simply by a potential romance but by our environment 
or activities—our brain produces adrenaline, norepinephrine, and 

	
Lecture 22—The Neuroscience of Lasting Love	
173
dopamine. This dopamine is the same neurotransmitter that activates 
the system of falling in love.


Many relationship experts suggest the importance of breaking out of 
routines with your partner from time to time. Doing novel activities 
together can be very important for maintaining those dopamine-
related circuits that spark the romantic, loving connection. 
Effect of Antidepressant Drugs


Some researchers have expressed concern that certain drugs 
might be antithetical to the love and attachment processes in the 
brain. The use of antidepressant medications in the United States 
Doing novel activities 
together can be very 
important for maintaining the 
dopamine-related circuits 
that spark the romantic, 
loving connection.

	
174	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
has skyrocketed in recent years. Most antidepressants function by 
boosting serotonin function in the brain. For instance, the class of 
drugs referred to as serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
greatly increase the amount of time that serotonin remains in 
a synapse after it is released. It therefore greatly increases the 
general amount of freely active serotonin molecules in the brain as 
a whole.


When you boost serotonin systems in the human brain, you reduce 
the activity of dopamine-related systems. A common side effect of 
SSRIs is reduced libido and sex drive. This is a direct result of the 
suppression of that nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area 
system associated with arousal and falling in love.
Strive for Five


John Gottman’s research about improving a couple’s argument style 
fits in with our understanding of the oxytocin-related attachment 
system in the brain. When a romantic attachment is formed, it’s not 
set in stone. Over time, that attachment can erode. Unless there are 
regular, periodic releases of oxytocin that are associated with the 
partner, the attachment will decline. 


Oxytocin doesn’t simply make us all love one another unconditionally. 
In fact, it makes us become more cooperative and positive with in-
group members and more negative with those we perceive as the 
out group. A fascinating memory study suggests that the release 
of oxytocin can produce very vivid and detailed memories for any 
negative events that are experienced along with that oxytocin. If a 
partner accumulates enough negative associations, the process will 
undo the positive attachment that is essential to meaningful love.


Gottman has explored this aspect of his data and found that a 1:1 ratio 
doesn’t seem to be enough. If you experience an equal number of 
positive and negative associations with a romantic partner, the most 
likely outcome is divorce. In fact, a full 5:1 ratio seems to be needed. 

	
Lecture 22—The Neuroscience of Lasting Love	
175


If you were in a Gottman study, you might be asked to write down 
a summary of each positive event and negative event you can 
remember taking place with your partner over the past week. The 
number of items on each list turns out to be critically important. 
Partners who tend to stay together can report five positive events for 
every one negative event that has happened over the past week. For 
people in Gottman’s studies whose ratios were substantially lower, 
the most likely outcome was divorce. 
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Arranged marriages were the norm for many centuries and are 
practiced in some cultures even today. Numerous arguments can 
be made against this system, but how might it fit well with the 
human brain’s love processing? How might it contrast with it?
2.	 Excitement seems significant to promoting strong social bonding. 
What types of romantic activities seem in line with this? Are 
romantic couples always thrill seekers?

Lecture 23
How Your Brain Creates 
Happiness
C
ognitive neuroscientists have long sought to identify the patterns 
of neural activity associated with happiness. A range of studies 
have found that there are consistent differences between happy 
brains and unhappy brains. Happy brains show more activity in left frontal 
regions of the cortex, while unhappy brains tend to have more activity in 
the right frontal and amygdala areas. In this lecture, we examine cognitive 
research that demonstrates that the greatest happiness is possible when 
we create it ourselves—through the processes of imagination, mindfulness 
training, expressing gratitude, or other actions that boost left prefrontal 
cortex activity. 
The Power of Imagination


Imagine being happy. There is strong evidence that this simple 
strategy will lead to increased happiness.


In one happiness study, Nakia Gordon and her colleagues had a group 
of participants pretend to laugh or pretend to cry. After participants 
had practiced actually performing the actions, they shifted to 
imagining performing the actions. The researchers found that when 
participants imagined crying, they later produced lower mood ratings. 
Thinking about crying makes you feel a little sad. Conversely, thinking 
about laughing makes you feel a bit happier. 


Most people presume that we decide to do something before we 
actually do it. However, a series of studies suggest that the feeling 

	
Lecture 23—How Your Brain Creates Happiness	
177
you are making intentional decisions actually follows the moment 
when you start to make those decisions. One of the areas in which 
automatic processes of the brain are most directly relevant is in the 
domain of happiness.
Adopt an Attitude of Gratitude


To make yourself happy, find something to be thankful for, and 
then thank the person most responsible for it. Write, call, or visit 
this person and communicate how much you appreciate his or her 
positive impact on your life. Expressing gratitude will likely make the 
person you thank feel good, but you will also feel happier. Thank 
people on a regular basis and you will find yourself becoming a 
happier person.
Imagine being happy. There 
is strong evidence that this 
simple strategy will lead to 
increased happiness.

	
178	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


The science is quite clear on this. Researchers conducting 
experimental studies recruited a group of participants and then 
randomly assigned half to a gratitude condition. The participants 
were asked to spend several minutes a day for a week thinking about 
aspects of their lives for which they were grateful. The control group 
spent equivalent amounts of time thinking and writing about recent 
experiences; however, the control participants were not explicitly 
asked to focus on gratitude.


Across a range of different situations, the participants who focused 
on gratitude later reported feeling happier about their lives and 
themselves. That is, the results strongly suggest that there is not 
simply a relationship between gratitude and happiness; this is an 
actual intervention that works.


An underlying theme in much of the research on happiness is that 
happiness is generated by the brain itself. This is counterintuitive to 
most people, who presume that things or people or events are what 
make us happy. 
Money Buys Happiness—to a Degree


It is often said that money can’t buy happiness. A research team led by 
Daniel Kahneman recently shed some light on a fundamental question 
related to money and happiness. His team set out to determine just 
how much money buys happiness and at what point will money no 
longer buy additional happiness.


The simple answer here is an annual household income of about 
81,000 dollars (in 2016 dollars). It’s important to note that this 
number varies quite a bit from place to place. In an expensive location 
such as Hawaii, additional money keeps increasing happiness up to 
about 122,000 dollars of annual household income. In Alabama, the 
cost of happiness is quite low, with happiness peaking around 65,000 
dollars per year. 

	
Lecture 23—How Your Brain Creates Happiness	
179


Kahneman and his colleague Angus Deaton analyzed about 450,000 
responses given by U.S. residents in a telephone survey conducted 
by the Gallup organization. A set of questions included in that survey 
was used to calculate people’s emotional well-being. The survey also 
included questions about the level of household income. The primary 
analysis here explored the relationship between the amount of money 
a person made per year and the level of general happiness. 


Not surprisingly, there was a clear positive relation between income 
and happiness. The crucial result, however, was that the amount of 
extra happiness you get for each additional dollar becomes smaller 
as the income rises. By the time you get up to an annual household 
income of around 50,000 dollars, the increases become extremely 
small. By the time the income rises to another plateau—around 
81,000 dollars in many locations—the average happiness score peaks. 
There were some increases beyond that level, but the increases were 
neither statistically significant nor substantively large. 


Therefore, money can buy you happiness—at least to a degree. To 
become truly happy, however, you will need to look beyond money. 
Basal Ganglia Activity


In older models of brain activity, our sense of pleasure and happiness 
are associated with stimulation of a particular subcortical structure of 
the brain: the basal ganglia. The nucleus accumbens—which is part 
of the motivation circuit in the basal ganglia—and the subcortical 
automatic motivation systems crave the release of dopamine within 
this pleasure circuit. 


In the 1950s, James Olds and Peter Milner found that if they delivered 
mild electrical stimulation to this brain region in rats, the rats acted 
as if it was a powerful positive reinforcement. When the researchers 
hooked up their system so that the rats could obtain this electrical 
stimulation by pressing a bar in their enclosure, the rats stopped 
eating and drinking and continued to press this bar for hours on end.


It’s not surprising that many addictive drugs increase activation 
in this same brain region. Activity in the basal ganglia is directly 
connected to our experience of intense pleasure. However, if you 
interview most heroin addicts, they don’t seem very happy. Indeed, 
even when they receive a dose of heroin, they often describe feeling 
relief, not happiness. 


More modern work on brain activity has re-characterized basal 
ganglia activity with the emotional feelings of liking or wanting—but 
that is not the same thing as happiness. 
Affective Neuroscience


The search for the brain circuits that are active in humans and other 
animals when they are actually happy or unhappy has spawned an 
entirely new subfield of cognitive neuroscience.


Richard Davidson is often described as one of the founders of a 
field that people now call affective neuroscience. This branch of 
neuroscience seeks to determine how the brain regulates emotion, how 
changes in emotion are mapped onto various patterns of brain activity, 
and the how we can change emotional states by changing the brain.


By studying hundreds of people in different emotional states, 
Davidson and his colleagues have begun to develop an outline of the 
characteristics of a happy brain and the ways that the brain activity of 
a happy person differs from that of an unhappy person. 
The Happiness Ratio


In general, when you are unhappy or feel stressed or anxious, 
particular regions of your brain become active. The amygdala is a 
relatively small subcortical region of the brain. It is an important part 
of the limbic system, a highly connected brain structure that seems 
to regulate negative emotions. If you stimulate a particular part of 
the amygdala of most animals, they become strikingly agitated and 

	
Lecture 23—How Your Brain Creates Happiness	
181
aggressive. What’s more, when animals are agitated and aggressive, 
it turns out that their amygdala is highly active. 


If you feel angry, anxious, or unhappy, it’s very likely that your 
amygdala is exhibiting high levels of activation. Along with the 
amygdala, negative emotions are associated with activity in the right 
prefrontal cortex. When you are distressed, this right prefrontal cortex 
seems to regulate a heightened state of vigilance. 


In contrast, the brains of people who report relatively high levels of 
happiness and enthusiasm are associated with low activities in both 
the amygdala and right prefrontal cortex regions. Instead, higher 
activity is found in the left prefrontal cortex. 
When heroin addicts 
receive a dose of heroin, 
they often describe feeling 
relief, not happiness.

	
182	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


If you put someone into a functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) scanner and examine the activity produced in the right 
prefrontal cortex and the left prefrontal cortex, you can calculate a 
ratio of activity: the amount of left prefrontal cortex activity divided 
by activity in right prefrontal cortex and amygdala. This ratio is a 
remarkably effective predictor of someone’s reports of their everyday 
happiness. Happier people tend to show a larger ratio. Unhappier 
people tend to show a substantially smaller ratio. 
Mindfulness Training 


In addition to quantifying the happiness ratio, Davidson and his 
colleagues have explored several methods to alter this ratio. One of 
the most successful is mindfulness training.


Although mindfulness training is associated with the practice of 
meditation, you can engage in mindfulness at any time. Training 
aimed at enhancing mindfulness will typically involve spending 15 to 
20 minutes per day in quiet meditation. Often, this method involves 
focusing your attention on your breathing and not dwelling on 
thoughts about the past or plans for the future. 


There is another aspect of the mindfulness training that is particularly 
relevant to happiness. As you quietly sit and meditate, you may 
become aware of the emotions you are feeling—specifically, you might 
feel happy or you might feel sad. Mindfulness training instructors will 
typically tell you to simply feel that feeling. Be aware of it. Embrace 
it. Students of mindfulness training are taught to focus periodically on 
being very aware of what is happening right now—that is, to be self-
aware in the particular moment. 


Most people spend much of their day thinking about what has 
happened in the past and making plans for the future. As important as 
this is to our daily cognition and decision making, the focus on what 
is outside the domain of our immediate context seems to generate 
stress, anxiety, and unhappiness.

	
Lecture 23—How Your Brain Creates Happiness	
183


Consider the intervention that Davidson and his colleagues used. 
After several weeks of mindfulness training, the happiness ratio 
became larger. It’s not clear what aspects of the mindfulness training 
accomplish this, but across many studies, when mindfulness training 
is used as an intervention, the brains of the participants change. Their 
brains produce different patterns of activity, and participants report 
that their everyday happiness levels increase.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Students of Buddhism pursue a goal of reducing desire rather than 
satisfying it. How does this align with our description of happiness 
as having a thermostat-like set point?
2.	 If you win a large lottery jackpot, you will be happy, but there 
is evidence that the happiness will fade as you adapt to the 
changes associated with it. If a lottery paid out prizes in gradually 
increasing amounts over time, could this lead to greater 
happiness?

Happy Brains Are Smart 
Brains
C
ognitive neuroscience research can help you understand how to 
make yourself happier. For example, when people are exposed 
to natural surroundings, their brains show patterns of activation 
associated with relaxation and happiness. Focusing on the value of time 
can affect automatic, unconscious processes in your brain that can lead 
to greater happiness. What’s more, across several studies using different 
types of happiness-induction procedures, the results are the same: Happy 
workers are more productive. Happy people also demonstrate enhanced 
immune function. Moreover, by intentionally practicing optimism, there is 
strong evidence that you will become more optimistic, leading directly to 
higher levels of happiness.
Significance of Green Spaces 


A simple way to make yourself happier is to go outside and visit a 
place that is rich in natural vegetation—a forest, an open field, a city 
park, or a desert landscape. Studies demonstrate that this visit to 
nature will have an effect on your brain that is on par with taking a 
dose of prescription antidepressants. Even better, while you are out 
there, get some exercise. 


Clearly, physical exercise is good for your brain. Regular workouts are 
associated with increases in neuron production in the hippocampus 
and other areas of the brain. In fact, several recent studies suggest 
that it’s even better if you perform that exercise in green, natural 
surroundings.



Peter Aspinall and his colleagues had participants hike around 
Edinburgh while wearing a portable electroencephalograph and GPS 
system. The device monitored patterns of brain activity over the 
course of the walk. The researchers found that when participants 
were in green spaces, they exhibited patterns of brain activity 
associated with happiness. Frustration levels fell. Patterns of brain 
activity associated with meditation increased. When participants were 
in more urban spaces, these patterns were reversed.


Colin Capaldi and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of these 
types of studies. They identified 30 different experiments—including 
8,523 participants—that had explored the relation between natural 
surroundings and happiness. When they analyzed these studies 
together, the average effect on happiness was impressively large. 
Perhaps most remarkable was that the effect was consistent across a 
wide range of different types of studies. 
Regular workouts are 
associated with increases 
in neuron production in the 
hippocampus and other 
areas of the brain.

	
186	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
Look Outside


Cognitive research suggests that you don’t have to change your 
activities, you can just take your current activities outside. In fact, you 
don’t even need to go outside. Simply viewing natural settings can 
affect patterns of neural activation.


A study by Roger Ulrich and his colleagues was based on hospital 
records at a facility in suburban Pennsylvania. Some of the hospital 
rooms had windows that looked out on the surrounding countryside; 
other rooms were windowless. Patients in both types of rooms 
received the same quality of care. They were served by the same staff 
with the same medications and protocols. 


Based on a review of hospital records, Ulrich found that the people 
assigned to window rooms recovered from surgeries more quickly 
and with fewer complications. Window-room participants checked 
out of the hospital, on average, about a day sooner than those in 
the windowless rooms. For the windowless patients, nurses’ notes 
contained nearly four times more negative assessments than they did 
for the window patients. 
Value Your Time


Another strategy to boost happiness is to value your time highly. A 
recent study by Ashley Whillans and her colleagues assessed the 
trade-offs between time and money to determine how much monetary 
value people place on their time. The authors found that individuals 
tend to place a fairly consistent value on their own time. In addition, 
the researchers determined that people who place a greater value on 
their time tend to be happier.


Cassie Molginer published a set of experiments exploring how time, 
social behavior, and happiness interact. In several of her experiments, 
participants started by completing a word-scramble puzzle. 
Participants had to unscramble the letters as quickly as possible and 
then come up with sentences that included the words.

	
Lecture 24—Happy Brains Are Smart Brains	
187


After completing this puzzle task, the study participants completed a 
questionnaire containing a list of daily activities, such as socializing, 
working, and commuting. The participants were asked to rate how 
much time they were likely to spend on each activity during the next 
day. They were also asked to rate how happy they expected to be 
while doing those tasks.


The key manipulation in the study was the content of the word 
puzzle. For some participants, the words were related to time; for 
other participants, the words were related to money. A control group 
unscrambled neutral words. 


Cognitive scientists think of the word-scramble puzzle as a priming 
task. While you are doing the puzzle, you’re inherently thinking about 
the related concepts, such as money or time. Once you finish the 
puzzle and go on to the survey, your conscious mind probably doesn’t 
focus on money or time. However, there is strong evidence that the 
unconscious neural networks that are used to process information 
related to the priming task remain active for at least several minutes. 


Results of the experiment demonstrated that if you prime people to 
think about money, they indicate that they will spend more of their 
next 24 hours working. If you prime the concept of time, people 
unconsciously shift their plans to include more time in social activities. 
What’s more, the time participants also anticipated being happier 
than the money participants.
Increased Work Production


A wide range of studies find that happier people produce more work 
and superior work. Productive work, of course, is itself a source of 
satisfaction; however, a number of studies have found that when you 
experimentally boost people’s happiness, they tend to improve in 
their work as well. 

	
188	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You


To test the relationship between happiness and work, Andrew Oswald 
and his colleagues recruited about 300 students and randomly 
assigned them to either a control condition or a happiness-induction 
condition. To induce happiness, participants watched a funny movie 
clip or were provided free drinks and snacks. As simple as these 
happiness-induction steps were, they increased the happiness level of 
these participants. Participants assigned to the control conditions had 
about the same level of happiness as when they started.


Oswald then asked these participants to perform some work, such as 
solving math puzzles. Across several studies using different types of 
happiness-induction procedures, the results were the same: Happy 
workers are more productive. When your brain is happy, it produces 
superior work. Happy people are less distractible, less irritable, and 
seem to have enhanced memory performance. 
Enhanced Immune Function


As we learned from Richard Davidson’s research, happy brains have 
greater patterns of activity in the left frontal cortex, as opposed to 
the right frontal cortex and amygdala areas. As part of the Davidson 
study, researchers collected blood samples from participants who 
had recently received flu shots. Davidson’s group found that the 
number of influenza antibodies in the bloodstream of the happy 
people was significantly greater than those in the bloodstream of the 
unhappy people. 


It may be that when you are unhappy, even if you aren’t experiencing 
the surge of adrenaline that we associate with a strong activation of 
the sympathetic nervous system, perhaps there are milder activations 
that suppress processes such as digestion and immune function. If 
so, then being happy will result in more resources being devoted to 
immune function. 


If you are happier, studies have shown that you will tend to be more 
energetic and productive. The influenza antibody result suggests a 

	
Lecture 24—Happy Brains Are Smart Brains	
189
very direct mechanism for that observed effect. Happy people have 
better immune function and therefore fewer illnesses—and fewer sick 
days out of work.
Practice Optimism


A successful strategy for promoting happiness is to practice being 
optimistic. By intentionally practicing optimism, there is strong 
evidence that you will become more optimistic, which will lead directly 
to higher levels of happiness.


A theory often associated with Rick Hanson and his colleagues is that 
humans are born pessimists. While this is debatable, there is evidence 
that we tend to be more affected by negative events than positive 
ones. A number of brain mechanisms may be responsible for this 
tendency. For example, the amygdala—an area greatly activated by 
Happy people have 
better immune function 
and therefore fewer 
illnesses—and fewer sick 
days out of work.

	
190	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
negative experiences—has strong connections to the hippocampus, 
which is responsible for encoding information into long-term memory. 
Thus, a negative memory will likely be encoded more strongly than a 
positive one.


This creates a problem for happiness. If humans are inherently 
somewhat pessimistic, then the brain is wired to resist when positive 
events happen. Even if you experience an equal number of positive 
and negative events, your brain will remember a greater proportion of 
those negatives.


The best way to be more optimistic, however, is to practice. A system 
that David Fresco and his colleagues have explored in several studies 
simply involves keeping track of the times when you engage in a 
pessimistic-explanation strategy.


When some event or uncertain situation arises, you can interpret it 
in either an optimistic way or a pessimistic way. If you make a note 
of those times and then intentionally try to be more optimistic, then 
optimism will become a habit. In as little as two weeks of using this 
intervention, participants’ explanatory styles are altered significantly. 
Human Connectome Project 


Our brains contain unconscious control systems, and we have 
tendencies to think and behave according to certain cognitive reflexes. 
All of us are embodiments of an ongoing battle between these reflexive, 
automatic tendencies and our conscious, intentional mind. 


Throughout this course, we’ve considered ways to outsmart these 
automatic brain systems. We have provided numerous tools that 
you can use in that battle, and now you know enough to seek out 
additional tools adapted even more specifically to your individual 
situation. If you are patient and persistent, you can outsmart many of 
those automatic processes and take control for yourself. 

	
Lecture 24—Happy Brains Are Smart Brains	
191


What’s more, cognitive neuroscientists aren’t finished with their 
research on the brain. If anything, the rate of new discovery has 
accelerated in recent years. For example, the Human Connectome 
Project has developed new neuroimaging techniques that combine 
assessments of connectivity and myelination with correlations in 
activation. The underlying circuit diagram of the human brain has 
uncovered more than 100 newly identified processing systems. Right 
now, we don’t know what many of these systems do. But we will. 


It may be that you have little or no conscious control over your 
moment-to-moment behaviors; there’s good evidence for that 
from cognitive neuroscience research. Over longer periods of 
time, however, you do have the ability to consciously shape those 
unconscious systems. The battle can be a challenging one, but the 
outcomes can be tremendously rewarding. You can outsmart yourself.
Questions to Consider 
1.	 Spending time in natural surroundings engaged with nature 
promotes happiness. Even simply looking out a window seems 
sufficient to promote happiness. Do you think nature-themed art 
or computer screen savers would have a similar effect? How could 
you test for this in your own life?
2.	 Simply mentioning the concept of time a few times seems to 
promote greater socialization. The concept of money seems to 
promote more work behavior. What other key concepts might 
modulate our behaviors in this fashion?

angry tone of voice, particular brain circuits are activated; suppressing 
that tone of voice can reduce the anger inherent in any confrontation.
Satel, S., and S. O. Lilienfeld. Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of 
Mindless Neuroscience. New York: Basic Books, 2013. This course has 
often argued that understanding the patterns of brain activity associated 
with various types of mental and physical activity can lead to a better 
understanding of ourselves and better outcomes. This book questions 
those assumptions and will lead to a better understanding of the strengths 
and weaknesses of the cognitive neuroscience approach.
Schwartz, Barry. The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less. New York: 
Ecco, 2004. The notion that expanded choice and freedom of choice 
are always desirable is central to Western cultural identity. This book 
considers situations in which too much freedom of choice leads to 
negative outcomes; examines what these negative outcomes reveal about 
the nature of human decision making; and presents strategies to minimize 
the problems created by too much choice.

Skinner, B. F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. New York: Bantam Books, 
1972. This enormously influential work provides a fascinating firsthand 
account of the behaviorist approach to understanding and controlling the 
behaviors of humans and other animals. Much has been discovered since 
this book was published, but this work remains fundamental to many 
modern theories of behavioral science.
Soeter, M., and M. Kindt. “An Abrupt Transformation of Phobic Behavior 
after a Post-Retrieval Amnesic Agent.” Biological Psychiatry 78, no. 12 
(2015): 880–86. This paper provides a detailed summary of a potentially 
transformative study of memory re-consolidation and fear.
Spivey, M. The Continuity of Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. 
At the heart of embodied-cognition theory is the idea that the body and 
mind are integrated into a single dynamic system. This book maintains 
that we should change our conceptions of the brain and mind if we are to 
understand completely the nature of human thought and behavior.
Stickgold, R., and M. P. Walker, eds. The Neuroscience of Sleep. London: 
Academic Press, 2010. The authors provide a detailed, authoritative 
account of what the brain does during different types of sleep. 
Tang, Y. Y., B. K. Hölzel, and M. I. Posner. “The Neuroscience of 
Mindfulness Meditation.” Nature Reviews Neuroscience 16, no. 4 (2015): 
213–25. This journal article provides a detailed and technical review of 
what happens in the brain during different types of meditative practice. 
Thaler, R. H. Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics. New 
York: W. W. Norton, 2015. Behavioral economists describe the mythical 
creature “homo economicus” as one whose behavior conforms to the 
economic principles of maximizing benefits and minimizing costs. In 
fact, however, decisions about how to increase happiness are driven by a 
variety of principles characterized by behavioral economics.

More Done in Less Time. San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler, 2007. This book 

	
200	 Outsmart Yourself: Brain-Based Strategies to a Better You
takes its title from a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain. If you start 
each day by eating a live frog, you can go through the rest of the day 
comfortable in the notion that nothing else will be worse. This course 
argues that you should first tackle the hardest thing you have on your to-
do list. This book suggests this as well and presents many other tips for 
overcoming procrastination.
Verstynen, T., and B. Voytek. Do Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep?: 
A Neuroscientific View of the Zombie Brain. Princeton, NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 2014. One of the best ways to consider human thought 
processes and human behavior is to ponder how other creatures 
might think and behave. This highly engaging book considers how our 
understanding of human cognitive neuroscience might explain why 
zombies behave as they do. While not scientifically testable, the book is 
both entertaining and educational.
Wansink, B. Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life. 
New York: Hay House, 2016. This outstanding book describes research 
on human eating behaviors and outlines how those results can be used to 
improve our physical health and well-being.
Wenk, G. L. Your Brain on Food: How Chemicals Control Your Thoughts 
and Feelings. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014. The lectures in this 
course consider how to regulate your eating. This book explores a related 
topic: how your eating regulates you.
