Acknowledgments
Writing this book has been a whirlwind journey that has taught me so much, I can still hardly believe it all 
came together!
I would like to thank the wonderful team at Apress, without whom this book would not exist. Thanks 
to Jonathan Gennick, who saw the potential in the proposal and pushed the idea for this book forward; 
Lyne Hoge and Douglas Pundick, who made sure all the images and explanations in this book flow together 
to create a better experience for the reader; and Jill Balzano, who helped keep us on track and always 
understood when we missed a deadline or needed some extra time for image permissions. And to Tiffany 
Taylor for copy-editing.
I would also like to thank all the designers who dedicated the time to let me pick their brains and 
ask them the same questions they get asked in every interview. They helped transform and expand my 
perspective on wearables to make this book more thorough and complete. Thanks to Yolita Nugent, for her 
insight and wonderful recommendations on what areas of body technologies to explore; and Sylivia Stein, 
Madison Maxey, Chris Pin, and other designers and friends who helped point me in the right direction 
during my research about textiles and manufacturing. Thanks to all the companies and designers who 
granted permission for their images of their work to be featured in this book; I hope that together we will be 
able to reach an even wider audience and expose your talent and ideas.
A special thanks to my guest authors Madeline Gannon and Kate Sicchio, who have shared their 
expertise to make this book more complete and more interesting. They have helped me with many aspects 
of the book beyond the chapters they wrote, from helping me figure how to structure chapters to helping me 
choose appropriate images. On that note, I’d like to thank my friends and family, who have been extremely 
supportive throughout this process and have helped me keep other commitments afloat. I definitely had 
to be very protective of my spare time to (try to) meet all of my deadlines, and I greatly appreciate all the 
support and encouragement I received. A special thanks to my amazing mother, (also a talented seamstress) 
who always encourages me to keep going. And to my dad who once told me “I think you should write a 
book”, here it is.

Introduction
A ring on your finger vibrates, a bracelet is illuminated with soft white lights that begin to cycle on and off 
in a repeating pattern, and your shirt begins to tighten around your body. Your clothes and accessories 
have come to life and seem to have a mind of their own. Although this may seem like a description of a 
scene from a science fiction story, many of these devices already exist and are being adopted by people all 
over the world. Doctors use them to monitor their patients, dancers use them to add expression to their 
performances, and educators use them to teach concepts of engineering; the applications span industries 
and communities worldwide.
A wearable, in its simplest form, is defined as an item or object that is suitable for wearing. Clothes, 
jewelry, armor, watches, glasses, and shoes all fit within this category. However, over the past few decades, 
this term has taken on a more specific connotation, referring explicitly to wearable technology. Wearable 
technology is defined as any wearable that incorporates electronics either as an accessory or as part of an 
item of clothing. The electronics may collect information, or they may just feature lights and speakers that 
are prewired to turn on in a sequence when connected to a power source. Wearable computing is a specific 
subset of wearable technology that refers to computational or sensory devices. Often these devices are 
miniature forms of a device that exists in non-wearable form. This book explores the evolution of different 
types of wearable technology within the larger world of textiles and fashion.
Wearable technologies propose completely new solutions and features to address connectivity, security, 
and health. The most obvious of these is that they allow for a more intimate and personal connection with 
the user. Although the ring, bracelet, and shirt described earlier may seem disruptive or intrusive, they are 
intrusive in a personal sense. Other people may not notice that your bracelet is flashing, and they won’t 
be able to tell that your ring is vibrating or that your shirt is being stretched. These are all hidden, almost 
secret interactions that are directed only at the user. Unlike a loud cellphone ringtone, which could disrupt 
a whole lecture hall or movie theater, a gentle vibration or glow on the finger is barely noticeable. However, 
these new interactions and associations will ultimately breed a new set of gestures and reactions to our 
environments. Once we are trained to associate the sound of a bell with an incoming message, or a slight 
tapping on the shoulder with a reminder to straighten up, we may be augmenting our senses to a point that 
we expect the world to be equipped with these electronic devices. We may respond to them more intensely 
then we do to our primitive human instincts associated with nature.
Wearables have attracted experts from fashion, engineering, education, and several other fields to work 
together. The interdisciplinary nature of wearable devices serves as a unique platform for people to share 
skills in craft, science, design, and more. Interestingly, an important invention in the field of textiles—the 
Jacquard head by Joseph Marie Jacquard (circa 1801)—was the first binary information processor. At any 
given point, the thread in a woven fabric can be in one of two states or positions: on the face of the fabric or 
on the back. Pattern cards were punched or cut according to the required fabric design. A hole in the card 
signified that the thread would appear on the face of the fabric, whereas a blank meant the end would be left 
down and appear on the back of the fabric. The Jacquard head was used on weaving looms or machines to 
raise and lower the warp threads to form desired patterns based on the lifting plan or program embedded in 
the cards. Thus the Jacquard mechanism set the stage for modern-day binary information processing.

 ■ INTRODUCTION
xxiv
Tech companies such as Google are partnering with Levi’s and other fashion companies to create 
clothing that is embedded with interfaces and sensors. With this collaboration, Levi’s can focus on creating 
a comfortable and stylish item, and Google can focus on giving it function and supporting the technology. 
Each company is able to focus on its strengths in the collaboration, but a certain amount of training and 
learning is necessary for fluid communication. Software engineers at Google studied traditional methods 
of textile manufacturing to gain an understanding of what is possible in order to better communicate their 
idea to designers at Levi’s. Similarly, designers at Levi’s needed to learn the basics of electronics and tactile 
interfaces to understand how to work with them and what considerations they must factor into their designs.
This book gives examples of these types of collaborations while guiding you through common 
methodologies from both a textiles and technology perspective.
Book Overview
This book is divided into three parts. The first part sets the stage by providing some foundational knowledge 
of the history of wearables. The second part discusses techniques for crafting wearables, from a simple 
sewable circuit to a complex digital interface. The third part takes a look at the use of wearables in various 
industries and reviews some inspirational products and projects.
Part 1 of the book walks you through the factual and fictional evolution of wearable computing. 
Chapter 1 discusses the intersection of textiles and technology from the earliest known forms of wearable 
computational devices and the integration of automated and robotic techniques in the textile industry. 
Chapter 2 provides an overview of the influence that science fiction and other forms of narrative media have 
had on the wearable industry. In particular, it looks at how some popular fictional props have set the stage 
for the introduction of certain technologies.
Part 2 of the book includes the bulk of the “wearable recipes,” showcasing some of the methods 
and techniques used by hobbyists and professionals as they pertain to the research and development of 
wearables. We begin by looking at the current state of textile manufacturing and follow with a crash course 
in basic sewing and pattern-making techniques. The next few chapters include tutorials for sewing circuits 
and creating textile “soft” sensors. We then introduce some common tools and materials used by e-textile 
artists and designers with reviews and recommendations for various applications. The last few chapters in 
this section look at new interfaces and tools for wearables and how they are changing and improving current 
manufacturing methods.
Part 3 focuses on real-world applications and provides an in-depth look at popular wearable products 
and high-tech fashion. We examine various products, from medical devices to augmented-reality glasses 
and consider their usability and potential scalability. This section includes some design thinking exercises 
to help guide you through your personal evaluation of the devices described. We then explore some more 
experimental approaches to wearables involving the application of electronics directly to the skin and the 
idea of superhuman powers. This leads into a catalogue of wearables that have been incorporated in high 
fashion and costumes for performance. The final few chapters of part 3 explore the cultural significance of 
the projects and products mentioned and speculate on future trends and implications.
This book will leave you with a comprehensive general knowledge of the state of wearables in different 
industries, including a well-curated list of example projects and resources. It will serve as a wonderful 
launching pad for your personal journey into the world e-textiles.

 CHAPTER 1  
 A Brief History of Wearables 
 The motivation for  designing and making wearables has always been quite simple: to provide convenience 
for the  wearer . As the world becomes more connected, our attention is increasingly divided. Clothing and 
accessories, when chosen carefully, can provide comfort and relief. For example, by adding more function 
to an outfit, you can consolidate the number of objects you need and make yourself more efficient when 
mobile. The ability to access e-mail or schedule an appointment on the go opens up new possibilities 
for where and how you can work. This chapter looks at the evolution of some of the earliest wearable 
technologies and the role they have played in fashion, technology, and society. 
 Overview 
 Before mobile phones became a widespread handheld accessory, many people wore a watch to tell the time. 
The  history of the common wristwatch began in the 1500s, when the watch was redesigned to use simple 
springs as opposed to bulky, heavy weights, allowing the device to shrink considerably in size. German 
inventor Peter Henlein began developing small watches that hung from a chain around the neck and could be 
worn as a necklace. Then, in the late 1600s, the waistcoat became a fashionable item, and men began carrying 
watches in the pocket of their coat, leading to the popularization of pocket watches. Wristwatches appeared 
around the same time, but they were almost exclusively worn by women and marketed as bracelets. 
 The watch further evolved over time, becoming smaller and more accurate. In 1904, aviator Alberto 
Santos-Dumont commissioned the famous jeweler Cartier to create a timepiece that could be worn around 
his wrist, allowing him to keep his hands free for piloting. This proved to be a convenient place to wear a 
watch, and many soldiers began wearing watches to help synchronize time during war. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ A BRIEF HISTORY OF WEARABLES

 The  wristwatch  became widespread as a wearable after the World War I and continues to be redesigned 
and readapted today. The first mechanical digital watch was designed in the 1920s, and this technology was 
widely used until 1969, when quartz watches were introduced; the new technology greatly improved the 
accuracy of watches and reduced the maintenance required. In 1972, the Hamilton Pulsar electronic digital 
watch hit the market. In 1976, the company took the watch further, using new LCD display technology, and 
sold the first calculator watch. The calculator watch was redesigned by Casio in 1980 and became wildly 
popular as an iconic nerd accessory. In 1982, Seiko took the watch to a new level with a television watch, 
featuring a miniature blue LCD screen. Although the watch had to be tethered to another piece that housed 
the TV tuning system, it was impressive. 
 Over time, the price of manufacturing a  digital watch  decreased significantly, and companies began to 
add more features such as Nintendo games and address books. In 1994, Timex added a critical feature: the 
ability to communicate with another digital device. Using an optical sensor embedded in the watch, the Link-
150 could transmit data to a PC. Other notable developments included the Casio camera watch, released in 
2000, which housed a tiny functional digital camera; and the Seiko e-ink watch, released in 2010, which was 
the first smart watches with an interactive e-ink display. Today, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Google 
continue to develop watches, adding more and more functionality to the small, wearable wristband. 
 Although a bit smaller and arguably less commonly worn, the ring has also been used as a 
 computational device  for centuries. In the 17th century, the Qing Dynasty of China created the first smart 
ring in the form of an abacus embedded in a metal ring that was worn on a finger. The size of the  abacus was 
1 cm by 1/2 cm, and it contained seven rods with seven beads on each rod that could be moved back and 
forth using a small tool such as a hairpin. It is believed that the ring was used by traders who needed to make 
quick calculations while traveling from port to port. 
 The  ring  has been designed with other computational features over time. The Swiss ring watch 
appeared in 1890s as a fanciful jewelry item. Today, companies like Ringly continue to expand on the 
capabilities of the ring by embedding electronic interfaces and communication systems.

 Another interesting wearable device is the  hearing aid . The first hearing aid, also called an  ear trumpet , 
was invented in the 17th century; and the first electronic hearing aid was developed in the 1890s after the 
invention of the telephone. Digital hearing aids hit the market in 1898. They continue to be redesigned and 
to shrink in size with each new version. 
 Wearables to Help You Win 
 In 1961, two mathematicians, Edward O. Thorpe and Claude Shannon, built a shoe that helped them 
cheat at roulette. Their idea was to hide a  timing device  in the shoe, which could fairly accurately predict 
which number the roulette ball would land on.  Radio waves were used to communicate this number to 
the wearer of the shoe via an earpiece, allowing him to make a well-informed bet. When tested by the 
inventors, the gadget increased the odds of winning by 44%. However, when Thorpe and Shannon took 
their gadget to the casino to test it, they experienced several hardware problems and were not able to 
double their money as planned. 
 Although primitive, the invention tackled many challenges that designers of wearables are still trying 
to overcome today.  Designing truly personal communication between the device and the wearer was one 
aspect of the project that took a lot of experimentation and consideration; encasing the hardware in such a 
way that it could withstand the wear and tear of an active person was another. 
 In 1972, Alan Lewis, a theoretical physicist, tackled the same problem using a computer hidden in a 
camera case. A few years later, in 1978, a group of mathematicians formed a group called the  Eudaemons  . 
Their objective was to create a device that would similarly help them beat roulette, and then to use the 
money to fund a scientific community. In the end, they also chose to conceal the computational device in a 
shoe. The data was input by the user by tapping a switch under the big toe in the shoe; the signal was then 
relayed to an output system, which was hidden in the player’s shirt. The input came from three solenoids 
that vibrated in a certain pattern, informing the user which of the eight octants of the roulette wheel to bet 
on. The “shoe computer” is shown in Figure  1-2 .

 The group took the device to Las Vegas in 1978 and reported a profit of 44% for every dollar. 
Unfortunately, like Thorpe and Shannon, they experienced  hardware problems , the most severe being 
that the insulation rubbed off on the wires and the wearer experienced several  electric shock s from the 
solenoids, burning a hole in her skin. In the end, they won approximately $10,000 and accomplished their 
goal of statistically predicting where the ball would land on the wheel based on input data. However, the 
risks involved drew the group apart, and they disbanded shortly after the trip. Their work is thought of as a 
precursor to data science and predictive analysis. 
 Wearables and the  Arts 
 Theodore Dubois, professor of harmony at the Conservatoire in Paris, debuted his  electric ballet  
 La Farandole in 1883. In the ballet, dancers wore electric lights on their foreheads; batteries were concealed 
in the recesses of their clothing. When the dancers touched a button on their belt, the lights illuminated. 
The technology used in the  batteries was featured in electronic journals from the time. Figure  1-3 is from an 
article in  The Electrician describing the battery. 
 Figure 1-3.  Image of a wearable electric headband from  La  Farandole 
 One year later, in 1884, the  New York Times published an article about a new phenomenon: the  Electric 
Girl Lighting Company . It was said that the company rented out “illuminated girls” who would wait on 
homeowners while wearing filament lamps of “fifty candle power.” The girls would sit either by the door or 
in the hall to guide guests through the house while lighting their way in the night. In the story, the  cost   of 
hiring a girl is said to be less than the combined costs of running an electric lamp and hiring a servant, thus 
providing the perfect replacement for both services. The  Times article made the prediction that “in a very 
short time private houses will be lighted by girls, instead of stationary electric lights.” The article also claimed 
that the creation of “Electric Girls” was almost as important as the invention of electricity. Historians believe 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ A BRIEF HISTORY OF WEARABLES
7
that this story was in fact a spoof, based on the inconsistencies of many facts in the article. Perhaps the idea 
was inspired by Dubois’ ballet and other events at the time, but no real record of the company has ever been 
found. Additionally, the writer for the  New York Times  published the article under a fake name, giving reason 
to doubt its validity. But regardless of whether the girls existed, the article shows that hiring a human lamp, 
so to speak, was plausible at the time—so much so that the idea was able to slip by the editor and make it 
into print. You will see more of these fictitious stories and their influence in the next chapter. 
 Back to actual historic inventions and gadgets: in 1907, German inventor and amateur photographer 
Julius Neubronner patented what may have been the first wearable  camera . He strapped a small wooden 
camera to a pigeon to take aerial photographs. His tiny lightweight camera featured a timer mechanism so 
that it could capture a single image. Although his work won him many photography awards, the expenses 
involved made it an unsustainable pursuit. 
 In 1968, the Museum of Contemporary Craft in New York City held a monumental exhibit called  Body 
Covering centered around forms for covering the body using new technology. The exhibit featured an array 
of wearable projects, from astronaut suits to clothing that could heat and cool itself and light up. The exhibit 
included the work of Diana Dew, who created a line of electroluminescent party dresses that could light up 
and produce siren noises. The work in  Body Covering is particularly impressive because the designers and 
artists did not have specialized tools for activating their creations. They had to creatively repurpose raw 
materials and readily available electronics, and then embed them into clothes and accessories. Fashion 
designers and artists continue to experiment with embedding electronics, pushing the limits of fabric craft 
and engineering. Chapter   14 takes a closer look at these projects. 
 New Ideas and New  Tools  
 In 1985, Harry Wainwright created a sweatshirt embedded with fiber-optic lights and a microprocessor 
that could control the pattern of the lights and display frames of a full-color cartoon animation on the 
surface of the fabric. Ten years later, in 1995, he invented a machine specifically designed to weave fiber 
optics into fabric. In 1997, he developed this into the first CNC machine that can embed fiber optics into 
any flexible material. He holds over a dozen patents based on light displays and machinery and has created 
custom apparel and toys for Disney, Mattel, Britney Spears, Sony, and more. Although Wainwright’s work 
is primarily used for entertainment, he has also developed educational kits. He still consults, designs, and 
teaches workshops on the subject at his studio in Monessen, Pennsylvania. 
 Over time, textiles artists and engineers have worked together to create highly specialized tools and 
methods for wearables. A new genre of technology has emerged, commonly referred to as  computational 
craft . In 2006, Leah Buechly coined the term  e-textile construction kit and introduced the LilyPad Arduino, an 
electronic kit featuring the popular microcontroller platform that enabled people to build interactive fashion 
using fabric-mounted boards. The project was further developed in collaboration with popular hobby 
electronics company SparkFun Electronics and became commercially available in late 2007. The spirit of 
creating an easy-to-use platform for artists and designers to attach and program electronics on clothing has 
been carried on by several designers. Chapter   4 takes a closer look at some of  these . 
 Wearable  Eyewear 
 The first set of eyeglasses was  created for Emperor Nero (who ruled from 54-68 A.D.). Eyeglass were purely 
 analog tools   for centuries until Hubert Upton created what may have been the first a pair of augmented reality 
glasses in 1967. Upton, an engineer at Bell Helicopter, conceived a device as a personal project that would 
help hearing-impaired people visualize sounds. His original  design   included a microphone that analyzed 
sounds via a portable wearable computer and sent a signal to a small  fiber optic LED embedded in the glasses. 
Depending on the tone, the light would change color and project straight out into the wearer’s field of vision. 
Upton surmised that if the light aligned with a speaker’s lips, the deaf person would have an easier time with lip 
reading. Unfortunately, this was never truly realized, and the technology was repurposed for the military such

that instead of translating sound into color, the light projected lines in front of pilots to give them direction 
while flying a plane through difficult areas or landing at night. 
 Wearables have shown great potential in helping the impaired. In 1977, C. C. Collins, a researcher at the 
Smith-Kettlewell Institute of Visual Sciences, developed a five-pound, wearable, head-mounted camera for 
the visually impaired. Collins used the now-popular technique of haptic tactile feedback and converted a 
1,024-point image from the  camera into a 10-inch square   tactile grid  on a wearable vest. 
 Many of these devices can be readapted to either augment or improve the senses, although some 
experimenters are focused more on augmenting perception. In 1981, Steven Mann, then in high school, 
fastened a 6502-based multimedia computer with text, graphics, and multimedia capability, as well as 
 video capability , to his backpack. Mann is known as the father of wearable computing and the first person 
to call himself a cyborg. Since 1989, he has been wearing a computerized eyewear system that he builds 
and rebuilds himself. Figure  1-4 provides a snapshot of the evolution of his glasses over the years. Mann 
has invented countless wearable computational perception devices throughout his career, most notably the 
wireless webcam.  
 Figure 1-4.  Steve Mann’s wearable  computer inventions (courtesy of Steve Mann) 
 In 1987,  Reflection Technology released the Private Eye shown in Figure  1-5 . It was a commercial 
wearable television display that could be handheld or worn over the center of one eye. It weighed less than 
two ounces, and the 1.2 inch × 3.2 inch display had a resolution comparable to that of a personal computer 
screen at the time: 720 × 280 pixels. Additionally, it drew only 1/2 watt and could be battery powered. The 
Private Eye was used in many wearable  computer projects , including these two:
• 
 VuMan 1, a project developed at Carnegie Mellon University, allowed the user to 
virtually maneuver through the blueprints of a house using three input buttons. The 
project was redeveloped through six generations from 1991–1995. Version 2 included 
a cursor that allowed the user to select items from a map or database, and version 3 
was upgraded to include features like memory and power management. 
• 
 The  Lizzy, developed at the MIT Media Lab by Thad Starner and Doug Platt in 1993, 
began as a research project to develop a wearable platform that could be used for 
general-purpose computing applications. It was created as an open source project 
with an assembly guide, in the hopes that many other people would adapt and 
repurpose it for their needs. Starner has continued to wear a customized computer 
system since he created Lizzy, updating the parts with new technologies and features 
over the years, and he currently leads Google’s Project Glass. 
 Both of these projects are arguably a few decades ahead of their time and are still inspiring 
researchers today.

 Wearables in  Research 
 In 1996, the Department of Defense organized a workshop titled “Wearables in 2005” and brought industrial, 
university, and military visionaries together to work on the common theme of delivering computing to 
individuals. One notable project funded by DARPA is the  Wearable Motherboard, also called the  Smart 
Shirt,  developed at Georgia Tech. An image of the shirt is shown in Figure  1-6 . The Smart Shirt was 
developed under the paradigm “the fabric is the computer,” and it brought engineering, textiles, and medical 
applications together. The Smart Shirt is recognized as the first “intelligent” garment, because it was the 
first wearable integrated information infrastructure; the group called it Personalized Mobile Information 
Processing (PMIP). It used optical fiber embedded in the fabric to detect bullet wounds and used embedded 
sensors to monitor heart rate and other vital signs during combat. As the project continued, it was developed 
less as a military-specific garment and more for civilians, because it featured so many new opportunities in 
the medical realm to monitor vital signs. The group continued to redesign and develop the architecture and 
textiles in an attempt to achieve their goal of creating a wearable processing system that could be reached 
“anywhere, anytime, and by anyone.”

 Summary 
 Several important milestones were not reviewed in this chapter but are mentioned in the chapters to come 
as you look at more specific  developments in wearables. The examples in this chapter were chosen to give 
a general idea of how a wearable gadget can evolve over time, adapting to new technological advances 
and cultural needs. For example, researchers may find they need to shift their focus to continue to fund 
and support their project, as in the case of Upton’s augmented-reality glasses. New tools are designed for 
manufacturing and experimenting as interest in and demand for wearable technology increases. The next 
chapter takes a closer look at cultural interest in wearables and examines some fictional stories that have 
inspired and motivated these technologies.

 CHAPTER 2  
 Wearable Fictions 
 Wearables often seem like something out of a  science fiction (sci-fi) movie, made for another world or 
another time. Sometimes that’s because they really  are something out of a science fiction movie. Sci-fi is 
a genre of fiction that is based on imaginary concepts such as futuristic worlds and technology, parallel 
universes, and extraterrestrial life. It is a subgenre of  speculative  fiction , which refers more broadly to stories 
that involve elements of imaginary or speculative concepts as opposed to those of reality and everyday life. 
 The wearables field has been linked to speculative ideas, sci-fi books and films, and other imaginary 
media for decades. Most superheroes and villains are equipped with a magical gadget, cape, or shoes that 
enhance their superpowers. Sometimes the magic is embedded in the wearable, leaving us to believe that 
anyone with a particular hat or cloak could be transformed into a wizard. Other times the wearable simply 
enhances these powers, making them seem more far-fetched for everyday use. This chapter traces the 
evolution of fictitious wearables, connecting them to inventions and ideas that actually exist today. 
 Sci-fi Prophecies 
 Sci-fi is not only responsible to introducing us to crazy fashion styles and superpowers; many of the terms 
and concepts used to describe wearable  gadgets and devices come from sci-fi stories. The term  cyborg was 
coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline in a story they wrote called “Cyborgs and Space.” In the 
story, the cyborg is a human being who is augmented with technological “attachments.” Today the term is 
defined as a person who is dependent on a mechanical or electronic device. 
 Neuromancer , written by William Gibson in 1984, founded the genre of  cyberpunk .  Cyberpunk is a 
subgenre of sci-fi in which the story takes place in a dystopian futuristic world similar to Earth. The plot 
usually involves a conflict between a corporation and rebellious hacker. Cyberpunk characters are generally 
augmented with computer implants, and there is often an underground world of computer hackers. In 
 Neuromancer , one of the main protagonists has undergone surgical alterations and wears inset glasses with 
an alphanumeric readout, which has been tied to the origin of the concept for Google Glass. 
 Another famous sci-fi novel,  Fahrenheit 451 , written by Ray Bradbury in 1953, describes a futuristic 
world where people live under a government who has outlawed written word and instructs firemen to burn 
any existing books. In the book, Bradbury describes “little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an 
electronic ocean of sound” in the ears of the characters. Bradbury is credited with forecasting the invention of 
headphones, along with many other gadgets and cultural norms of the today’s world, like large  flatscreen TVs . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ WEARABLE FICTIONS

 Bionics and Biomimetics  
 Bionics are technologies that are built and designed based on biological systems in nature. Although the 
term was coin in 1958 by medical doctor Jack Steele, it was popularized in 1970 after the launch of several 
sci-fi books and television series. A bionic limb, also called a  prosthetic , is one that has been replaced by 
an artificial limb that is electronically or mechanically powered. Bionic limbs have featured in many pieces 
of fiction since the 1960s and 70s, including  The Six Million Dollar Man , the Borg of  Star Trek , and Darth 
Vader. In the 1970s show  The Bionic Woman , the main character has been fitted with several bionic parts 
after suffering from a traumatic parachute-landing accident. She is given a pair of bionic legs that can propel 
her at speeds of more than 60 mph and a bionic arm that can bend steel, along with other supernatural 
substitutes. 
 Bionic engineering has been used in the development of ultrasound imaging, cybernetics, fabric that 
mimics the way pinecones adapt to temperature, and more.   Biomimetics is closely related to bionics and 
refers to models, systems, and elements of nature that are adapted and imitated to solve complex human 
problems. 
 Diegetic Prototypes 
 One of my favorite design exercises is to try to invent for an imaginary world. I find designing for the present 
and near future limiting in many ways; it steers you toward something practical—something that seems 
attainable. When you remove those requirements, you have the freedom to speculate even deeper and 
invent scenarios, cultures, and designs for a world that may not ever exist. Depending on the time period, 
planet, and dimension of your alternate and imaginary world, the clothing, spacesuits, and communication 
devices will be radically different from your everyday world and what you are familiar with, at least for now. 
 Diegetic prototype  is a term introduced by Julian Bleecker of the Near Future Laboratory, which he 
defines as “ways in which cinematic depictions of future technologies demonstrate to large public audiences 
a technology’s need, viability and benevolence.” These depictions, or props, are fictional to the audience 
but completely real to the characters in the story. Diegetic prototypes are crucial to the development of a 
fictional world, because they help guide the audience through the sensory experience of what it is like to 
exist in that world. Watching characters interact with these objects makes it easier to put yourself in the 
world and imagine how you too could use these devices. Some of these props are believable because they 
could conceivably really exist in the near future, and others are extremely specific to the scenario in the 
story. For example, the earpiece in the movie  Her basically already exists as a Bluetooth headset. It is a 
bit bulkier and does not have such a developed operating system (OS), but the concept is relatable to the 
majority of the audience. 
 Minority Report 
 Minority Report , a 2002 film based on Phillip K. Dick’s short story with the same title, depicts a future high-
tech crime unit in which police are able to predict a murder before it even happens. Although many different 
aspects of the movie have come true, such as advertising based on facial recognition, let’s focus on the 
wearables. In the movie, the main character constantly uses projected touchscreen interfaces with special 
gloves that allow him to control the content that is displayed. The system recognizes various gestures as 
input, many of which are similar to the gestural interfaces used today with touchscreen phones and tablets. 
 Pranav Mistry of the Fluid Interfaces group at the MIT Media Lab recently released the SixthSense 
project, shown in Figure  2-1 . The project consists of “a wearable gestural interface that augments the 
physical world around us with digital information and lets us use natural hand gestures to interact with that 
information.” SixthSense consists of a pocket projector that projects visual information on surfaces, walls, 
and physical objects, and a camera that recognizes and tracks the user’s hand gestures and physical objects 
using a computer-vision algorithm. This means any surface can be instantly transformed into an interface.  

CHAPTER 2 ■ WEARABLE FICTIONS
13
 The user  wears  colored markers on their hands, which are encoded in the system to trigger specific 
actions in response to different gestures. SixthSense also recognizes when the user draws icons or symbols 
in the air with an index finger and processes them as interaction instructions. For example, drawing a 
magnifying glass symbol opens the Map application. The group has posted instructions on how to make 
your own SixthSense system for approximately $350 at   https://code.google.com/p/sixthsense/ . Several 
other research groups in industry and academia are working on similar systems of touchscreen interactions 
that don’t actually involve touching, referred to as  ultrahaptic technology . 
 Back to the Future 
 Back to the Future  (1985) is a sci-fi adventure film about a teenager named Marty McFly who travels 30 years 
into the future in a flying car to save his family. It was the highest-grossing film of the year and has won 
countless awards, including being named the American Film Institute’s 10th best sci-fi film.

■ Note   The date that McFly travels into the future (October 21, 2015, “Back to the Future Day”) happened to 
be the week before I began writing this chapter! 
 In case you have not already seen the film several times (it is often shown on cable television), it 
features many speculative elements of this future world. In addition to flying cars and futuristic Pepsi cans, 
some of these elements are of the wearable genre and were recently invented as real products:
• 
 Smart watches : In the film, the teenagers in the future world are all wearing smart 
watches on their wrists that can predict the weather “down to the tick.” Today, 
the Apple Watch and other smart watches offer different applications capable of 
forecasting the weather and loading calendar appointments, along with many 
other features. Additionally, advancements in weather technology have led to 
developments like AccuWeather’s new application called MinuteCast, which can 
give hyper-local, minute-by-minute precipitation forecasts.  
• 
 TV glasses : Members of the future family wear TV glasses at the dinner table. With 
these glasses, they can make and answer calls and watch television. Everyone is 
consumed their own world; Marty Jr. even complains that he can only watch two 
channels at a time with his glasses.  TV glasses , known today as  augmented-reality 
glasses , have also become a reality. With Google’s Google Glass and Sony’s Glastron, 
you can make and receive calls, check e-mail, and enter a fully augmented reality. 
Today’s society is similarly consumed with electronics. Even if people are not 
wearing TV glasses, most cafes are full of people staring at their phones, reading 
articles or watching videos and tuning out their environment. 
• 
 Power laces : Who wouldn’t want a pair of shoes that can tie themselves? In the 
movie, Marty wears a pair of Nike sneakers called Nike Air Mag with  laces   that 
automatically tighten around his ankle. Nike released a pair of Air Mags in 2011 
that look identical to those in the movie but lacked the critical power-lacing feature. 
Four years later, the company successfully created a pair of self-lacing shoes that 
automatically tie themselves. In addition to being extremely iconic, Nike believes 
the shoes will be advantageous to athletes who already wear ankle-support braces, 
because the built-in ankle strap system helps to secure the ankle in place. A pair of 
the shoes was sent to actor Michael J. Fox, who plays Marty in the film. The shoes will 
sold commercially starting in 2016. The  Nike  shoes are shown in Figure  2-2 .

 Star Trek 
 Star Trek , one of the most popular  sci-fi TV and movie series , has acquired an enormous following over the 
years, commonly referred to as  Trekkies . Being called a Trekkie may seem unfashionable, but on the contrary, 
Trekkies have insight into many future trends. Several wearable concepts are familiar from the show, and their 
function and potential impact on society are very noticeable. Following are some notable props from the show:
• 
 Communicators : If you have watched a few episodes of the original series, you 
probably recall a small flip-phone-like device that characters carried with them. 
Called  communicators , these wearable devices were used to place calls to other 
characters. For example, Captain Kirk often used his communicator to call Spock 
and ask him to look up important scientific information. Nowadays, communicators 
have become a widespread device, commonly referred to as a smartphone.

 Geordi’s VISOR : Geordi is a memorable character on  Star Trek: The Next Generation 
who had an iconic eye visor. Geordi was blind, but after a special surgery, he 
was able to see through the electromagnetic spectrum with the aid of his Visual 
Instrument and Sensory Organ Replacement (VISOR). In 2005, a team of scientists 
at Stanford successfully implemented a similar bionic eye. They implanted a small 
chip behind the retina of a blind rat, which resulted and the rats then successfully 
passed a vision test. This technology is similar to the VISOR because the patient first 
receives the implant and then uses a special pair of glasses that have an embedded 
video camera. A small computer processes the light that enters the camera and 
wirelessly broadcasts it as an infrared LED image on the inside of the glasses. These 
images are reflected into the chip implanted behind the retina, where they stimulate 
photodiodes. The photodiodes replicate lost retinal cells and change the light into 
electrical signals, which send nerve pulses to the brain.

 Tricorder :  Tricorders were small portable devices that the crew used to measure 
things like oxygen levels and detect diseases. Mr. Spock often carried his tricorder 
over his shoulder. The tricorder was used to gather an initial analysis of the 
conditions of a new environment and thus warn the crew about anything potentially 
harmful or dangerous. Various versions of the tricorder exist today, from wearable 
air-quality monitoring devices to wearable medical devices that can monitor various 
functions of the wearer’s heart. NASA uses a device called the LOCAD onboard the 
International Space Station, which can measure microorganisms such as E. coli, 
fungi, and salmonella.      
 Superheroes and Super-Wearables 
 The follow-up discussion after a sci-fi superhero book or film often involves a conversation of how amazing 
it would be if their super-wearables actually existed. For example, Harry Potter’s famous invisibility cloak 
makes him invisible to the outside world and is a popular wish-list item for almost anyone familiar with the 
story. This section highlights some superpowers that are now attainable (or nearly so) with the help of 
high-tech wearable devices. 
 Batman’s  Batsuit 
 Batman is one of the most relatable superheroes, because he is just an ordinary guy who protects the 
world from impending dangers. Hypothetically, anyone with a Batsuit could become Batman; the tricky 
part is getting the Batsuit. You might be pleased to know that this is no longer wishful thinking: the Unified 
Weapons Master (UWM) suit, developed by Chiron Global, features capabilities quite similar to those of the 
Batsuit. 
 The suit, intended to be worn by  weapons-based martial arts fighters (such as sword fencers), 
incorporates a patented intelligent armor and scoring system. The UWM software measure the forces and 
location of impacts on the armor from attacks and processes a score based on the damage that would 
have resulted had the fighter not been wearing the suit. The suit’s helmet is embedded with cameras and 
microphones that allow spectators to see and hear the battle from the fighter’s perspective. Additionally, 
the suit is equipped with biometric data-sensing capabilities that measure the fighter’s heart rate and body 
temperature. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ WEARABLE FICTIONS
17
 Iron Man’s  Exoskeleton 
 Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark, is another superhero who gets most of his superpowers from his amazing outer 
armor, which has evolved with each chapter of the story. The suits are made from extremely strong fictional 
materials and reinforced by a force field. They feature embedded weapon systems, flight abilities and 
jetpacks, communication sensors and systems, and more. The most unique aspects of Iron Man’s suits are 
the  repulsors and the  unibeam . The repulsors emit a blast of charged particles referred to as a  force beam ; 
the unibeam can divert power from an attack to Iron Man’s chest. The suits are extremely self-sufficient and 
can be powered by alternative energies such as solar and wind. The construction of the armor is also very 
interesting and adds to its resilience. Stark designs the suits to self-compose using an automated system of 
bacteria that consume specific metals and then die, leaving small granules of metal “cells” behind. These 
cells are the basis of the suit and supply energy and computing power to the armor. They also have the ability 
to fold in on themselves, allowing the suit to contract and expand. 
 The  U.S. army’s Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit   (TALOS) is almost as strong and powerful as Iron Man’s 
suit. The suit is actually composed of a “liquid armor” that can solidify instantly, shielding the soldier from attack. 
The project, which is an initiative of the United States Special Operations Command, began in 2013 and is led by a 
team of researchers from 56 corporations, 16 government agencies, 13 universities, and 10 national laboratories. 
 The team is working to equip the final suit with the following key features:
• 
 Comfortable and flexible, conforming to the body 
• 
 Embedded with sensors that provide cues to the soldier via a next-generation 
antenna that includes dynamic tuning, the Future Interoperable Radio Enclosure 
(FIRE), and a tactical radio sleeve for cell phones 
• 
 Ability to reapply energy to enhance efficiency of motion and reduce impact load by 
weight distribution through the body (a bit like a unibeam) 
• 
 A powered cooling vest to sustain body temperature and a biosensor-equipped 
combat shirt that can monitor a soldier’s physiological status    
 Several other new technologies and features are being developed for the suit. Although it may not be 
nearly as advanced as the latest edition of Iron Man’s suit, it is expected to be similar to the early Iron Man 
Mark I suit. The team aims to have the project completed by 2018. 
 Wonder  Woman’s Bracelets 
 Wonder Woman is armed with a pair of special metal bracelets, also known as the Bracelets of Submission. 
They are indestructible and can absorb the impact of incoming attacks such as bullets, fire, and energy 
blasts. Slamming the bracelets together creates a wave of concussive force, strong enough to make other 
superheroes’ ears bleed (even Superman!). 
 Will.i.am’s Puls  bracelets are not advanced enough to shield off attacks, but they can certainly make 
enough noise to make your ears bleed. These wearable bracelets are embedded with functions like WiFi, 
Bluetooth, a pedometer, GPS, as well as really loud speakers. Experts expect to see a lot of similar bracelets 
might appear in the near future. 
 007’s Bag of Tricks 
 James Bond has been an immensely popular fictional character for more than 50 years. Bond, also known 
by the code name 007, is the beloved superstar intelligence agent of the Secret Intelligence  Service   MI6. 
Originally developed as a books series by Ian Fleming, more than 40 Bond books and 25 movies have been 
made. The Bond stories always feature futuristic vehicles and gadgets that help Bond save the day. He uses 
more than 200 gadgets throughout the series, a nearly complete list of which can be found on the Wikipedia 
page:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_gadgets . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ WEARABLE FICTIONS
18
 Several of these gadgets now actually exist, some as spy accessories and others embedded in popular 
devices. Following is a list of a few of these wearable gadgets that are now available as consumer items:
• 
 The homing beacons featured in  Goldfinger (1964) are extremely useful for  Bond’s 
mission . One beacon enables Bond to track the villain he is after; the other, Bond 
carries in his shoe to help MI6 track him. A new technology called the  Digital Angel 
chip consists of a tiny sensor that measures biometric data like body temperature. 
It wirelessly transmits this information and GPS location to an antenna. The device 
was designed for medical applications and can be implanted just under the skin, to 
help doctors track their patients. It can also be used in gadgets like electronic collars 
for pets, to help monitor their behavior. 
• 
 Bond’s Seiko wristwatch in  For Your Eyes Only (1981) contains a two-way  radio 
transmitter  for voice communication and can receive digital message readouts. 
This is only one feature of the  smart watches that have been coming to the market 
recently.  Smart watches like the  Apple Watch  can receive messages, control nearby 
devices via Bluetooth, track your location, and much more. What seemed extremely 
futuristic and novel to an audience of the 1980s is much less impressive to us today.  
• 
 The  polarizing glasses in  A View to a Kill  (1985) allow Bond to see through tinted 
glass. Several other Bond movies feature X-ray glasses that enable him to see through 
clothes, containers, and more. Evena Medical developed a pair of glasses called 
 Eyes-On that allows doctors to see through a patient’s skin (see Figure  2-3 ). Using a 
multispectral lighting technique, the doctor can see the veins under the skin! Another 
device that features X-ray vision is the Golden-i headset by Kopin. The headset 
uses infrared technology to see through walls and other objects. Carmaker Mini is 
developing a pair of smart goggles for drivers, which project information and images in 
front of the driver. The glasses can communicate with cameras placed around the car, 
enabling the driver to see through and around the car. Although these technologies are 
still primitive and expensive, they show that X-ray spyglasses may not be far off.

• 
 Bond wears a miniature ring  camera in  A View to a Kill (1985). These days, you can 
purchase a camera hidden in a keychain on the Internet for less than $10. More 
expensive spy cameras are embedded in eyeglasses, watches, pendants, and other 
wearables. Concepts for a ring camera have been featured in many design awards, 
but the real gadget remains fictional. 
 Summary 
 The stories and concepts mentioned in this chapter are just a small percentage of the hundreds of 
fictional  props   that have inspired the creation of actual products, many of them wearable. The next time 
you watch a science fiction film or read a book, pay attention to the devices the characters use, especially 
in older stories. You may find that some of the futuristic objects in these stories have already passed and 
are archaic to a modern audience, whereas others are extremely similar to something you can buy at a 
convenience store today. 
 This first part of the book has given some background about how the  concept   of wearables has 
developed through both fact and fiction. The next part looks at different techniques for designing and 
creating wearables, and how they are (and aren’t) adapting and evolving with new technologies.

 CHAPTER 3  
 From Textiles to Wearables 
 In order to understand how  electronic devices can be embedded into clothing, let’s first review current and 
past  textile  and manufacturing techniques. Textiles is a billion-dollar global  industry  , and the top three 
 exporters  of textiles are China, India, and Italy. Most clothing is produced at a mass scale to reduce cost and 
speed up the manufacturing process: it is much easier to set up a machine to make 1,000 shirts at once then 
it is to run a machine 1,000 times to make each shirt. Additionally, most consumers prefer clothing that is 
affordable and of good quality. A subset of people give a higher priority to ethical manufacturing processes 
and unique designs. These products usually come from smaller-scale, boutique manufacturers where the 
facilities are set up to make a few articles of clothing at a time. This greatly affects the price of the product, 
because more labor and time are needed to produce it; thus this subset of consumers are wealthier and the 
product is not accessible to a diverse group. 
 This chapter follows the process of clothing manufacturing from fiber to garment and explains how 
electronics can be inserted into these processes. These techniques are still being explored on a small, 
semi-private scale, but some companies are making great strides to formulate ways to implement them on 
a larger scale. 
 Textile Manufacturing 
 A  textile is a flexible material composed of a network of  natural or artificial fibers . Textiles are also referred 
to as   fabric and  cloth . Although all three of these terms have the same meaning, they can have subtle 
differences depending on the context. For example,  cloth is often used to refer to a textile that has been 
finished, such as a  tablecloth . 
 Raw  Materials 
 Textile manufacturing begins with the  cultivation of fiber . The most common natural fiber is  cotton . In 2007, 
the global cotton yield reached 25 million tons, and cotton was cultivated in more than 50 countries. Other 
common natural fibers include the following:
• 
 Flax  : Cultivated from a flax plant. The best grades are used to make linen.  
• 
 Jute : Cultivated from the Corchorus plant and often used to make rope and rugs. 
• 
 Hemp  : Harvested from the  Cannabis plant and often used to make dresses, sacks, 
and rope. 
• 
 Wool  : Comes from domesticated sheep and often used for warm clothing.  
• 
 Silk : A valuable, strong protein fiber harvested from  silkworms   and often used in 
scarves and high-end apparel. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
24
 Wool and silk are  protein fibers , meaning they are cultivated from an animal. Protein fibers are generally 
more valuable. 
 Synthetic fibers  are made from polymers that are synthesized from raw materials such as petroleum. The 
materials are polymerized into a long chemical bond; different chemical compounds yield different types 
of fibers. The most commonly used synthetic fibers are nylon, polyester, and acrylic. Synthetic fibers offer 
advantages over natural fibers because they are more durable and can readily soak up different dyes. They 
are also preferred because they can also be designed to have properties such as stretch, waterproofing, and 
stain resistance. Some particularly interesting synthetic fabrics are discussed in Chapter   7 . 
 From  Fiber to Fabric 
 The fibers go through a series of steps known as the  preparatory processes to prepare them for the next part 
of the process: spinning. During these processes, the fibers are made into  rovings,  which are bundles of fiber. 
 Spinning  is when the roving is twisted into a yarn or thread and spun onto a bobbin. This can be done with 
natural or artificial fibers, and there are different spinning techniques for each. Finally, the spun threads 
are woven into flat fabric using a loom. Modern engineering advances have increased the efficiency and 
accuracy of looms, although it is still necessary for a skilled weaver to watch over them in case something 
goes wrong—the slightest impurity in the fibers can cause the loom to jam and stop. The number of looms a 
weaver supervises varies from 1 to 100. 
 During the  weaving process , patterns can be woven into the  fabric  , or they can be transferred onto 
it later with dye or printed during the finishing process. For example, Figure  3-1  shows textile artists 
demonstrating  ikat   weaving. Weaving is another multistep process, and I will not go into great detail. The 
basic steps involve washing, bleaching, singeing, smoothing, shrinking, and dyeing or printing. Several other 
steps may be involved, depending on the textile and desired outcome.

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
25
 Other methods for making textiles include  knitting ,  crocheting ,  knotting , and  felting . There are  large-
scale mechanical machines that can perform all of these processes, some of which are becoming digitized. 
These are discussed in Chapter   9 . 
 Finally, the  fabric is ready to be cut, embellished, and sewn, as explained on a do-it-yourself level in 
Chapter   4 . This has been a very abbreviated introduction to the textile manufacturing process—it is actually 
quite complex and takes several months or even years from start to end. 
 Economic and Social Implications 
 Although growing cotton provides jobs to millions of people, it is expensive to sustain. Cotton is classified 
based on how it is grown: organically or genetically modified. Cotton needs to be farmed intensively and 
uses large amount of water, fertilizer, and insecticide. For example, in India, 5% of the land is used to grow 
cotton, and this 5% is responsible for 55% of the pesticides in the country. 
 Harvesting the fibers is not the only costly part of the process. The finishing processes mentioned 
earlier, such as washing, bleaching, and printing, all consume large amounts of water, electricity, and time. 
Additionally, factory conditions in the textiles world often violate labor rights. Workers are sometimes forced 
to work long hours in poor conditions and paid extremely low wages. A simple Internet search for “textile 
factory fraud and disaster” yields many heartbreaking stories and facts. 
 Many top fashion brands take advantage of countries where labor is cheaper and have their 
manufacturing done abroad to drive down the price of production. This in turn creates new problems; the 
brand does not have tight control over the products, and they become easier to copy, leading to many  knock-
offs . Additionally, companies now have to budget for transportation costs (shipping and duty taxes), which 
sometimes can be more than the labor savings. 
 Furthermore, the urgency to take  manufacturing abroad hurts the economy and job market at home. 
Many clothing manufacturers in the United States were forced to shut down in the 1990s when companies 
started to take manufacturing abroad, resulting in more job losses in the textile and apparel industries than 
in every other type of manufacturing. Studies show that between 2000 and 2011, an average of 17 factories 
per day closed up shop. However, some of these companies are realizing their mistakes and working to bring 
production back to the United States. These companies are investing in new technologies to streamline the 
process at home, resulting in less production time and lower labor costs per garment.   
 Fashion Design 
 Another important field in  wearables is  fashion design . Fashion design, also called  apparel design  , is a separate 
field from textiles and is defined as the  application of design to clothing or  accessories. Fashion  designers use 
textiles created by textile designers to create clothing and other wearables. Their  process involves an entirely 
different set of steps, which I briefly describe here. Fashion design is a very detailed process and can be 
explored in more details through books and courses specific to the subject. The following steps serve as a basic 
tutorial of how a fashion designer goes from concept to finished product or collection:
 
 1. 
 Fashion  forecast : The designer must explore upcoming trends for the season to 
predict the future landscape of fashion. 
 
 2. 
 Conceptualization : The designer collects all of these trends and chooses a focus 
or a theme. This could be based on an event or emotion. These ideas are usually 
collected on a board of images called a  mood board . The mood board features 
images that are pertinent to the overall theme of the collection; this can range 
from pictures of an environment the clothing would be made for to emotional 
expressions the clothing might create, such as comfort or power. Nowadays it is 
easy to create a mood board online using a service like Pinterest. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
26
 
 3. 
 Illustration and silhouette : This is when the actual sketching and drawing occur. 
The concept is manifested in a series of drawings of the different elements of the 
collection on a series of  silhouettes . Although most designers do this by hand, 
computer-aided software techniques are becoming more popular. These are 
discussed in Chapter   8 . 
 
 4. 
 Color, fabric, and trim  selection : The designer selects the fabrics and trims that 
will be part of this collection. They choose fabric based on properties like weight, 
strength, and texture. After the types of fabric are decided, the color palette is 
determined. Colors are chosen based on the mood board and other factors such 
as the season and forecasted trends. 
 
 5. 
 Technical design : A  technical sketch is needed to move into production. 
This is like a blueprint for the piece, with instructions on how it is made; 
detailing all measurements, seams, trim placements, and so on. A mock-up 
of the garment is made from muslin, based on this sketch, and fitted onto a 
mannequin. The garment is adjusted and redesigned until it resembles the 
desired look.  
 
 6. 
 Patterns : The final step in the development process is making a  pattern from 
the technical design. Patterns can be made by hand or digitally with pattern-
making software. Several versions of the pattern may be made, for use in house 
and otherwise. Patterns must be adjusted according to factory guidelines when 
sent into production. Which may feature different notations from the designer’s 
version. An example of a pattern is shown in Figure  3-2 . Chapter   4   explains 
how to interpret a pattern. A good pattern is the ultimate key to a well-fitting 
garment.

 7. 
 Style selection and feasibility : Finally, the collection is assessed based on financial 
and production feasibility. These are determined by the goals and budget of 
the brand for this particular collection. The number of pieces in the collection 
can depend on many factors, such as the intended distribution process and 
target audience. There may be a variety of high-end and low-end pieces in the 
collection, or they may all be on one end of the style spectrum. After the costs 
and manufacturing methods are optimized, the first set of samples is made and 
presented to buyers, retailers, and other  influencers   of the brand.      
 Textiles and Education 
 This section explains the various  roles of textiles and sewing in education and highlight new efforts to blend 
electronics with textiles as an educational tool. 
 Sewing as a Class 
 When I was in middle school, the entire grade had to take sewing class. We collectively made a quilt (each 
student made a patch) that was donated to the local children’s hospital. When I reached high school, sewing 
was a popular elective class. Nowadays, when I go into a school or museum to teach a wearables workshop, 
I know not to assume that students have had the same exposure to sewing that I did. In fact, I am surprised 
when more than one student knows how to sew. This goes for 4th graders, high schoolers, and even college 
students who have never threaded a needle. Although you can probably get by without this skill, basic 
stitching does not take that much time to learn and definitely pays off in the long run. 
 
■ Note   Don’t worry if you’re in the camp of those who never learned how to sew. The next two chapters 
walk you through basic sewing techniques and teach you how to sew a simple light circuit!  
 Figure  3-3 shows a high school girl learning how to sew a light circuit in a workshop that I taught while 
researching ways to engage girls with engineering and science. There were 12 girls total in this workshop, 
and only 2 or 3 of them knew how to sew before starting their project. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
29
 The question of why  sewing is no longer being taught in schools or offered as an elective is more 
complicated then it may seem. The digital divide in education has been a key issue in many learning 
standards and systems. Schools and other educational venues all over the world are working hard to ensure 
that their students do not fall behind, because computer literacy is becoming a critical skill of the future 
workforce. Unfortunately, this often means reviewing budgets and making cuts to curricula that do not fit 
with these project future values, in order to make room for new technology, and sewing is often one of the 
first to go. 
 However, research is proving that blending electronics with technology is extremely valuable as an 
educational tool. Some researchers have developed their own toolkits for this purpose (myself included), 
as discussed in Chapter   5 . Sewing as an entry to electronics makes the concepts more accessible and less 
abstract. 
 Higher Education: Tech vs.  Textiles 
 Higher education in the fashion and textile industry faces the opposite problem. Many programs are set 
in their ways, using traditional drafting and cutting methods rather than embracing the new technologies 
and software that are available. Most curricula focus on these foundational methods rather than new 
interdisciplinary techniques. Before students can experience these new methods, teachers need to become 
familiar and comfortable with them. Although some schools are working to solve this problem by bringing in 
technology experts and providing faculty training, many programs are not showing any progress. This is, of 
course, a multifaceted issue that must be considered by the administration and board of the department of 
the institution before more modern techniques are introduced and enforced.

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
30
 Sewing for Engineers 
 Yet another area to be  explored is the value of using textiles in engineering classrooms at the university 
level. As the next section demonstrates, many breakthroughs and innovations in textile manufacturing have 
resulted from the collaboration of  engineers with textile and apparel designers. Additionally, exposure to 
the process of textile design and materials of textiles is valuable for engineers, regardless of whether they 
pursue fashion later in their career. Working with fabric and thread presents new and interesting challenges. 
It is a hands-on experience—not too different than other traditional hands-on projects in the engineering 
classroom—that forces you to think of a simple circuit in an entirely different way, for an entirely different 
application. Chapter   5 explains the nuances and intricacies of designing a circuit that is sewable.   
 Electronics in Clothing 
 At this point, you can probably see why  weaving   electronics   into clothing is not as simple as it may sound. 
Not only do the electronics have to be small, lightweight, and flexible like fiber, but they also need to be 
formed into the fabric at an early stage to be durable. This involves retrofitting several different machines 
and processes. 
 Harry Wainwright, who invented a machine for weaving fiber optic  fibers into  fabric , was mentioned 
in Chapter   1 . Wainwright’s process is a good case study, because it shows how he went from an idea to 
designing his own  processes and tools for mass production. Let’s look at other projects that are taking on 
electronics textile manufacturing at this level. 
 Project Jacquard 
 Google’s Advanced Technologies and Products (ATAP) team is working to integrate electronics into clothing 
in a new way. The goal of the project is to make any piece of fabric into an interface. By weaving with 
conductive yarns and thread, the team, led by Ivan Poupyrev, believes they can integrate touch sensors and 
more right into clothes, car seats, curtains, and everything else. An example of what this interface would 
look like on fabric, and how you would interact with it, is shown in Figure  3-4 . As Poupyrev explained in an 
interview with  Wired , “If you can weave the sensor into the textile, as a material you’re moving away from the 
electronics. You’re making the basic materials of the world around us interactive.”  

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
31
 Like Wainwright, ATAP is not  inventing entirely new materials, but rather is inventing new ways to use 
and combine these materials. The key ingredients of these future fabric interfaces, the conductive threads 
and fabrics, have been around for centuries. However, embedding these materials into textile manufacturing 
at a mass scale is not currently possible, mostly because the tools do not exist to do so. 
 For  Project Jacquard , Google collaborated with textiles manufacturers and fashion designers. For the 
first phase of the project, the team partnered with a boutique textiles manufacturing company in Japan to 
understand the textile process. Eventually, they were able to design a yarn based on a metallic alloy (hence 
conductive) that can be woven into several other fibers using a strong braiding process. The yarn can be 
used to make denim, silk, polyester, and even wool that is conductive and comes in any color. 
 Google does not intend to  start a textiles manufacturing factory, or even a clothing company, for these 
special textiles. The ATAP team’s plan is to develop software that can be used with these new wearables. 
They want to continue to find partners who can share their expertise and help streamline the process. 
Although the team is enthusiastic about embedding this technology into clothes, there are still a lot of 
problems to be solved that fall on the fashion-design side. For one thing, this process will completely change 
a manufacturing company’s supply chain and add a lot of tests and processes to production. The first fashion 
label partner for this project is Levi’s. With these challenges in mind, Levi’s is excited about the potential 
solution, because it could really customers’ relationship with clothing. 
 It is evident that the digital world is becoming a larger part of consumers’ personal world; people are 
constantly connected with their smartphones and fitness trackers. Adding digital functionality into clothing 
could be revolutionary if done correctly. You can read the latest about  Project Jacquard at    www.google.com/
atap/project-jacquard   .

CHAPTER 3 ■ FROM TEXTILES TO WEARABLES
32
 Intel’s Smart Fashion 
 Google is not the only tech  company aware of this trend. Intel has also been making an effort to engage in 
the wearables field. In 2014, it hosted a competition called Make It Wearable, where people were invited to 
submit a wearables concept in the form of a one-minute video. A panel of judges selected a winner, who was 
given seed funding and counsel to bring the idea to life. 
 The  Intel Curie Compute Module has had a large role in this process. Curie is a complete 
microcomputer the size of a button, designed to make the creation of wearable devices faster, simpler, 
and more accessible. Additionally, Intel has been partnering with famous designers and brands to bring 
wearable innovations to market. In a recent collaboration with fashion label Chromat, they created apparel 
that forms to the human body directly. So far, they have debuted two items. The first is a sports bra that 
responds to changes in perspiration, respiration, and body temperature. The bra is able to vent and cool the 
wearer using the Curie module as the central brain of the system. The second item is a 3-D printed carbon-
fiber dress that morphs based on the wearer’s adrenaline levels. 
 Smart clothing will not only be able to extend the capabilities of smart devices and gadgets; it also 
will be able to respond to the human body and create a more comfortable, intimate wearable experience. 
As Chromat’s CEO, Becca McCharen, explains in an interview with FastCoDesign, “I think in the future, 
everyone will have a body scan, buy the files online, and print out their garments and get something fully 
customizable to their form.” 
 Although this project does not introduce a new machine or material into the manufacturing process, it 
is designed with future manufacturing in mind. As it becomes easier to customize clothing, it is important 
to speculate and prototype these customizations. What will consumers value in a custom pair of pants? 
Will it be the fit, the responsiveness to their emotional state, or the touch interface that connects to, or even 
replaces, their phone and other devices? High-tech fashion projects by Chromat and other designers are 
presented in Chapter   13 . 
 Summary 
 This chapter has provided an overview of how most wearables are produced, from raw material to mass 
production. Additionally, you learned about the social and economic impact of the  industry   and the current 
state of textiles in education. The textile industry is an old and essential market with tremendous future 
potential. As advancements in technology lead to new consumer needs, the textile and fashion industries 
need to be prepared. New technologies will present many challenges to factories and companies that have 
invested time and money into streamlining their current processes. On the bright side, marriages between 
major fashion brands and technology companies will help guide this new potential market. Although textile 
 companies may be nervous about venturing forth, many tech companies are extremely eager to see what 
the future of embedding electronics into clothing will bring. In the end, these wearables have to be stylish, 
comfortable, and affordable. To achieve these goals, the technologists will have to find fashion and textiles 
designers who can make this happen. 
 The next chapter discusses the basics of sewing and following a pattern to help guide you through the 
tutorials in this book. If you are already proficient with these skills, you should be able to breeze through 
Chapter   4 .

 CHAPTER 4  
 Cutting and Sewing 
 This chapter serves as a crash course in sewing and working with fabric. If you have never learned how to 
sew or need a refresher, consider this chapter a guidebook for the projects in the remainder of the book. 
You will need to acquire a basic sewing set, which is described in the next section, and some fabric. These 
materials can be found at most craft stores or at a fabric store, if there is one local to your area. You could also 
cut up an old article of clothing as scrap fabric to practice with. 
 By the end of this chapter, you will learn how to sew different stitches, follow a pattern, and sew a button 
onto an article of clothing. These skills will be useful for repairing clothing, replacing a missing button, 
or patching a pair of pants. The chapter covers basic sewing terminology and techniques, which you can 
explore further in media dedicated to sewing and textile techniques. 
 A Sewing Kit 
 The first step is gathering your sewing toolbox. A simple sewing toolkit can be found in any general store, 
craft store, or pharmacy. Depending on the store, the kit will be more or less complete, but it will include 
basic tools. The sewing tools needed for the tutorials in this book are listed in Table  4-1 . Some of them may 
require a more specialized sewing store or can be ordered online.

 Tool 
 Use 
 Tailor’s chalk 
 
 
 This soft, chalk-like material leaves traces on fabric that can 
gently be brushed or washed off. A thin bar of soap works as a 
substitute. 
 Colored thread 
 
 
 A basic sewing kit comes with colored spools of thread. It is 
good to have a rainbow of colors, with more specific colors for 
specific jobs. For example, when mending a light gray pair of 
pants, you will want to find the closest shade of gray thread. 
 Pins and pincushion 
 
 
 Pins come in many different shapes and sizes. They are used 
to hold fabric in a desired shape before sewing. It is also useful 
to have a pincushion to collect you pins and needles. You can 
easily make a pincushion by folding a piece of fabric into a 
ball shape or sewing a small pillow (as described later in this 
chapter). 
 Sewing needles 
 
 
 Sewing needles are the integral part of the sewing kit; they 
are necessary for learning how to sew. Sewing needles come 
in many different size and shapes particular to the fabric they 
need to go through. For example, embroidery needles are 
thicker and blunt, because they are used with thick thread 
to go through porous canvas. Try to find a variety pack, with 
several different kinds of needles.

 A typical  hobby sewing set may also include a few buttons, safety pins, and snaps. A more advanced set 
may include a seam ripper, which as its name suggests is used to rip apart seams of a piece of clothing. 
 Tool 
 Use 
 Shears 
 
 
 Sewing shears are different than regular scissors and an 
important part of your toolbox. They are designed to make 
long, smooth cuts in different fabrics and stay sharp for a long 
time. If they become dull, they should be sharpened with 
special sharpening instruments. 
 Thimble 
 
 
 This is a useful tool when you’re learning how to sew, because 
it can protect your fingers and help you push a needle through 
thick fabrics. It is worn on your thumb or index finger. 
 Tape measure 
 
 
 This flexible ruler is great for measuring along curved edges 
and perimeters. Tape measures are most commonly used for 
taking measurements during fittings: the distance around a 
person’s waist or chest, down a leg, and so on. 
 Needle threader 
 
 
 This tool is used to help thread a needle and is handy piece 
of a beginner toolset, especially when you are experimenting 
with different needles and threads. 
Table 4-1. (continued)

 Additional Materials 
 In addition to the tools described, there are some materials that are always good to have in your sewing kit. 
For  starters ,  scrap fabric is a must. Velcro may be useful when making something where you don’t want to 
use buttons. Similarly, a zipper is a good alternative and may be more appropriate for some projects, such 
as sewing a coin purse. As you explore different  projects and techniques  , you may also find that you need 
some ribbon to add to a trim, or some elastic to make a flexible waistband for a skirt or a pair of shorts. Every 
tailor’s sewing kit is full of unique remnants from past projects that only get more interesting with time. 
 Another material that is good to have in stock, especially for electronics sewing projects, is 
 interfacing .  Interfacing  is a material used to add stiffness to a fabric. As you learn in Chapter   7 , some 
conductive fabrics are not very thick, and attaching interfacing makes them easier to work with. There 
are two different type of interfacing:  nonwoven interfacing  does not have a grain and works in most 
cases, whereas  woven  interfacing does have a grain and is preferable when using stretch fabrics.  Fusible 
interfacing has one side that is fusible and another side that is smooth and not fusible. The fusible side 
contains a heat-activated adhesive that can be glued to the fabric using an iron; the other side can be 
sewn on.  
 Stitches and Seams 
 In this section, you learn how to make two basic  hand stitches  — running stitch   and  whipstitch  —and 
how to sew on a button. These three things will take you a long way. Although they may seem simple and 
straightforward, they will be awkward at first; you should practice each of them until the motions feel 
natural. Using a thimble is optional for these tutorials, but it is common practice to wear a thimble on your 
finger to help push the needle through fabric. 
 For each of these  techniques , the first step is threading a needle and knotting the thread.  Threading 
a needle can be very frustrating, especially when you’re just learning, but tools like a needle threader make 
it easier. One factor is the size of the  eye of the needle. The eye is the hole on one end of the needle that the 
thread passes through. The larger the eye, the easier it is to thread the needle. Another factor is the thickness 
of the thread. The thicker the thread, the more likely that it will fray and be difficult to pass through the eye. 
In order to prevent the thread from fraying, I recommend that you cut the tip of the thread at an angle with 
your shears, to create a point. Another common practice is to wet the end so that the thread stays together. 
It is best to start with a shorter, more manageable amount of thread; 20–24" is a good length to work with. 
If the thread is very long, it is more likely to get tangled and caught while sewing. 
 First prepare your thread as just described. If you don’t want to use a needle threader, then all you have 
to do is hold up your needle so you can see the eye, and pass the end of the thread through the eye. 
 If you’d like to use the threader, follow the steps diagrammed in Figure  4-1 :
 
 1. 
 Take the needle in one hand and the needle threader in the other. Insert the wire 
loop of the needle threader through the eye of the needle. The loop is made of 
very thin wire that should be able to pass through the eye, even if it is small.  
 
 2. 
 Hold the needle and the threader in one hand, making sure the loop is still 
sticking through the eye of the needle, and take the end of the thread in your 
other hand. Stick the thread through the loop of the needle threader, and fold it 
over to meet the remaining thread, as shown in part 3 of the diagram. 
 
 3. 
  Keep your hand on the thread, and pull the loop of the threader completely 
through the eye of the needle. Now, release the thread, and pull the loose end all 
the way through so that there is only one strand passing through the eye.   

CHAPTER 4 ■ CUTTING AND SEWING
37
 
 4. 
 You must tie a knot at the other end of the thread to hold it in place. You can tie 
the knot on one end of the thread, or double the thread so that both ends meet, 
and tie a knot as shown in Figure  4-2 . 
 Figure 4-1.  Threading a needle, steps 1–4 
 Figure 4-2.  Tying a knot at the end of the thread 
 Running Stitch 
 This is the most basic stitch and results in an even, straight seam. Start with a threaded needle and a piece of 
fabric. The steps are diagramed in Figure  4-3 :
 
 1. 
 Start with the needle underneath  the  fabric. Poke the needle through the fabric, 
and pull it all the way through so that the knot is taut on one end, as shown in 
part 1 of the diagram. 
 
 2. 
 Flip the needle, and poke it through the top of the fabric about a quarter of an 
inch to the right of the first hole. Pull the needle through the back of the fabric 
until it is taut. You’ve made your first stitch! 
 
 3. 
 Flip the needle again, poke up through the back of the fabric about a quarter 
of an inch to the right of where you made the last hole, and pull the needle up 
through the top. 
 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ CUTTING AND SEWING
38
 
 4. 
 Continue going through the fabric, alternating sides, in a straight line until you 
either (almost) run out of thread or reach the end of the material. The stitch 
should look like part 5 of the diagram. 
 
 5. 
 To make a knot, draw the needle through the last stitch, making a loop, stick the 
needle through this loop, and then pull taut, as shown in part 6. Repeat a few 
times until the knot feels sturdy, and then cut the thread.       
 Whipstitch 
 Whipstitch  is useful for sewing around the edge of a piece of fabric. For this tutorial, let’s sew a patch onto 
another piece of fabric. The steps are diagramed in Figure  4-4 :
 
 1. 
  Poke your threaded needle through the base layer fabric and then through the 
edge of the patch, or top layer, about a quarter of an inch from the edge of the 
patch. Pull the needle all the way through so that the knot is taut on the back of 
the bottom layer. 
 
 2. 
 Flip the needle, and stick it over the edge of the fabric so that it only goes though 
the bottom layer, as shown in part 2, and pull all the way through. This should 
result in a stitch that is perpendicular to the edge of the patch. 
 
 3. 
  Poke the needle up through the base fabric and patch, close to where the 
first stitch started, to create another perpendicular stitch next to the first one. 
Continue this all around the edges of the patch until it is secured to the base layer 
of fabric. 
 Figure 4-3.  Sewing a  running stitch 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ CUTTING AND SEWING
39
 
 4. 
 Once the patch is secure, knot and cut the thread as described in step 5 of the 
running stitch tutorial. 
 Sewing a Button 
 This technique is used when you need to sew a  button or snap   onto a piece of fabric. Start with the threaded 
needle, a button, and a piece of fabric. The steps are diagramed in Figure  4-5 :
 
 1. 
  Decide where the  button will be placed on the fabric, and mark it with your 
tailor’s chalk. Note the holes in the center of the button; there should be at least 
two holes, but there may be four. 
 
 2. 
  Stick the needle through the middle of where the button will go on the fabric. 
Before pulling the needle through, place the button over the fabric, and pull the 
needle though one hole of the button as shown in part 1. Pull the needle through 
the fabric and the button, holding the button in place. 
 
 3. 
  Flip the needle back toward the fabric, stick the needle through another hole on 
the button and the fabric, and pull it taut on the back of the fabric, as shown in 
part 2. If your button has four holes, try to go for the hole that is diagonal to the 
one you first anchored. 
 
 4. 
  Go through each of the holes, in and out through both sides of the fabric, two or 
three times, until the button feels secure on the fabric; it should look like part 4.  
 
 5. 
  When you finish sewing the button onto the fabric, pull the thread to the back 
side of the fabric and tie a knot as described earlier.

 Cutting fabric 
 In order to cut fabric with a  smooth edge , there are some basic  guidelines to follow:
• 
 The fabric must be flat, clean, and wrinkle free, so wash and iron it if necessary.  
• 
 Place the fabric on a flat surface, and smooth it out; a large table works well. 
• 
 Draw the shape you’d like to cut with the tailor’s chalk. If necessary, use a flat edge or 
ruler while drawing. 
• 
 Begin to cut through the fabric with your sewing shears. Open the scissors 
completely, and make long, fluid strokes through the fabric. Hold the scissors very 
steadily; a slight shake could result in an uneven cut. You can also use a rotary fabric 
cutter if you have one. 
• 
 If cutting a straight line, you may want to lay a ruler or other straight edge on the 
fabric to help guide you. One method is to line up the fabric with the edge of a 
surface and cut parallel to the surface. 
• 
 Do not use these scissors to cut anything other than fabric. They are designed to cut 
through fabric and risk falling out of alignment or becoming dull if  misused . 
 Making a Pillow 
 To practice these stitches, making a simple  pillow is a great first project. You need the following tools and 
materials:
• 
 Some scrap fabric (or other fabric if you would like) 
• 
 Needle 
 Figure 4-5.  Sewing a  button 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ CUTTING AND SEWING
41
• 
 Pins 
• 
 Thread 
• 
 Scissors 
• 
 Cotton or foam to stuff the pillow 
 Follow these steps to make your pillow, as diagrammed in Figure  4-6 :
 
 1. 
 Cut two square pieces of fabric equal in size out of your fabric, and thread your 
needle with the desired color of thread. 
 
 2. 
 Pin all four edges of the pillow together, as shown in part 1. 
 
 3. 
 Sew together three edges of the pillow using a running stitch, about half an inch 
from the edge of the fabric. Try to make your seams even. 
 
 4. 
 Take the pins out of the fourth side of the pillow, reach in, and turn the pillow 
inside out to hide the seams of the three edges. 
 
 5. 
 Stuff the pillow with the desired amount of stuffing material, and close the fourth 
edge with some pins. 
 
 6. 
 For the last edge of the pillow, use a whipstitch to attach the two pieces of fabric 
together. 
 
 7. 
 Congratulations! You have put together your first pillow!

CHAPTER 4 ■ CUTTING AND SEWING
42
 Following a Pattern 
 After  learning how to sew, cut fabric, and make a pillow, a good next project would be to make a garment 
from a pattern. For your first garment project, choose a simple pattern. When you find a pattern that you 
like, check whether there is a labeled size; if so, make sure it is your size. Some patterns have multiple sizes 
printed on the pattern, which can be confusing to follow. If this is the case, it may be useful to outline the 
size you are following with a dark- or bright-colored marker. Before making the garment out of your desired 
fabric, it’s a good idea to make a sample, also called a  muslin . 
 
■ Note  The term  muslin also refers to untreated cotton fabric, but for this chapter it refers to a different 
definition given below. 
 A  muslin is a mock-up version of a pattern made from a plain fabric.  Muslins   are useful for making a 
first draft of the garment that can be revised and changed, before making the final version out of the desired 
fabric. Follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Read the instructions printed on the pattern or on the accompanying guide. The 
guide includes tips on how to cut out the pattern tissue, how to construct the 
garment or item, the best way to select sizing, and so on.  
 
 2. 
 Check to see if the pattern allows for seams. If it does not, you will need to add 
them in when cutting out the pattern later. 
 
 3. 
 Find the  grain lines . These are the long, straight lines on the pattern with 
arrowheads at one or both ends. This arrow tells you which direction the paper 
pattern pieces should sit with respect to the grain of the fabric. To find the grain 
lines of the fabric, find the  selvage edge : this is the edge where the pattern ends 
and is sometimes white. The grain lines are the same direction. 
 
 4. 
 Take note of the following markings on the pattern: notches, shortening lines, 
button holes, darts, and dots. 
 
 5. 
 You are ready to cut out the pattern. The cut lines are the solid lines surrounding 
the dashed lines. If there are no dashed lines, this means the sewing line is not 
marked on the pattern; in this case, it is safe to assume that the sewing line is 
about half an inch inside the cut line. When cutting out the pattern, use normal 
paper scissors. Cut along the cutline very carefully; if you make a mistake, just try 
to match the cut back to the line. 
 
 6. 
 Trace the pattern on the scrap fabric you are using to make a muslin, and cut it 
out of this fabric. It may help to pin the pattern to the muslin while cutting it out 
to hold it in place. When pinning fabric that you are going to sew, it is easiest to 
place the pins perpendicular to the direction the seams will go, so that you can 
easily sew through them. 
 
 7. 
 Assemble the pattern from the fabric pieces according to the guide. Use pins to 
hold the pieces together by pinning the pattern together along the edges.  
 
 8. 
 If you have experience with a sewing machine, you may want to use one instead 
of hand sewing. Otherwise it is better to hand-stitch the pieces together so that 
it can easily be mended. Try on the  muslin and note the areas where the form is 
ill-fitting. Be sure to cut out the pattern from the final fabric with these changes 
in mind. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ CUTTING AND SEWING
43
 Using a  Sewing Machine 
 Sewing machines are preferable for making sturdier, even stitches, and they get the job done much more 
quickly than sewing by hand. They can produce several different types of stitches from straight, to zigzag, to 
a more intricate, curvy seam. Sewing machines use a slightly different mechanism than hand sewing: for one 
thing, the eye of the needle is on the other end, near the sharp point. This needle does not go up through the 
fabric one way and down another—instead, it just pokes through the surface of the fabric at set increments. 
Also, there is a second spool of thread beneath the needle plate, called the  bobbin . What happens when the 
needle goes under the needle plate? Refer to Figure  4-7  to see how the machine locks in each stich.  
 The needle is affixed to the needle bar and is driven up and down by a motor and  gearbox . When the 
tip of the needle passes through the fabric, it pulls a small loop of thread through with it. A  hook mechanism 
under the needle plate pulls this loop and wraps it around another piece of thread, which is reeled from 
the bobbin. The two threads interlock around the fabric, forming a stitch, and the needle is pushed up and 
slightly forward before it goes through the fabric again. 
 A basic sewing  machine is fairly inexpensive and can even be found at a thrift store or a secondhand 
marketplace like Craigslist. When learning how to use a sewing machine, an electric pedal–powered 
machine is easiest. You will have to learn how to thread the machine and get a feel for the pedal power. This 
is perhaps the most important part, because steady control of the pedal determines the evenness of the 
stitch. The other important factor in evenness is the ability to hold the fabric in place and feed it through the 
machine. It is important to tinker a bit with the sewing machine until you really get a feel for these things 
before attempting a more advanced project.

gesamten Technik (dictionary of technology) by Otto Lueger

 Summary 
 After completing the tutorials in this chapter, you should have confidence in your basic sewing  skills  . If you 
are looking to take them even further, there are some resources listed in the appendix. Additionally, you have 
now gained perspective about what goes into assembling a wearable. Of course, when produced at a mass 
scale, automated machines do several of the steps covered here, but a considerable amount of work still 
needs to be performed by skilled workers. The next chapter provides you with a basic overview of electronics 
and teaches you how to combine your sewing skills with circuits to create embedded wearables.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Making Electronics Sewable 
 Making electronics sewable may seem like a trivial task to the skilled crafter who is experienced in 
repurposing materials. Even so, learning some basic tips and tricks will help unleash your creativity. This 
chapter guides you through some conceptual and technical considerations when sewing with electronics. 
 Like most interdisciplinary fields,  e-textiles is exciting because there are so many possibilities to be 
explored. There are  techniques in textiles that can be tested with electronics, and methods in designing 
electronics that can be tested and adapted for wearables—not to mention the wealth of new (or, rather, 
unconventional) materials that can be introduced to both fields. Of course, not all translate perfectly from 
one field to the other, and some do not work at all. But new techniques have been invented along the way, 
and custom parts have been designed for new applications. 
 This chapter begins with an overview of circuit design. I give you a basic overview of a circuit with some 
considerations to keep in mind when designing a wearable circuit, especially when it comes to choosing the 
right power source. This is followed by a tutorial for making an LED wristband using off-the-shelf electronic 
components. The last section highlights some of the new techniques and custom parts that have come out of 
the e-textiles field in the last decade. I review five different kits that attempt to make sewing with electronics 
accessible and interesting to a wider audience. 
 Circuits and Power 
 This section provides an overview of basic electronics— or rather, all you need to know to get started with 
 soft circuits. Because  wearables ideally need to be lightweight, finding the right power source can be the 
most difficult part of designing a wearable circuit. If you are already comfortable with electronics, then most 
of this will seem redundant, but it may be wise to skim over it nonetheless. 
 What Is a Circuit? 
 A very simple  definition of a  circuit is a conductive path that allows electricity to travel across it. A basic 
circuit is composed of a power  source , a conducting path, a switch, and a load. Your next question may 
be, what is a conductive path? A  conductor is anything that allows electricity to flow through it. Different 
materials have different levels of conductivity, which is based on their chemical composition. Table  5-1 gives 
some everyday examples of conductive materials as well as nonconductive (or  insulating ) materials. As an 
exercise try to think of a few other materials that could be added to this list.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
46
 Back to the other parts of the circuit: the power, switch, and load. The  power is the power source of the 
circuit, most commonly a battery, although it could also be a solar panel or other “alternative” power source. 
The  switch , as you learn more about in Chapter   6 , is a device that enables you to turn a circuit on and off. 
And the  load  is the part of the circuit that consumes the power; it is what you are turning on or off. 
 There are a few more terms I would like to introduce that are not tangible parts of a circuit but are 
equally, if not more, important to understand conceptually. The  voltage is the difference in charge between 
two points on a circuit and is measured in volts. Different components require different amount of voltage 
to turn on. The  current  is the rate at which electrons flow through the material; it is measured in amps. 
Different components draw different amount of current to stay powered. Last, the   resistance is a physical 
property of the material that resists the electric current and is measured in ohms. The lower the resistance, 
the easier it is to force electrons to leave atoms and move through the material, and the more conductive 
the material is. Although materials have an inherent resistance, sometimes additional resistance is needed 
to make sure the power is supplied at a manageable rate. For example, an LED light may only be rated to 
receive 20 milliamps of current, and let’s say you have a wall power adaptor that supplies a constant 1 amp 
of current to the circuit. In order to restrict the current flowing through the LED, you can add a resistor and 
ensure that the LED does not burn out from a high current. The next section explains how these three values 
are directly related through Ohm’s Law. 
 Figure  5-1  illustrates a basic circuit with these terms defined in the appropriate location on the diagram. 
As you can see, the circuit is set up as a loop, with the arrows illustrating that the  current   is flowing from 
positive to negative. This is a basic rule of circuits: electrons flow (that is, the current flows) from positive to 
negative. The order of components depends on what you are making: for example, if you want to limit the 
current to the LED with a resistor, you need to place the resistor before the LED, not after it.

 A  short circuit is basically equivalent to connecting from the positive end of the power source to the 
negative without putting anything in between. This will drain or  burn out your battery very quickly. You 
should always make sure there are no short circuits in your design. 
 Components have two or mores leads through which they connect to the circuit. On a common 
through-hole LED, the two long legs are the leads. Some components have a certain  polarity , meaning one 
lead is positive and one lead is negative. In this case, the component must be oriented in the circuit such 
that the positive aligns with positive and negative with negative. Otherwise, electricity will not flow through 
them, and this will cause a break in the circuit, like an open switch. Components like switches and resistors 
are  symmetric , meaning they do not have a preferred direction and can be inserted into the circuit in either 
configuration. Pay attention to the polarity when building a circuit. 
 Figure 5-1.  A diagram of a  basic light circuit 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
48
 To demonstrate this, let’s test the polarity of an  LED . You need a through-hole LED (with two legs) and 
a coin-cell battery (CR2032 is preferred). Take your LED and sandwich the legs around the coin cell such 
that the thin edge of the coin cell is in the middle and the legs are touching the flat circular sides, as shown 
in Figure  5-2 . There is a 50-50 chance that your LED will turn on. If it doesn’t turn on the first time, keep 
the battery in place and flip the LED so the opposite legs are touching the sides. Why does it work in one 
direction and not in the other? Because the LED has a certain polarity: one leg must connect to positive and 
one leg must connect to negative. The battery also has a polarity: the positive side is usually labeled with an 
etched + mark, and the negative side is usually textured and not as smooth.  
 Figure 5-2.  Testing an  LED 
 If you hold up the LED, you will notice that one leg is slightly longer than the other. The longer leg 
is positive and is called the  anode , and the shorter leg is negative and is called the  cathode . It may take a 
while to remember this, but for someone who spends a lot of time tinkering with electronics, this becomes 
second nature. 
 Here is a recap of key properties of circuits that you should always keep in mind when  designing and 
troubleshooting :
• 
 A circuit is always a loop. 
• 
 Electricity flows from positive to negative around the loop. 
• 
 Everything in the circuit must be oriented in the same direction. 
• 
 Any time a component is put into the circuit backward, it causes a break in the circuit 
and may result in a short circuit or a circuit that cannot “turn on”. 
• 
 If the negative and positive sides of any component or connection cross, this creates 
a short  circuit . 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
49
 Power Sources 
 When  choosing a power source, a few factors help determine what will be appropriate. First, you must 
find a power source that will provide enough power to all the components in your circuit. To find out how 
much power each component requires, you may need to refer to the  datasheet . The  datasheet is a product-
specification sheet that the manufacturer of the electronic component provides. It lists the minimum amount 
of volts and amps the component must use and draw, as well as other useful information like the maximum 
temperature it can withstand without literally burning out. For example, most LEDs draw around 3 volts, so a 
power source that provides anything less than 3 volts will not provide enough voltage to turn on the  LED . 
 When researching  batteries , along with the voltage, another value is listed: the  capacity  of the battery, 
which is measured in Ah (amp-hours). The capacity of the battery measures the rate at which the battery 
will discharge at the rated voltage. For example, a battery with capacity of 100 Ah can provide 5 amps over 
a 20-hour period. If you are powering a circuit that requires 10 amps, the battery will last only 10 hours. A 
common coin-cell battery usually has a capacity of only 50 mAh (that’s milliamp-hours). This is why a coin 
cell is insufficient to power anything that requires more than 50 mA. 
 For most wearable and e-textile projects, the power source of choice is a battery unless the concept of 
the project is centered on alternative power. Another common power source for electronics that I haven’t 
mentioned is a wall power adaptor. This is not ideal for wearable applications for the obvious reason that it 
requires being tethered to an outlet, thus restricting the movement of the wearable. 
 Batteries are divided into two classes: primary and secondary. A  primary  battery is not rechargeable, 
whereas a  secondary battery  is rechargeable. Table  5-2 provides information about common primary and 
secondary batteries as well as pros and cons to consider for wearable applications.

 Series vs. Parallel 
 There are two different ways to connect elements of a circuit together: connecting in  series and in  parallel . 
The components in a circuit are connected in series if the same current is travelling through them. They are 
connected in parallel if they have unique current values flowing through them. Figure  5-3  shows a circuit 
with the components connected in  series vs. parallel . 
 Figure 5-3.  A circuit with lights connected in series (left) and parallel right) 
 To connect a circuit in series, you need to connect all the components together in one path, making one 
long, single loop from positive to negative. To connect a circuit in parallel, you need to create several parallel 
paths that each loop from positive to negative. 
 Now that I’ve explained the difference, I should explain when each is useful. In other words, when 
should you use a parallel circuit and when should you use circuit in series? This can be explained using the 
most important law of circuits: Ohm’s Law. Ohm’s Law states that the voltage in a circuit is the product of the 
current and the resistance: V= I × R. Most of the time, two of these values are known, and the other can be 
calculated using this equation. Let’s consider an example scenario for each circuit to see when it would be 
more useful than the other. 
 For the first example, suppose you want to connect a string of five LED lights together. If you connect 
them in series, each one will depend on the LED before it. In other words, if one LED were to burn out, all 
the LEDs that come after it would not get power because there would be a break in the circuit! If you connect 
them in parallel, each LED will independently draw power from the battery. Thus, parallel is a better 
configuration for this circuit. 
 For the second example, you want to connect two  batteries in an attempt to double the voltage of the 
circuit. If you connect them in series, the voltage will double as needed, and the capacity will stay the same. 
If you connect them in parallel, the voltage will stay the same, but the capacity will double. 
 How to Sew a Light Circuit 
 The following tutorial for how to sew a light  circuit uses basic  materials that can be sourced from most 
electronics stores. I assume you have basic sewing skills like threading a needle and sewing a running stitch 
and therefore do not go into detail about sewing techniques. If you are not comfortable with this, you can 
review the tutorial in the previous chapter. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
51
 You are going to sew a  light-up wristband . For this project, you need the following items:
• 
 Needle 
• 
 Scissors 
• 
 Pliers 
• 
 Conductive thread 
• 
 LED 
• 
 Metal snap 
• 
 Felt or other scrap fabric 
• 
 Sewable battery holder for CR2032 battery  
• 
 CR2032 coin-cell battery 
 The metal snap will act as a switch, such that when the snap is closed, the light will turn on; and when it 
is open, the light will turn off. You can also use different metal enclosures to make this simple switch; several 
of them are mentioned in Table   6-1 in chapter   6 . 
 Follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Thread your needle with  conductive thread  . Depending on how big you want 
to make your circuit (I recommend a medium size to start), 18 inches 
should be plenty. 
 
 2. 
 Find or cut out a rectangular piece of felt or other fabric about 2 inches wide and 
long enough so that it can comfortably wrap around your wrist. 
 
 3. 
 This next part is an essential skill when sewing with electronics. Pull your LED’s 
legs apart slightly. Try to make note of which leg is positive and which leg is 
negative. Now, take your pliers and, starting with one leg, gently curl the leg up 
toward the bulb in a loop shape, as shown in Figure  5-4 . Do not pull too hard, or as 
the leg may break off. Make sure the loop is not too small (you need to sew through 
it later!), and make sure it is nice and tight (you may need to pinch is together or 
make two loops, depending on how long the leg is). Do the same with the other 
side. Make sure the loops are not touching each other when you are done.  
 Figure 5-4.  Curling the legs of the  LED 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
52
 
■ Tip  It may be easier to start from the bottom of the leg (furthest from the bulb) and wrap it around one side 
of the pliers while curling it up toward the bulb. 
 
 4. 
 Place the pieces on the felt to get an idea of how the circuit will look, as shown 
in Figure  5-5 . Make sure you know which leg loop from the LED is positive and 
which is negative. If you can’t remember, you can sandwich the LED around the 
battery and test again, as described in the previous section.   
 Figure 5-5.  Layout of components on  wristband for light circuit 
 Figure 5-6.  Sewing from positive to positive : steps 5–7 
 
 5. 
 You are ready to sew the circuit as shown in Figure  5-6 . First connect the 
positives. When sewing through looped legs, make sure to go over the loop a 
couple of times with the thread, poking your needle through the middle of the 
loop on one side and down right next to the edge of the loop on the other side as 
illustrated in Figure  5-6 . Make sure these stitches are tight; otherwise, the loops 
may not conduct the current from the battery. 
 
 6. 
 Once the  positive loop is secured, sew a running stitch from the loop to the 
positive hole of the battery holder with the same thread. The stitches do not have 
to be too close together, but I recommend making them fairly tight and even.  
 
 7. 
 When you reach the positive hole on the battery board, poke your needle into the 
hole and then up right near the edge (as you did with the LED loop) a couple of 
times so that it is secure. Then, bring your thread to the back side of the band, 
and tie a knot, and cut it. It should look roughly like the illustration in Figure  5-6 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
53
 
 8. 
 When you have reknotted your thread, you can connect the negative side of the 
circuit. You do not connect negative battery to negative LED directly; you use a 
snap in between to act as a switch for the light and a clasp for your bracelet. Start 
from the negative hole on the battery board, and sew to the closer edge of the 
bracelet. Now, sew the female snap onto the edge. Make sure the snap is facing 
the right way, so that it will fit with the other side when closed. To secure the 
snap, sew around the holes on the outer edge, like you would sew a button. Tie a 
knot, and cut your thread. 
 
 9. 
 Last step! Starting with the loop of the LED light that is not secured (this should 
be the  negative loop ), sew around the loop a few times to secure it to the fabric 
as you did with the other side. Then, sew a running stitch away from the battery 
holder, toward the other end of the bracelet. When you reach the end, place the 
male snap on the back side of the fabric so that when you close the bracelet, the 
ends overlap and close the circuit. Sew the snap securely onto the fabric, and tie 
a knot when you are finished. You can now cut off the remaining thread. 
 
 10. 
 To test your wristband, insert the battery (make sure it is in the correct 
orientation) and close the snap, as shown in Figure  5-7 . The light should turn on! 
There you have it: a simple  lightband that uses a common through-hole LED, a 
metal snap, and a battery board. If the LED doesn’t stay on or doesn’t turn on at 
all, refer to the troubleshooting tips that follow.      
 Figure 5-7.  The completed  lightband 
 
■ Troubleshooting   If the light does not turn on, first check the back side of your lightband to make sure 
no threads are crossing or touching in such a way that they could create a short circuit. Then make sure all 
the connection points with the electronics are secure. You may need to gently tug on the thread to see if it is 
making good contact. If the light turns on when you tug on the thread, you need to tighten these connections. If 
the light still doesn’t turn on, make sure your LED is oriented correctly, and try a new battery. You may want to 
use a multimeter. If you need to take the lightband apart or remake it, don’t worry—sewing with electronics can 
be very tricky, especially on the first try! 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
54
 To add another LED to your lightband, you want to attach it in parallel. You can design your circuit to 
look like the example circuit in the previous section. 
 Custom-Made Kits  
 Using raw components is great for prototyping purposes, but (as you may have noticed if you completed the 
previous tutorial) raw components are not always very durable or aesthetically pleasing when it comes to 
wearable applications. For this reason, several designers and engineers have developed custom electronic 
boards that are meant to be embedded in fabric and thread rather than solder and wires. I mentioned a 
few of these kits in previous chapters, but here is a closer look at five different e-textiles kits. If you search 
the Internet, you can find others available, but these five have interesting back stories. The first three kits are 
shown in Figure  5-8 . 
 Figure 5-8.  Aniomagic Sparkle board (left), LilyPad Arduino (middle), Flora board (right) 
 LilyPad 
 The  LilyPad Arduino is the first sewable microcontroller (   www.lilypadarduino.org  ). It was developed by 
Dr. Leah Buechley as part of her doctoral thesis at the University of Boulder. Around 2005, Dr. Buechley began 
experimenting with e-textiles and developed an e-textiles kit with her collaborator, Nwanua Elumeze, whom 
you read about later in this section. Dr. Buechley and Elumeze were testing the kits with students, and Dr. 
Buechley began to feel as though the kits were too limited: she wanted to give students a way to program the 
circuits they were building. She set out to create a fabric microcontroller using laser cut pieces of fabric and 
large through-hole electronics. Though the boards proved to be interesting and engaging to the students, they 
were hardly durable and not very user friendly. Dr. Buechley began to make improvements to the board, she 
experimented with ways to use smaller surface mount components on the board and realized the shape of the 
board was limiting her design. She tried a circular flower instead, which proved to be easier to work with and 
became the final shape of the board. An early prototype of the LilyPad is shown in Figure  5-9 .  
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
55
 Dr. Buechley continued to teach  workshops using her homemade boards and found that her project 
was extremely successful in attracting girls to engineering. Around the same time, the now-popular Arduino 
board was just getting started, and a new company in Boulder called SparkFun Electronics was beginning 
to make and sell Arduino kits. Dr. Buechley was a frequent customer of SparkFun, and during one of her 
visits she began brainstorming with the founder about making her fabric microcontroller into a commercial 
product. By October 2007, the LilyPad Arduino was released. The LilyPad has sold more than 10,000 boards 
since then and continues to be a pioneer platform of DIY wearable computing. 
 Dr. Buechley continued developing content and new parts for the LilyPad with her research group at 
the MIT Media Lab called High-Low Tech. The LilyPad has several complementary input and output boards 
including LEDs, vibration motors, temperature sensors, and more. The group also developed a smaller 
version of the board called the LilyTiny, which is based on the atTiny microcontroller and suitable for 
smaller-scale projects. Dr. Buechley left the Media Lab in 2014 to pursue her personal design practice, but 
she continues to make many contributions to this field. She has coauthored two books based on the LilyPad 
and continues to lead workshops and inspire many with her work. 
 Flora 
 The  Arduino Flora is another sewable microcontroller, designed by the founder and CEO of Adafruit 
Industries (a popular online hobby electronics site), Limor “Lady Ada” Fried. The Flora board is similar to 
the Arduino LilyPad in that it is also round and compatible with the Arduino IDE. It features 14 sewable 
pads and was designed to be as fabric-friendly as possible; it is the center image in Figure  5-8 . The main 
difference between the two platforms is that the Flora is built around a different microprocessor chip and 
thus has built-in USB support, whereas the LilyPad does not. The native USB driver on the Flora offers a 
unique feature: when the board is plugged in to a computer, it can emulate a keyboard, allowing you to make 
a custom keyboard for your computer using soft circuits.

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
56
 The pin layout of the Flora is a bit different from the LilyPad’s and is designed to easily integrate with 
the Flora’s custom accessory boards, which feature sensors and outputs that are different than those of the 
LilyPad line. The Flora’s boards include an accelerometer, a GPS location sensor, a lux (intensity of light) 
sensor, and a color sensor board. Adafruit also produces its own brand of LED lightboards for the Flora, 
called NeoPixels. NeoPixels offer many advantages over other sewable LED boards, primarily that they are 
individually addressable and low power. This means that using only one pin from a microcontroller, you can 
chain together as many NeoPixels as you like and address each one to output a different light pattern. 
 Like the LilyTiny, the Flora  comes in a smaller size: the mini Flora is called the Gemma board. You can 
find more information about the Flora and its family at    www.adafruit.com/category/65  . The wearables 
team at adafruit posts a new tutorial each week on the online Adafruit Learning System; you can find them at 
  https://learn.adafruit.com/category/flora . 
 Aniomagic 
 Aniomagic was developed by Nwanua Elumeze as part of his doctoral thesis at the University of Boulder. 
Elumeze and his colleagues were investigating ways of adding “tiny bits of computation” to everyday objects 
to make them respond to ambient changes in the environment, such as temperature and light. The team 
quickly realized that the programming platforms they were utilizing were too bulky and slow for what they 
hoped to achieve. They wanted to create something that could be programmed on the fly. Elumeze dreamed 
of paintings and stockings encoded with programs that could trigger a circuit in a dress when someone 
passed by. 
 Elumeze set four goals for his project: he decided it needed to be easy to use, low-tech (for user 
interaction), affordable, and able to be programmed  ambiently  (meaning it can be programmed from a 
variety of sources without additional wires or other hardware). This resulted in the invention of the  Sparkle 
board: a small, inexpensive, sewable circuit board that can be programmed with light from any graphical 
web browser. 
 The board features a sensitive  light sensor that is preprogrammed to respond to certain light patterns. 
The light pattern can be programmed by writing a few lines of code on the web site or dragging sliders in a 
simple graphical interface. The interaction is simple, allowing the user to focus on the design and function of 
the project rather then spending time on small details of the electronics. Figure  5-8 shows the Sparkle board 
with four LED lightboards. Inspired by the shape of the LilyPad Arduino, the Sparkle board also features 
round, sewable, petal-like edges with large conductive pads. 
 The  Aniomagic library has grown beyond these initial boards and now includes several sensor 
boards including touch, magnet, and sound. The team has also developed and released another series 
called  Chicklet , which can be programmed via sound. Unfortunately, Elumeze decided to discontinue the 
Aniomagic line in July 2015. You may still be able to find a kit from a reseller (SparkFun and Maker Shed, to 
list a couple), and the project web site still exists at    www.aniomagic.com  . 
 Fabrickit 
 Fabrickit developed by Despina Papadoupolos and Zach Eveland, is a set of electronic “brick” modules 
designed for making wearable projects. Fabrickit combines sewing with soldering to make prototyping with 
electronics simple. The set consists of three different bricks, shown in Figure  5-10 , and a special connector 
ribbon called  wire :
• 
 Battery brick: A removable and rechargeable coin-cell battery. The board has a 
built-in USB charging circuit  and port. 
• 
 LED brick: Comes in two styles, one with and one without an on-board LED in the 
middle with solderable pads (for attaching the ribbon)  

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
57
• 
 Snap connector brick: Three snaps on a small board with solderable pads on the 
other end. There is a male snap connector and a female snap connector. The snaps 
provide an easy, non-permanent solution to sewing electronics, because you can 
snap and unsnap to make and break connections.  
• 
 Wire:  A very clever solution to the intricacy of sewing long traces with conductive 
thread without crossing them. It comes as a ribbon with three parallel conductive 
thread columns embedded in the middle. Between each conductive column is a 
strand of normal ribbon, which separates and insulates the conductive threads from 
one another. The conductive ribbon can be sewn on with conductive thread. It can 
be cut to any length and then attached to the final project with hot glue or sewn on 
with regular thread.

 Teknikio 
 Teknikio began as a research  project (then called Invent-abling) to find ways to engage girls in STEM 
(science, math, engineering, and science). After a series of initial workshops using raw materials and other 
e-textiles parts, I decided that these were too difficult for young children (and even adults) to use. Although 
the smaller boards are perfect for fashion applications, they are a bit tricky to use for educational purposes, 
when you are trying to point out different features of the electronics. I set out to find a way to make the 
parts more user-friendly and developed a series of custom circuit boards in the process. The boards feature 
bigger sewing pads with larger labels, making them easier for a novice user to sew through. Our mission is 
still focused on empowering girls, but has evolved to promote gender neutrality and dilute gender barriers. 
I believe that boys should also know how to fix a shirt button; they should not shy away from basic sewing 
skills due to gender stereotypes. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MAKING ELECTRONICS SEWABLE
58
 The project has evolved over time and expanded into the retail realm. We currently make two different 
e-textiles kits and several sewable circuit boards. Our latest addition- LED shapes experiments with the idea 
of not only make the LED boards easier to use, but designing the boards to have fun shapes like hearts and 
stars. We find that users are drawn to this new series and treat them more like sequins, than electronics. We 
are doing more research in this realm. The  Fabtronic Sewing Set   is intended to serve as an intro for teaching 
circuits with sewing or for the curious hobbyist who wants to try sewing LEDs lights without investing too 
much time or money in a more complex kit. The Wearable Electronics Set, shown in Figure  5-10 , is more 
substantial and includes eight sewable boards, raw components, pliers, conductive fabric, thread, and a 
mini sewing kit. This kit was designed for someone who really wants to dig deep into the realm of analog 
e-textiles and try several different circuits. It can also be used in an educational setting and can be applied to 
several subjects including art, home ec, science, and technology. Both kits are analog but can be used with 
microcontrollers and most of the other platforms mentioned in this chapter. You can find more information 
about the  kits and example projects online at    www.teknikio.com  . 
 Summary 
 You should now have a strong foundation for understanding  e-textiles . If you would like a more detailed 
explanation of a circuit, resources are available both online and in other books dedicated to this topic. You 
have also completed your first e-textiles project, an LED wristband! Although this may seem trivial, your 
experience designing and crafting this circuit will be useful in future projects. Finally, you were introduced to 
several custom toolsets that have been developed to make e-textiles more accessible and fabric friendly. The 
evolution of each of these kits leaves provide value insight into context as to the issues their designers are 
hoping to overcome with new tools. 
 Perhaps you will discover your own obstacles and solutions throughout your exploration of  e-textiles  . 
Whether you want to turn your discovery into a product or share it on an open platform is, of course, up to 
you. The next chapter highlights a few designers who have shared their research and experience in e-textiles 
and made great contributions to this open source community.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Soft Circuits 
 What exactly makes a circuit soft? A  soft circuit is any circuit that is embedded into a soft or flexible 
 material  . They are often composed of flexible conductive materials such as  fabrics and threads   along with 
discrete electronics components that are sewn in or attached by some other means. By this definition, the 
opposite—a non-soft or hard circuit—would apply to any circuit that is composed of hard, nonflexible 
materials such as plastic and metal. 
 Soft circuits are also called  e-textiles , where the  e  stands for electronics. The term  e-textiles refers to 
the general field of combining electronics with textiles and does not necessarily refer to something that is 
wearable. Although techniques used in e-textiles can be applied to wearables, they are also used in interior 
design and other objects. This chapter looks at some techniques used to create soft circuits and highlights 
designers who have made remarkable contributions to this field. 
 Crafting Circuits 
 Artists who are looking to push the boundaries of their work have been exploring the  art of crafting a circuit 
out of  nonconventional materials for many years. Similarly, scientists who want to test the usability of 
different materials in different contexts have conducted many experiments in this realm. Crafting circuits 
lends itself to various  interdisciplinary practices combining art, design, and technology. By reimagining an 
electronic component or repurposing a  raw material in a new or unconventional form, you can invent and 
reinvent them. This process sparks new ideas for household products, medical devices, wearables, and more. 
 Hannah Perner-Wilson and her collaborator, Mika Satomi, have been developing an  online   
encyclopedia of soft-circuit designs, tips, and tricks for the do-it-yourself wearable electronics community 
since 2009. Their site, How to Get What You Want (   www.kobakant.at/DIY  ), is an excellent resource for 
anyone looking to explore the intersection of  sewing and electronics . As stated on the site, the project 
“aims to be a comprehensible, accessible and maintainable reference resource, as well as a basis for further 
exploration and contribution.” 
 The site is organized the way a basic  electronics store   would categorize its products, and includes 
tutorials on how to make different actuators, sensors, and connectors. Perner-Wilson and Satomi also 
post reports from their experiences sourcing and using materials commonly used in the projects. The 
pair works under the collaborative name  Kobakant and leads workshops around the world to teach their 
techniques; the workshop schedule can be found on their site. Although they do their best to help readers 
source materials locally, several of the projects can be purchased as kits from Perner-Wilson’s Etsy store. 
Kobakant’s portfolio includes many other projects beyond How to Get What You Want, several of which have 
a speculative edge, using textiles and electronics as tools for exploring future interactions. 
 Perner-Wilson continued this work as her masters thesis, entitled “Kit-of-No-Parts,” in which she 
explored the intersection of craft and electronics beyond textiles. Figure  6-1 shows a  collection of soft-circuit 
sensors she created. Her personal work can be found on her web site,    www.plusea.at  , where she documents 
her adventures with engraving circuits in wood carvings, embedding metals into  ceramics , and more.

CHAPTER 6 ■ SOFT CIRCUITS
61
 I have highlighted the  work of Kobakant because it offers a  comprehensive and whimsical approach 
to  soft circuits . There are several other wonderful resources available for those who are interested in 
researching soft-circuit techniques; they are listed in the appendix. The next section guides you through 
how to make a pushbutton switch using conductive fabrics.  
 Designing a Soft Switch 
 Most metal fabric closures naturally lend themselves to becoming switches. A  switch , in its simplest form, 
is something that can be opened and closed or turned on and off. There are hundreds of  variations on this 
simple mechanism, but for the sake of the tutorial, let’s look at two types: the momentary switch and the 
toggle switch. 
 A  toggle  switch is a switch that holds its state. When it is put in the open position, it stays in the open 
position; and when it is in the off position, it stays in the off position. For example, most light switches use 
toggle switches to turn on when pressed or flicked and turn off when pressed or flicked again. Metal clasps 
and snaps commonly used in garments naturally lend themselves to being repurposed as switches. For 
example, a metal snap is conductive and has two parts that can click together (on) and be separated (off). 
Table  6-1 shows different closures that can be repurposed as switches.

 The  momentary switch    is a  switch   that does not hold its state: in other words, it only reacts to an external 
force when the force is applied. A push button, for example, is often a momentary switch. When you use a 
remote control you are interacting with push buttons. When you press the Volume Up button, the volume 
does not continue to increase after you release the button; it only increases when you are pressing the button. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SOFT CIRCUITS
63
 I will now explain how to make a  textile push-button   switch. For this project, you need the 
following items:
• 
 Needle 
• 
 Scissors 
• 
 Conductive fabric 
• 
 Foam or other soft, springy material 
• 
 Felt or other scrap fabric 
• 
 Nonconductive thread 
 The  construction of the  switch with templates is shown in diagrams. Follow these steps to construct 
the button:
 
 1. 
 Cut out two  square pieces of scrap fabric  and two slightly smaller squares of 
conductive fabric with tabs, as shown in Figure  6-2 . 
 Figure 6-2.  Felt (top),  conductive fabric (middle),  foam with holes cut out (bottom) 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SOFT CIRCUITS

 2. 
 Cut out a  square piece of foam or other squishy material, slightly larger than the 
conductive fabric but smaller than the nonconductive fabric. Poke a few large 
holes in the center of the foam. 
 
 3. 
 To put the pieces together, make a  sandwich with the foam in the middle, 
conductive fabric on both sides of it, and nonconductive fabric on the outside. 
Place the conductive pieces such that the tabs are sticking out on different sides, 
as in the diagram.     
 
■ Tip  To hold the conductive fabric in place, you may want to use a bit of fabric glue and tack it down onto 
the nonconductive fabric. You can also attach some Heat’n Bond to the fabric instead of glue. This may be a bit 
more involved but is more easily reversible if you need to take it apart. 
 
 4. 
 Make sure the foam piece in the middle is covering the conductive fabric 
on both sides. Also make sure the holes are large enough that when pressed 
together, the two pieces of conductive fabric on either side touch. This is what 
will close the switch. 
 
 5. 
 Using  nonconductive thread ,  sew around the outer edges of the nonconductive 
fabric to close the button (see Figure  6-3 ). 
 Figure 6-3.  Assembling and closing the button 
 
 6. 
 To test your button, you can attach it to a circuit or test for conductivity using 
a  multimeter . If you’re using a multimeter, bring the meter to the conductivity 
setting. Put one lead on one tab and one lead on the other. Then, press down on 
the padding of the button; the meter should beep when the button is pressed, 
signifying that the switch is closed. If you’re building a circuit, you need an LED, 
a battery, and three alligator  clips . Arrange the pieces as shown in Figure  6-4 . 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SOFT CIRCUITS
65
 Press down on the button, and the  LED should turn on! 
 
■ Troubleshooting   If the button does not seem to be working, rip the seams and see if everything is in 
place. You may need to make the hole in the foam a bit larger, or readjust the position of the foam so that the 
conductive swatches do not touch when the switch is in the relaxed (unpressed) position. 
 Creating a  Printed Circuit Shirt 
 Of course, not all textile circuits are made of conductive thread or fabric. Just as circuits are screen-printed 
onto boards, they can be printed onto fabric. By using conductive inks with traditional screen-printing 
tools, textile artists are able to print actual circuit traces onto fabric. Although these traces may be more 
visible than thin threads, they provide a simpler solution when designing a piece involving circuits with 
several traces. It is also possible to create sensors and other components with conductive ink. For example, 
a simple proximity sensor or antenna involves a coil and can be designed as a flat printed image; see 
Figure  6-5 for examples.  
 Figure 6-4.  Push-button test circuit with alligator clips and LED 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SOFT CIRCUITS
66
 The screen-printing process uses a mesh-based stencil to apply ink onto a substrate such as fabric, 
paper, or wood. An ink-blocking stencil is “burned” onto a mesh and forms open areas that transfer ink 
through the mesh. A fill blade or squeegee is moved across the screen stencil, forcing ink through the mesh 
openings and printing the image onto the substrate. A starter screen-printing kit usually includes a tutorial 
on how to burn an image onto the screen and apply the ink. 
 For the purpose of soft circuits, the only difference in this process is the ink. You can try Bare 
Conductive paint, copper paint, or other metallic conductive paints. If the ink is too thin, it is recommended 
that you thicken it using a neutral substance that does not affect the conductivity. All inks have a different 
resistance, which you should research and consider when making your selection. For example, if the printed 
image involves a long, continuous trace of ink, the resistance will be much higher than that of a shorter trace. 
You can also use this effect to intentionally create resistors in your circuit by using a busy pattern to make 
the length of the trace longer. Additionally, the number of coats you apply can increase the conductivity; it is 
recommended that you apply additional coats of ink to longer traces. 
 The composition of the substrate you are  printing on may affect the conductivity of the ink. You should 
always test the ink on your substrate by printing a series of lines with varying thickness before  applying   
your design, to find the correct thickness. The image below shows images on a screen printed circuit with 
components attached (left), the process of screen-printing (middle), and another screen-printed conductive 
pattern (right).

 Summary 
 You’ve now learned about basic  sewing skills , basic circuits, and crafting sensors from raw materials. At 
this point, I recommend referencing the sources provided in this chapter and in the appendix and trying 
some different soft-circuit  projects . As you explore different materials and techniques, you may design 
your own version of some of these projects or discover an entirely new soft circuit! In any case, I encourage 
you to document and share your work, both so you can review your progress and so that others can draw 
inspiration from your work. The collaborative and open nature of artists and designers in this field is what 
really makes it so wonderful to explore. 
 The next chapter presents some interesting smart materials that can also be embedded into wearables 
and soft circuits.

 CHAPTER 7  
 Materials That Matter 
 Now that you are better acquainted with  e-textiles and textiles, I am going to introduce a new set of  materials 
that, in my opinion, make wearables far more interesting. For now, I will generally refer to them as  smart 
materials . A smart material, in essence, is any material that has a property that changes state in reaction 
to an external stimuli such as temperature or light. Smart materials include  piezoelectric materials  , which 
generate voltage when pressure is applied; shape memory polymers, which change shape when they reach a 
certain temperature; and photoresistive materials that respond to changes in light intensity. There are many, 
many  categories of smart materials, some of which are industry-specific. 
 These materials are inspirational for  designers and engineers working in the wearable realm, because 
they provide ideas for new interactions and new possibilities. Many of these materials can be programmed 
to respond and react to the environment in a way that emulates natural interactions between humans (or 
other organisms) and their environment. Smart materials can be  programmed to undergo a set amount of 
phase changes. For example, a shape-changing plastic could take one form when it reaches 100 ° C and then 
take another form when it reaches 150 ° C. 
 This chapter focuses on a select group of smart materials that are commonly embedded in wearables 
and are excellent prototyping tools for product and wearable design. I have already mentioned conductive 
materials, which fall under this category, but I explain in greater detail the properties of conductive thread 
that make it ideal for certain applications and less ideal for others. 
 Thread as Wire 
 Whenever I show someone a  soft circuit for the first time, they turn it over, look at the components, and 
ask how the parts are connected. The answer is the special thread. The thread replaces wire or solder 
that normally hold components together, allowing for a more flexible and, in some ways, more  durable 
connection . Wires can be difficult to attach to clothing and are stiff and restrictive, not to mention that they 
might totally clash with the design. Conductive thread, on the other hand, can be sewn into the fabric, just 
like any other thread, allowing for smoother integration. 
 There are many different  types of conductive thread, varying in composition and thickness. The 
most common are steel- and silver-based threads, which are also the most affordable. Conductive thread 
can also be made from strands of copper, gold, tin, nickel, and other metals. The thread is composed of a 
core material such as cotton or polyester mixed with metal alloys and is not insulated, making it ideal for 
electronic connections. 
 When  choosing which thread to use for a wearable project, you should take into consideration a few 
key factors. First, the conductivity and resistance of the thread is important. Different metals have different 
levels of conductivity; Table  7-1 shows a few common metals to give you an idea of how to compare them. 
Second, the thickness of the thread is important to consider. The two most common weights of conductive 
thread are two-ply and four-ply. Four-ply contains twice as much metal as two-ply but is usually significantly 
thicker. Steel-based threads, for example, are usually quite thick, which makes them easier to secure 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
74
electronic components, but they can be difficult to sew. Thicker threads also tend to fray and come apart. 
However, they offers some advantages over thinner coated threads, in that the steel can withstand higher 
temperatures, thus making it solderable. Other project-specific factors include the color of the thread, the 
elasticity (some threads are elastic, allowing for even more flexible connections), ability to give off heat, and 
so on. Third, you must consider the reaction to skin or any moisture; some metals corrode more quickly than 
others when exposed to skin.

 Although some  conductive threads are more durable than others, they all eventually fray over time, 
especially after they are washed. Some ways to reinforce the thread are to cover it with conductive glue, 
solder the connections (if possible), and use small pieces of conductive fabric at the connective joints. Other 
tricks include covering the ends of the thread with hot glue or clear nail polish to seal them together. 
 The thickest form of conductive thread is conductive yarn, which is similarly made by mixing metal 
strands with cotton and other materials.  Conductive yarn is often used to make DIY textile sensors or is knit 
into woven wearables like gloves to create conductive touch points. 
 Conductive Ribbon and  Tape 
 I mentioned conductive ribbon in the context of the Fabrickit in Chapter   6 , but this is not the only use of this 
material or the only manufacturer. Different types of conductive ribbons and tapes are shown in Figure  7-1 . 
Conductive thread ribbon cabling is produced in a few different varieties, depending on the intended 
use. The ribbon produced by Fabrickit has three conductive strands and is a steel-based blend, making is 
solderable. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
75
 Figure 7-1.  Conductive  ribbons and tapes 
 Another version, produced by R4R LLC, is a flatter ribbon with four conductive silver strands. Its 
intended use is to be connected with flexible flat cable connectors, as shown in Figure  7-1 . This makes if 
easy to integrate with most electronic boards. It comes in white and black and can be dyed different colors 
without affecting the conductivity. 
 AMOHR is a German company specializing in conductive tapes. It manufactures several different 
varieties including elastic, pressure sensitive, and a version with a heating element. Conductive heating 
elements are commonly used for applications like heated car seats and blankets. 
 Plug and Wear is an Italian textile company specializing in conductive sensors. It manufactures resistive 
tapes that are woven with silver thread. The company also has pressure-sensitive textiles and tutorials for 
creating different kinds of sensors with its fabrics. 
 Conductive Fabric 
 If you can make conductive thread, you can make conductive  fabric .  Conductive fabrics are fabrics that 
conduct electricity. They are made by blending or coating fabric with metal fibers. Conductive fabrics 
are heavily used in medical garments because metals like silver also have antibacterial properties. The 
composition of conductive fabric gives it different textures. There are a few major manufacturers of 
conductive fabric in the United States and a few in Europe, as listed in the appendix. This section highlights 
a selection of conductive fabrics, some of which are shown in Figure  7-2 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
76
 Iron-on Conductive Fabric 
 This fabric is coated with nickel or copper on one side and has  iron-on coating   on the other side. This makes 
it ideal for attaching to other fabric, wood, glass, or paper, using heat. It is fairly soft and can be manipulated 
like nonconductive fabric. The nickel may cause skin irritation.  
 Electrolycra 
 This is usually silver-plated, stretch, conductive fabric. It is very conductive and similar to ordinary LYCRA or 
other elastic fabric. Depending on the weave, some versions only stretch in one direction, and others stretch 
in both directions. The resistivity may change when stretched, depending on the blend. This is ideal for 
wearables that need flexibility, such as gloves and undergarments. It can be found under the brand names 
Electrolycra and Medtex. 
 Tin/Copper/Cobalt Plated 
 These fabrics are highly conductive and solderable due to their high temperature tolerance but cause skin 
irritation. They can be used in between two layers of nonconductive fabric. These fabrics can be found 
under the brand name Flectron. 
 Super-Light Mesh 
 This fabric is extremely thin and lightweight and is therefore very useful for wearable applications. It is 
woven from very thin strands of copper or silver thread or wire. This mesh is sold as a curtain material for 
shielding electromagnetic radiation.

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
77
 Velostat 
 Velostat  is a film made from polyolefin that is impregnated with carbon, thus making it conductive. It is most 
commonly used as packaging material to protect items that could be damaged by electrostatic discharge. 
Velostat is useful when making soft-circuit sensors because it has an interesting property: the resistivity 
decreases under pressure. You can use it to make your own pressure or bend sensors by sandwiching it 
between two conductive layers. I provide a short tutorial on how to do this in the next section. 
 Homemade Bend  Sensor  
 This tutorial walks you through how to make a  pressure   sensor using several of the materials described 
in the previous section. The key element of this pressure sensor is the velostat. The resistance of velostat 
decreases when force, or pressure, is applied to the surface, and when you bend the sensor, this effectively 
puts pressure on it. To measure, or sense, pressure, you are going to measure this change in resistance. The 
construction of the bend sensor may seem similar to the push button you made in the previous chapter. 
Figure  7-3 illustrates the steps to construct the bend sensor. 
 Figure 7-3.  Steps 1–4: assembling the bend sensor 
 You need the following  materials and tools for this project:
• 
 Velostat 
• 
 Conductive thread 
• 
 Conductive fabric (optional) 
• 
  Neoprene or other nonconductive squishy fabric  
• 
 Scissors 
• 
 Needle 
 Follow these steps
 
 1. 
  Cut two identical rectangular shapes out of  velostat  . The size of the bend sensor 
is determined by how sensitive you want to make it. The more conductive thread 
you can fit under the velostat, the more sensitive your sensor will be. 
 
 2. 
  Cut a slightly larger version of the same two shapes out of the neoprene or 
nonconductive  fabric . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
78
 
 3. 
 Thread your needle with conductive thread. You are going to sew across one side 
of the neoprene fabric, as in the third step shown in Figure  7-3 . Start close to one 
end and sew all the way to the other end, using a zigzag stitch. When you get to 
the other end, tie a knot and leave some thread hanging past the edge. Do this to 
both pieces of the outer fabric. You can also sew a small tab of conductive fabric 
on the end, to create a larger connection pad. I have illustrated both versions in 
the diagram. 
 
 4. 
 It is time to  assemble you sensor! Place each strip of velostat on top of a piece 
of neoprene, such that the velostat is covering the stitched side. Make sure the 
velostat is completely covering the stitches, but leave the tabs of conductive 
thread or fabric at the ends exposed. Then make a sandwich with the two sides, 
putting the velostat in the middle. Sew around the edges of the neoprene with 
regular  nonconductive thread to seal the sensor. 
 
 5. 
 You can test your sensor by connecting it to a multimeter, as shown in 
Figure  7-4 . Put a probe on each end of the bend sensor, and set the multimeter 
to the resistance setting, at the 2 kilohms scale. Push on the bend sensor. You 
should see the resistance decrease when you apply pressure or bend it. You can 
now connect it to a circuit in place of a bend or pressure sensor. 
 Figure 7-4.  Testing the bend  sensor 
 Chromatic 
 Chromatic materials change color in response to changes in their environment. Adding chromatic materials 
to wearable designs presents a range of interactions. These  interactions   happen automatically, in the 
sense that the material is preprogrammed to respond to a change in the environment instead of the user 
specifically. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
79
 Thermochromatic 
 Thermochromatic pigment  changes color in response to temperature. The pigment is usually created 
with liquid crystal technology, which you may be familiar with from “mood rings.” The liquid crystals are 
encapsulated within the dye. At a preprogrammed temperature, a chemical reaction causes the liquid 
crystals in the dye to reorient and produce a change of color. This may happen due to an increase or 
decrease in temperature. This technology is also used in baby bottles to detect a change in temperature. 
Although this pigment can be mixed with inks, it is usually used with a thin film. 
 Another technique for creating  thermochromatic materials is with leuco dyes. Leuco dyes can acquire 
two different color states. In the first state the dye appears colorless, but when it reacts with heat or UV light 
it absorbs visible light and changes to a different color (the second color state). This type of dye is used for 
sun-printing and can be applied to fabrics. Hypercolor is an example of a thermochromatic fabric that is 
coated with leuco dye; a sample of  hypercolor fabric changing color can be seen in Figure  7-5 . Lumi is a 
company that produces a thermally reactive dye as an alternative to screen-printing. Their tagline is “print 
color with light.” 
 Figure 7-5.  Hypercolor fabric turning from orange to yellow 
 Photochromatism 
 Photochromatic  materials change color in response to electromagnetic radiation such as sunlight. This is a 
reversible process: the color reverts back to the original state. A common application of this technology is 
in eyeglass lenses, where the lenses automatically darken when exposed to sunlight and clear up when in a 
dark environment. It is also being experimented with in fabric dyes to create patterns on fabric that change 
depending on the light exposure or time of day. Figure  7-6 shows apparel from the Photochromia project, by 
The Crated, which reveals new patterns when exposed to sunlight. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
80
 Shape Changing 
 Shape-changing materials may seem to be the most magical of the smart materials presented in the chapter. 
They can literally morph from one shape into another without physical manipulation by the user, as shown 
in Figure  7-7 . I discuss three different  types of shape-changing materials in this section. 
 Figure 7-6.  Photochromia  outfit diagram by Madisson Maxey (photos by Spencer  Kohn)

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
81
 Shape Memory Polymer 
 A shape memory polymer (SMP) is a  plastic that has the ability to return to an original state after it has been 
deformed. The plastic is preprogrammed during the manufacturing process to have different solid crystal 
states that it can take. This change is induced by external stimuli such as a  change   in temperature or voltage. 
Additionally, SMPs can have multiple states: for example, a plastic-based  SMP may take one shape when it 
reaches one temperature and then morph into another. During the transition, the polymer becomes rubbery 
and elastic, and it hardens into a glassy state when the stimulant is removed and the transition is complete. 
The type of SMP is determined by what activates it. Following is a list of several of these types:
• 
 Light-induced SMPs react to a change in the wavelength of light. This could be a 
reaction to UV light or simply a change of color. 
• 
 Thermoactive SMPs react to a change in temperature. This is similar to polymorph 
plastic, which is mentioned in the next section.  
• 
 Electro-active  SMPs use electric current to activate the polymer. This is useful in a 
situation where heat is not accessible as a stimulant. Usually the material contracts 
or bends when exposed to the current. SRI International, a nonprofit research center, 
has developed a material called  electroactive polymer artificial muscle (EPAM). As 
SRI explains, artificial muscle offers an alternative to the way in which many types of 
industrial, medical, consumer, automotive, and aerospace products are powered and 
operated. Additionally, EPAM is much lighter, smaller, quieter, and cheaper. It can be 
used in haptic displays to improve human computer interaction and flat conformal 
loudspeakers and could even be implanted to create active medical prosthetics.     
 Shape Memory Alloy 
 Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are similar to  SMPs in that an  SMA   is an alloy that returns to its programmed 
shape when heated. SMAs can have a one-way or two-way memory effect. In the one-way effect, the material 
remembers a programmed shape when heated. When it is cooled, it remains in this shape until physically 
reformed. In the two-way effect, the alloy has two states. When it is heated, it returns to one programmed 
shape; and when it is cooled to a lower temperature, it takes the form of the second shape. SMAs are usually 
composed of a blend of metals like copper-aluminum-nickel or titanium-nickel. They tend to be quite strong 
and can support unusually large strains. Although SMAs are preferred for certain applications, SMPs are 
usually chosen over SMAs because they are less expensive to manufacture and more resilient over time. 
SMAs fatigue and lose their memory effect after constant use. 
 Nitinol , commonly referred to as  memory wire , is an SMA that is extremely biocompatible and is often 
used in medical applications such as stents and orthodontic braces. It is also extremely resilient when used 
in eyeglass frames. Nitniol is also being used by fashion designs to activate clothing, you will read about 
some examples of this in Part 3 of this book. 
 Polymorph 
 Polymorphic materials have the  ability to exist in more than one shape. Similar to SMPs, they react to 
external stimuli such as heat. Unlike SMPs, they do not remember their shape at different states; they simply 
become reshapeable or remoldable. Polymorph pellets are commonly sold as a prototyping/design tool 
under brand names like Insta-Mold and Thermoplastic. Polymorphs are a useful material when designing 
wearable  applications because they can quickly be reformed from one solid state to another. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
82
 Optical Fibers 
 I mentioned  optical fibers in Chapter   1 , when discussing the work of Harry Wainwright, who has pioneered 
many techniques for embedding optical fibers in clothing. Extremely thin optical fibers can be woven into 
fabrics to illuminate them. Optical fibers are able to carry light from one source point, usually a super-bright 
 Glowing Materials 
 Although  LEDs are commonly used when creating wearables, they offer very direct light that does not always 
suit the desired aesthetic. The glowing materials described in this section offer thin, flexible alternatives to 
LEDs that provide more of an ambient glow rather than a focused splash of light. 
 Electroluminescent Wire 
 Electroluminescent (EL) wire , also called  glowire, is a material that emits light when current is passed 
through it or it is exposed to a strong electrical field. It is often compared to the phenomenon of 
bioluminescence. EL wire is composed of phosphor-coated copper at the center, surrounded by two thin 
conductive wires, which are encased in a clear protective sleeve and then covered in a layer of colored vinyl. 
The outer layers protect the center from moisture. When current flows through the copper and conductive 
wires at the center, the phosphor glows.  EL wire comes in many different colors; the colors are set by the 
frequency of the applied power and the colored plastic layer. 
 EL wire is used in a variety of different applications including safety lighting for automobiles, light 
sculptures, and illuminated fabric an example of EL wire sewn onto a shirt can be seen in Figure 7-8. It is also 
available as a thin plastic sheet. ElastoLite is one manufacturer of these sheets and markets them as 
waterproof lamp sheets that can be embedded in wearable projects.

LED, across a very long length of fiber, creating a more distributed light than the single LED point. Fiber-
optic fabric can have a starry texture when the fibers are slightly exposed and light leaks out. The fabric is 
used to illuminate all kinds of clothing, from hats and gloves to wedding gowns. 
 Quantum Tunneling Composite 
 Quantum tunneling  composite ( QTC ) is a flexible polymer with extraordinary electrical properties, 
commonly used for pressure switching and sensing. In its normal state, it performs as an electrical insulator; 
but when it is deformed, it become the complete opposite and acts like an excellent conductor. It can pass 
very high currents even at a very small size. QTCs are composed of metal filler particles combined with an 
elastomeric binder, such as silicone rubber. They are a fairly new material developed in the last 20 years. 
Currently they are used to make a variety of textile switches and pressure  sensors   ( QTC  ).  
 Protective Materials 
 Several academic and industry research groups specialize in developing new coatings and compositions 
of fabric to give it extraordinary functionality and efficiency. This section mentions a few particularly 
interesting and innovative textiles. 
 Schoeller Textiles 
 Schoeller Textiles is a Swiss company specializing in researching and developing new textiles. Many 
of its inventions mimic biological inventions and are very interesting for wearables. Follow are 
some textiles developed for protective purposes; more can be found on the company’s web site 
(   www.schoeller-textiles.com  ). 
 C_change 
 C_change  is a windproof, waterproof fabric membrane that responds to changes in temperature and other 
factors. It was developed to mimic the fir cone, which opens and closes in response to different weather 
conditions. Similarly, the C_change membrane reacts to environmental conditions by opening to increase 
breathability or closing to trap moisture. It is advertised as having the ability to ensure a pleasant body 
climate in all conditions. This fabric is used for racing and extreme weather jackets by various brands.  
 NanoSphere 
 NanoSphere  is a nanotech-based surface-finishing technology for fabric, which repels dirt and water from 
becoming absorbed. It was developed based on the natural self-cleaning effect of certain plants whose 
leaves are always clean because dirt cannot stick to the surface. The obvious benefit of this technology is that 
the fabric does not need to be washed as often as it protects itself from common stains. 
 INZECTIC 
 INZECTIC provides protection from ticks and mosquitos. When the insects come into contact with the 
fabric, they become immobilized and usually die. The fabric also repels mosquitos from landing on the 
wearer. Additionally, it is able to breathe and quickly wick moisture out of the fabric.   

CHAPTER 7 ■ MATERIALS THAT MATTER
84
 GORE 
 GORE is a research and development firm specializing in smart fabrics (   www.goreprotectivefabrics.com  ). 
In addition to providing an array of windproof and waterproof fabrics that are ideal for outerwear, the 
company has created a contaminant-aware fabric. Although many of these fabrics are commercially 
available, several have been developed specifically for military use. The contaminant-aware fabric can be 
easily decontaminated if it is exposed to certain chemicals: regular fabrics cannot be fully cleaned after 
exposure to those chemicals, but GORE CHEMPAK does not absorb the chemicals in the same way and thus 
can be easily cleaned.  
 X-Bionic 
 X-Bionic (   www.x-bionic.com  ) is a research center and think tank that develops revolutionary textiles, mainly 
used for outerwear and athletic clothing. I highlight a few of the company’s materials here; they make several 
others that are similar to the technologies described from Schoeller and GORE. 
 Xitanit 
 Xitanit is a material that is able to absorb body heat from working muscles and then distribute and dissipate 
it throughout the surface. The material is extremely conductive and reflective. The conductive property 
allows it to quickly dissipate heat on the exterior while keeping the interior cool. Additionally, the knit 
structure distributes perspiration evenly across the surface.  
 Macrotermes 
 Macotermes  is a cooling material that was inspired by the air-conditioning system of a termite nest. The 
texture of this unique fiber is modeled after the channels and porous structure on the nest’s interior. It is this 
texture that gives the fabric special cooling properties. 
 BIONIC Aramid 
 BIONIC Aramid can withstand temperatures up to 400°C without melting! This material is based on the 
threads of the Golden Web Spider. This spider’s threads are four times as strong as steel. Scientists modeled 
the chemical construction of the Aramid structure after the protein structure of the spider web. The fibers 
that are woven in lengthwise are different than those that are woven widthwise; this prevents the yarn from 
transferring heat and makes it fire resistant. 
 Summary 
 Now your wearables toolbox has expanded even further, from sewing tools and sewable electronics to include 
smart textiles and dyes. Entire books are dedicated to smart fabrics and are full of fascinating material that 
expands on what has been presented in this chapter. As a collector of interesting objects, I have acquired 
samples of many of these materials. I find that when thinking about a new project, it helps to experiment with 
a variety of tools and materials before deciding what to use in the final version. Hopefully these materials will 
be inspirational as you imagine what clothes and wearable devices will be made from them in the future. 
 The next few chapters present new  fabrication techniques and software tools that have had a huge 
impact on the future of wearables.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Digital Design for Wearables 
 Guest Chapter by Madeline Gannon 
 We have a long tradition—as old as human civilization itself—of crafting wearable garments and objects 
for the body. But it is only in the past 30 or 40 years that we have been building tools to digitize these 
traditionally analog practices. Although we shouldn’t reject millennia of accumulated knowledge, 
 handcrafted design processes have certain limitations that digital tools can help overcome. For example, 
when designing wearables that need to be custom-fitted to the body, such as prosthetics or masks, a design 
for one person is not easily adaptable to another; this creates a lot of redundant work when it’s time to 
scale up production. In addition, pragmatic functions—like archiving, editing, sharing, and duplicating a 
wearable—are hard to do with analog design workflows. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, however, 
is incredibly useful for these processes. 
 This chapter goes over the benefits of using design software and highlights commonly used tool sets 
for digitally designing wearables. It touches on designing for fabrication and shows you ways to tailor your 
digital tools for more customized workflows in wearable design. If you are new to digital processes like  3D 
modeling ,  3D scanning , and  parametric modeling, keep in mind that there is a learning curve. But with a 
bit of patience and perseverance, integrating digital tools into your design process will enhance both your 
efficiency and your creativity. 
 Software for Digital Design 
 CAD tools—software for digital design—fall into two primary categories:  tools for designing in two 
dimensions and tools for designing in three dimensions. If you are new to digital design processes, you may 
want to start by experimenting with two-dimensional CAD tools; these tend to be easier to learn, and they 
pair nicely with 2D fabrication processes. For those diving into 3D-modeling and 3D-printing wearables, this 
chapter has suggestions for choosing the right software for your design needs. A nearly endless number of 
CAD tools are available, but this section highlights specific examples that are most useful for designing and 
producing wearables. 
 2D Design Tools 
 The design and fabrication of clothing has traditionally existed as a  two-dimensional process : you use 2D 
templates to cut out a design from a 2D sheet of fabric, which you then sew into the three-dimensional 
garment. Although it is perfectly adequate to do this process by hand, you can also use software to assist in 
the creation and execution of your design. 
 Graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW, and CAD software like AutoCAD and 
Vectorworks, provide digital canvases for drawing 2D patterns and designs. Most important, these software 
packages (and many others) can export your design as a  vector graphic , which can be sent to a fabrication 
machine. Vector graphics are a way of representing a digital image as a series of 2D ( x,y ) coordinates plotted

on the screen. Because the digital image is represented as coordinates and not pixels, you can send vector 
graphics to all sorts of two-axes digital fabrication machines, including laser cutters, vinyl cutters, and more 
traditional paper printers and plotters. The next chapter goes over digital fabrication tools in more detail, 
but keep this in mind: if your software can export a design as a file type with the extension  .dxf ,  .dwg ,  .ai , or 
 .pdf , chances are you can send your 2D digital design to a fabrication machine.  
 3D Design Tools 
 3D modeling is a more recent addition to the wearable designer’s repertoire. Commercially available 
software for 3D modeling is tailored toward three distinct domains: product design, computer graphics and 
animation, and architectural design. Notice anything missing? Currently there are no 3D-modeling tools 
designed specifically for fashion design or wearable design! The next section addresses this limitation; for 
now, let’s find the best available option for the type of wearables you’ll be designing. 
 Choosing the Right Modeling Software 
 Learning to 3D-model can be technically challenging and time consuming. To make things even more 
difficult, each 3D design tool brings its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to geometric 
representation, usability, and cost. This makes learning multiple programs difficult, so it’s best to start with 
the design tool best suited to your needs. 
 If you use geometric representation as a guiding criterion, designers creating wearables that are 
more closely related to product design, such as medical devices or shoes, should use  solid modeling 
software. Examples of solid modelers include Dassault Systèmes SOLIDWORKS, Autodesk Fusion 360, and 
OpenSCAD. Designers creating wearables with more free-flowing, organic forms should use software that’s 
more tailored for computer graphics, animation, and architectural design, such as Rhinoceros 3D, Blender, 
or Autodesk Maya. 
 If you use usability and  cost as the guiding criteria, Blender and OpenSCAD are free, open source 
programs with vibrant developer communities. Autodesk products have free student software licenses, 
but professional licenses are costly. Rhinoceros 3D is perhaps the easiest to learn and the most extensible 
through its Grasshopper plug-in. Maya is perhaps the most difficult to learn, but it is also the most powerful 
in terms of 3D modeling. 
 Finally, the most tried-and-true method for choosing the right design tool for your needs is to first find 
work that you admire and then contact the creator to inquire about their digital design tools and workflows. 
 3D Modeling for 3D  Printing 
 3D modeling can be used in every phase when designing a wearable: in the concept phase for rendering 
images; in the development phase for rapid prototyping and 3D printing; and in the production phase 
for preparing for mass production processes, like injection molding. However, the constraints and 
requirements of a 3D model change for each of these phases. For example, a 3D model created to look its 
best in a rendering may not be built properly for 3D printing. This section focuses on 3D modeling for rapid 
prototyping and looks specifically at how to 3D-model for 3D printing. 
 A 3D model needs to satisfy three basic requirements before it can be printed:
• 
 The geometry must be a  closed solid or a  closed mesh . 
• 
 The geometry cannot have  self-intersecting faces . 
• 
 The geometry must match the  minimum resolution of a printer. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
87
 For a 3D model to be a closed solid or a closed mesh, all the faces must be joined together such that 
there are no holes in the mesh. Another way people describe this property is that the 3D model needs to be 
 watertight . Imagine you poured water into your 3D model: would water leak out? If so, then your model has 
a hole that needs closing. Figure  8-1  shows a valid, closed solid model compared to an invalid 3D model 
with a hole.  
 Figure 8-1.  The 3D model on the left shows a closed solid model, but the model on the right has a hole in its 
hexagonal cutout. This hole violates the watertight principle, which makes the model invalid for 3D printing 
 3D  geometry has both an  in side and an  out side. The mesh is  self-intersecting when the inside of the 
mesh gets flipped outside. In Figure  8-2 , the inside of each mesh face is colored magenta. You can tell when 
a 3D model is turned inside-out when these inverted magenta faces show on the outside of the 3D surface. 
Figure  8-2  shows a valid mesh compared to one with inverted faces. 
 Figure 8-2.  The 3D model on the left shows a closed solid model, but the model on the right has inverted faces 
in its hexagonal cutout. These inside-out faces violate the self-intersecting principle, which makes the model 
invalid for 3D printing 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
88
 When 3D modeling for 3D printing, it’s important to design for the minimum print resolution of your 
3D printer. The  print resolution of a 3D printer is the minimum size for any geometry to be printed. If you 
design a 3D model with features that are smaller than the minimum resolution of a printer, then those 
features are too small for the 3D  printer to realize. Moreover, different 3D printers have different print 
resolutions: a standard FDM desktop 3D printer may have a print resolution of around .1 mm, whereas a 
higher-end SLA printer may have a resolution of 10 microns! Figure  8-3 shows a bracelet that failed during 
3D printing because details in the 3D model were below the minimum print resolution of the 3D printer. 
 Figure 8-3.    This sequence of images shows a digital design with the corresponding physical print. A 3D print 
can fail or break when the 3D model has details that are below the print resolution of the 3D printer 
 Customizing Your Tools 
 As previously mentioned, currently available 3D-modeling software is not built specifically for digitally 
crafting wearables; it is most commonly used for architectural, aeronautical, automotive, and product design 
applications. However, designing for the body has different challenges than designing a building, a boat, a 
car, or a gadget. 
 Human bodies are highly complex, highly specific physical contexts; 3D-modeling tools tend to be 
empty virtual spaces that ignore physical contexts. This can make it difficult to digitally design wearables that 
have a tailored or ergonomic fit. Moreover, every  body is different; creating variations of a design for multiple 
body types can be a laborious task in current 3D-modeling software. Modifying a design to work for S, M, L, 
and XL sizes is not as simple as scaling a 3D model up or down. 
 This section looks at two strategies for customizing your 3D-modeling tools to circumvent these 
limitations. First, you see techniques to  digitize the body— bringing a digital reference of the physical 
body into a virtual modeling environment. Next you learn about  parametric modeling  techniques—a 
way to rapidly iterate and build variation into a digital design. Integrating these two strategies into your 
3D-modeling workflow helps to customize your tools so you can tackle the more difficult challenges for 
digitally designing wearables. 
 Digitizing the Body 
 Bringing a digital reference of a body into your 3D-modeling tool is one useful technique for 3D-modeling 
wearables. Although some modeling  software has default human bodies that you can directly import into 
the 3D-modeling environment, these tend to be idealized forms that are mainly used as scale figures for 
a 3D-modeled scene. To get a more accurate representation of a body, you can  digitize —or  3D scan— a 
person’s body.  3D scanning is a process of digitally capturing the body using hardware and then using 
software to process and reconstruct the captured data into a 3D mesh. This mesh can then be imported into 
your 3D-modeling environment. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
89
 Central to 3D scanning is the idea of  resolution . The resolution of a 3D scan is the amount of detail and 
geometric fidelity it has to the physical counterpart: low-resolution scans have a low amount of detail, and 
high-resolution scans have a high amount of detail. It’s important to find the right resolution for digitizing 
the body: if you have too little detail in your 3D scan, a design may not accurately fit the body; if you have 
too much detail in your 3D scan, the file size of your 3D model may be too big for your modeling software to 
process. Figure  8-4 shows a full-body 3D scan that has been resampled at different resolutions. 
 Figure 8-4.  A full-body 3D scan that has been resampled to four different resolutions. The scan with the 
highest resolution (densest number of mesh faces) is in the background, and the scan with the lowest resolution 
(sparsest number of mesh faces) is in the foreground 
 The three most useful 3D-scanning techniques for digitizing the body are  photogrammetry ,  depth 
cameras , and  structured light scanning . The process of 3D scanning may seem technologically complex, but 
there are a number of options with a low point of entry to get you started. For example, instead of purchasing 
expensive  3D-scanning hardware, you can use your smartphone camera, an inexpensive depth camera like 
the Microsoft Kinect, or a projector and camera to 3D-scan the body. The following sections go into detail 
about the advantages and limitations of each of these three digitizing techniques. 
 Photogrammetry 
 Photogrammetry is a 3D-scanning process that stitches together photographs to create a fully three-dimensional 
model. It works by taking a lot of photos of an object from every possible angle. The photogrammetry 
software then reconstructs a 3D object from these 2D images by analyzing slight differences in the light 
reflected off the object in each photograph. 
 Although these software algorithms are quite sophisticated, photogrammetry is an easy and affordable 
way to 3D-scan something. It requires a little planning but no special hardware. All you need is a decent cell 
phone camera to get started: the algorithms handle all the complicated model reconstruction, and you get 
back a fairly accurate digital representation of your physical capture. Figure  8-5  shows the resulting capture 
session from one photogrammetry app, 123D Catch. Notice how, given a set of photographs, the software is 
able to estimate the world position of the camera. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
90
 However, there are limitations. Photogrammetry algorithms look for  minute changes across a large set 
of images, so they are very sensitive to environmental changes such as moving capture subjects or changes 
in lighting. Moreover, captured images need a decent amount of overlap to fully reconstruct a 3D object. This 
works well for small to medium-sized objects, like a toy or a vase, but can be difficult for large objects, like a 
human body. Also, this need for overlapping images makes it difficult to adequately capture areas with large 
amounts of three-dimensional change, such as hands or fingers. 
 For the best results, keep these requirements in mind when using photogrammetry to 3D-scan the body:
• 
 The person being captured must remain  very still. 
• 
 The lighting in the space where you doing the capture must remain  very consistent. 
• 
 The images being captured must significantly overlap. Plan your capture session to 
reach difficult areas of the body, like the top of the head and the hands and arms.    
 Many programs and apps use  photogrammetry for 3D scanning, but the two I recommend starting with 
are Autodesk’s 123D Catch (free) and Agisoft’s PhotoScan (free 30-day trial). 
 Depth Cameras 
 Depth cameras use various hardware and software configurations to sense the three-dimensional world, 
but all they follow a similar technique: project infrared (IR) light out into an environment and then sense 
where or when the IR light hits a surface. Depth cameras use IR light because it is invisible to the human eye: 
a depth camera can beam high densities of information into an environment, and you and I are none the 
wiser. Depth cameras reconstruct this information as depth maps, point clouds, or meshes. Figure  8-6 shows 
examples of point clouds captured by a Microsoft Kinect. 
 Figure 8-5.    These two screenshots show how photogrammetry software, like Autodesk’s 123D Catch, 
constructs a 3D model from a set of photographs. (Screen captures from    www.instructables.com/id/3D-
Printing-your-own-full-color-bobblehead-using-1   .) 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
91
 Different depth cameras have different resolutions (the amount of detail they can sense): low-resolution 
depth cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, tend to be cheaper, whereas high-resolution cameras, like 
Artec 3D hand-held scanners, tend to be more expensive and used for more specialized purposes. 
 3D scanning with depth cameras takes more time to master than photogrammetry, where you can use 
an app on your smartphone to start 3D scanning. However, depth cameras have distinct advantages that can 
be worth the time and monetary investment. For one thing, depth cameras are very resilient to changing 
lighting conditions in your capture environment. Unlike photogrammetry, these cameras use IR light, not 
visible light, to sense the world: if the environmental light changes in the middle of your scanning session, 
it won’t be sensed by the depth camera, and your scan won’t be ruined. With depth cameras, you can even 
3D-scan a subject in a completely dark environment! 
 Depth cameras are also flexible and useful devices for analyzing the body. Yes, you can use them to 
create a static 3D scan, but you can also use depth cameras to dynamically sense how the body is moving. 
They give you the ability to detect and track different movements, interactions, and gestures for one or more 
bodies. Access to this real-time data can be invaluable when designing wearables for parts of the body that 
are constantly moving, like shoes and medical braces. 
 One of the limitations of depth cameras is that they can’t scan objects or surfaces that are reflective or 
refractive. Depth cameras work by projecting and then sensing IR light; if you try to scan a reflective surface, 
like a mirror, the projected beams of IR light bounce away from the camera’s IR sensor. If the projected 
light never returns to the sensor, then the camera can’t read in the depth data. When using depth cameras 
to digitize the human body, this issue comes up most often when the person being scanned is wearing 
reflective jewelry, a watch, or glasses; but even a person with very oily or sweaty/wet skin can corrupt scan 
data. This can leave noticeable holes in your scan data. 
 Figure 8-6.  Point clouds from a Microsoft Kinect. This raw data can be processed into refined 3D meshes using 
various optimization algorithms 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
92
 Structured Light Scanning 
 Structured light scanning works similarly to  3D scanning with depth cameras: you project light into an 
environment and then sense how that light hits a surface. However, instead of using infrared light that you 
can’t see, structured light scanning uses a standard projector and camera.  Three-phase structured light 
scanning works by projected three specifically patterned calibration images onto the capture subject. 
Figure  8-7  shows how these 2D patterns deform when projected onto the capture subject and then 
generate the 3D scan.  
 Figure 8-7.  Three-phase structured light scanning can be an economical way to get high-resolution 3D 
 scans . The top row shows the three calibration images for three-phase scanning. The bottom row shows the 
calibration images projected onto a car seat and the resulting digitized surface; note the high level of detail in 
the wrinkles of the leather seat. (Images courtesy Wikimedia Commons, licensed under CC BY 3.0.) 
 This sounds quite complicated— and it is —but basic structured light scanning is a very inexpensive 
way to get  high-resolution 3D scans. All you need is a projector, a camera, and some smart software. There 
are open source software options, if you would like to try it yourself. I recommend this tutorial from MIT: 
  http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/processes/structured_light . 
 You will most commonly find structured light scanning being used to capture the bodies of actors 
for films. In this scenario, highly specialized stages filled with DSLR cameras and programmable LED 
 lights sequentially bounce light off the capture subject. One spectacular example is  Light Stage V from the 
University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies. Light Stage V is a geodesic dome with 
156 programmable LED lights. As the LED lights are sequenced on and off, a high-speed camera captures 
the light bouncing off the capture subject at 24 times per second. A high-speed structured light projector 
adds dynamic geometry information onto this reflectance data. What results is an extremely high-detail 3D 
scan—down to the pores of the skin. For more technical details and images, see   http://gl.ict.usc.edu/
Research/DigitalEmily/  . 
 Table  8-1 summarizes this section in a simple, easy-to-read form. As you decide which digitizing 
technique to use, keep in mind the constraints of your capture subject, capture environment, and project 
budget.

 Case Study: Open Fit Lab 
 One great example of how digitizing the body can change the way you design and construct wearables is the 
 Open Fit Lab . The Open Fit Lab is an initiative by Lisa Kori Chung and Kyle McDonald to bring new software 
techniques to traditional clothing construction. In this case, they are using a depth camera and custom 
software to automatically generate patterns for tailored pants. 
 To create these digital pants patterns, the Open Fit  software uses a Microsoft Kinect to scan a person’s 
legs and extract specific body dimensions. These dimensions, such the  crotch length ,  hip-to-floor height, 
and  thigh ,  calf , and  ankle widths, then update a generic pants pattern to fit this specific body. The newly 
generated 2D pattern is projected onto a bolt a fabric, and tailors mark up, cut out, and sew together the 
customized pants. Figure  8-8 shows the process from software interface to physical fabrication.  
 Figure 8-8.  The  Open Fit workflow begins with a parametric pattern generator. The pattern generator is 
updated by real-time readings from a person’s body. The updated pattern is projected at a 1:1 scale onto fabric 
for final construction. (Images courtesy of Lisa Kori and Kyle McDonald, Open Fit Lab.) 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
94
 The Open Fit workflow elegantly balances digital/physical processes in digitally generating patterns and 
facilitating analog fabrication. However, the digital workflow does not necessarily need to stop at the design 
phase: these digital patterns could also be cut using a 2D-fabrication machine. The digital files generated 
by the Open Fit software are the same kinds of files a laser cutter or CNC drag knife uses to cut out a design 
from fabric. Admittedly, this is not a necessary step. But it is a great example to illustrate how easily digital 
design and fabrication processes link together. As you are engulfed in the process of digital design, keep in 
mind how your digital design will eventually come out of the computer and into the physical world.  
 Parametric Design 
 Now that you have brought the human body as a digital canvas into your 3D modeling environment, you have 
a great starting point for designing wearables. But these modeling environments have one more  limitation   
that can make your design and production processes cumbersome: 3D models are very hard to adapt. 
 When you digitally create a wearable design using existing CAD environments, it is 3D-modeled as a 
single, static object. However, wearables rarely ever exist as a single static version: a single design might need 
multiple formal adaptations to fit different body types, fabrication techniques, or even aesthetic sensibilities. 
This is where parametric design can help. 
 Parametric design  is a technique for embedding variation directly into your design. One parametric  object   
that you may encounter daily is the disposable coffee cup. This cup has  fixed variables  that don’t change, 
like the diameter of its top and bottom rims, and it has  open variables  that do change, such as its height and 
volume. The relationship between the height and volume of the coffee cup is its defining  parameter . Changing 
one variable of a parameter affects the others: tweaking the height of the cup modifies the overall volume of 
coffee that it can hold, for example. With parametric modeling, the effort you put into building the original 
model gives you instant variation without the need to reconstruct any geometry. As in the cup example, the 
design effort to create a 12-ounce cup also lets you generate 16 oz cups, 20 oz cups, or even 23.57 oz cups. 
 For wearables, parametric modeling is exceptionally helpful for  iterating ,  customizing , and 
 personalizing  a design. Basing the 3D model of a wearable on parameters lets you rapidly iterate through a 
wide range of options during the design phase. A designer can explore formal and functional changes just 
by tweaking a few variables. Figure  8-9 shows a parametric bracelet being modified by the designer. The 
parametric model is dynamically transformed by simply shifting the values of a few variables.  
 Figure 8-9.    The design of this  bracelet can be rapidly explored using parametric modeling. Just tweaking the 
radius and twist of each bracelet segment generates many variations on a single form 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
95
 Once the design of a wearable is finalized, you can use the same techniques to customize and adapt 
the overall design to multiple body types. Figure  8-10 shows the parametric bracelet in a variety of sizes. 
Each variation keeps the same aesthetic and fabrication constraints of the original model but is sized to fit 
a different wrist diameter. 
 Figure 8-10.    Adapting a wearable design to fit many body types is streamlined using parametric modeling 
techniques. When this example  bracelet   is sized up and down, the fabrication properties (such as wall 
thickness) are preserved 
 In the previous two examples, all the changes in the parametric model result from tweaking one or 
two numeric values. Parametric models abstract the formal behaviors of a design down to interdependent 
numbers. These numbers don’t need to be arbitrary values; they can be very specific data for personalizing 
a design to an individual. The bracelets in Figure  8-11 , for example, are personalized with the individual’s 
Twitter data. The overall aesthetic, design, and fabrication constraints are consistent, but the data gathered 
from each individual person generates a unique form. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL DESIGN FOR WEARABLES
96
 Figure 8-11.    Parametric design also lets you  personalize a design for an individual. These bracelets share 
aesthetic values but integrate an individual’s Twitter data to generate uniquely distinct forms       
 Tools for Parametric Modeling 
 Most 3D modeling environments use back-ends or plug-ins that support parametric design. They can be 
 scripted (where you write code to build the model) or  visual  (where you construct code through a drag-and-
drop interface). The principles behind both kinds are the same: they offer back-door access to the geometry 
functions that the program uses. Table  8-2 shows three of the most commonly used  tools for parametric 
modeling in existing CAD software.

 If you have programming experience, you may feel most comfortable working with OpenSCAD, which 
is a code-based 3D modeling platform. But you can also build your own parametric modeling tool. Creative 
coding platforms, such as Processing and openFrameworks, offer many good libraries and resources for 
programming parametric forms. One benefit of building your own custom parametric modeling tool is that 
it gives you exceptional control over data integration, user interaction, and customization in your design. See 
the tutorial at   https://github.com/madelinegannon/BodyArchitectures for a step-by-step walkthrough on 
how to make 3D-printed bracelets using   Processing  . 
 Summary 
 People are fairly particular about what they put on their bodies, so wearables have a demanding list 
of requirements they need to satisfy. To some degree, wearables need to be functional, beautiful, and 
comfortable. Adding to the  complexity is that everyone’s  body is different: a wearable that is comfortable for 
your body may not be for mine; one that is functional for mine may not be for yours. These requirements—or 
 design constraints —are particularly challenging when  digitally  crafting wearables. 
 This chapter discussed commercially available software for creating 2D and 3D digital designs. It 
also highlighted current limitations for designing for the body. To overcome these limitations, you saw 
two techniques for customizing existing digital design tools. You learned about ways to bring in physical 
bodies as digital references in a virtual modeling environment and about principles of parametric design 
for designing wearables. You also saw how parametric modeling uses the full potential of digital design 
for wearables by letting  designers rapidly explore a design space, customize a design, and integrate 
personalized data into the design of a wearable. 
 The next chapter goes over how to translate digital designs into physical artifacts using a variety of 
fabrication machines.

 CHAPTER 9  
 Digital Fabrication for Wearables 
 To integrate new materials, we sometimes have to develop new machines. For example, to use fiber optics in 
clothing, Harry Wainwright (who was introduced in Chapter   1 ) created a special machine to weave the fibers 
into fabric, and this enabled him to design more intricate light patterns in the fabrics.  Fabrication  techniques 
for manufacturing wearables have been mentioned in previous chapters, but this chapter takes a closer look 
at some of these processes, especially newer and more cutting-edge techniques. 
 Some of these processes are related to making reactive clothing, and others have been developed 
in search of more efficient and economical manufacturing processes. Regardless of the  application  , a 
fascinating variety of new styles and techniques have emerged from the integration of digital fabrication 
methods with traditional textiles.  Fashion designers have been presented with a new toolset of software 
and machines that challenge their process. Some designers have embraced this toolset and are defining the 
future of textiles manufacturing, whereas others believe the new trends do not mesh with their style. 
 Lasering 
 I will start with the  laser cutter , perhaps because it is my favorite digital fabrication tool. To give a quick 
overview of how it works, I will first define the key  component , the  laser . Although you are probably familiar 
with lasers, it may come as a surprise that the word  laser  is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated 
 Emission of Radiation . The acronym is useful because it also defines the term; a laser emits light through 
optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. 
 In a laser cutter, the high-power output of the laser is manipulated through an optical chamber, which 
directs the beam based on instructions from a  computer . Using a focused laser beam, the machine is able to 
cut through several different materials with extreme precision. If you slightly unfocus the beam or lower the 
intensity, it can also engrave or etch patterns on the surface of materials, even those it cannot cut through. 
For example, most laser cutters can cut and engrave through fabrics, paper, thin wood, acrylic, and foam and 
can additionally engrave harder materials like stone and glass. The ability of the laser cutter to cut through 
different materials depends on the power of the laser and the ventilation system. 
 The laser  cutter was invented in 1965 to drill holes in diamond dies. In the early 1970s, it was adapted 
to cut non-metal materials such as fabrics. In the 1990s, British fashion designers, including Janet Stoyle 
and Janet Emmanuel, began to experiment with using laser cutters for textiles and other unconventional 
techniques. In 1998, Integrated Laser Systems patented the first laser-cutting machine specifically for cutting 
fabric and textiles. The company continues to manufacture these machines today and also offers custom 
cutting services; it is one of many laser-cutting companies that has shifted its focus to textiles. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES

 Laser Cutting 
 Laser-cutting  fabrics offers a great advantage over traditional methods of cutting fabric. For one thing, it is 
much more precise than a human hand could ever be. It is also usually much faster and can cut through 
multiple layers of fabric at once, increasing the efficiency of the process. 
 Laser cutting works best on synthetic fabrics because the  material   in the fabric melts when the laser 
slices through it, creating a clean, sealed edge that won’t fray. Although laser-cutting  natural fabrics also 
creates a heated seal, the fibers are likely to be singed by the laser beam, resulting in a burned look that is not 
always ideal. The discoloration can sometimes be washed off, but the crisp, burned texture remains, which 
may not be preferred when using softer, thinner fabrics. 
 Although the laser cutter is a great tool for cutting templates and different  shapes   from textiles, it can 
also be used to create new patterns within the fabric. Traditional methods like weaving and crocheting can 
be used to design intricate patterns with gaps and holes. The most popular of these is lace, which can come 
in many different  forms and patt erns. Laser cutting offers an alternative method for creating these textures 
because the laser can simply cut the pattern out of the fabric. For example, a typical lace pattern could be 
cut from a piece of leather or polyester fabric. This new technique has inspired the use of unconventional 
materials to feature designs that are traditionally associated with a different material. Figure  9-1 shows 
samples of laser-cut leather with various designs.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
101
 The laser cutter can take any vector image and trace along the lines to create a new fabric pattern. This 
also opens the door to new types of patterns that can only be created using this process. Other cutting tools 
could be combined with pattern tracing, but this is an extremely tedious process that is not as accurate as 
using a laser cutter. Additionally, laser-cut patterns can be more freeform; you can take any image, hand 
drawn or digital, and cut it out of any fabric. You can also engrave the pattern into the fabric, as explained in 
the next section. 
 Laser  Textures 
 Laser-cutting patterns is not the only way a laser cutter can be used to create new fabric patterns.  Laser 
etching is another unique and exciting process in textile manufacturing. Instead of cutting through the fabric 
at high power, the laser is programmed to etch a pattern at lower power by moving across the surface of the 
fabric and melting it away. The depth of the pattern—in other words, the amount that is removed from the 
surface layer—is determined by the laser’s power, speed, and resolution settings. Etching is usually optimal 
at lower power settings, high resolution, and slow speeds, depending on the composition of the fabric. 
 Laser etching presents a lot of possibilities for experimentation. First, depending on the composition of 
the fabric, the surface layers will melt in a specific way, creating a smooth or rough surface texture. Designers 
have found that laser-etching woven textiles that are composed of various fibers works well, because the 
laser can be set to remove one element of the textile, revealing a different color or texture underneath. Some 
designers weave fabrics specifically for laser etching. By constructing the fabric with certain fibers, they can 
be sure that melting away the fabric will give the result they intend. 
 Another interesting  feature is that the etching pattern can vary in depth. The laser can be programmed 
to etch certain parts of the pattern at one setting and other parts at a different setting, resulting in a depth 
gradient across the surface of the textile. This variation can also be achieved by attaching a thin stencil to the 
surface of the fabric, with certain parts of the fabric exposed according to the pattern on the stencil. The laser 
etches at uneven depths as it goes over the surface of the stencil and fabric. 
 Laser  Welding 
 Laser technology is not limited to creating patterns and textures; it can also be used to fuse fabrics together, 
eliminating the need for stitches. This process, known as  laser welding , has been a primary area of research 
for The Welding Institute (TWI), an engineering research facility in Cambridge, UK. In laser welding, the 
thermoplastic properties of synthetic fibers are used to melt layers of fabric together, resulting in a smooth, 
strong bond that offers an alternative to stitching. Not only must the textile be highly thermoplastic in 
content to enable melting, but the composition must also allow the energy from the laser to transmit 
through the fabric, which is not a property that most designers are interested in. This property is not usually 
measured or known by the manufacturer and has led to some new scientific methods for evaluating fabric. 
 Kate Goldsworthy, a researcher and textile designer who has made tremendous contributions to this 
field, collaborated with TWI during her doctoral research to find environmentally friendly techniques for 
textile finishing. Goldsworthy’s thesis, titled “Laser-Finishing: A New Process for Designing Recyclability 
in Synthetic Textiles,” explores techniques for manufacturing and re-manufacturing textiles with an 
emphasis on the sustainability of this process as it relates to the life cycle of the material. Figure  9-2 shows 
Goldsworthy’s Mono Finishing project, which consists of a series of fully finished textile samples, each 
demonstrating a different technique she developed at TWI. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
102
 During her research, Goldsworthy realized that this process produced superior results compared to 
traditional methods. She found that welding bonds the layers of fabric together without disrupting the 
surface, although denser materials sometimes display melting and destruction. The welding technique can 
also be used for stitch-free surface embellishments including beading, sequins, foiling, and embroidery. 
 Goldsworthy’s more recent works  include a project called Zero Waste, which uses a single-step digital 
manufacturing process to cut, etch, and weld garments using laser technology. This research is particularly 
promising because it allows designers to create small runs of custom pieces without having to cut and sew 
by hand. Whereas a small run of a custom garment normally would lead to an abundance of waste and 
high energy consumption, Goldsworthy has developed a way to eliminate several steps, resulting in a  zero 
waste (zero compared to normal, that is) process. Additionally, the synthetic fibers used are suitable for full 
chemical recycling if the garment is disassembled. 
 3D Printing 
 3D printing , also known as  additive manufacturing , has become immensely popular in the last decade. 
It is the process of synthesizing a three-dimensional object with a  computerized numeric control (CNC) 
machine  . I remember the day I walked into Staples and saw a 3D printer on display: I was filled with 
excitement that the store had been so quick to adopt this new trend. 
 3D printing was  invented in the 1980s, but it wasn’t until 20 years later that an open source version 
of this project was conceived, known as the RepRap. In 2009, about 10 years after this initiative began, an 
affordable printer was released in kit form called the BFB Rapman. Since then, other affordable kits and 
prebuilt printers have been flooding the market.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
103
 There are several types of 3D  printers , which vary based on printing process, printable platform size, 
and printable materials. Some are to be used only with metal, whereas others can print several different 
kinds of materials. The most common 3D printers work by melting thin 2D layers of thermoplastic such 
as polylactic acid (PLA) on top of each other to create a 3D object. These objects can be printed hollow, 
partially filled, or completely solid, depending on the desired outcome. Some printers use a temporary 
material called  support to fill in any gaps during the printing process. The printer software calculates where 
the support fill may be needed during the printing process. For example, if the object is wide on the top and 
bottom and thin in the middle, it may use some support fill between the two ends so that the object does not 
collapse during the print. This support fill can be chipped away or dissolved by putting it in a chemical bath. 
 Although 3D printers have become more affordable, they may not seem like a worthwhile investment 
for a designer who just wants to try a few pieces or a hobbyists who would like to do a one-off print from time 
to time. Several 3D printing platforms have emerged that can print a file for you. All that is required is the 
 design file and material specification , and your custom-printed object is sent right to your door. Companies 
like Shapeways offer several kinds of printing services with a wide range of materials and resolution. 
 3D printers  have been used to make just about anything  wearable , from jewelry to shoes to hats. 
Companies like Nike and New Balance are using 3D printing technologies to create custom-fit shoes for 
athletes, and jewelers and artists are using the technology to make molds and casts from digital models. 3D 
printing has been disruptive to many different industries, and wearables are no exception. There are entire 
books about the 3D printing  process and applications  , but this books focus of course, are those that pertain 
to wearables. The following sections introduce printing techniques and materials that are particularly 
interesting or disruptive for fashion and apparel. Chapter   10 introduces some technologies that can be 
combined with 3D printing to bring the fabrication of wearables to a new level. 
 Flexible Filaments 
 Objects printed with flexible  filaments have rubber-like elasticity after they have been printed. Depending 
on the form and composition of the filaments, these objects can be stretchy, bouncy, or bendable. Wearable 
applications of  flexible filaments include the following:
• 
 Eyeglass frames: As discussed in Chapter   7 , eyeglass frames are generally made from 
a shape-memory alloy or polymer. 
• 
 Bathing suits: Flexible filaments have been used to 3D-print bathing suits, which are 
normally constructed out of ultra-flexible materials. 3D printing allows the designer 
to experiment with different 3D textures and shapes to create unique forms. 
• 
 Jewelry: Flexible filament is ideal for making custom bracelets and watchbands, 
because it offers a more form-fitting solution. Depending on the design, the 
wristband can stretch to fit over the wearer’s wrist or bend to more comfortably wrap 
around the wrist. 
• 
 Athletic accessories and shoes: The customization potential of 3D printing, combined 
with flexible material that can conform to the movements and changes of the body, 
present ground-breaking opportunities to increase an athlete’s performance.    
 Danit Peleg, an Israeli fashion designer, recently launched a line of 3D-printed garments. Peleg uses 
FilaFlex (a brand of flexible 3D filament) to create plastic textiles with various patterns and textures. The 
textiles are flexible, allowing them to comfortably fit the wearer’s body. The garments bounce up and down 
when lifted or shaken. Figure  9-3 shows Peleg’s 3D-printed skirt, which responds to the model’s movement 
by bouncing back and forth. The model is also wearing red 3D-printed shoes.

 The DREAMS Lab from Virginia Tech and members from the TransLab have collaborated to develop 
3D-printed flexible  textile structures . They were inspired by the additive 3D- printing   process because it is 
more eco-friendly than conventional subtractive methods. The goal of this work was to create fabric that 
is both flexible and rigid, meaning the shape remains fixed when the fabric is manipulated. The resulting 
textile uses interlocking Mobius motifs that can conform to the skin.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
105
 4D Printing 
 3D printing is fairly straightforward to imagine, because it literally refers to printing a three-dimensional 
object. By this logic,  4D printing refers to printing in the fourth dimension, and this opens up a discussion 
about what that means. 4D printing refers to a 3D-printed object that remains dynamic—in other words, it is 
able to change over time after it has been printed. 
 There are several different approaches to this concept, some involving self-folding and others responding 
to physical changes. The self-folding techniques employ some of the smart materials introduced Chapter   7 . 
Using a tool called a  filament extruder , researchers have experimented with creating their own filament 
that is a mixture of materials like Nitinol and PLA. The result is a 3D-printed object that reacts to a change in 
temperature or light or the presence of electric current. Depending on how the structure is designed and the 
smart material in the filament, the object can change shape and embody several different states. 
 The Self-Assembly Lab  at  MIT is experimenting with many different processes of 4D printing and has 
joined forces with Stratasys and Autodesk, two leading firms in the 3D-printing industry. Using Stratasys’s 
Connex multimaterial printer technology, they have developed a way to embed functionality directly into 
the material, including actuation, sensing, and material logic. With a single print, a product or mechanism 
can transform from a 1D strand to a 2D surface and into a 3D shape. The Connex technology allows 
researchers to program the material while printing it out. The geometry of the materials gives them water-
absorbing properties that activate a self-assembly process. Depending on the material composition and 
design of the object, carefully placed joints and hinges allow it to morph in response to water, heat, or light. 
This is a fairly new technology, and there are several potential applications for this process, including the 
 creation of garments that respond to the wearer or a fluctuating environment. 
 Nervous System, a Boston-based jewelry and accessory company, has a slightly different approach 
to 4D printing. Its Kinematics project is a system for 4D printing using foldable forms. Large objects are 
compressed into smaller 3D shapes for production, resulting in a more efficient and practical way to print 
these textures. The designs are composed of several interlocking components that behave as continuous 
3D-printed textiles. Figure  9-4 shows an example of a 3D dress that was printed using Kinematics; the size 
of the dress is reduced by 85%, making it printable as single object. This process is particularly useful for 
creating intricate wearables that conform to the body. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
106
 Printed Casting 
 Lost-wax  casting is a method that jewelers use to cast metal sculptures from an original nonmetal model. 
The way the process normally works is as follows:
 
 1. 
 A  positive  model is made from a castable substance like clay or wax.  
 
 2. 
 A  negative  is made by making a mold of the model from a flexible material like 
silicone or rubber. 
 
 3. 
  The model is removed from the mold, and the mold can be reused to make 
replicas. 
 
 4. 
 A second ceramic mold is made, and the molds are sprued, burned, and treated 
in preparation for the metal (I will not go into these steps, but there are many 
instructions available on the internet if you search for “lost-wax molding”). 
Finally, hot metal is poured into the cast, creating a metal positive when it cools. 
 The first step of this process, making a model, is one of the most time-consuming phases. If the design 
is very intricate, it can be difficult to sculpt a small item such as a ring from wax. 3D-modeling the item 
using CAD software is much less frustrating, because one mistake does not ruin hours of work and material. 
Unlike a mistake made while sculpting which can ruin hours of a work, a mistake made by modelling can be 
reversed with one click. Figure  9-5 shoes two rings side by side: the 3D-printed wax ring made for casting, 
and the final silver ring made from the cast mold.

Nervous System: Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg) 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
107
 Many  3D  printers can print using metal filament. In this case, there is no need to make a wax model 
and go through the casting process, because the ring can be printed directly from the computer model. 
However, depending on the type of metal you want to use and the number of replicas you would like to 
make, finding a 3D printer that can print out a metal version may not be the best route. In this case, it is 
easier to combine new and old techniques, making a digital model of the piece and then continuing with 
traditional casting methods. (Plus, the cost of a 3D printer that prints metal can be 10 to 50 times higher than 
a 3D  printer that can make a wax model suitable for casting.) 
 Digitized Machines 
 Unlike laser cutters and 3D printers, which were not originally designed with textile or jewelry 
manufacturing in mind and have been hacked by designers, several machines were design to digitise 
textile manufacturing. This section looks at two of these machines, which are particularly disruptive to the 
manufacturing processes they replace. 
 Digital Knitting 
 Knitting machines are use to create knitted fabrics and are partially or fully automated. Industrial knitting 
machines have become a crucial part of the mass customization of apparel. They are able to knit large 
quantities of a specific product very quickly and efficiently. Some machines, similar to 3D printing, can knit a 
3D garment, meaning an entire sweater can be knit in one piece without any seams. But these machines also 
have drawbacks, especially for small designers who are not interested in mass production. They are difficult 
to program and are usually operated by skilled technicians. Additionally, they are not economical for one-off 
designs because of their high operational costs. 
 Recent developments in knitting machines have led to a new alternative to fully automatic sewing 
machines. Shima Seiki, a leading company in knitting-machine manufacturing, has a line called 
WHOLEGARMENT that can knit a 3D garment using four needle beds; this allows it to produce 3D garments 
with different patterns and textures, including ribs. The machines are equipped with a computer control 
system that provides controllable sections, allowing the designer to manipulate the tension and shaping of 
the garment during the knitting process.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
108
 KNYTTAN is an early-stage company with great potential. It is developing a digital platform for 
sharing and purchasing knit designs. Similar to the 3D-printing services mentioned earlier, like Shapeways, 
KNYTTAN lets users order customized knitwear. The company is developing an easy-to-use interface where 
users can select ready-made designs or customize their own garments from fully tested templates. This 
simplifies the designer’s interaction with the manufacturing process, making it possible for you to design a 
garment without learning the intricacies of an industrial knitting machine. 
 With these new advances in knitting-machine technology, the $200 billion knitwear market has the 
potential to become democratized, causing a tremendous disruption to current manufacturing systems.  
 Digital Embroidery 
 The first mechanical sewing device was invented in 1755. More than 200 year later, the first computerized 
sewing machine was designed. Before computers became affordable, embroidery patterns could be 
“programmed” by punching patterns on paper tape and feeding the tape through the machine. In 1980, 
Wilcom created the first computer graphics system for designing embroidery, which ran on a mini computer. 
Over the next decade, several other companies developed technologies for this process, including Melco (later 
acquired by Saurer) and Brother. At first the computer interface still printed out the pattern on paper tape, but 
eventually the tape was replaced by floppy disks, which have since become obsolete. Modern machines can 
stitch patterns directly from a computer or SD card and have a built-in digital touchscreen interface. 
 These embroidery machines use a hoop or frame that holds the fabric taut like a canvas. The hoop is 
moved around under the needle so that the needle stitches across the fabric to create the programmed pattern. 
 The ability of the machine depends on the needle. Some machines have up to 20 needles, each 
threaded with different color yarn and capable of making different kinds of stiches. These include the 
following:
• 
 Satin stitch embroidery: Also known as a zigzag stitch for its zigzag pattern.  
• 
 Chain stitch embroidery: A series of looped stitches that form a chain like pattern. 
These chain patterns come in many different varieties.  
• 
 Applique: One layer of fabric applied to the surface of another.  
• 
 Cutwork: A technique in which a hole is cut out of a portion of cloth and reinforced 
with embroidery to keep the raw edges from fraying.     
 SoftWear Automation 
 SoftWear Automation is an Atlanta-based company that is revolutionizing the cut-and-sew process and taking 
the sewing machine from digital to robotic. Its innovations improve the accuracy, efficiency, and ability of 
textile-manufacturing processes using methods like preprogrammed sewing paths. The company’s automatic 
sewing machine uses ThreadVision, a machine-vision technology that monitors the stitches on the surface 
of a piece of fabric to ensure that they are even and notifies the machine when it comes close to the edge. 
Another product, called LOWRY, is a lightweight, four-axis robot used in fabric handling, pick-and-place 
operations, and direct sewing. LOWRY is able to track the sewing path and manipulate the fabric to prevent 
distortion. It can also feed fabric into and out of the machine. Figure  9-6 shows LOWRY in action.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES
109
 Maker and Machine 
 These fabrication technologies have revolutionised practices that have developed over centuries. 
Additionally, the use of software to design clothing and accessories is a remarkable change to the  design 
process . Similar to architecture and other fields that have relied on pen-and-paper models or laborious 
handcrafted 3D models, fashion is a field where instructing a machine rather than a human completely 
changes the process. The most obvious difference may be efficiency, because the time gained from having a 
machine do the work allows the designer to focus on other steps and potentially complete the process much 
more quickly than before. Additionally, a machine may be much better at handling certain materials, leading 
to smoother cuts and builds than are possible in a handcrafted piece. This has given rise to a debate about 
how these processes may distance the maker’s relationship with their craft: the maker suddenly becomes 
isolated from the materials. 
 Three main  barriers arise: the physical distance between the maker and the machine, the separation 
between maker and material, and the space between the maker and the software controlling the machine. 
In the case of laser cutting, researchers feel that this relationship is not lost, but rather if redefined. The laser-
cutting process can be paused and resumed, allowing the designer to redesign during the manufacturing 
process. By pausing the laser, the designer can open the sealed chamber and touch the fabric to see if the 
desired result is being obtained. The fabric can be rotated, flipped, or repositioned before resuming the 
programmed process. 
 With a process like 3D printing, you must wait for the print to finish and cannot manipulate it during the 
printing process without sacrificing the resolution and stability of the print. Digital fabrication does make 
some of these material interactions impossible, but it also presents many new forms of interaction.

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL FABRICATION FOR WEARABLES

 Summary 
 Digital fabrication is extremely interesting and useful when applied to wearables. Not only do these 
machines allow for precision that is nearly impossible to achieve by hand, but they also offer low-cost 
solutions to prototyping concepts and tools for wearables. For example, a friend of mine who was designing 
a pair of shoes for a doll was able to 3D-print a mold and laser-cut the leather for the shoes in an evening. 
Without these tools, he might have cast the molds for the shoes, wait for them to set, and cut the leather by 
hand, extending the process by days. 
 Researchers are exploring ways of developing custom software and hacking different kinds of  sensors 
and tools  to create new and exciting techniques to design for the body. The next chapter explains this 
process through the eyes of one of these researchers. Madeline Gannon is an architect and interaction 
designer exploring the boundaries between human and machine interactions. Her work has led to the 
development of several exciting systems that can be employed for wearable design.

 CHAPTER 10  
 Designing for the Body, 
on the Body  
 Guest Chapter by Madeline Gannon 
 Designing for the body can be challenging with today’s digital tools. 3D-modeling environments tend to be 
empty virtual spaces that give no reference to the human body. Chapter   8 showed how 3D scanning and 
parametric modeling can help tailor your digital tools for crafting wearables. But even with customizing, 
they still have limitations. At the end of the day, you are 3D-modeling in a tool that was built to design cars 
or buildings, not wearables. So, what would a digital tool native to wearables design look like? How would it 
help overcome the design challenges that are inherent to wearables? 
 This chapter looks at  Tactum , an experimental interface that uses the  human body   as an interactive 
canvas for digital design and fabrication.  Tactum , shown in Figure  10-1 , is an augmented  3D-modeling tool for 
designing ready-to-print wearables  directly on your body . This design system was created by Madeline Gannon’s 
Madlab.cc. Instead of using a screen, mouse, and keyboard to 3D-model a design, it uses depth sensing and 
projection mapping to detect touch gestures and display digital designs directly on the user’s skin. Using Tactum, 
a person can touch, poke, rub, or pinch the geometry projected onto their arm to design a wearable. Once a 
design is finalized, a simple gesture exports the digital geometry for 3D  printing     . Because wearables designed 
with Tactum are created and scaled to the user’s body, they are ready to be worn immediately after printing.  
 Figure 10-1.    Tactum is a  gesture-based interface   that lets you customize wearables directly on your body       
 This chapter takes a deep dive into the technical details that made Tactum possible. It also gives you 
some background on  computer interfaces that use the skin and discusses the future potential of augmented 
modeling tools. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING FOR THE BODY, ON THE BODY 
112
 Skin -Centric Interfaces 
 In the past ten years, a rich body of work has been developing for using your skin, instead of a screen, as the 
primary interface for  mobile computing . Researchers have been working on various methods for sensing 
and displaying interactions with the skin. Figure  10-2 shows three recent research projects that explore the 
practicalities of using hands and arms for navigating menus, dialing phone numbers, and remembering 
input. The consensus among these researchers is that skin offers a surprising number of possibilities that 
smartphones lack:
• 
 Skin  interactions can be detected through devices worn on the body, in the body, or 
in the environment. 
• 
 Skin can be both an input and output surface by combining  sensors and projectors . 
• 
 The human body has  proprioceptive qualities ––a spatial awareness of itself––which 
makes visual feedback not entirely necessary for effective interaction. 
• 
 Unlike your cell phone, your skin is always available and with you. 
• 
 Your skin innately provides tactile feedback. 
• 
 Because skin is stretchy, you can get multidimensional input. 
 Figure 10-2.  Researchers in  human-computer interaction have been exploring skin as an interface for mobile 
computing. This image shows Skinput, by Chris Harrison, et al. (2010), in which buttons projected onto the 
skin work just like buttons on a screen. (Images courtesy of Chris Harrison, Scott Saponas, Desney Tan, and

 Tactum builds on this existing work by creating a way to  3D-model directly on the skin. Notice in the 
previous list that a few of the possibilities are particularly useful for 3D modeling: projecting onto the skin 
lets you map and simulate 3D models on the body; sensing diverse input lets you use a number of  natural 
gestures for modeling; and multidimensional input has potential to use the skin as a digitally deformable 
surface. With these opportunities in mind, Tactum focuses specifically on designing for the forearm: not only 
is it easily accessible, but many wearables—including watches, gadgets, jewelry, and medical devices—can 
be made for the arm.

 Sensing the Body 
 Tactum uses a single depth sensor to detect tactile interactions with the body. The system detects touch 
gestures by first tracking the medial axis of the forearm as is moves around the workstation. It can then 
isolate the small volume of space directly above forearm. When a finger enters this small volume of 
space, the system knows that a user is touching the skin. Tactum then starts tracking the behaviors of the 
touch—such as duration, position, velocity, and acceleration—to classify a specific touch gesture. Using 
this method, Tactum can detect up to nine different skin-centric gestures for 3D modeling. Figure  10-4  
shows the range of natural gestures that are sent to Tactum’s 3D-modeling back end.  
 Figure 10-3.    (left) The initial  workstation   setup for Tactum. (right) The segmented, red touch zones on the 
forearm are tracked by Tactum’s depth sensor as the user moves in the workstation 
 Although the sensors may have changed, the principles for  tracking   and detecting the body have 
remained the same. Tactum uses depth data from the sensor as in the following example:
 
 1. 
 Find and segment the forearm. 
 
 2. 
 Find the index finger and thumb of the opposite hand.  
 
 3. 
 When the index or thumb enters the touch zone of the forearm, begin 
recording the gesture. 
 
 4. 
 Identify the gesture, and send it to the 3D-modeling back end.      
 Figure 10-4.    Using a  single depth sensor , Tactum can detect up to nine different gestures for 3D modeling 
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING FOR THE BODY, ON THE BODY 
114
 3D Modeling Back End 
 The gestures detected by Tactum’s depth sensor are fed directly to a 3D-modeling back end. This is where 
digital geometry is processed without the designer having to know the details. In the example in Figure  10-5 , 
a live 3D model is being wrapped and piped around an existing 3D scan of the  forearm . As the designer 
touches and pinches the skin, their tactile interactions are sent to the modeling back end. From here, the 
wearable design’s animated 3D-printable geometry is dynamically updated by a particular gesture. The 
updated geometry is simultaneously projected back onto the designer’s body. Although Figure  10-5  shows a 
3D scan of the body, it’s not entirely necessary when designing in Tactum; however, working from a 3D scan 
helps ensure that the wearable has an exact fit once the printed form is placed back on the body.  
 Figure 10-5.    The 3D-modeling back end dynamically updates the wearable design based on tactile 
 interactions with the skin 
 Fabrication-Aware Design 
 Fabrication-aware design embeds the technical expertise of an experienced fabricator into the workflow of 
a digital design environment. With Tactum, the internal digital geometry is built with an awareness of how it 
will be physically produced: it only allows for 3D-printable geometry to be generated. Therefore, no matter 
how much or little the geometry is manipulated by the designer, the digital geometry is always exported 
as a valid, 3D-printable mesh. Figure  10-6 shows the projected geometry that the designer sees. Once they 
achieve a satisfactory design, they can close their fist to export the geometry for fabrication. 
 Figure 10-6.  Dynamic 3D model being  projected back onto the body. Once a desired geometry is found, the 
design can be exported for  3D printing 
 Tactum keeps the  animated digital geometry scaled and attached to the designer’s body. This gives 
the printed form a level of ergonomic intelligence: wearable designs inherently fit the designer. Moreover, 
with the constraints for 3D printing embedded into the geometry, every design is immediately ready to be 
3D-printed and worn on the body. 
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING FOR THE BODY, ON THE BODY 
115
 Intuitive Gestures, Precise Geometry 
 Gestures within Tactum are designed to be as natural as possible: as you  touch, poke, or pinch your skin, the 
projected geometry responds as dynamic feedback. Although these  gestures   are  intuitive and expressive  , 
they are also fairly imprecise: they are only as precise as your hands. This means the minimum tolerance 
during design is around 20 mm—the approximate size of a fingertip. This 20 mm limit is adequate for many 
design scenarios, as in Figure  10-7 , which shows the creation of a new design. However, to design a wearable 
around an existing object, such as a smartwatch, you need more precise  control   over the digital geometry.  
 Figure 10-7.            This sequence of images shows the process of designing a smart watch band directly on the body 
with Tactum. The actual watch face can be used as a physical reference for the digital design 
 Figure  10-7  shows how Tactum can be used to create a new watch band for a Moto 360 Smartwatch. 
As in the previous example, you can use skin gestures to effect the overall design: touching and pinching 
the skin lets a designer set the position and orientation of the watch face and the distribution of the bands. 
However, the watch-band design also requires mechanical components to function: it needs clips that hold 
the watch to the watch band and a clasp that holds the watch band to the body. Moreover, for the watch 
to fit and the watch band to function, these mechanical components require precise measurements and 
tolerances that go beyond what you can detect from skin gestures. 
 To overcome this limitation, Tactum can connect premade geometry that was precisely 3D modeled 
in a  traditional CAD program to specific parts of a wearable design. In this example, the clips are first 
3D-modeled using conventional modeling techniques. They are then imported and parametrically attached 
to the abstract design definition of the watch band: the two clips sit precisely 41 mm apart, but their position 
and orientation are entirely dependent on where the designer places the watch face on their skin. This 
parametric association between the overall  watch-band design and any premade, imported geometry 
prevents a designer from directly modifying any high-precision geometry and preserves the wearable’s 
functional constraints. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING FOR THE BODY, ON THE BODY 
116
 Tactum uses  intelligent geometry to strike a balance between intuitive gestures and precise constraints. 
Here, the exact geometries for the clips and clasp of the smartwatch are topologically defined within the 
band’s parametric model. In this example, the user- manipulated geometry defines the overall form and 
aesthetic of the watch band. The clips and clasp, although dependent on the overall watch-band geometry, 
cannot be directly modified by any gestures. The CAD back end places and generates those precise 
geometries, once the user has finalized a design. Figure  10-8 shows how the existing smartwatch fits directly 
into the watch band designed through Tactum. 
 Figure 10-8.    Tactum can design wearables around preexisting objects, such as this watch band for a 
 Motorola 360 smartwatch . Skin-centric gestures are used to set the overall design of the watch band. 
The high-precision mechanical components of the watch band can be imported from conventional CAD 
programs and parametrically attached to the overall design 
 Pre-scanning the body is not entirely necessary when designing a wearable in Tactum . However, it 
ensures an exact fit once the printed form is placed back on the body. Between the 3D scan, the intelligent 
geometry, and  intuitive interactions , Tactum is able to coordinate  imprecise  skin-based gestures to create 
very precise designs around very precise forms. 
 Physical Artifacts 
 Tactum has been used to create a series of  physical artifacts   around the forearm. These artifacts test a range 
of different interactive geometries, materials, modeling modes, and fabrication machines. Figure  10-9 shows 
a PLA print made from a standard desktop 3D printer, a nylon and rubber print made from a  selective-laser 
sintering (SLS) 3D printer , and a rubbery print made from a  stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer  .   
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ DESIGNING FOR THE BODY, ON THE BODY 
117
 Future  Applications 
 Although Tactum is an experimental interface, there are real-world implications for skin-centric design 
tools. Many wearables today are still made using high-skill analog techniques: for example, a special-effects 
artist sculpting a mask onto an actor; a tailor fitting garments to a client; a prosthetist molding a socket on a 
residual limb; or a doctor wrapping a cast around a patient. These professions may benefit from integrating 
digital technologies into their workflows, but they should not have to abandon the dexterous abilities of 
their own two hands. Skin-centric design tools show a potential for balancing the best of digital and analog 
techniques for on-body design. 
 Summary 
 This chapter profiled  Tactum , an experimental interface that uses the  designer’s body as an interactive 
canvas for digital design and fabrication. You learned about related work in skin-based interfaces and 
saw how Tactum uses depth sensors to detect tactile gestures on the skin. This chapter also showed how 
gestures—although relatively imprecise—can be used to 3D-model precise, functional objects directly on 
the body. Finally, the chapter concluded with a series of 3D-printed artifacts fabricated using a range of 
printing processes. In the next chapter, we look at how wearables can integrate into our everyday lives for 
health and wellness.

 CHAPTER 11  
 Wearable Wellness 
 Can wearables improve our  quality of life ? This is perhaps the most important question we need to answer. 
How can we convince people all over the world that wearable electronics are a necessary evolution of 
our wares? Thus far, you have been presented with different methodologies and toolsets for exploring 
and inventing wearables. 3D printers and laser cutters are opening doors for democratizing the design 
and manufacturing process. Digitized sewing and knitting machines are translating computer code into 
embroidery and stitch patterns. However, for the most part, these tools are used in short-run boutique or 
independent projects; they have not been adopted for mass production. Perhaps you are not yet convinced 
of how wearable technologies could become a part of your wardrobe. 
 The next part of this book tries to convince you otherwise. It explains how and where wearable 
technologies are disrupting and revolutionizing various fields of research and industry. This chapter focuses 
on wearables for  wellness . Health-related gadgets are designed to encourage people to be healthier. From 
tracking the number of steps you take to helping improve your diet, these metrics are meant to give you 
a perspective of how you can take better care of yourself. There are several different ways in which these 
gadgets can be worn; some are embedded in accessories, and other are incorporated directly into the fabric 
of clothing. The design and form of these gadgets will continue to evolve in the future. The next few sections 
highlight some technologies that have become increasingly popular over the past few years. 
 Fitness Trackers 
 Fitness trackers  have created a huge buzz in the last couple of years and have been quickly adopted by those 
who are looking to add personal  style to tracking their health. Data that was once only  measurable   by a 
doctor or specialist can now be sent to your phone and then analyzed and explained to you in a custom daily 
report. The power to improve your health and track your progress on a daily or even hourly scale has never 
been easier. An estimated 25 million people purchased fitness trackers in 2015; however, the number of 
people who use their new gadget for more than 6 months is up for debate. 
 Several focus studies have shown that fitness trackers are the ultimate  motivational tools  , rather than 
the ultimate health-monitoring tools. They very successfully encourage users to rethink their daily habits, 
like taking a longer route when walking, eating less, and generally paying more attention to their sleep 
cycles. This is most likely because of the user interaction they foster. Every time you look at your phone, 
check your email, or glance at the touchscreen on your device, you are reminded of your daily progress. Not 
only that, but many of them have the ability to network to other fitness trackers so you can compare your 
activity to that of your friends and family. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
122
 An important question that many people have about fitness trackers is, what happens to all the 
collected  data  ? Currently, the information is private and only accessible to the devices you connect 
to your tracker. However, several other industries would love to have access to this information. Some 
obvious groups include doctors, who would be able to analyze what may be the largest data pool ever, and 
advertisement agencies that could target you when you are most alert. This issue is discussed in greater 
detail in the last chapter. This may not be a huge concern right now, though, because studies show that none 
of these fitness trackers are particularly accurate. When tested simultaneously, each one overcompensated 
in some areas and undercompensated activity in other areas. Figure  11-1 shows three different fitness 
trackers that were tested simultaneously by one user, who found that the results varies tremendously from 
device to device. 
 Figure 11-1.  A reviewer  testing three fitness trackers simultaneously: from top-left to bottom, Fitbit Flex, 
Jawbone UP MOVE, Fitbit Zip 
 Today, the three most highly reviewed fitness trackers are the Fitbit, Jawbone, and Garmin Vivosmart. 
There are hundreds of others on the market, not to mention smartwatches like the Apple Watch that have 
integrated fitness trackers. Following are some distinguishing aspects of the top three:
• 
  Fitbit   HR:  A thin wristband with a small digital display that can show your statistics 
as well as caller ID for a paired smartphone. Its strongest feature is the heart-rate-
monitoring sensor, which appears to be more accurate than other brands. 
• 
  Garmin   Vivosmart : Has been praised for offering measurements that are equally 
accurate to those of the Fitbit and Jawbone, but features a larger screen and has a 
more user-friendly integrated notification system. It is waterproof, whereas most are 
only splash proof, and performs better when tested by runners. It is also said to have 
a very comfortable band. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
123
• 
 Jawbone   UP MOVE: Designed a bit differently and does not feature a display on the 
device, encouraging the use of other devices with the wristband. It has a very strong 
sleep-monitoring system.     
 Smart Clothing 
 Smart clothing refers to  e-textiles or clothing embedded with electronics. Smart clothing is being researched 
and developed in several different areas, primarily focusing on fitness, fashion, and health. 
 Techstyles 
  Fashion designers   are working with high-tech textile manufacturers to redesign classic articles of clothing. 
Ralph Lauren, for example, has developed the PoloTech Shirt: a smart shirt that is able to track your 
biometrics and pair with a Bluetooth-enabled device. The shirt was created in collaboration with Canadian 
smart textile company OMsignal. 
 Smart textiles companies each emerge with a specific focus or specialization. Most are working to 
integrate wireless sensors that transmit data to a smart device, but some are developing ways to embed real-
time displays on the clothing. Gymi, for example, is embedded with an LED display of your heart rate, a reps 
counter to show how close you are to a set goal, and an extra display to show the readout of another person 
for partner-training purposes. Following are three big names in the smart textile industry that have different 
applications:
• 
  Hexoskin  :  Hexoskin’s biometric shirt can provide more biometric data than any 
other wearable on the market. It can monitor heart rate, breathing rate, ventilation, 
recovery, cadence, and oxygen levels. It is designed to be an equally effective sleep-
tracking device. Hexoskin is used by space agencies, military organizations, and 
sports teams around the world. The shirt pairs with an app that tracks the wearer’s 
performance across different activities and can be used to monitor health, fitness, 
and more. It is machine washable and comes in several different models for men and 
women. 
• 
  Clothing+  :  Clothing+ is a leading e-textile consultancy firm that helps brands create 
with e-textiles. It offers expertise and experience with e-textiles systems and works 
with brands to infuse new technology into their clothing. Clothing+ was the first 
company to create a wearable heart sensor that could be washed. The company 
continues to innovate new solutions for embedding electronics in fabrics with new 
tools and materials. It works with clients throughout the process of selecting the right 
sensors, fabrics, and software tools for each project. Clothing+’s services also include 
configuring a mass-manufacturing and supply chain, allowing brands to produce 
smart clothing on a large scale. Clothing+ specializes in smart clothing for fitness 
and healthcare and has shipped more than 50 million sensory clothing units. 
• 
 iTBra: The  iTBra is a more localized article of smart clothing; it is a bra that can 
detect signs of breast cancer. The bra contains intelligent breast patches that detect 
temperature changes within breast cells. This information is sent to a smart device 
and processed through a predictive analytic software algorithm. The software is able 
to categorize abnormal temperature and cellular signaling patterns in otherwise 
healthy tissue. Clinical trials show that the data from the iTBra is just as accurate 
as mammography. It is targeted at women who are looking for a more discrete and 
accessible way to monitor their health that does not involve radiation and scheduled 
doctors visits. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
124
 Several other e-textiles companies are working on the cutting edge of integrating this technology into 
everyday clothing. For example, AIQ is innovating new techniques for major brands. It often works together 
with Kings Metal Fiber, a company that specializes in thermally resistant conductive threads and fabrics. 
 Fit Like a  Glove 
 LikeAGlove is a new wearable service that ensures you find the right size jeans, shirts, dresses, and more. The 
company has made smart elastic leggings that automatically take your size measurements and send them 
to an Internet shopping profile; an app then presents you with several pairs of jeans that are guaranteed to 
fit you perfectly. You’re probably wondering how it works. Here is an overview. The smart leggings appear 
to be a normal pair of leggings with a large button on the front below the waist. They are embedded with 
conductive fibers and sensors that provide precise measurements of the length of your leg, waist, thigh, 
inseam, and hips. Once you put them on, you push the button, and it automatically collects data from these 
sensors and transmits it via Bluetooth to an app. The app loads the measurements in 5 seconds and filters 
through a database of jeans to present you with models and brands of jeans that are guaranteed to fit you. 
 If you have ever struggled through several ill-fitting pants and  dresses   to find ones that fit just right, your 
next question is probably, where can I get this? The leggings are currently available for preorder from 
   www.likeaglove.me  for $69; this price is expected to double when the product is fully launched. The product 
video also features a smart shirt that will measure your torso to help you find the perfect  dress     .  
 Wearable Baby  Monitors 
 Wearables are not just for adults; they are revolutionizing  babywear . Several companies are developing 
wearable sensors to help parents and doctors keep track of an infant’s vital signs:
• 
  Mimo Baby  : Mimo Baby has developed a small turtle-shaped monitor that attaches 
to a custom “kimono” onesie. The turtle monitors the baby’s sleep position, body 
temperature, activity level, and breathing and sends this information wirelessly to an 
app that reports the baby’s status. Mimo recently partnered with the home automation 
system Nest so that you can adjust the temperature in the baby’s room based on the 
information from Mimo. You can even use a Nest Cam to watch and listen to your 
baby, ensuring that you have peace of mind when you are away. The system retails at 
about $200 depending on how many kimonos you choose to invest in.  
• 
  MonBaby   : MonBaby is a similar to Mimo, but instead of clipping onto a custom 
onesie, it is a small button that can be attached to any article of clothing. The button 
is embedded with sensors for measuring properties similar to those monitored by 
Mimo; it sends this data to the MonBaby app. The company has also launched the 
SafeSleep project: an online platform for sharing resources and tips to help track and 
improve your baby’s sleeping patterns. 
• 
  Owlet  : The  Owlet Smart Sock , shown in Figure  11-2 , monitors a baby’s heart rate and 
oxygen level while they sleep. The sock comes with an Owlet monitor base that can 
be placed in the parent’s bedroom and acts as an alarm that is designed to trigger 
based on incoming information from the sock. The sensor can be removed to wash 
the sock, which comes in several different sizes for growing babies. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
125
 Bracing Yourself 
 DIY braces and casts are popular projects among hackers and medical experts. By taking advantage of the 
lower cost of digital-fabrication machines, they can make custom-fit prosthetics, splints, and more at much 
lower costs than ever before. One example is the e-Nable Community, an incredible global organization of 
doctors, makers, and hobbyists who have come together to create prosthetic 3D-printed hands for children 
in need. The community began as a husband and wife maker team who posted a video on the Internet of a 
metal puppet hand they had designed for a steampunk convention in 2011. The video went viral, and they 
discovered they had a much larger fan base outside of the steampunk community. Their project gave hope 
of restoring limbs with affordable DIY methods to thousands of people around the world with upper limb 
differences. Today, this online platform provides resources for designing mechanical hands, getting started 
with 3D printers, support for families, and more. Other prosthetic initiatives are discussed in Chapter   13 . 
 Quell is a knee brace that uses  wearable intensive nerve stimulation  (WINS) to treat chronic pain. The 
brace stimulates sensory nerve fibers in the upper calf, which activates descending pain-inhibition systems 
in the brainstem. Then, high-frequency nerve stimulation triggers a cascade of processes that block pain 
signal transmission and result in widespread pain relief. The brace is embedded with sensors such as 
accelerometers to transition between therapy levels based on the wearer’s activity. User studies show that 
81% of people who use Quell reported an improvement in their chronic pain, and 67% reported a reduction 
in their use of pain medication. The product is FDA approved, and the starter kit can be purchased for $250.

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
126
 Kinetic is another company that is rethinking medical  braces . Its smart back brace can detect when you 
are lifting an object and which muscles you are using during the act. It pairs with a wristband that receives 
information from the brace. The brace uses this data to determine whether you have put your back at risk and 
are lifting the object safely. If it seems you are performing an unsafe action, the brace signals the wristband to 
vibrate. The device was invented to help reduce the number of work-related injuries that result from unsafe 
lifting and bending, and help employers save on workers compensation claims. The brace also sends collective 
data to an app that a manager can use to see how their team is performing at any given moment and provide 
suggestions for redesigning the workspace to optimize workflow.  
 For Better  Posture  
 “Stop hunching”—words my mother and grandmother have said to me more times than I can count. 
Although the reminder helps, it’s often not enough to keep me standing straight for the whole day. So, what is? 
A range of  products   that aim to help correct posture have come to market in the past few years. They typically 
involve a sensor that detects when you are slouching and sends you a friendly reminder to straighten up via a 
buzz from a small pager motor in the device. Following are some wearable posture sensors that take different 
approaches to form and style. The one thing they all have in common is that they pair with an app:
• 
  Lumo  Lift : A small plastic sensor that is worn like a pin just below your collarbone. It is 
held in place using a magnetic clasp, as shown in Figure  11-3 . Once you have attached 
the  sensor to your shirt, you double-tap to calibrate the patented angle-displacement 
sensor and set a training program through the app. Depending on the coaching 
settings you have selected, the sensor vibrates to remind you to correct your posture. 
The app also keeps track of your progress over the long term to show how you have 
improved. Lumo can measure additional metrics like the number of steps you take 
and the calories you have burned. I tried a Lumo Lift for several months and found 
that it was indeed quite helpful, but it did not work with looser tops. The company is 
working on ways to attach the sensor to wearables that give more reliable feedback, 
such as bra straps, but it largely depends on how the clothing fits on the user.

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
127
• 
 UPRIGHT  Posture Traine r: A small, curved device that attaches to your lower back 
and vibrates when you slouch. It is not the most discrete tool, but it is easily hidden 
by a shirt or jacket. It uses built-in sensors that automatically calibrate to your body 
and then detect changes to your posture and send an activity log to the app. 
• 
  JINS MEME  : A product that stands out for taking a different approach to measuring 
posture than you may expect. It is a pair of glasses that measure your eye movements 
and ear and nose position to determine whether you are tired and have poor posture. 
The smart glasses frames have embedded  electrooculography sensors near the bridge 
of the nose to monitor changes in your eye movements, gyroscopes to detect changes 
in your body, and two six-axis acceleration sensors in the earpieces to check for 
posture and general body state. This data is sent to an app, which analyzes your state 
and can help you optimize your form and function. For example, if the glasses detect 
that you are drowsy while driving, they send you an alert. The glasses come in a few 
different styles including a Darth Vader model. 
• 
  Prana : A bit different from the others on this list in that it is not specifically for 
improving your posture; it is designed to improve your breathing. However, good 
posture facilitates good breathing, so the Prana can also be used to keep track of 
your posture. It is a circular disc, about one inch in diameter, that clips to your waist. 
Prana measures your breath with its patented sensors and sends this data to an app 
that passively notifies you of your status. It is popular among meditation and yoga 
communities. 
 The last part of this chapter provides a recipe for creating your own DIY pair of posture-sensing 
suspenders!  
 Concept Products  
 Here’s a futuristic wearable that takes things to another level: smart contact lenses. The project was originally 
announced in 2014 as a collaboration between American tech company Google and Swiss pharmaceutical 
company Novartis and is expected to be on the market by 2018. The lenses are embedded with a tiny circuit 
that measures the blood glucose levels of diabetics and wirelessly sends this data to a device. 
 The team has filed for a patent on the technology, which suggests that they are already planning to use 
it in other areas. The lenses could be adapted to improve vision loss due to age by autofocusing on distant 
objects like a camera lens or to detect and report your blood alcohol content. It could even be used to sense 
environmental conditions like allergens and dust and to verify the wearer’s identity.  
 Posture Suspenders Project 
 This project was developed by Tobias Sonne during his research at Carnegie Mellon University and can 
be seen at   http://tobiassonne.com/?p=272 . Although the  sensors   are quite low tech compared to the 
technology in the products mentioned earlier in this chapter, you will gain an understanding of how posture 
sensing works. 
 
■ Note   You need prior microcontroller experience before attempting this project, although it is fairly simple 
and would make a great early project for a beginner. You also need to be comfortable with sewing electronics, 
because this tutorial does not go into detail about sewing circuits. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ WEARABLE WELLNESS
128
 Begin by collecting the following  materials :
• 
 1 pair of suspenders 
• 
 2 DIY bend sensors (tutorial in Chapter   7 ) 
• 
 1 microcontroller (preferably sewable like the LilyPad or Flora) 
• 
 Conductive thread 
• 
 LiPo battery (rated for the microcontroller you are using) 
• 
 Desired output: sewable vibration motor or LED  
• 
 Alligator clips (for prototyping) 
• 
 2 10k ohm resistors 
 Follow these steps: 
 
 1. 
 Prototype your circuit as shown in the diagram in Figure  11-4 (colored lines 
represent alligator clips).

 2. 
 Loosely attach the bend  sensors to the suspenders with safety pins or double-
sided tape. Make sure to place them on your upper back in an area that changes 
shape dramatically if you start to slouch. 
 
 3. 
 Connect your  microcontroller to the computer, and upload the following 
program to measure the  values coming in from the sensor: 
 int sensorleft = A0;        // left bend sensor 
 int sensorRight = A1;       // right bend sensor 
 int Right = 0;              // variable to store the value coming from the right bend sensor 
 int Left = 0;               // variable to store the value coming from the left bend sensor 
 void  setup () { 
 Serial.begin(9600); 
 } 
 void  loop () { 
  Right= analogRead(sensorRight); 
  Left= analogRead(sensorLeft); 
  Serial.println("right:" + Right); 
  Serial.println("left:" + Left); 
  delay(200); 
 } 
 
 4. 
 Analyze the data to find the  threshold value : that is, the point at which the value 
changes dramatically when you begin to slouch. Values on one end of this 
threshold value mean you are standing upright, whereas values on the other end 
signify that you have started to slouch. 
 
 5. 
 Connect the output to your circuit—either an LED or a vibration motor—and 
upload the following code to your microcontroller. Now, when the bend sensor 
detects that you have started slouching, it should trigger the  output   to turn on: 
 int sensorleft = A0;        // left bend sensor 
 int sensorRight = A1;       // right bend sensor 
 int Right = 0;              // variable to store the value coming from the right bend sensor 
 int Left = 0;               // variable to store the value coming from the left bend sensor 
 int threshold= 500;        // change to your observed threshold value 
 int vibe = 9; 
 void  setup () { 
 Serial.begin(9600); 
 pinMode(vibe, OUTPUT); 
 }

 void  loop () { 
 Right= analogRead(sensorRight); 
 Left= analogRead(sensorLeft); 
 digitalWrite(vibe, HIGH); 
 if (Right >=threshold){ 
 digitalWrite(vibe, LOW); 
 delay(2000); 
 }   
 else if(Left >=threshold){ 
 vibe= HIGH; 
 delay(2000); 
 }   
 } 
 
 6. 
 If you are happy with your circuit, you can replace the  alligator clips   with 
conductive thread! Before you start, you may want to refer to Chapter   5 for a 
refresher on how to sew with electronics. Here are some tips:
• 
  Curl the legs of the  resistors with pliers to make loops to sew through, as shown 
in Figure  11-5 . 
 Figure 11-5.  Resistor with curled legs for sewing through 
• 
 When  sewing to a pad on the microcontroller, be sure to loop through the pad a 
few times, until the connection feels secure. 
• 
 If there is not enough room to attach the microcontroller to the suspenders, you 
can sew on a patch of  fabric to create a larger surface. 
• 
 You may want  to sew a pocket for the battery to sit in on the back of the 
suspenders so that it stays in place. 
• 
 Be careful when placing the components. Make sure all the negative rails go 
along the same side of the suspenders, and the positives on the other side—
remember not to cross the paths. 
 
 7. 
 Try out your suspenders! Do they help you improve your posture? Try different 
 outputs and output patterns on the suspenders to see what works the best, as 
shown in Figure  11-6 . You could make a light fade in and out or a buzzer increase 
in intensity depending on the angle of slouch—be creative!

 Summary 
 The  technologies and products describes in this chapter are just a small percentage of the amazing 
wearables being developed for medical and wellness applications. Ultimately, these technologies can only 
become as successful as we allow them to be, so the design and interface of these gadgets is extremely 
important and, arguably, has much room for improvement. As more people adopt these gadgets for help 
with monitoring their infants’ conditions, tracking their daily calorie intake, or checking their posture, 
manufacturers will get more feedback about which features work best. Calibrating sensors to adapt to the 
physically and environmentally dynamic conditions of our bodies is another  challenge that requires much 
research and development. These technologies show great promise and will likely improve exponentially in 
the next few decades. The next chapter examines techniques and projects that offer less visible alternatives 
for wearables.

 CHAPTER 12  
 Beauty Tech 
 Beauty and  technology are two words that are not often used together. Technology might be described as 
being beautiful, in the sense that it is simple and well designed, but can beauty be technological? The term 
 beauty technology , coined by computer scientist Katia Vega, is an emerging field of wearables that refers to 
 electronic devices that are attached to the surface of the body and enable the wearer to interact with the 
digital world. These interactions are not disruptive to the wearer’s everyday routine; on the contrary, they are 
designed to integrate into natural tendencies and actions such as blinking or waving. 
 Beauty technology has been applied to different fields such as  fashion ,  makeup , and  medicine . Chapter 
  2 mentioned X-ray technology as a method of getting under a person’s skin; beauty tech is a method for 
sticking to the skin. Both medical and design researchers are developing sensors that can be applied directly 
to a person’s skin. This can be extremely beneficial for taking accurate measurements of body parameters 
or tracking movement. This chapter discusses various projects that use beauty technology to create more 
advanced or intimate wearable experiences. 
 The Beauty Technologist 
 Katia Vega is a beauty  technologist working at the intersection of invisible computing and fashion. Vega’s 
work is inspired by magic and empowering human capabilities with technology. During her doctoral studies, 
she worked as a research assistant in the  Wearables  Lab at Hong Kong Baptist University, where she 
noticed that a lot of women wore fake eyelashes, nail stickers, and makeup on a daily basis. She thought, 
“Why not add a little technology to these elements?” This question led to her invention of beauty technology. 
Vega works to create beauty enhancements that can give the wearer robotic powers but are completely 
imperceptible from the outside. Furthermore, they do not fit any traditional robot aesthetic. She wants her 
“magical” electronic devices to be hidden on the body, emphasizing the feeling that they are giving the 
wearer secret powers. She is currently a postdoctoral associate at the MIT Media Lab, where she researches 
beauty technology, wearable computers, and  human-computer interaction (HCI) . The following sections 
highlight some of her inventions; you can follow her work online at   http://katiavega.com . 
 Hairware 
 Vega’s latest project, called  Hairware , uses metalized hair extensions as a capacitive touch interface. 
Hairware explores the conscious use of unconscious auto-contact behaviors. Touching or twirling a strand 
of hair is a common comfort behavior that women unconsciously perform. Hairware takes this behavior 
to a new level by triggering actions when the wearer touches the metalized capacitive touch-sensing hair 
extensions. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
134
 Artificial hair is chemically metalized, which makes it conductive while keeping its natural color. 
Layers of nonconductive hair are attached around the conductive hair to protect it from the wearer’s skin. 
Depending on which part of the extension the wearer touches (top, middle, or bottom), the sensor sends out 
different output values, which are input into a microcontroller to control digital devices. For example, when 
the wearer touches certain points on her hair, a signal is sent to her phone to send out her geolocation. 
 Hairware allows the wearer to use her auto-contact behaviors as a secret interface. This raises an 
interesting debate about the advantages and disadvantage of disguising technology on our bodies. Is it fair to 
hide these interactions in social situations, or will it become so common that it is expected? These questions 
are discussed further in Chapter   16 . 
 More than  Makeup 
 Conductive ink was introduced in Chapter   6 as a recommended material for your wearable toolbox. 
 Conductive ink allows you to draw circuits on fabric, paper, and even skin! Katia Vega and her collaborators 
began experimenting with conductive makeup in 2010 by creating eyeliner from conductive ink. This 
technique proved to be problematic because although the ink is not hazardous to the body, it is not 
approved for use on skin. Additionally, the ink is water-soluble, and the humidity from the wearer’s eyes and 
skin can cause issues. The group decided to take another approach to applying conductive makeup to the 
skin: stickers. They created makeup stickers by covering thin conductive tape with makeup ink. For example, 
a thin, black, conductive makeup sticker can be applied as eyeliner. The stickers do not cause irritation and 
are easily removable. 
 Another makeup product the team electrified is  fake eyelashes . Instead of applying liquid conductive 
mascara, fake eyelashes are chemically metalized, which allows them to keep their black color. The 
 metalizing process involves two parts: first the eyelashes are activated with hydrogen and tin chloride, and 
silver nitrate is added to prepare the eyelashes to catalyze the electron transfer. Second is an electrolysis 
phase, during which a layer of nickel is deposited on the eyelashes to plate them. The plating contains 
copper, which makes the eyelashes electrically conductive; and black nickel, which gives the natural black 
color of the eyelashes (see Figure  12-1 ). 
 Figure 12-1.  Fake eyelashes being metalized at EQA lab (left) and tested (right) (photos courtesy of Katia 
Vega) 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
135
 Following is a list of Vega’s projects that use conductive makeup technology:
• 
 Blinkifier : A wearable computer that amplifies the action of blinking without using 
intrusive devices on the face. As the muscles around the eye contract, a series of LED 
lights, embedded in a wearable headpiece, display different patterns depending on 
the blinking gesture. The project uses conductive eyelashes to capture the blinking 
motion. Every time the wearer blinks, the metalized lashes come into contact and 
close the circuit, thus acting as a switch input. The eyelashes on the top eyelid act as 
one side of the switch, and the bottom lashes are the other side. This input signal is 
transmitted through conductive eyeliner stickers to an Arduino in the headpiece that 
sends an output signal to trigger the LEDs.  
• 
 Kinisi : An  FX e-makeup application that was designed to turn skin into an interface 
that is controlled by a smile, a wink, or the raising of an eyebrow. It is similar to 
Blinkifier in that conductive makeup is used to control light patterns of LEDs. Instead 
of a wearable headpiece, the LEDs are applied directly to the skin and hair of the 
model and covered with FX materials, as shown in Figure  12-2 . In addition to the 
metallic lashes and conductive eye makeup, conductive lipstick was developed. 
Vega and her team collaborated with Larca Meicap, a special effects makeup artist, 
who added her FX materials to the Beauty Technology sensors to precisely apply the 
sensors on specific muscles. 
• 
 Superhero: An  e-makeup circuit that triggers output or levitates an object when 
the user blinks. The circuit is made from conductive makeup, black metalized fake 
eyelashes, and a radio transmitter. Like Blinkifier, the metalized eyelashes are used 
as a switch input to the transmitter. Each time the user blinks, a signal is sent to the 
radio receiver, hidden in a handbag nearby. The receiver is programmed to output 
animated images—“POW,” “BAM,” and “ZAP”—that are displayed on a screen each 
time it receives a signal. In another version of this circuit, blinking is used as an input 
to trigger infrared commands that are then decoded for the remote controller of a toy 
helicopter. By blinking her eyes, Vega is able to launch the helicopter into flight!     

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
136
 Beauty Tech  Nails 
 Another technology developed by Vega is her Beauty Tech Nails. These are  fake fingernails that are 
embedded with RFID tags, small magnets, or conductive nail polish. These elements enable the wearer to 
interact with other electronic wearable devices or objects in their environment. The  RFID glass capsules   
embedded in the nails are used with an RFID reader that can identify each individual tag and trigger an 
application based on the input of one nail or the combination of a sequence of nails in a specific pattern. 
The magnets can amplify the wearers’ sensing abilities by allowing them to sense magnetic fields and 
objects with magnetic switches, such as smartphones and tablets. The  conductive nail polish   can be used to 
complete a circuit when it comes in contact with other conductive materials.

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
137
 Following is a list of projects that use Beauty Tech  Nails :
• 
 Gimmickiano: In a live performance, DJ Maribel Tafur wore RFID nails to “play” the 
piano. The nails are shown in Figure  12-3 . As she moved around the auditorium and 
waved her fingers over a wearable belt embedded with an RFID reader, the belt sent 
the notes to a computer through a radio module. Depending on the input pattern 
received, different notes were played by a computer interface.    
 Figure 12-3.    Decorated RFID nails from Gimmickiano (left); exposed RFID tags on nails (right) (courtesy of 
Katia Vega) 
• 
 Abrete Sesamo: This project was inspired by the ancient Ali Baba tale, in which a cave 
that holds a treasure can be opened with the words “iftah ya simsim” (“open sesame” 
in English). Vega and her team created a version of this lock, using a combination 
of finger movements instead of a secret phrase to open the door. RFID glass capsule 
tags are inserted into gel nails and hidden with nail polish and decorative crystals. 
An RFID reader receives the input combination from the nails and transmits it to a 
microprocessor that opens the door when the correct code is  entered . 
 Living Makeup 
 Makeup and electronics are not only being applied to the face with new conductive materials; they are also 
being projected onto faces as dynamic masks. Omote is a project led by Japanese producer Nobumichi Asai, 
who is known for his work in projection mapping, to create what is being referred to as   living makeup .  Omote 
translates as  face or  mask in Japanese. Using advanced face tracking and projection mapping, the team has 
invented a system to project images onto a user’s face in real time that can simulate anything from makeup 
to cascading water. Asai states that he was inspired by the medium of the human face, which he considers to 
be the most “powerful but delicate medium for art.” 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
138
 Face tracking is widely used in security and marketing applications, but Asai wanted to use this 
technology in a different way: to express beauty and the art of makeup, specifically Japanese beauty. He 
was inspired by Japanese aesthetics and  Japanimation , a term referring to the Japanese anime subculture. 
Updating the image with every slight movement of the user’s face required a much more precise algorithm 
than other face-tracking systems. Coordinating the timing of the computer graphic renderings to match the 
face is impressive. He hopes to continue to develop new technologies that express beauty with new media. 
A model with an Omote mask that seamlessly changes from one projected image to another is shown in 
Figure  12-4 .

 Dermatology and Technology 
 Wearable technologies are being researched and developed for more than makeup and masks; researchers 
have also been exploring the potential of wearable technologies for dermatology. The  applications   of these 
technologies range from anti-aging to  dermo-therapy . Studies have shown that although medical tracking 
devices like the Fitbit (discussed in Chapter   11 ) are very promising, the majority of users do not use them 
for more than 6 months. Therefore, researchers are trying to redesign these devices to be smaller and less 
invasive. Doctors and medical experts are looking forward to these advancements and believe that with 
the help of these sensors, they can lower the rate of ER visits and keep patients healthier. The following two 
companies innovating in this field, sometimes referred to as the  Internet of healthy things :
• 
 MC10:  The  MC10 BioStamp is a temporary tattoo, the size of two postage stamps 
and thinner than a Band-Aid, that acts as electronic skin. A picture of the stamp on 
human skin is shown in Figure  12-5 . Using common sensors like accelerometers and 
gyroscopes, the BioStamp can monitor temperature, movement, heart rate, brain 
waves, and more. It then transmit wirelessly to a computer program that analyzes 
the data. The stamp is waterproof and powered by a thin film battery that can last 
more than 24 hours and is charged wirelessly. One concern is that because it is a skin 
patch, wearing it for too long could cause dermatitis. 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
139
• 
 Feeligreen: Feeligreen is a French company that has developed a line of makeup and 
skin patches that address aging and other skin-related conditions. The  dermoPatch  
is an under-eye adhesive sticker that applies a microcurrent technology across the 
skin. The microcurrent technology increases the pharmoco-kinetics of ionized 
drugs and transdermic diffusion of active molecules, thus improving their efficiency 
in the treatment of certain types of local pathologies. Feeligreen says this could be 
applied to a large range of drugs that treat neuropathic chronic pain, skin cancer, 
bedsores, arthritic pain, and diabetes; provide needleless vaccines; and can be used 
for cosmetic applications such as anti-aging, depigmentation, and cellulitis.  
 Another interesting technology that plays into this field is   transient electronics . These are tiny, 
biocompatible electronics that dissolve after a set amount of time. They are encased in layers of silk protein 
extracted from silkworm cocoons and are fully biodegradable. Researchers have discovered how to adjust 
the properties of the silk such that it dissolves at a specific time. They believe that this technology will 
be widely used in medical implants, consumer electronics, and environmental monitors. Although this 
technology is still being tested and developed, it is extremely promising for wearable applications.

 Conductive  Tattoos  
 Along with medical and beauty products, conductive tattoos are popular among artists, designers, and 
hackers. Some of these tattoos use  conductive inks, such as Bare Conductive. Although these inks are safe 
to use on the skin for short periods, they are not recommended for long periods, as Vega discovered in her 
research. Amrita Kulkarni, an Indian designer, has been experimenting with conductive ink in her henna 
designs. Using small LED lights and coin-cell batteries, she draws intricate patterns on her skin and embeds 
simple light circuits throughout. Chaotic Moon, an Austin-based design firm, is using this ink to prototype 
more complex skin circuits for DIY health monitoring and embedding banking information onto the skin to 
replace credit cards. The company refers to this concept as a  tech tat . 
 The Design Probes team at Phillips released a speculative concept video called “SKIN: Electronic 
Tattoo” in 2007. In the video, two lovers touch each other’s bare skin, activating an electronic tattoo that 
spreads across the body. The video “explores the body as a platform for electronics and interactive skin 
technology.” The electronic ink that forms the tattoo is touch sensitive and is therefor visible only when 
contact has been made. Similar interfaces are being researched in academic labs around the world as well as 
in industry. For example, Google recently filed a patent for an electronic skin tattoo that couples to a mobile 
device. The application describes a neck tattoo that would pick up sound from the wearer’s vocal cords 
(“fluctuations of muscle or tissue in the throat,” to be exact) and wirelessly send it to a device.  
 DIY LED Tattoo Project 
 This section guides you through how to make a simple tattoo  circuit with LED lights. The project uses off-
the-shelf components that can be ordered online through sites like Amazon and also found in local hobby 
electronics stores. Some of these are shown in Figure  12-6 . 
 You need the following  materials :
• 
 Conductive Ink 
• 
 Small coin-cell battery (CR1220) 
• 
 Chibitronics circuit stickers (LEDs and sensors)  
• 
 SMD LEDs 
• 
 Tweezers 
• 
 Glue dots 
• 
 Conductive tape

 Design and Sketch 
 Following is a series of question to consider while making this and other beauty tech projects:
• 
 What is it? Decide what aspect of beauty you’d like to focus on. 
• 
 Attachment: how is it attached to the body? Does this cause any problems? If you 
are focusing on something that attaches to the skin, research the properties of skin. 
Could humidity cause problems for your device? If it is something that attaches to 
your nails, could it cause complications with your daily habits? For example, if it 
involves magnets, could it trigger unexpected interactions with your devices?  
• 
 What does it do? This is the most important part of your concept. What superpower 
will your device give you? How will it change your interaction with the world? Will it 
be a secret, hidden  device , or will it pop out and help you express yourself further?

 Steps to Make a Temporary Light Tattoo 
 Follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Once you have your circuit design, sketch it out on your body using a pen or 
thin  marker . Remember, the positive and negative traces of the circuit cannot 
overlap. Additionally, there should be small gaps where you plan to place the 
LEDs and battery. The forearm is a good place to start, because it gives you a lot 
of  surface area  .  
 
 2. 
 Outline the  circuit traces with conductive ink , and wait for it to dry (15 to 20 
minutes), as shown in Figure  12-7 . 
 Figure 12.7.  Conductive ink drying on skin 
 
 3. 
 Carefully place the LED circuit  stickers on your arm. You may want to use 
tweezers for this part. 
 
 4. 
 Now to attach the power. Place a small glue dot on the bottom (negative side) of 
your battery, such that half of the surface is exposed. Place the negative side of 
the  battery over the end of the negative trace outlined with conductive ink, such 
that the glue dot does not cover the ink and the surface of the battery is making 
contact. 
 
 5. 
 To connect the positive side of the battery, you can either draw with conductive 
ink from the end of the positive trace on your tattoo to the top surface of the 
battery, or use another material like conductive tape to close the final gap. Once 
the ink is dry, the LED should light up, as shown in Figure  12-8 . 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ BEAUTY TECH
143
 
 6. 
 If the battery is loose, you may want to experiments with various  tapes   and more 
 glue dots to hold it down, or a small Band-Aid may do the trick. If you want 
to cover the tattoo traces and/or circuit sticker, you can use foundation or 
other makeup.       
 Summary 
 Beauty technology extends into many areas of  research , from medical and wellness to performance and art. 
I find these applications to be particularly exciting because of the way  electronics and digital devices   can 
be disguised and embedded on the body. These projects are intentionally crafted to be applied to the body 
through invisible means—in other words, they feel like a natural growth or extension of the wearer’s skin 
and hair. This is a powerful step forward for wearables, showing that these devices can shrink and evolve so 
much that we might not even notice them or, more important, feel them. The next chapter will look at some 
examples of how to take wearables from on the body and embed them in the body!

 CHAPTER 13  
 Superhumans and Cyborgs 
 When you hear the word  cyborg , your mind probably jumps to superhero comics and sci-fi TV shows or 
movies featuring creatures with one eye in the middle of their forehead, robotic limbs, and green skin. 
Although these are, indeed the cyborgs we are familiar with from the media, there are many other cyborgs 
living among us, some with less obviously unusual features, and some who could be spotted a mile a way. 
You may be surprised to find out how little it takes to be known as a cyborg. Several cyborg enhancements 
are used frequently to restore a person’s natural abilities and may not seem like a superhuman feature. The 
term  superhuman , however, is more specific and refers only to qualities that exceed human capability. These 
are for the most part fictional qualities like superhuman strength or sixth and seventh senses. Superhumans 
are a subset of cyborgs; a superhuman ability may have resulted from a cybernetic implant or enhancement. 
 Another term pertinent to this topic is  cybernetics , which is defined the science of communication and 
control theory as it applies to the comparative study of automatic control systems. However, the term is broadly 
used to refer to any controlled system that uses technology. Thus cyborgs are a derivative of cybernetics. As you 
may expect, many cyborgs are people interested in or involved with the field of cybernetics. 
 Chapter   2 touched on the history of cyborgs and bionics and how they have been used in media 
and popularized by certain iconic characters. This chapter elaborates on forms of cyborgs and artificial 
enhancements. These include wearable enhancements such as hearing aids and special eyeglasses, as well 
as implants and prosthetic wearables. You also learn about organizations and societies that have formed 
around the culture of cyborgs and bionics. 
 Cyborgs and Bionics 
 Before delving into the world of cyborgs, let’s evaluate what makes a person a cyborg, or bionic. 
 
■ Note   Cyborg and  bionic basically have the same meaning and are used to describe the same devices 
throughout this chapter.  Cyborg is a noun and more often refers to a person, whereas  bionic is an adjective. 
 By  definition , a  cyborg  is a person who is aided by or dependent on a mechanical or electronic device. This 
means anyone who is wearing a fitness tracker to help monitor their health is in fact a cyborg. Alternatively, 
cyborgs are people with medical or experimental implants that restore or modify their behavior and function, 
such as a cochlear implant, which is used to restore hearing. Researchers believe a wave of  cyborgism  
has already started on a small scale and may become widespread in the near future. On the far end of the 
spectrum, they speculate that there will come a time when humans and machines have become one, which is 
referred to as  singularity . There is some opposition to singularity from those who believe the world will collapse 
before this occurs. In other words, they think the technology we create will impose the end of humanity before 
it can effectively merge with humans. This, of course, is a longer and more philosophical discussion, as found 
in books such as  Future Shock by Alvin Toffler and  The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzwell. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
146
 Cyborgs for Art 
 Artists have used cyborgs in their work in many different ways, from creating work about cyborgs, to altering 
their own bodies to become cyborgs. The latter, known as  cyborg artists , are often trying to add a cybernetic 
extension to their body that they can share with their audience. In these cases, the device is the heart of the 
piece. The following sections introduce a few artists who have paved the way for cyborgism as an art form. 
 Stelarc 
  Stelarc   is an Australia-based performance artist who is famous for pushing the limits of becoming 
superhuman with his body modifications. His performances involve displays of his extended abilities, such 
as being hung from hooks that have been implanted in his back. He regularly collaborates with robotics 
engineers, experimenting in the space between virtual and reality. During one performance, his body was 
controlled by electronic muscle stimulators that were connected to the Internet. 
 In his  Ear on Arm project, he had a third ear implanted onto his forearm and connected to his auditory 
system by a team of surgeons and stem-cell experts. Initially, Stelarc wanted to implant the ear on his 
head, but the doctors were not able to perform this procedure. As Stelarc explains, “I have always been 
intrigued about engineering a soft prosthesis using my own skin, as a permanent modification of the body 
architecture. The assumption being that if the body was altered it may mean adjusting its awareness.” To 
carry out this quest, he  experiments with prosthetics in unconventional ways to see if he can rearchitect his 
body’s senses and systems. 
 Neil Harbisson 
 Neil Harbisson is a  British artist and activist raised in Barcelona who was born completely color-blind. 
He studied music and art and pursued a degree in music composition in the UK. In 2004, Harbisson had 
an antennae implanted in his skull, allowing him to use audible vibrations in his skull to communicate 
information such as measurements of electromagnetic radiation, phone calls, music, as well as video and 
images. Figure  13-1 shows Harbisson in front of one of his prints. He is most famous for being the first cyborg 
recognized by a government: his UK passport features a photo of him with his antennae. 
 Figure 13-1.  Neil Harbisson and his  eyeborg (photo by Dan Wilton, licensed under CC-BY-2.0) 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
147
 The antennae’s main function is to treat his color- blindness . It translates light frequencies of the visible 
color spectrum as well infrared and ultraviolet light to sound. Harbisson has memorized these frequencies 
and claims he is able to “hear color” through this process. The antennae consists of two antenna implants, 
one vibration/sound implant, and a Bluetooth implant that allows him to connect to the Internet. The 
Internet connection makes it possible for him to receive color information from satellites and other people’s 
cameras, as well as receive phone calls directly into his skull. Currently five people, each on a different 
continent, are allowed to directly send him images, sounds, and videos. 
 Harbisson regularly gives lectures to raise awareness about  cyborgism   at universities, museums, 
conferences, and other venues. He also continues to produce work as an artist, most commonly in the form 
of music and color prints, and has performed and exhibited globally. For example, his series  Color Scores 
consists of a series of painting in which he paints what he hears. As Harbisson explains, his ability to hear 
color means common sounds such as voices and music are all associated with a color. Thus he is able to 
paint speeches and music that correlate to the colors in which he hears them. Similarly, a walk through a 
park or a supermarket fills his ears with the sounds of all the brightly colored objects he passes.  
 Moon Ribas 
 Moon Ribas  is a cyborg activist, choreographer, and dancer known for her  Seismic Sense project. In March 
2013, Ribas permanently attached a sensor to her elbow that vibrates whenever an earthquake occurs in 
the world; she has been wearing the sensor since then. The frequency of the vibration relates to the strength 
of the earthquake and is wirelessly connected to seismograph data on the Internet. With her sensor, Ribas 
created the solo dance performance  Waiting for Earthquakes.  In this performance, the dancer stands still 
until an earthquake is felt, and the intensity of her movements reflects the magnitude of the earthquake. 
 Her other projects include  Speedborg, which began as a speedometer glove that translates the speed 
of objects around her into vibrations that can be felt by her hand. After months of wearing the glove, she 
found she could sense different speeds depending on the interval of the vibrations. Another version of the 
project used earrings instead of gloves that similarly vibrated when there was a nearby presence. She wore 
the earrings while travelling around Europe, and in each city she collected data to find the average walking 
speed of the citizens. She used this data to create  The Speeds of Europe , a video dance that demonstrates the 
walking speeds of the citizens in the cities she visited. 
 By 2009, Ribas found she was very familiar with her own speed. With this information, she created 
 Green Lights,  which is choreographed in relation to a set of eight traffic lights on Barcelona’s Rambla de 
Catalunya. She first studied the traffic-light timings and measured the distance between traffic lights; she 
then calculated the speed at which she had to walk to such that she was not interrupted by a red light and 
was able to get from one end of the avenue to the other end without stopping.  
 Wafaa Bilal 
 Wafaa Bilal  is an Iraqi-American artist and assistant professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York 
University. His art focuses on provoking a dialogue about international politics and dynamics; Bilal has 
lectured internationally about the critical situation in Iraq and Sadam Hussein’s regime. He uses technology 
and media in his work to connect to his audience and invite them to participate in his performances. 
 In his piece  3rdI , he became a cyborg artist by surgically implanting a camera on the back of his head. 
The camera had a USB connection to a lightweight laptop that Bilal carried with him, which had a 3G 
wireless Internet connection. With this system, the camera automatically captured one image per minute 
from his daily life and transmitted them to a web site (   www.3rdi.me  ) where they are visible to the public. As 
he explains, the piece is a platform for telling and retelling a story, and the artist is the storyteller. 
 The piece was exhibited at the Arab Museum of Modern Art in Doha Qatar. NYU asked Bilal to cover 
the camera while on campus due to security concerns; he had the camera removed in February 2011 due to 
constant pain.

 Cyborg  Foundation 
 Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas founded the Cyborg Foundation in 2010 with the mission of helping 
humans become cyborgs, promoting the use of cybernetics as body parts, and defending cyborg rights. 
They believe that cybernetic extensions should be treated as parts of the body, not artificial extensions. 
The foundation does not focus on helping repair senses and does not discriminate between people with 
disabilities and those without. They believe if we extend our senses, our perception of the planet will change, 
as will our behavior, and this will lead to a connected world that is more respectful to the environment and 
one another. They launched the initiative Cyborg Nest in 2015 in collaboration with Younivis, an “incubator 
for social superheroes,” in order to architect new senses for the cyborg generation. You can visit the Cyborg 
Foundation online at    www.cyborgfoundation.com  . 
 Cyborg  Research 
 Artists have made tremendous contributions t the advancement of cyborgism, but many of these would not 
be possible without the help of scientists and engineers. Steve Mann and Kevin Warwick are two scientists 
who are instrumental in this field. 
 Steve Mann 
 Steve  Mann was mentioned in Chapter   1 for his work on wearable headsets and is revisited here for his 
contribution to cyborg research. It is believed that  Mann was the first cyborg, because he has been wearing 
his computer-aided vision system since the 1980s to enhance and record what he naturally sees. In addition 
to several inventions in the field of computational photography, Mann is extremely active in issues of 
cyborg rights and cyborg law. He keeps an online blog at   http://eyetap.blogspot.ca detailing his own 
experiences as a cyborg. In July 2012, Mann was physically assaulted by a McDonalds employee who tried to 
pull his headset off and proceeded to push him out the door of a McDonalds in Paris. Following the incident, 
Mann teamed up with several international organizations and leading industries to propose the Mann-
Wassel law for presentation to the New York legislature. The goal of this effort is to create a legal policy and 
social climate to counteract such incidents by companies that could negatively interfere with the research 
and use of  augmediated reality technologies. 
 Mann has coined the term  sousveillance , which refers to the recording of an activity by a participant in 
the activity, typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. His  Anonequity project 
is an ongoing collaboration with several other researchers and focuses on the ethics, law, and technology 
of anonymity, authentication, surveillance, and sousveillance as they relate to cyborg law. He is a tenured 
professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with cross-appointments to the 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Faculty of Forestry, at the University of Toronto, and is a professional 
engineer licensed through Professional Engineers Ontario. He is also general chair of the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Symposium on Technology and Society and 
Associate Editor of  IEEE Technology and Society . 
 Kevin Warwick 
 Kevin  Warwick is an engineer, professor, and deputy vice chancellor at Coventry University in the UK. His 
research centers on   artificial intelligence  ,   biomedical engineering  ,   control systems  , bioethics, and robotics. 
He is best known for his project  Project, Cyborg , an ongoing project in which  Warwick has implanted an 
array in his arm with the goal of becoming a cyborg or, as his nickname says, “Captain Cyborg.” The project 
began in 1998 when an RFID tag was implanted under his skin, allowing him to control doors, lights, heaters, 
and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity. This served as a test to see how the body 
would react to the implant. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
149
 The next stage was to implant a neural interface that consisted of a BrainGate (a brain-implant system 
built by the company Cyberkinetics) and an electrode array connected to an external gauntlet that contained 
other necessary electronics. The array contained 100 electrodes, 25 of which could be accessed at once. The 
median nerve, which the system monitors, carries many times that number of signals. The interface was 
designed by Warwick’s former PhD student Dr. Mark Gasson and his team. It was successfully implanted 
into his arm in March 2002 and directly interfaced into his nervous system. The implant also connected 
Warwick’s nervous system to the Internet at Columbia University in New York. This allowed him to send a 
signal to control a robot arm at the University of Reading that was built by one of his colleagues and obtained 
feedback from the sensors in the fingertips. The signal from the array was complex enough that the robot 
arm was able to mimic the actions of Warwick’s arm. He was also able to connect ultrasonic sensors to a 
baseball cap and experience extrasensory input from them. The side effects of the implant on Warwick’s 
hand function were measured using the University of Southhampton Hand Assessment Procedure, a 
clinically validated hand-function test, and no measurable effect or rejection was found. The nerve tissue 
grew around the electrode array, enclosing the sensor. 
 Warwick is not the only person who went through this operation. A similar array was implanted into his 
wife with the goal of inventing a form of telepathy or empathy, using the Internet to communicate signals 
across long distances. The operation was successful and proved to be the first direct and purely electronic 
communication between the nervous systems of two humans. 
 Warwick believes that  Project Cyborg could pave the way for new medical tools that treat patients with 
damage to the nervous system. Additionally, it is speculated that a similar technology could be used for 
technology-facilitated telepathy. He has written or edited 27 books, 3 of which are about  Project Cyborg . 
He holds honorary degrees from several universities around the world and several visiting professorships. 
He has also been awarded many honors including earning the title of one of the “only 7 eminent scientists” 
from the Institute of Physics, the others being Galileo, Einstein, Curie, Nobel, Oppenheimer, and Rotblat. His 
implants are on display at science museums in London and Naples. 
 Bodyhacking 
 
■ Note  This section explains some unconventional body modifications. If you do not enjoy reading about 
these types of things, please proceed with caution. 
 Most of the cyborg implants and enhancements presented so far have a specific purpose. The cyborg 
has chosen to have a procedure performed as part of an art project or proof of concept. Neil Harbisson 
initially wanted to find a different way to perceive color because he was naturally color-blind. He then began 
to experiment with his implant and has used the device to serve other purposes. This curiosity alone can be 
a reason for an implant. 
 Bodyhackers , also referred to as  grinders , are people who modify their body with technology and thus 
fall into the arena of cyborgs.  Bodyhackers experiment with different ways to extend human capabilities, or 
become superhuman, by implanting electronics and other small objects under their skin. The procedures 
are usually carried out by a body-implantation specialist or doctor and are performed at the risk of 
the recipient. Different people have different reactions to their implants; some are able to live with no 
complications, whereas others face infections and disease after the operation. The following sections review 
four of the more common body hacks. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
150
 Near-Field Communication Chips 
 Near-field communication (NFC) microchips are in many of the electronic devices we own.  NFC chips   
enable a communication protocol between two electronic devices when they are in a certain range (about 10 
cm) of one another. They are used in contact-free payment systems, where simply holding your card in front 
of a device like a smartphone with a payment application is enough to process a transaction. They are also 
used in car keys, to unlock the doors automatically when the key is a certain distance from the car. They are 
much less expensive than similar technologies such as Bluetooth. 
 Once the chip is synched with a device, it basically acts as a key to enable communication. A grinder who 
has this key embedded in their finger can automatically unlock keypads and phones using the technology. It is 
believed that this implant will be more useful in the future when it is compatible with more devices. One risk is 
that the chip could be hacked to carry spyware and spread viruses to all devices it comes into contact with.  
 Magnetic Implants 
 Other grinders have had a small  neodymium (rare-earth) magnet implanted in their fingertip in order to gain 
an extra sense. The procedure involves slicing the tip of the finger, inserting a magnet, and gluing the incision 
together. Once the incision heals, the magnet is ready for adventure. For starters, people with this implant can 
pick up small metal objects like paperclips and bottle caps with the tip of their finger, as shown in Figure  13-2 . 
Depending on the strength of the magnet, they may even be able to demagnetize credit cards and hotel key cards. 
 Figure 13-2.  Woman with a magnetic implant  lifting paperclips 
 A more interesting effect is the new sense of magnetic  awareness . A person with a magnet in their finger 
can literally sense the presence and strength of a magnetic field. Dann Berg, a writer who had a magnet 
implanted in his pinky finger in 2009, tells his story of how his everyday experiences changed. He says that 
suddenly things like  power transformers and microwaves  became interactive; he could feel this new invisible 
layer as a tingle in his finger. He explains, “Each object has its own unique field, with different strength and 
‘texture.’” Berg recalls the first time he went into a retail store and felt the strong magnetic waves emitted by 
the device used to remove tags from clothing. He could feel the magnetics embedded in electronic devices 
like speakers. Some of these magnets were so strong that they could flip the magnet in his finger! 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
151
 Berg notes that he is generally happy with his magnet and cannot think of many negative consequences. 
He does not believe the magnet has given him a sixth sense, but rather it has extended his sense of touch and 
allows him to interact with  objects more intimately, letting him perceive them without physically touching 
them. The magnet has not been a problem in airport security and does not damage his electronics. In fact, 
the magnet is not as strong as it first was. One major issue he is aware of is that he would have to have the 
magnet removed if he needed to have an MRI—and if he forgot, the machine would probably rip the magnet 
out for him. 
 Another, less common, version of magnetic implants involves embedding magnets in the ears. In 2013, 
Rich Lee had  sound-transmitting magnets implanted in his ears that, when paired with an amplifier and coil 
necklace, allow him to play music without headphones. In order to use the magnets, an amplifier is plugged 
into a media player and sends signals to a coil worn around the neck. The coil creates a magnetic field that 
sends signals to the magnets and is perceived as sounds that only the wearer can hear. 
 LED  Compass 
 Pittsburgh-based bio-hacking collective Grindhouse Wetware recently tested the first version of its latest 
creation: a small circuit board, a bit larger than a coin, embedded with five LEDs that are activated by 
a magnet. The board is covered in a special silicone casing, which took months to develop. The most 
important part of the design is to ensure that the board does not make contact with the body. Three 
members of Grindhouse had the board, known as the NorthStar v1, implanted into their hands by a Swedish 
tattoo and body-modification artist in November 2015. The NorthStar can serve as a backlight for a tattoo or 
mimic the natural phenomenon of bioluminescence, where living organisms are able to glow and emit light. 
 When a magnet is placed on the board, the LEDs blink for 10 seconds. The team predicts that the 
battery on the board will be able to light it up about 10,000 times. At that point, the device will have to be 
surgically removed. When asked why they created this device, the team stated that the community wanted 
a way to light up their tattoos. They plan to sell about 100 of these devices to tattoo parlors in the next year. 
Their research is mostly self funded, with some outside investment; it does not comply with bioethics 
standards, so they usually are not able to work with doctors or medical experts. 
 The NorthStar is the next iteration of the Circadia 1.0, a health tracker around the size of a pack of 
cigarettes that cofounder Tim Cannon previously had implanted. He removed it after three months due to 
discomfort. The NorthStar is considerably smaller, but the group wants to shrink it even more and expand 
its capabilities. For example, a future version could wirelessly deliver biometric data such as blood pressure. 
Another version will be able to track the motion of the person’s hand, enabling the hand to become a 
wireless controller. The implant will recognize movements and transmit them via Bluetooth to a gesture 
controlled device that can be controlled with gestures. They like to think of this as the next level of Siri, who 
you don’t need to talk to. As Cannon explained in an interview with Vice, “We want to transform science 
fiction into reality.… This is about passion and  citizen  science.” 
 Cyborg-Themed Products 
 This section presents some products that are working to give a new outlook or perception for how people 
experience the world. Some of these are similar to the superhero products presented in Chapter   2 . 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
152
 To Better See You With 
 Devices that improve or correct vision are one of the earliest forms of wearables, as you saw in Chapter   1  . 
The ability to magnify or extend vision makes people curious, from wondering what it would be like to 
have “eyes in the back of your head” to being able to see through walls. This section highlights some newer 
wearable concepts that are trying to extend vision. 
 Night Vision 
 There is a reason I prefer not to drive at night: I cannot see as well. This is because humans in general are 
not able to form images in the dark; we need light to reflect off an object in order to form the image in our 
eyes. Luckily, the invention of night-vision goggles works to combat this inability. Night-vision goggles are 
commonly used by the military to aid soldiers who need to find their way in the dark, but they can also be 
purchased at sporting good stores to help you see your way through the woods when camping. They range in 
price from $10 to $600, depending on how high-tech you want to get. 
 On the lower end, you may only be able to find glasses with a reflective coating, similar to the material 
used to illuminate roads at  night . On the higher end, you can get a more complex optical system. Night-
vision devices work by amplifying what little light is present in an environment. They can do this in two 
ways. The first, called  light amplification , involves collecting a small amount of light, even from the lower 
infrared spectrum that is imperceptible to human eyes, and then amplifying it to the point that you can see 
the image. The second method,  thermal imaging or  heat vision , uses the higher end of the infrared light 
spectrum, which objects emit as heat. If an object is giving off heat, the thermal-imaging device can capture 
this and translate it into a loosely defined image in the visible spectrum. 
 Eidos  Eyewear 
 A team of designers from the Royal College or Art prototyped a set of wearable headpieces called Eidos that 
augment  perception ; see Figure  13-3 . The first device resembles an oversized mask that is embedded with a 
 camera  and a display and enables the wearer to see motion. The incoming images from the camera are sent 
to a computer and processed by an application that creates an output with a ghosted trail, similar to that 
of long-exposure photography. The output is then sent to the display in the headset, altering the wearer’s 
perception of the outside world. The team believes these nuance patterns and traces of movement will be 
useful in many different applications. For example, if used in sports, the technology would allow players 
to visualize and improve their techniques in real time. Alternatively, if worn by an audience at a dance 
performance, viewers would have personalized experiences of the event, whereas these types of projections 
are usually applied to the stage. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
153
 To Better Hear You With 
 This section describes wearable technologies that augment or enhance auditory senses—in other words, the 
way we perceive sound. 
 Eidos Earwear 
 The second mask of the Eidos project allows the wearer to selectively hear speech. A directional microphone 
embedded in the device captures audio and processes it through an application that reduces background 
noise. The sound is then transmitted to the listener through headphones in the mask and a central 
mouthpiece. The mouthpiece passes the isolated sound directly to the inner ear through vibrations, which 
are processed by bone conductance. As the team explains, this creates a unique feeling, as though someone 
is talking directly inside your head. 
 Headphones , Reimagined 
 Doppler Labs is a San Francisco-based startup working on a new type of earbud. The wireless earpieces pair 
with a smartphone app that allows you to adjust the volume, EQ settings, and other effects. The earbuds, 
called Here, let you personalize your listening experience. For example, you can add an echo or cancel 
out specific background noise, like the sound of a crying baby. The app transmits the settings to Here via 
Bluetooth, which unfortunately does not deliver the best sound quality. The earbuds work best at short 
distances, which could pose a problem when your smartphone is turned off on an airplane. They retail at 
about $200 and are not intended to be marketed to a wide audience, but rather to music-savvy audiophiles 
who may be looking for a new listening experience. 
 Nuheara is another company working on a similar product, but its earphones are not just intended 
for listening to music. They will also be used for telephone calls or conversations with Siri, similar to the 
earpiece in the movie  Her . Nuheara expects to release its product in late 2016 at a retail price of about $300. 
Several smartphone manufacturers, such as Motorola and Samsung, have developed Bluetooth earpieces 
that pair with the phone and transmit sound, but augmenting that sound is a new development.

perceive the image, and  earmask (right) (photos by Tim Bouckley) 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS

 VibeAttire 
 Whenever you walk into a loud concert or movie theater, you may perceive the loudness in your ears as well 
as other parts of your body. Or you may have experienced discomfort from a car passing by, blasting the 
bass of a song that is otherwise inaudible. This is because sound waves cause vibrations: to your ear, these 
vibrations are perceived as sound, but they can cause other parts of your body to vibrate as well, such as your 
chest. This generally is not dangerous unless the sound is extremely loud or you suffer from a lung or heart 
condition that could be affected by the vibrations. 
 Aubrey Schick, a designer and engineer at Intel, founded a company based on her project   VibeAttire 
while working as a researcher at the Quality of Life Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University. 
VibeAttire essentially works to benefit from the vibrations of sound and give the wearer a different type of 
sensory sound experience. It is a vest embedded with several vibration motors that pulse in response to an 
audio signal. Schick wrote a program that determines how different parts of an audio signal (treble, bass, 
volume, and so on) cause vibrations in the body and mapped the frequencies from the sound to a matrix of 
vibration motors embedded in the vest. 
 The vest was initially  developed to allow deaf people to compose their own auditory experiences and 
later marketed as audio-enhancing tool to the general public. The targeted user applications are as follows:
• 
 Music, gaming, and multimedia enthusiasts 
• 
 People with hearing impairments 
• 
 Therapy 
 I tried an early prototype of the vest and was amazed to find that I really felt as though I could hear 
music through the vest. I first used the vest with headphones so that I could both hear and feel the music at 
the same time; I then turned off the headphones and found I could still hear the song in my head through 
the feedback from the vibration. However, when I turned the vest on without hearing any of the music, my 
predictions about the music were way off. For example, from the vibrations, I interpreted a song to be in the 
genre of hip-hop or R&B—but when I turned up the headphones, it was a country song!    
 Medical Bionics 
 In medicine, bionics are divided into two categories:  restorative and enhanced .  Restorative technologies 
restore a lost function, organ, or limb. The defining factor is that something is being replaced or repaired. A 
common medical bionic is a cochlear implant, which is an electronic device that provides a sense of sound 
to a person who is deaf or hard of hearing. 
 Enhanced  bionics, on the other hand, aim to extend past natural function or capability and provide a new, 
superhuman power. An example would be implanting a pair of legs that are able to run faster than any human. 
 Brain-Computer Interface 
 A  brain-computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain 
and an external device. They are most commonly used to research, map, assist, augment, or repair human 
cognitive or sensory motor functions. The  BCI field primarily focuses on neuroprosthetics that restore 
hearing, sight, and movement. The brain has amazing  plasticity , meaning it can quickly readapt. This means 
the brain can interpret signals from prosthetics as it would natural sensor and effector channels. These can 
fall under the categories of both restorative and enhanced bionics, depending on the functionality of the 
device and how it is interpreted and adapted by the brain. 
 Invasive  BCIs  are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain)    during neurosurgery. These 
devices provide higher-quality signals but are prone to scar tissue build-up, which eventually weakens or 
totally blocks the signal from reaching the brain. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
155
 Retinal Implants 
 Retinal implants are a common invasive BCI that can partially restore vision to patients who have lost their 
sight due to degenerative eye conditions. In this procedure, a low-resolution image is created by electrically 
stimulating surviving retinal cells. Researchers have found that in these cases the photoreceptors of the 
eye have been damaged, but the nerve cells that relay the signal to the brain are still intact. This means 
it is possible to directly stimulate these retinal nerve cells and produce signals that are perceived by the 
brain as vision. Scientists have researched different methods to stimulate retinal nerve cells, including 
neurotransmitter release, magnetic, mechanical, and electrical stimulation. Currently, three types of retinal 
implants are being developed by private companies and research institutions around the world. 
 Noninvasive BCIs 
 The alternative,  noninvasive BCIs , do not require surgery; they involve placing electrodes on the head 
but have poor spatial resolution because the skull dampens the signals. The most studied form is 
 electroencephalography  (EEG) . In an EEG, electrodes are placed along the scalp and measure spontaneous 
electrical activity, usually over a period of 20–30 minutes. By placing several electrodes around the scalp, 
more precise data analysis can be performed to deduce where signals are being fired and to filter out noise. 
EEGs are most commonly used to diagnose coma, sleep disorders, epilepsy, and brain death. 
 Recently, smaller, low-cost EEG headsets have been developed for the consumer market. NeuroSky Inc. 
is a Silicon Valley–based company that specializes in creating EEG headsets for consumer applications. Its 
products include Mindflex, a game released by Mattel that involves wearing an EEG headset to measure your 
brain waves and steer a ball through an obstacle course. The headset in the game is widely used by hackers 
and hobbyists who want to implement a low-cost BCI device into their projects. A few years later, NeuroSky 
launched MindSet, a research and developer multimedia headset with free software developer tools. The 
company also partnered with the Japanese organization Neurowear to create Necomimi, a headband with 
a brain-wave sensor that controls motorized cat ears that turn up or down based on the EEG readings. 
Figure  13-4  shows several members of the press trying Necomimi at a launch event.

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
156
 Technically, this device is not able to read your mind; but depending on where the sensor is located on 
the head and how noisy this area is, it can read your brain state quite accurately. There are currently many 
research initiatives to create smaller, more portable wearable EEGs. They have promising potential not just 
for games and smart accessories, but also for helping to monitor and diagnose chronic health conditions. 
 Prosthetics 
 A  prosthetic  is defined as an  artificial device that replaces a missing body part. The reason a prosthesis 
is needed can vary from trauma to disease and is treated accordingly. The earliest known prosthetic was 
created by the early Egyptians and was discovered on a mummy, who is thought to have been buried in 
950–710 B.C.E., in the form of a big toe made from wood and leather. Other  early developments included an 
iron hand and a peg leg developed in the 1500s. The first electronically enabled prosthetic was developed in 
the 1990s. Known as the  intelligent prosthesis, it was a microprocessor-controlled knee. 
 Many new  materials and technologies in recent years have been used in the development of artificial 
limbs. Carbon fiber, for example, allows limbs to be stronger and more lightweight, thus making them easier 
to design and operate. Additionally, the use of electronics has become more common. 
 Myoelectric  limbs can be controlled by converting muscle movements into electrical signals that are 
picked up by electrodes. The muscle movements are read from the surface of residual skin, such as flexing 
an elbow or ankle. This system uses the neuromuscular system of the body to control an electrically powered 
limb, as shown in Figure  13-5 . 
 Figure 13-5.  The  myoelectric arm of a U.S. Marine 
 The alternative approach,  cable-operated limbs , offers a more immediate response—the myoelectric 
system often has a slight lag time. The cable-control system harnesses the energy of a healthy shoulder or 
wrist and is referred to as  body-powered prosthesis . Another advantage of this system is that the wearer can 
feel what is being held, thanks to the inherent biofeedback system. 
 A third approach involves  robotic prostheses . These devices have several components, including 
biosensors, such as surface electrodes that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes 
implanted in the muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. These sensors 
collect feedback from the wearer’s body and communicate with a central controller system that triggers 
 actuators in the device. Actuators are electronics that mimic the actions of a muscle to produce movement. 
The controller is connected to the wearer’s nerve and muscular system and monitors and controls the 
movements of the device. 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
157
 Robotic  prosthetics offer much more fine-tuned control of the device. The  i-limb hand launched in 
2007, invented by a team at Princess Margaret Rose Hospital in Edinburgh and manufactured by Touch 
Bionics, was the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. Other 
features of the hand include precision power, key grip modes, and a manually rotatable thumb that is 
passively operated by the wearer. Another example of robotic prosthetics is ReWalk Robotics’ prosthetic legs, 
which are bionic exoskeleton attachments that enable   paraplegics  to stand upright, walk, and climb stairs. 
 Customized Prosthetics 
 Some patients see a prosthesis as a chance to alter their body in a new and unique way. For example, Chef 
Eduardo Garcia, who lost his arm in a hiking accident, has experimented with several different prosthetic 
substitutes that allow him to continue his passion of cooking. As a bionic chef, he has to be careful when 
selecting what type of prosthetic to wear, because he is constantly exposing it to water, heat from a stove, 
and cold from a freezer. However, he is also interested in exploring potential benefits of an artificial limb that 
could replace his built-in senses. He dreams of a limb that could detect pH and bacteria levels in the food he 
comes into contact with and display the results on an LED screen. His dream device would also be able to 
provide sensory feedback about temperature and texture. His current mechanical hand attachments include 
a hook that can expand to act as tongs to lift the lid on a pot. This may bring to mind Edward Scissorhands, 
a fictional character whose hands were literally scissors that he could use to trim bushes and cut through 
many different materials. He also has a myoelectric arm that can control 25 different functions via Bluetooth 
from a smartphone. 
 Another chance to  customize prosthetics is the design of the outer shell. Because it can be made from 
synthetic materials, there is no need to make it blend in with the rest of the body; some designers are taking 
prosthetic design in a new direction. Alleles Design Studio is a Canadian company specializing in high-
fashion prosthetic covers. The inspiration came from a research project by cofounder McCauley Wanner 
during her thesis project for her industrial design degree. Wanner found a gap in the prosthetics market 
for fashionable options. Most companies focused on function rather than aesthetics, leaving the consumer 
with few, if any, customizable options. Wanner interviewed many amputees and doctors and knew that she 
wasn’t the only one who wanted to spice up these artificial limbs. Many amputees want to draw attention 
to their artificial limbs and are constantly trying to find unique ways to do so. For example, some want to 
customize them by imprinting a nostalgic image, a bit like getting a tattoo for an artificial limb. 
 Alleles Design Studio is working to fill this gap by creating affordable, customizable prosthetic covers. It 
currently only designs leg covers and has a few different collections people can choose from; the company 
also offers custom designs for those who are looking for something different. Alleles plans to release about 
two collections per year and keep the cost of the product in the $200–$400 range. Figure  13-6 shows a leg 
cover from the Racer collection. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
158
 Open Bionics 
 The Enable Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping people design and 3D-print bionic hands, 
was mentioned in Chapter   11 . Another company working in this realm is Open Bionics. It has developed 
a prosthetic hand model composed of four lightweight 3D-printed parts that can be produced in about 40 
hours. The current wait time for artificial limbs can range from weeks to months. Additionally, prostheses 
can cost thousands of dollars, whereas this one costs less than $100. The Open Bionics hand, which also 
plans to go fully open source, uses EMG sensors attached to the amputee’s skin to provide individual finger 
movement such as opening and closing the fingers. 
 Similar to Alleles,  Open Bionics is concerned with the wearer’s aesthetic preferences. In order to 
increase the company’s reach, it has released a line of superhero-themed bionics to appeal to children. The 
line includes a Jedi lightsaber hand that lights up and a hand with blue sparkles modeled after Elsa, the main 
character in Disney’s hit movie  Frozen . 
 Superhuman Bionics 
 So far, you have seen bionics and prosthetics that fit in the restorative category, but not prosthetics that are 
designed to enhance human capabilities. One approach to enhancing prosthetics is to embed them with 
small gadgets and devices. For example, instead of wearing a smartwatch, you could have it built into a 
prosthetic arm. Computer programmer Jerry Jalava has a prosthetic finger after losing his in a motorcycle 
accident. He decided to add a new function to his prosthetic and has a 2.0 GB USB port installed in the 
finger. The drive does not upload information to his body, but it certainly must come in handy when Jalava 
needs to store information.

CHAPTER 13 ■ SUPERHUMANS AND CYBORGS
159
 However, not all bionics are designed for people who have lost a bodily function; others are designed 
to enhance the average person’s functionality. Some of these were presented in Chapter   2 , including 
superhero exoskeleton technologies. A collaborative project between researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
University and North Carolina State University released last year offered a different kind of exoskeleton that 
is not electrically powered but, rather, is purely mechanical. It is an ankle attachment that helps people walk 
using less energy. Studies show that people spend more energy walking than in any other daily activity. This 
energy, of course, becomes more precious as people become older or develop mobility issues. This system 
is said to reduce the metabolic cost of walking by about 7%. This difference equates to taking off a 10-pound 
backpack while walking around. The device is composed of a mechanical clutch that engages when the foot 
makes contact with the ground, and disengages when the foot is lifted into the air. The clutch replaces the 
function of the calf muscle in this motion, providing the force needed to launch the body forward without 
consuming any energy. This in turn decreases the overall metabolic rate of the activity.    
 Summary 
 This is perhaps the most graphic chapter of this book thus far, focusing more on fringe wearable projects 
in the medical, art, and cyborg enthusiast realms. Naturally, there will be curious researchers who try 
unconventional techniques and push things to the limit to see what is possible. Some of these efforts have 
led to breakthroughs in medical technologies, while others are perhaps a bit ahead of their time and have 
not shown any life-changing applications for the average person. Nonetheless, these experiments are 
crucial to understanding how these wearable technologies could alter people’s interactions with the world. 
A magnetic finger implant may not seems like much more than a strange party trick, but the way the brain 
processes the information from the magnet shows that humans can quickly expand their existing senses 
and potentially form new ones. The last chapter   16 elaborates on the potential risks and challenges of a 
wearables-driven world.

 CHAPTER 14  
 Activated Garments 
 This is perhaps the chapter you have been waiting for: what are fashion designers doing with technology? 
How can technology actually be integrated into clothes and accessories? What do these clothes look like, 
and how do they fit? These are important details when imagining the future for wearables. You have seen 
several wearable devices that match different styles and trends, but mostly from a functionality perspective 
of the wearable, rather than an aesthetic perspective. 
 Often, the “fashion” aspect of wearables feels like an afterthought. A tech company finds a fashion 
label or brand to make the device wearer-friendly, but the focus is really the accuracy of the engineering 
design, not the fashion design. Not all wearables are created this way, of course; many adventurous fashion 
designers want to work with technology and initiate a collaboration or partnership with technologists 
and engineers. Some of these designers research and develop their own techniques and methods for 
fitting electronics into their envisioned garments. A few of these projects have resulted in toolsets that are 
commercially available, as discussed in Chapter   6 . 
 This chapter presents the latter approach: what happens when designers treat electronics as ingredients 
for their collections. How does fashion design change when the toolset is expanded from the thread, fabrics, 
and buttons discussed in Chapter   4 to a collection of electronic components? The designer is not limited to 
one set of colors, textures, and materials; these are all factors that can be changed from an app or in response 
to sensors embedded in the garment. For example, using a programmable LED to set the color of the fabric 
on a shirt means the shirt can shine green one day and blue the next. A fashion designer must decide how 
the garment responds and adapts to the wearer. Fashion designers are using electronics to add not only 
another wave of style, but another layer of interaction. They are literally  activating clothing . 
 Fashion for Safety 
 In 2005, Anna Haupt and Terese Alstin were studying industrial design at the University of Lund in Sweden, 
when a law was passed that made helmets mandatory for all cyclists under the age of 15. As debates brewed 
about whether this law should be extended to adults, the team saw this as an opportunity to redesign the 
helmet. The problem they foresaw was that most adults do not prefer to wear helmets. Some think they are 
too cumbersome to carry around, and others may not want to wear them because they don’t match an outfit. 
Whatever the reason, these hesitations result in a huge safety risk. Haupt and Alstin designed an  inflatable 
helmet  that sits as a collar around the wearer’s neck until triggered, at which point it inflates to encapsulate 
the wearer’s head, protecting the wearer from potential harm. Figure  14-1 shows the helmet before and 
after it has been triggered. The device, much like an airbag in a car, has several built-in sensors that trigger 
inflation when they sense impact or a sudden change in speed and orientation. The design has won several 
awards and led to the development of their company   Hövding , which manufactures and sells the helmets 
worldwide. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ACTIVATED GARMENTS
162
 Once inflated, the helmet covers a larger area than a tradition bicycle helmet. Additionally, it provides 
soft and gentle shock absorption on impact. The air pressure in the helmet stays constant for several seconds 
after impact, ensuring that it can remain effective from multiple impacts that may result from a single 
accident. The gas inflator uses helium and is responsible for the bulk of the weight; it rests on the rider’s 
back. It is ergonomically designed with even weight distribution across the shoulders. 
 The helmet collar is made from ultra-strong nylon fabric that doesn’t rip when scraped against the 
ground. It is waterproof and provides great protection for the built-in airbag system. The collar itself is 
not washable but is encased in a shell that can be washed. This shell protects the collar from sweat and 
dirt. The shells come in several different colors, allowing the user to personalize the item and choose their 
preferred shell. 
 A similar product is the   In&motion   ski vest. The vest contains an inflatable airbag that inflates before the 
skier makes contact with the ground during an accident. The  In&motion system   also analyzes data collected at 
the time of the fall and sends this to the user to help them better understand the causes of the accident. 
 To Safely Reach Your Destination 
 An interesting concept that has appeared in science fiction stories as well as design theory is the idea 
of self-navigating shoes. These are shoes that have little vibration motors around the heels, one on the 
left shoe and one on the right shoe. The shoes are synced with mapping software that tells the shoes 
which direction you need to turn while walking to a destination. If the wearer has to turn left, the motor 
on the left shoe vibrates; similarly, turning right is indicated by a vibration from the right shoe. Indian 
company   Ducere Technologies   has taken this concept to market under the brand name Lechal and 
is manufacturing stylish navigating shoes for both men and women. The company also sell insoles to 
convert normal shoes into   haptic shoes . A portion of each sale of a pair of shoes goes into the Lechal 
Initiative, an organization that subsidizes the cost of the shoes for visually impaired people who cannot 
afford them at full price.

 No Contact Jacket 
 Every woman has had the experience of walking alone at night and feeling uneasy about her safety. 
(Although men may also experience this feeling of vulnerability, it is unfortunately more common for 
women to be in danger.) The  No Contact Jacket was created in 2003 by industrial designer Adam Whiton and 
apparel designer Yolita Nugent in attempt to provide an extra layer of comfort and protection. It is a stylish, 
sporty woman’s outerwear garment with a secret power: it can repel an assailant with 80,000-volt shock! 
The shock is not lethal, but it is certainly enough to make a person take a few steps back, not to mention the 
side effects of disorientation, discomfort, and loss of balance. The wearer of the jacket is protected from the 
electrical charge by insulation, enabling her to escape. 
 The jacket is composed of several layers; the innermost layer is made from a conductive fiber and 
powered by a 9-volt battery. The battery is connected to a circuit that allows it to build up a high-voltage, 
low-amp charge, similar to the technology used in commercial stun guns. To activate the jacket, or charge 
it up, a small lock on the outer sleeve is opened using a key. Next, the wearer must press a button, which is 
attached by a cord to the inside of the sleeve so that she can easily hold it in her palm. This charging process 
may take a few minutes, so the ideal use case involves preactivating the jacket in situations where a woman 
may feel at risk. This way, she can feel confident and secured against any surprise attacks. However, it was 
found that even when the jacket is not activated, audible crackle sounds and visible electric arcs serve as a 
sufficient warning that the jacket is dangerous. 
 The jacket was prototyped in petite sizes so that men would have a hard time trying to use it against 
women in the event that the jacket was stolen. The team chose to embed the technology in a jacket over 
other articles of clothing to ensure that the woman can always have it with her, if not on her—in other 
words, they wanted an item that the women would use on a daily basis. The cost of the jacket on a small 
manufacturing scale was estimated to be about $1,000. 
 The team continues to work in the realm of creating new wearable technology for defense and 
protection. Nugent also founded R4R and manufactures conductive ribbon (invented for this project), which 
was discussed in Chapter   7 .  
 Fashion for Privacy 
 Smartwatches and phones are not the only way to carry information on your body. Data chips can be 
embedded in almost anything. As you saw in Chapter   13  , they are even placed in prosthetics! One issue 
that arises with all of this data storage is security. If your phone or smartwatch is stolen, the device is 
not the only thing you lose; the new owner also has access to your passwords, message logs, and more. 
Fortunately, there are many systems in place to lock a device as soon as it goes missing, making it 
impossible to break into—but sometimes it may already be too late. 
 One way to protect your digital  information is to make it less detectable. This is the approach Susan 
McGregor took when designing  Hiding in Plain Sight . The project incorporates USB keys into wearable 
accessories like jewelry, where they are invisible from the outside. This gives the wearer an increased sense 
of privacy and security. McGregor also wanted the project to be accessible to those who may not consider 
themselves technically savvy. The use of jewelry and other common accessories invites the user to explore 
other places and tools for storing information, taking the high-tech process of protecting data and making it 
simpler and more personal. A necklace with a USB drive hidden in the gems is shown in Figure  14-2 .

 Emotional Style 
 Chapter   11 presented wearable biotechnology that measures the wearer’s health or emotional state. The 
emotional state of the wearer is very important in fashion design. For one thing, clothing can develop a 
strong emotional and nostalgic purpose for the wearer. A brightly colored shirt worn on a memorable day 
may carry feelings of warmth and happiness. Several fashion houses across the world are exploring this 
potential of digitally enhanced wearables that connect more deeply to the wearer’s emotions. 
 Social Body Lab 
 The   Social Body Lab  , led by wearables expert Kate Hartman at the Ontario University of Art and Design, 
researches meaningful and provocative interactions between humans and technology. The lab develops 
prototypes and projects that combine playful speculations about the power of technology with wearable 
garments that manifest human values and desires. 
 In the project  Prosthetic Technologies of Being , the team collaborated with Jamie Sherman from Intel 
Research to explore ways in which technology can be manipulated to feel like an extension of the body. The 
prototypes in the series extend the wearer’s ability to sense their surrounding while providing a new output 
to express their emotional reactions. The first prototype, Monarch, is a  muscle-activated wearable   form that 
attaches to the shoulders. The form expands and contracts in response to the movement of the wearer’s 
arm muscles, as shown in Figure  14-3 . The physical extension provided by Monarch heightens the wearer’s 
personal expression.

CHAPTER 14 ■ ACTIVATED GARMENTS
165
 The second prototype, called  Nautilus , follows a similar theme of extending muscle movements and 
using them to trigger a change of shape in wearables. Nautilus takes the form of a wearable hood that covers 
the wearer’s head when triggered to create a sense of personal space and division from the outside world. 
This time, the sensors are placed along the neck to sense when the wearer is shrugging. The shrug activates 
servomotors embedded in the hood to raise the fabric around the head or bring it back down. 
 Cardinal  is the third  prototype created in collaboration with former lab artists in residence Erin 
Lewis and is in the form of a cape. Cardinal investigates how wearables can enhance the wearer’s sense of 
directional awareness and connectedness. The surface of the cape has designs made from thermochromatic 
ink (introduced in chapter   7 ) and is embedded with heating wire that changes the color of the designs. The 
heating wire is activated by a change of orientation of the wearer. When the wearer is facing the direction of 
their home, the colors change. The heating wire also provides a sensation of warmth to the wearer. 
 Other projects from  the  Social Body Lab are mentioned later in this chapter. You can also see 
documentation of their work online at   http://research.ocadu.ca/socialbody , including videos of the 
prototypes from  Prosthetic Technologies of Being . 
 HugShirt 
 CuteCircuit  is a London-based fashion house that has been at the cutting edge of wearable technology since 
its launch in 2004. Its clients include celebrities like Nicole Scherzinger and Katy Perry. Prior to founding 
CuteCircuit, founders Francesca Rosella and Ryan Genz collaborated on several projects including the 
HugShirt, a shirt that helps people send long-distance hugs. The  HugShirt   is a long-sleeved t-shirt embedded 
with sensors that measure the strength, duration, location, heartbeat, and skin temperature from a hug. 
This information is recorded and then transmitted via Bluetooth to the HugShirt app. Each HugShirt has a 
partner shirt, and the recorded hug from one shirt is sent the to partner shirt through the synced app. Thus 
sending a hug is no different from sending an email or text message from your smartphone.

 The goal of the shirt is to provide a more intimate human connection to the wearer when they are away from 
their friends and loved ones. It has been tested for various applications including medical studies with the elderly 
and children. Studies show that people are happier when they receive physical contact from each other. The shirt 
has been remade several times with improvements to the technology. It is rechargeable and washable.  
 No(where)Now(here) 
 Montreal-based fashion designer and professor   Ying Gao  works at the intersection between fashion and 
technology. In her project  (No)where(Now)here , she created two interactive dresses that are made with 
photoluminescent thread (described in Chapter   6 ) that glows in the dark, and super-lightweight organza. 
The dresses are embedded with eye-tracking technology that triggers the dresses to move when someone 
is looking at them. The inspiration for the dress came from Paul Virilio’s essay entitled “Esthétique de 
la disparition” (“The aesthetic of disappearance”), which questions the concepts of appearance and 
disappearance. As Gao explains, “A photograph is said to be ‘spoiled’ by blinking eyes—here … the 
experience of chiaroscuro (clarity/obscurity) is achieved through an unfixed gaze.” The photoluminescent 
thread illuminates the dresses when they are in the dark. One of the dresses is shown in Figure  14-4 , but I 
recommend watching the video to understand the movement and interaction of the dresses. The video can 
be accessed online at   http://yinggao.ca/eng/interactifs/nowhere-nowhere .

167
 Studio XO 
 Another fashion house that is making a big splash in wearable technologies is London-based    Studio XO  . 
 Studio XO is led by fashion designer Nancy Tilbury and creative technologist Benjamin Males, who are 
interested in taking science-fiction fantasies to a new level with fashion and technology. Their process 
involves a speculative approach in which they envision a concept and build a narrative around it, helping 
them bring their visions to life in a believable form. In 2006, Tilbury was part of a team at Phillips Electronics, 
led by body architect Lucy McRae, who created the iconic Bubelle Dress. The dress responds to the wearer’s 
emotional state by blushing. An inner layer is embedded with biometric sensors. These readings are then 
projected onto a second layer of fabric, mapping the wearer’s mood to color and light patterns that result in a 
change of appearance and style of the actual dress. 
 Tilbury was contacted by artist Lady Gaga and her technical department, TechHaus, who were 
enamored with the Bubelle Dress. They commissioned the team to make several dresses for Gaga’s ARTPOP 
campaign. Although all of these dresses share a wildly new and interesting aesthetic, one stands out among 
the others: Volantis is a dress that can literally fly! Using six drones attached to a taller middle stem structure, 
the team was able to create a wearable costume that Lady Gaga can step into and be propelled from the 
ground; the dress is steered by the pilots of the drones. 
 In addition to Lady Gaga, Studio XO works with several artists and performers including the Black Eyed 
Peas and Wayne McGregor. They have expanded into a collective of fashion designers, engineers, material 
scientists, and product designers. Their work centers on the theme of connected bodies, using technology 
to expand the emotional intimacy of fashion. The team believes that authentic fashion shares the desire to 
create a spectacle. 
 Their current endeavor, called XOB, works to use their network of high-fashion celebrities as icons for 
the general public to become interested in and engaged with the future of fashion. XOB is a ready-to-wear 
fashion label that uses biotechnology in the form of digitized skin. As Tilbury explains, their goal is to take 
these clothes from the stage and offer them to the people. While watching fans take photos of the clothing 
they had designed for a Black Eyed Peas performance, Tilbury and Males realized they could harness this 
enthusiasm to create connected clothing for everyone, not just celebrities. The line uses Studio XO’s own 
emotional sensor technology, called XOX, which is said to be able to read the wearer’s psychic state. XOB 
is intended to serve as a platform for other brands and designers to use in their collections. The team 
ultimately wants to teach and spread the concept of  digital skin throughout the world. Digital skin goes 
beyond dresses and shoes embedded with LEDs to a more connected level, where the lights have function 
and can download and display information. 
 McRae has also continued to make incredible works combing science fiction, fashion, and speculative 
design, which you can see on her web site at    www.lucymcrae.net  . 
 Chromat 
 Chromat , a fashion house led by designer Becca McCharen, was mentioned in Chapter   3 . This section 
revisits it to take a closer look at some of the interactive apparel it has created. Many of  Chromat’s   garments 
combine 3D-printed forms with electronics to create interactive garments. Chromat’s current work centers 
around creating a fierce, bold image for women with an obvious underlying theme of “girl power.” In 
addition to its consumer brand, Chromat has worked with many artists to create custom outfits, including 
Nicki Minaj and Beyonce. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ACTIVATED GARMENTS
168
 Following are examples of Chromat’s work:
• 
 Adrenaline Dress : Composed of 3D-printed panels and a carbon-fiber framework 
that can expand and contract. The back view of the frame and dress in a resting 
pose is shown in Figure  14-5 . If the structure becomes activated, this lattice can 
morph into other, more provocative, forms. The garment is embedded with sensors 
that can sense adrenaline, triggering the carbon fibers to form an imposing shape. 
The project was inspired by biomimicry and fight-or-flight mode behavior, which 
describes an animal’s physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived 
  harmful event  ,   attack  , or threat to survival. During this reaction, hormones such as 
adrenaline increase at a measurable rate.

• 
 Laser Chakra Dress : Another 3D-printed dress. This piece is embedded with laser 
diodes that simulate synthetic neuron connections in the brain. Laser ports are 
positioned at the seven  chakra points on the body, representing energy vortexes. 
Optical amplification from the lasers serves as a physical representation for these 
chakra points on the dress. The word  chakra translates to “wheel” in Sanskrit and is 
believed to be a part of the body that represents the center of spiritual power. It is used 
in many forms of meditation, such as yoga, to help focus the practitioner’s energy.  
• 
 Bionic Bodies collection: Embodies the story of a love affair between a human and a 
robot. As McCharen explains, the collection was inspired by people’s obsession with 
screens and technology. The garments attempt to provide the experience of going 
into the screen, or digital realm, by covering clothes in LED lights and metal. The 
final pieces are covered with rings of LED lights that were inspired by global energy 
usage topographies and interactive maps of web sites like Tweetping and Reddit.    
 Other projects and products can be seen on Chromat’s web site:    www.chromat.co  . 
 Environmentally Reactive 
 Activated clothing can really make a statement when compared to “in-activated” clothing. Covering an 
outfit with lights and motors obviously stands out in a crowd of plain cotton and denim. Activated clothing 
does not always imply garments covered in bright lights, however sometimes they are more subtle and only 
visible in certain conditions. 
 Sparkle Booties 
 CuteCircuit’s Sparkle Booties may look like typical fashionable stiletto-heeled boots, but when hit with direct 
light, they reveal a special power. The leather of the shoe is coated with reflective micro-perforated fabric 
containing thousands of glass microspheres that illuminate the surface of the shoe. Figure  14-6 shows the 
shoes after they have been triggered by light. CuteCircuit recently teamed up with EasyJet to redesign the 
airline’s cabin/crew outfits. The flight attendants’ new uniform includes a pair of Sparkle Booties so that they 
can illuminate the plane’s corridors! The shoes are available in several different sizes and retail for 600 £.

 Dissolving Clothes 
 Hussein Chalayan, one of the leading innovators in fashion design, unveiled a new creation at the spring 
2016 Paris fashion show at Palais des Beaux-Arts. At the finale of the show, two models stood on a stage 
wearing stiff-collared, thigh-length overcoats. A portion of the ceiling was punctured by holes above the 
models that began to shower the models with water. As the water made contact with the coats, they began to 
dissolve and melt away, revealing patterned dresses lined with Swarovski crystals! The jackets were made of 
a paper-based material that disintegrated when exposed to water. 
 The concept is obviously not very practical, although many potential user scenarios come to mind. For 
example, what if, when you jumped into a pool, your shorts and t-shirt disappeared, leaving you with only 
a bathing suit? You wouldn’t get that pair of shorts or t-shirt back—they would have totally disintegrated. 
Chalayan’s goal was to make a commentary on how disposable fashion has become. And what better venue 
to make this statement than at a show where everyone is on the edge of their seats waiting for a fresh new 
look to be unveiled? 
 Wearable Façade 
 Wearable Façade is a project by design research studio   POPKALAB  for the Connecting Cities network. 
Connecting Cities was initiated by Public Art Lab in Berlin to create a connected infrastructure of media 
facades, urban screens, and projection sites to circulate artistic and social content. It has now become a 
worldwide network. 
 The project was inspired by the increasingly number of  media facades that are being installed in cities 
around the world. Giant LED screens cover buildings and line walls that surround roads and parks. Almost 
every big city has a Times Square full of these media displays. In cities like Hong Kong, most of the building 
are lit up.  Wearable Façade builds on this idea of using buildings to display information and reapplies it to 
fashion. In a sense, wearables media facades are even more influential because they are always updating 
based on their surroundings. They are smaller, mobile, and more accessible when displayed on a person 
rather than a building. 
 Wearable Façade is a garment embedded with a micro-camera and LED display that captures the colors 
and shapes of the wearer’s environment and translates them into computer-generated patterns displayed by 
the LEDs. As the wearer walks through a city,  Wearable Façade provides a reflection of the architecture and 
patterns recorded by the camera. The display offers a new perspective on the wearer’s surrounding that is 
not static like a printed imaged on a billboard, but rather dynamic and animated with lights.   
 Garments as Interfaces 
 The concept of using a garment as an interface was mentioned in previous chapters. Although  Wearable 
Façade is environmentally reactive, it could be seen as a wearable interface for advertising. Chapter   3 
discussed Google’s Project Jacquard, where researchers are working to create a new type of fabric interface 
that can be connected to existing hardware and electronics. Some designers are already putting this concept 
into practice, effectively creating garments that serve as an interface. 
 Digitizing Shoes 
 In the early 1990s, light-up sneakers were a must have for children everywhere. Popularized by the brand 
LA Lights, a product of American shoe company LA Gear, about 5 million pairs of these shoes were sold 
each year in the 1990s. LA Gear was not even the only brand selling such shoes, although it had the highest 
distribution channels. Light-up shoes have been one of the most successful products in the history of the 
athletic shoe industry, with more than 100 million pairs sold. Lights are still a popular feature of shoes, 
especially for children, but other outputs are also possible. Designers are experimenting with new ways to 
add interactivity to shoes. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ ACTIVATED GARMENTS
171
 POPKALAB just released  Sound Steps : a pair of multitech shoes that produce sounds and music through 
the wearer’s movements. The project was created in collaboration with   Phonotonic  and   Stephane Gontard  . 
The music is broadcast through a built-in speaker in the shoe that synchronizes with each step. The sound 
is customizable and can be changed by the user. The goal of  Sound Steps was to create a product that 
democratizes the creation of music through a more ubiquitous outlet: shoes. 
 Nudgeables Accessory Kit 
 The Social Body Lab’s (mentioned earlier) director Kate Hartman has designed several interactive wearable 
projects that she has expanded on with her research group. One of these projects, called the  Nudgeables 
Accessory Kit  , provides a customizable, secret communication tool. Hartman’s motivation for the project 
was to find a way for clothing to communicate secret messages. Her solution is a modular hardware kit with 
an XBee radio transceiver called the Nudger and a receiver called the Notifier that enable a pair of people to 
nudge each other from across a room. The communication distance is limited by the bandwidth of the XBee. 
 The  Nudgeables Accessory Kit can be embedded into a variety of different wearables such as headbands, 
scarves, and ties. The web site offers some ideas and tutorials on how to best attach the hardware to different 
materials. To trigger the Nudger, the wearer must push a button or other type of switch. The kit comes with 
a small push button that could be embedded into clothing, although the guide explains how to make your 
own switches out of conductive fabrics, much like the projects in Chapter   5 . This is perhaps the most 
interesting part of the kit, because it encourages the user to design a personalized switch for their clothes. 
For example, someone who plays with their hair may want to embed the switch in a headband or barrette, 
whereas a person who adjusts their necktie may prefer to hide the switch in the tie. It is important to find 
a gesture or interaction that comes naturally, so as not to draw attention to yourself when you are nudging 
or being nudged.     
 The notifier delivers an output signal that can be connected to a small vibration motor or LED light. 
Depending on the application of the nudgeable, the wearer must decide if they prefer a visible notifier 
or more discreet nudge from the pulse of the motor. Additionally, the pair can develop a communication 
system around the nudges. A series of short nudges could be code for “Let’s go home,” and a single nudge 
could simply translate into “Hello.” 
 TshirtOS 
 Imagine a t-shirt that had the ability to transform into hundreds of other shirts. How could this be possible? 
One way to achieve this is to create a shirt with a dynamic display that can be programmed on a daily, 
hourly, or even minute-by-minute basis. The outer border fabric of the shirt stays the same, but it’s like 
owning hundred of graphic t-shirts in one! 
 TshirtOS is a t-shirt embedded with a flexible, washable, 1,024-color LED matrix arranged in a 32×32 
grid (see Figure  14-7 ). But that’s not all: the LED matrix is Bluetooth enabled, meaning you can set the 
pattern for the shirt from your phone; it also has built-in Twitter integration. You can program the shirt 
to display an animation, tweets from a Twitter feed, a simple message, or any other image you choose 
to input. It’s a wearable platform for self expression. Features of the LED screen include brightness 
adjustment and flexibility. It also includes a built-in micro-camera, a microphone, an accelerometer, and 
speakers for other potential applications. For example, the shirt may react to the wearer’s movements or 
a sound in the environment. The battery powering the LED panel lasts a few days once charged. TshirtOS 
was invented and developed by CuteCircuit, and the first units of the product were used for an advertising 
campaign by Scottish whisky label Ballantine’s. It has now been brought to market by CuteCircuit and 
renamed InfiniTshirt.

 M-Dress 
 The  M-Dress , or  mobile dress , is another project by CuteCircuit that transforms clothing into an interface. 
The dress was conceived from the realization that most women’s clothing does not have a place to hold 
a phone, like a pocket or pouch. This leads to many missed calls, extra accessories like a purse to hold a 
phone, and other inconveniences. CuteCircuit has designed a solution to this problem by embedding the 
phone in the dress itself! 
 The wearer inserts a SIM card in a slot under the label, and the dress can then receive calls to the 
wearer’s mobile phone number. When the phone rings, the dress actually rings. It can even be programmed 
to produce different ring tones for different numbers. Custom gesture recognition software, developed by 
CuteCircuit, controls the hardware embedded in the dress. The simple gesture of bringing your palm to your 
ear activates a sensor that answers the call; bringing the palm away from the ear functions to hang up the 
call. As for making calls, the phone book can only store a few numbers. The dress is made from an elegant 
silk jersey material, and all the electronics are concealed. 
 Mirror Handbag 
 Another eye-catching accessory by CuteCircuit is the  Mirror Handbag . It is made out of solid brass coated in 
a noble metal finish of ruthenium, palladium, or gold. The surfaces of the bag are made from a layer of laser-
etched acrylic mirror that cover a matrix of white LEDS that shine through the mirror to create a dynamic 
light display. The LEDs can be programmed to display messages, tweets, and animations via Bluetooth 
though CuteCircuit’s Q app. The bag is rechargeable via USB and retails for 1,600 £.     
 Illuminated Garments 
 Many other top fashion designers have debuted  illuminated clothing   over the last few decades. Unfortunately, 
a single chapter cannot present them all. If you are interested, there are books dedicated to cataloging these 
impressive creations. Following is a list of designers and brands with particularly interesting or beautiful 
pieces that are worth investigating:

 Summary 
 The inspirational pieces presented in this chapter may make you want to get straight to the studio and 
the drawing board. The concept of adding emotional and environmentally reactive functions to clothing 
is very exciting. If you look at clothing as a second layer of skin, it is natural to want to activate this skin in 
the same way as the first layer (that is, the skin on your body). Skin reacts to temperature and light, and 
it may tense up when you are afraid and smooth out when you are relaxed. What if your clothes could 
also behave this way—would they feel more natural? This chapter reviewed several examples of how 
clothing can enhance the wearer’s body and experiences in meaningful ways, but in the end these are 
unique personal experiences. Every user, or wearer, has a different idea of what they’d like their clothes to 
be able to do and how their clothes could come to life. With initiatives like Studio XO’s XOB, you may be 
able to share and collaborate on these ideas in the future, leading to an enormous collection, or closet, of 
dynamic and active clothing. 
 The next chapter, by guest author Dr. Kate Sicchio, expands on the use of wearables for aesthetic and 
design purposes to show how they are used in performance and costume. Dr. Sicchio is an award-winning 
media artist, choreographer, and performer whose work explores the interface between choreography and 
technology. She presents the history of the use of new technologies in performance and provides an outlook 
on how to design and develop new interactions and relationships in this realm.

 CHAPTER 15  
 Wearable Costumes 
 Guest Chapter by Kate Sicchio 
 Since the 1960s, performing artists and creative engineers have embedded various wearable technologies 
into costumes for performance. From dance to music and theatre, the idea of digital interfaces that use the 
body spans many disciplines and works. In these performances there is usually a performer who is somehow 
either triggering or responding to a wearable device on their body. For example, a musician may wear gloves 
with bend sensors in them. When they bend their fingers, they can trigger a sound from a synth or a sample 
in a music software package. Instead of playing a traditional instrument, they are playing music through 
their own gestures. Figure  15-1 shows a  costume housing biosensors  for a performance at a music festival. 
Often this is thought of as interactive performance because it is allowing the performer a new way of creating 
the performance through interactive technologies.

CHAPTER 15 ■ WEARABLE COSTUMES
176
 A range of performing artists have explored wearables, including Troika Ranch, Johannes Birringer 
and Michele Danjoux, Julie Bokoweic and Mark Bokowiec, Palindrome Intermedia Group, Amanda Parkes, 
Imogen Heap, Stelarc, Georg Hobmeier, Camille Baker, and others. This chapter aims to explore what kind of 
wearable technology is found in performance and costumes, which artists have used these types of devices 
in their work, and ways to incorporate wearables into interactive performances. 
 What Kinds of Wearables Are Found in Performance? 
 When exploring wearables in  performance , there are a few general categories that most costumes and 
interactive designs fall into. These includes sensing systems, actuating systems, and energy-harvesting 
systems. All have different approaches and purposes for use in performance and artistic considerations. 
 First are  sensing systems , which sense or measure some aspect of the body as an input to an interactive 
system. This encompasses a lot of the work with wearables and performance. This could be in the form 
of biological sensors (heart rate, breath rate, temperature, galvanization, brainwaves), motion sensing 
(accelerometers, gyroscopes, flexion), touch (pressure, location), or combinations of these sensing 
techniques. Often the sensor is somehow controlling another aspect of the performance, such as the music, 
video projections, or even the stage lighting. These systems are often designed with the idea of the body 
somehow controlling aspects of the performance through the wearable. 
 There are also systems designed to  actuate and output to the body . This means a device is somehow 
creating a physical sensation on the body of the performer. This may include haptic feedback systems 
(vibrations, small motors), audio systems (speakers embedded in costumes), lights (LEDs, El wire), or, 
in the case of some avant-garde performance art, electrical impulses (electric shocks that stimulate muscle 
movement). As outputs, LEDs have become a popular way of costuming performers because they make a 
theatrical statement with their bright colors and impressive patterns onstage. However, the area of haptic 
feedback in performance is growing as a way of working with dancers and other participants in different 
artworks. 
 Finally, there have been some performance works exploring the notion of  harvesting energy from the 
body. In these works, different techniques are used to capture the energy produced by performers and 
convert this into a power source. In these performances, the energy that is being harvested is often used to 
charge batteries, which then power the sound or light of the performance piece itself. 
 These three categories start to describe the technology that is often used in costumes and performance. 
How they are used becomes individualized to artists and often even individual artworks. By exploring artists 
and artworks more, how wearables can be embedded into costumes may become clearer. 
 Sensing Performers 
 In 1989, Mark Coniglio and Dawn Stoppiello (also known as Troika Ranch) started working with their initial 
sensor system at CalArts University. They created the  Midi Dancer system   as a way for dancers to control 
media in real time in dance and theatre performance. Midi Dancer focused on flex sensors on the joints 
of the body, including the wrists, knees, and elbows. It translated the amount of bend in these joints and 
wirelessly transmitted these as a MIDI (music protocol) signal. The amount of bend could then be translated 
into the dancer controlling sound, video, or other aspects of the performance. This was demonstrated in the 
1994 piece,  In Plane , where the sound, video projections, and a robotic set piece were all controlled by the 
performer’s movement of her joints. 
 Because Midi Dancer was designed to be used in various works (and the company dedicated ten 
years to working with various versions of this system), it was less of a costume and more of a collection of 
wearables that could be worn under costumes. There was a clear aesthetic decision to make the device 
subtle, rather than a unique costume itself. The flex sensors were embedded in  skin-tone cuffs made of 
stretch fabrics that slide over the elbows, knees, and wrists. These were then hard-wired to a belt, which sent 

CHAPTER 15 ■ WEARABLE COSTUMES
177
the sensor data wirelessly to a computer. Although there are now many options for wireless communication, 
this early sensor system was built before many of these protocols become available or became reliable for 
performance. 
 More recently, the musician Imogen Heap has developed a wearable sensor system based on  gloves 
for her live performances. The gloves have several sophisticated ways of sensing and are constructed 
using a variety of electronics and soft-circuit techniques. These includes flexion sensors in the fingers, 
accelerometers and gyroscopes in the wrists, as well as conductive fabric between fingers that detect how 
far each finger is from the next. The gloves themselves have had clear iterations, with the most recent 
versions using softer circuitry and conductive materials such as threads and fabrics to give them a lighter 
and more sophisticated appearance. The color has been considered as well in the most recent version, 
which has much more sense of being a costume beyond the practical functions of playing music. 
 In performance,  Heap sings , samples her voice, adds effects, and plays prerecorded tracks and samples, 
all by gesturing with her hands and fingers. Her use of this technology to play her music live has also 
influenced her song writing. Her latest song (written exclusively to be performed with the gloves) is entitled 
“Me and the Machine.” 
 Biophysical sensing , or sensing the different signals of the body, is another category of sensors often 
found in performance. This may include such sensors such as heartbeat monitors or respiratory-rate 
sensors. Biosensors can be of varying grades and used in various other fields including medicine and sports. 
However, there are ways of making DIY biosensors as well, such as using infrared LEDs to detect the pulse 
or crocheted breath sensors to detect the expansion of the rib cage. An example of this in performance is the 
work of Kate Sicchio and her  DIY breath sensor used in a solo dance piece in 2013, as shown in Figure  15-2 . 
 Figure 15-2.    A DIY crocheted breath (stretch) sensor by Kate Sicchio       
 

CHAPTER 15 ■ WEARABLE COSTUMES

 A combination of pink cotton yarn and conductive yarn are crocheted together to form a band that is 
worn in performance around the dancer’s rib cage. This specific sensor is attached to an  Arduino LilyPad 
as a microcontroller and a Bluetooth module to allow for wireless communication. The sensor captures the 
increase and decrease in size of the rib cage when the dancer breathes. It is not by any means a medical 
measurement of breath, but the change is great enough that it is recognizable and can be used to trigger and 
change other aspects of the performance. In this piece, it is used to change sound in the dance and influence 
the accompanying electronic music composition live. As a costume, this is an interesting piece because 
it looks like a cross between something your grandmother would make and a hacker would program. It 
contains a mixture of electronics, circuit boards, and bright pink yarn. It is also small enough that it can be 
worn over dance clothing or even under another costume piece to hide it. However, the choice to display 
the piece was very deliberate, because it allowed the audience insight into how the dancer was affecting the 
music in the performance. 
 Actuation, Haptics, and Performance 
 Another way of working with wearables in costumes is using the technology as an output device. This may 
include lighting up performers with  LEDs or providing haptic feedback through  small motors . In some ways, 
 actuation is the opposite of sensing technology, because it is providing something on the body or costume 
that is controlled or programmed externally from the performer yet complements or affects the performance. 
 LEDs and El wire have become a way to create a dramatic impact on the stage, particularly in dance 
performance. Figure  15-3 shows a pair of sneakers enhanced with strips of LEDs. Shows such as  Artist of Light  
by iLuminate (as seen on  America’s Got Talent , 2011) focus on lighting up unique patterns made on costumes 
with highly precise timing to create illusions and visual effects that help convey narratives as well as highlight the 
movement of the dancers. This works for a large visual impact and a theatrical effect for the audience that is very 
different from performances that aim to give control to performers through sensors as described previously.

CHAPTER 15 ■ WEARABLE COSTUMES
179
 Since 2013, Kate Sicchio and Camille Baker have been working with dancers and  haptic feedback   in 
costumes to convey choreographic instructions in their projects under the umbrella name of  Hacking the 
Body . They have designed wearables using soft circuits and crafting techniques, as well as collaborated 
with interactive designers such as Becky Stewart and fashion designers such as Tara Boath Mooney. In 
performances, dancers respond to sensations on their bodies ranging from vibrations from vibe boards 
(similar to vibrations found in mobile phones) to custom-made devices. These actuators are sometimes 
triggered by Sicchio in live-coded performances. Other times, sensors on the dancers activate them. 
 The newest work to première in 2016 for  Hacking the Body  is titled “Flutter/Stutter” and includes 
 custom-made fabric capacitance sensors and  custom haptic actuations . A still from the research and 
development phase can be seen in Figure  15-4 . These haptics are created using servomotors that tickle 
dancers with small strips of fabric on the back of each dancer’s neck. They are sewn into a shoulder piece 
worn by the dancers. There are also small vibe board motors embedded in another costume piece that 
is worn around the dancer’s waist. When wearing these brightly colored costumes, dancers respond to 
different sensations and feelings on their bodies that are created through the haptic feedback, and create 
an improvised dance. For example, the feeling of the tickle on their neck may cause the dancer to move 
their shoulders or use sudden or light quality in their movement. With a strong buzzing on their hip, they 
may move more dynamically and travel across the space, leading with that hip. The  haptic devices in the 
costumes on the body become triggers for the movement in the performance.

 Energy Harvesting  
 In Prue Lang’s ongoing collaboration with Amanda Parkes, titled  Un Réseau Translucide , they explore how 
to make a completely energy-efficient dance piece and only use energy created during the performance 
to power the lights and music. Or, as they say, they are “developing a choreographic system in which the 
performers also generate the electricity.” One of the systems in this work is the use of energy-harvesting 
shoes that collect energy through the use of piezoelectric materials. When performing with the shoes, 
one hour of dancing equals one minute of lights. Although energy harvesting is still not at a point where 
it is commercially viable, it is exciting to see this technology used in costumes and finding a purpose in a 
conceptual choreographic performance.

 Technology vs. Performance  
 In many performance pieces that use wearables, a common question arises: are the performers still making 
art, or are they simply demonstrating a cool new technology? In many of these works, the technology as 
well as the piece are both experimental in nature, and this is a grey area. However, when thinking about 
the overall concept and how wearables can be uses as a tool (rather than the centerpiece of the show), the 
gimmick of the wearable tends to fade away, and the wearable provides a much richer artistic experience for 
the audience. Many of the examples discussed in this chapter use the technology to serve the performance, 
rather than make a performance around a new wearable. This is key in considering how to start using 
wearables in costumes and interactive performance. 
 How to Design Wearable Sensors for Performance 
 When working with sensors in  performance , it is good to think about these guidelines: choosing a sensor, 
designing for the body, what the sensor will control, and devising and choreographing for the sensor. These 
may not necessarily happen in this order all the time. You may realize through devising the performance that 
the sensor needs to be located on a different part of the body. But by working through these concepts, you 
will find various ways to put sensors into performance works. 
 1. Choose a Sensor 
 Think about what are you sensing. Is it a biosensor that is tracking a biological signal of a performer, 
such as their heart rate? Or are you trying to capture movement and need an accelerometer or gyroscope? 
Many types of sensors are available, so work with one that is going to capture the information you want from 
your performers. 
 2. Design for the Body 
 Depending on what you are sensing, the location of the sensor on the performer’s body or embedded in 
the costume may become critical. For example, most biological sensors have specific locations on the body 
where they work best, and some must be touching the skin of the person being sensed. Other sensors react 
differently and have different ranges of data depending where they are placed on the body. A flex sensor may 
only get a small range of changing numbers on the spine, but senses a wider amount of movement on the 
elbow because of the differences in the biomechanics of these body parts. 
 3. Decide What the Sensor Will Control 
 Once you know what sensor you are using and how it will be placed on the body, think about what this 
sensor is controlling in the performance. Is it manipulating sound? It is changing a video projection? 
Do the lights activate with the sensor? To connect your sensor to these other media, you may need to 
consider specialized software such as Isadora, MaxMSP, or Processing. 

CHAPTER 15 ■ WEARABLE COSTUMES
182
 4. Devising and Choreographing the Sensor 
 Another important consideration is the actions of the performer. Do not take this for granted! If you are 
making a meaningful performance and not a demonstration of technology, the movement and intentions 
behind the work must be considered. Making a performer run aimlessly just to generate accelerometer data 
is not going to be a poetic or interesting performance for an audience. Consider this when working with 
sensor systems so that the performance is just as involved in the technical process as the making or sensors 
or the media it controls. 
 5. Repeating Is Necessary 
 Iteration in the process of using sensing systems in performance is a necessity. Be prepared to make changes 
and several prototypes before the overall performance is finalized. Do not bring a system to a performer and 
expect them to create magic with it without discussion and the possibility of making significant changes. 
You are not just making a costume—you are creating the opportunity for new performance systems to emerge.  
 Summary 
 This chapter explored how wearable technology may be used in costumes and performing arts. It gave an 
overview of sensing systems, actuating systems, and energy-harvesting systems and some of the different 
approaches and uses in performance for these technologies, as well as artistic considerations when using 
wearable devices. You saw various examples of artists and customs that use technology in new ways and tips 
to approaching this work yourself when designing wearable technology for stage performance.

 CHAPTER 16  
 Speculations on Wearable Futures                          
 From health trackers to digital makeup, this section of the book has explored many different practices 
that are embracing wearables in creative ways. There are certainly others that I have not touched on, but 
hopefully this has been a diverse and informative sampling of how different schools of thought are adapting 
to the rise of wearable technology. Reflecting on all this, you are now in a position to speculate about how 
these new devices will mesh with social structures and culture. What will it take for this technology to 
become as ubiquitous and seemingly necessary as the World Wide Web? Today it is hard to imagine a world 
without the Internet, even though the Internet did not really extend globally until recently, and there are 
still parts of the world where life goes on completely off the grid. Will the same attitudes one day apply to 
clothing? Will vintage clothes and accessories no long seem attractive and unique, but rather antiquated 
and inferior? 
 This last chapter features some truly futuristic fashion and speculates about how humans’ relationship to 
wearables will change over time. These changes will not only occur in a personal level; the entire infrastructure 
around making, selling, and buying clothes will be affected. Let’s look at some possible and probable trends in 
the near future and speculate about how this will trickle into other areas of the wearable world. 
 Fashion Pioneers 
 This section highlights two fashion designers who have been at the cutting-edge of new design and 
innovation for years. A look at their recent collections may help forecast the trends of the future. 
 Hussein Chalayan 
 The  Turkish-Cypriot designer Hussein Chalayan has been at the forefront of reinventing fashion for decades. 
Chalayan’s work borders between fashion, theater, and art, and his runway shows are always designed as 
 theatrical performances involving these elements. The dissolving dresses mentioned in Chapter   14 are 
just one example of his incredible, astute perspective. Chalayan credits his perceptiveness to his general 
boredom with the world around him; he works to create objects that make the world more interesting. As he 
explains, “The way I see it, everything in fashion has been done over and over again … the only way you can 
do something new is by using technology.” 
 Chalayan uses  technology and new materials in much of his work. His pieces and shows are planned 
and executed so carefully that the audience is able to perceive how Chalayan is creating an entire narrative 
with each piece; he is writing the story and creating the set and the characters. 
 In 2000, he presented his  Before Minus Now collection, which featured the Remote Control dress: 
the first wireless device to be presented as a fully functioning fashion garment. The dress is composed of 
fiberglass and resin cast in a custom mold and is shown in Figure  16-1 . The side and rear of the dress have 
mechanical flaps that open using a button on a remote control, revealing frothy pick tulle underneath. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
184
During the debut show, a boy walked onto the catwalk with remote in hand and followed electronic 
instructions to operate the dress. Chalayan explained that he used the idea of controlling a person’s clothes 
with a remote control to poke fun at the natural tendency to want to control life and people’s unrealistic 
expectations of technology.

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
185
 That same year, during his fall/winter show, Chalayan created a set of wearable wooden furniture. 
Four models wearing simple slips walked into a living room furnished with four chairs and a round coffee 
table and proceeded to remove the fabric covers from the chairs. The fabric covers transformed into four 
different dresses that the models put on over their slips. Then the chairs were folded into suitcases and 
placed next to each model, showing that she could carry her chair/dress with her. Finally, a fifth model 
walked onto the stage and approached the coffee table, removing a disc from the center and stepping inside 
the table. She then pulled the table up from the middle, transforming it into a tiered wooden skirt that she 
hooked onto her belt. 
 Other noteworthy collections by the designer include the following:
• 
 Transformer Dress : In his spring/summer 2007 show, Chalayan revealed six different 
dresses that transformed automatically, including a skirt that suddenly flared out, 
a top that automatically unbuttoned, and a dress that disappeared into a hat. He was 
experimenting with the idea of clothes reacting to their environments  
• 
 LED dresses : That same year, for his fall/winter collection, Chalayan created a dress 
in collaboration with Swarovski that featured 15,600 LEDs layered behind crystals 
that acted as a display for a movie that played on the dress. Since then, he has 
produced several other illuminated garments. 
 Chalayan’s work has been exhibited at museums around the world. He has been given the title British 
Designer of the Year in 1999 and 2000 along with numerous other awards throughout his career. He has 
worked with several high-profile brands during his career. He currently leads his own brand,  Chalayan 
(since 1993), which recently opened its first retail store in London, and is the creative director at the 
German Sportswear label Puma. Chalayan has a powerful and exceptional ability to share and illustrate 
stories through couture. 
 Iris van Herpen 
 Iris van  Herpen is a Dutch fashion designer who started her own label in 2007 after graduating with a degree in 
fashion design from ArtEZ Institute of the Arts, Arnhem. She regularly collaborates with famous artists, musicians, 
architects, and choreographers. From the beginning of her career, van Herpen has approached her pieces as 
sculptures, always experimenting with new forms and materials. She is credited for being the first designer 
to introduce 3D printing to fashion with her 2010 collection. Her collections are often inspired by patterns 
and processes in nature, such as crystallization or magnetic force. Her latest collection was themed around 
 terraforming , which means modifying the biosphere of another planet to resemble Earth. The designer actually 
“terraformed” her materials, inventing new fabrication techniques in the process. For example, by combining 
stainless steel and silk into the same weave, she created a fluid new material. 
 Her 2013 collection  Voltage opened with a model dressed in a metallic bodysuit swaying atop a Tesla 
coil as sparks of electricity spewed from her hands and head. The star garments of the show, however, were a 
skirt and cape 3D-printed on an Objet Connex, which can combine several materials in each print. The piece 
was created in collaboration with architect Neri Oxman, discussed later in this chapter, and 3D-printing 
company Stratasys. The garment is lined with thousands of tiny white anemone-like modules; some parts 
are soft and flexible, whereas other sections act as a kind of structural skeleton. As van Herpen explains, 
“The ability to vary softness and elasticity inspired us to design a ‘second skin’ for the body acting as 
armor-in-motion … we were able to design not only the garment’s form but also its motion.” 
 For her spring/summer 2016 (SS16) show, van Herpen created a dress that was woven live on actress 
Gwendoline Christie, of  Game of Thrones ! Christie lay motionless on a round concrete surface as three 
robot arms disguised as magnetically “grown” sculptures created by Dutch creative Jolan van der Wiel 
wove, 3D-printed, and laser-cut a dress onto her body. As the robots were working to complete the garment, 
models wearing van Herpen’s SS16 collection entered the stage, donning futuristic garments composed 
of mesh, leather, and metallic pieces embedded with Swarovski crystals. If nothing else, the performance 
definitely felt other-worldly. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
186
 Van  Herpen says that her work is an expression of herself at the time of its creation. In a sense, she 
ia making the point that fashion is, in the end, an art; she uses her couture collections to create more 
experimental work. She employs her curiosities about nature, beauty, and regeneration in each piece, 
continuously pushing the boundaries of how clothing relates to function and movement of the human body. 
Her speculative and futuristic creations will definitely continue to keep us at the edge of our seats. 
 Future Fabric and  Fabrication  
 This book has discussed new types of fabric that are embedded with  conductive materials and electronics , 
but this is not the only focus of textile researchers. Chapter   9 presented  digital fabrication machines that are 
being used in the production of textiles and apparel. Currently, designers and researchers experimenting 
with these techniques are limited to materials that are readily available. These materials, however, may not 
yield the best results; different material compositions may prove to be more efficient for these processes. 
This section examines some new forms of fabric for wearables.

 Spray-On Clothes 
 A modern trend in fashion is skin-tight clothing. From skinny jeans to leggings, it seems as though clothing 
is getting tighter and tighter around the skin. London-based company Fabrican has invented a way to 
make clothing fit even closer to the skin: it patented an instant, non-woven, spray-on fabric. Yes, you read 
correctly: it is literally a can, similar to that used for whipped cream, silly string, or insulation, containing 
liquefied fibers that bond when sprayed (see Figure  16-3 ). As the spray dries, the solvent evaporates, and the 
result is a thin fabric layer that can be removed, washed, and reworn. These clothes are literally like a second 
skin for the wearer. The advantages of Fabrican over traditional fabrics include the following:
• 
 It is a faster method for constructing garments. 
• 
 Garments can be easily repaired. 
• 
 Clothes can be sketch in 3D. 
• 
 Garments can be crafted without seams.  
 Fabrican has many applications other than fashion. The company has been adapting the material to be 
used for various purposes:
• 
 Medical applications: Creating casts and bandages, and facilitating transdermal 
drug delivery 
• 
 Hygienic tools: Instant cloth and wipes 
• 
 Spill management: Maintaining spill positions, creating barriers, and containing spills  
• 
 Automotive  applications : Car interior and electrical wire coverings, and so on  
• 
 Design tools:  Prototyping and enabling consumers to easily customize objects at  home

 Catalytic Clothing 
 Catalytic Clothing is a collaboration between artist and designer Helen Storey and chemist Tony Ryan, to 
create clothing that filters the air around the wearer. The team has invented a way to attach  photocatalysts to 
the surface of clothes by mixing them in as an additive to products like fabric conditioners. The active catalyst 
agent is held in a shell that binds to the surface of the clothing when it is released in the washing cycle. 
 A  catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the process. 
Photocatalysts can break down airborne pollutants by harnessing power from light. When light shines on 
the surface of the treated clothing, the electrons in the material are rearranged and become more reactive. 
They then react with the water in the air to break the molecules into two separate molecules called  radicals . 
Radicals are extremely reactive molecules that cause pollutants to break down into harmless chemicals. 
 The main sources of air pollution are motor vehicles and factory waste. Many cities, like Beijing, suffer 
from extreme levels of air pollution, making it impossible for citizens to live in healthy conditions. The 
Catalytic Clothing technology is said to instantly break down pollutants that come in close proximity of the 
photocatalytic surface. The clothing cannot actively attract pollutants, and some may become attached to 
the surface without being broken down; in this case, they are cleaned off when the clothes are washed, as 
already occurs with normal clothing. 
 BioCouture 
 BioCouture  is a London-based design consultancy led by fashion designer, TED fellow, and NASA/Nike 
material Innovator Suzanne Lee. Lee and her team are pioneering the use of biomaterials for creating new 
textiles for fashion, sportswear, and other industries. Instead of using weaving or other traditional textile-
manufacturing processes, BioCouture fabrics are grown in a lab. The process is actually fairly simple: green 
tea, sugar, and microbes are combined to form a static culture. The microorganisms in the mixture eat the 
sugar from the tea as it ferments and spin tiny fibers made of pure cellulose in the process. After a week or 
so, these fibers stick together and form a mat on the surface that is about an inch thick. The sheet is then 
dried and can be cut or shaped and molded into clothes, shoes, and other wearables. The biomaterial and 
resulting wearables from this process are shown in Figure  16-4 . 
 An obvious advantage of this process is that it is environmentally friendly and yields zero waste or 
toxins. Additionally, the materials are compostable! Not only are these materials biodegradable, but they can 
be mixed with vegetable peelings and other materials to compost back into the earth.

 Lee predicts that in the future, clothing could be composed of living organisms that work symbiotically 
with the wearer to nourish the body or monitor for signs of disease. As she explains in an interview with 
 Dezeen , “I can imagine that we will eventually move towards the material itself being living while it’s on 
you, and having a direct relationship to your whole body in this happy micro-biome environment.” In 2014, 
Lee launched the Biofabricate platform and annual conference to bring together scientists, designers, and 
researchers in effort to foster new collaboration and innovation for a sustainable future.

 Mediated Matter 
 Neri Oxman, mentioned earlier for her collaboration with Iris van Herpen, is an architect, designer, and 
associate professor of media arts and sciences at the   MIT Media Lab  , where she founded and directs the 
  Mediated Matter    design research group. Mediated Matter works at the intersection of computational design, 
digital fabrication, materials science, and synthetic biology to enhance the relationship between built and 
natural environments. Although their work is applied to architecture, construction, and digital fabrication, 
several projects also fit within the realm of wearables. 
 To demonstrate the  speculative and innovative quality of their work, let’s look at their recent project 
entitled  Wanderers: An Astrobiological Exploration . In this work, they created four 3D-printed wearables in 
collaboration with Stratasys that are designed to facilitate synthetic biological processes that could allow 
humans to survive on other planets. The garments are composed of capillaries infused with synthetically 
engineered microorganisms that help to create a habitable environment. The first piece is designed to 
interact with the atmosphere on Jupiter and is proposed to consume and digest biomass, absorb nutrients, 
generate energy from sucrose accumulating in the side pockets, and expel waste. The second, Zuhal, can 
adapt to the vortex storms on Saturn. Bacteria contained on the bodice’s swirling textured surface would 
convert the planet’s hydrocarbons into edible matter. The third, Otaared, is for survival on Mercury and 
provides a protective exoskeleton around the head that can be custom-fit to the wearer. The fourth, Al-Qamar, 
is a “wearable biodome” that is worn around the neck and over the shoulders. The exterior of the piece is 
composed of pods for algae-based air purification and biofuel collection that can produce and store oxygen. 
 Oxman and her group continue to develop new and exciting tools and environments that blend 
materials and technology. Although they are not always presented as alternatives to fabric, it is important 
to consider the integration of these new materials in manufacturing or fabrication processes for fashion 
and design. 
 Future Retail 
 This chapter has looked at the future of  materials and fashion trends, but what will the retail experience be 
like for future fashion? If clothing indeed becomes more durable and long lived, as predicted, the desire 
for thousands of different styles each season may be significantly diminished. Consumers may only be 
interested in styles that are transformable between seasons. The  color of the fabric may not matter if it can 
be programmed to change whenever the wearer wants. Fabric and fit as we know it may become a thing of 
the past. This is likely a future very far from now, because fashion and style are so embedded into our lives. 
 People have always preferred the convenience of having goods delivered rather than going out to 
fetch them. This has historically been a symbol of wealth and status, and it is the motivation for several  
app-based services that allow you to place orders through your phone or computer and have them delivered, 
sometimes the same day. This model is being launched and tested primarily in large cities like New York 
and San Francisco. Wearables have one advantage over other goods like food and office supplies: they offer 
a more intimate user experience. Although you may not think twice about ordering a bottle of shampoo 
online, you may not feel the same way about a new pair of shoes. You cannot be sure if you want them until 
you physically try them on, walk around a bit, and see how your feet react. Even if someone else leaves a rave 

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
190
review, when it comes down to it, no two feet are identical, and these experiences cannot be compared. 
Of course, you could always ship the shoes back if you don’t like them and order another pair; but does this 
provide more convenience than going to a shoe store and having the ability to try on several different models 
in an hour? 
 Consumer preference , however, is not the only factor in this equation. There are also expense 
calculations to be analyzed. Eyewear brand Warby Parker offers the option of having five different styles of 
glasses sent to the customer’s home at no charge, with the agreement that they will be returned after a week. 
This is, in a sense, a compromise; it blends the convenience of online ordering with options and time so 
customers feels as though they are getting an equal if not better experience than shopping in a physical store. 
This enables the brand to provide the same shopping experience to customers all over the world. Additionally, 
the company it saves on expenses because it no longer has to budget for rent, utilities, employee salaries, 
and other costs of operating a physical storefront. 
 Lifestyles and Experiences 
 Another solution to keeping up with the demands of future consumers is to reimagine the concept of a store. 
Retailers are experimenting with different approaches to the design and aesthetic of their spaces. Some 
are branching out to offer a lounge or coffee shop in the store, so that customers get a sense that they are not 
just buying a shirt or a watch, they are joining a culture. Brands have always promoted their own culture 
and lifestyle, but emphasizing this in physical stores is an increasingly popular experiment. The Samsung 
pop-up in New York City in the winter of 2014 contained an Illy coffee bar where customers could enjoy a 
free espresso, a photo booth, and a busy schedule of in-store events. 
 The pop-up store is one strategy to changing the retail experience. Instead of being tied to one location, 
stores can pop in and out of cities and provide the full experience to more potential customers, if only 
temporarily. Additionally, this idea that stores can migrate and adapt to new cultures may be more relatable 
to a generation of jetsetters who are constantly moving around for work. It may feel reassuring that their 
favorite brand is popping in and out of cities and countries too, sharing the global lifestyle experience. 
 A more extreme version of the pop-up store is the vending machine store, shown in Figure  16-5 . 
Several brands have started to place vending machines full of their products in locations where they know 
customers are inclined to make impulse purchases. For example, flip-flop brand Havaianas placed vending 
machines filled with flip-slops at the beach, where people may decide to buy a new pair that they can use 
right way. Clothing brand Gap placed a vending machine full of collared shirts in an airport terminal for 
professionals who may have forgotten to pack a crisp, clean shirt for an important business meeting. This is 
another low-commitment experiment, in terms of the cost of maintaining the vending machine, that allows 
the brand to target customers in hyper-specific locations.

 Analog to Digital 
 Another key aspect of new lifestyle trends is converting  analog methods and objects to  digital . Many everyday 
rituals now have a digital factor. For example, you can check the news or weather on your phone—you no 
longer have to flip through a physical newspaper. Checking to see whether a package has arrived can be done 
online by entering a tracking number—you don’t have to wait until you go home and check the mailbox. How 
can digital elements be added to a store without doing away with physical stores completely in exchange for 
online storefronts? 
 FashionLike 
 Fashion retailer C&A has implemented a new  marketing strategy in Brazil called  FashionLike . The project 
involves a set of clothing hangers with a small screen embedded on the top of the hanger. The clothing 
collection is posted on Facebook when it is released in the store, for fans to vote on or “like” each article of 
clothing. The number of likes each item receives is displayed on the LED screen on the item’s hanger. The 
idea is that shoppers can consider the popularity of each item as they browse the store’s aisles. The result of 
this digitized hanger system showed that the store was able to engage 1,000 new fans per hour via Facebook, 
resulting in a collection being completely sold out in a day. The overall impact of the campaign was nearly 9 
million people. 
 Virtual Dressing Rooms 
 The concept of a dressing room, or fitting room, has remained fairly consistent: a small room or closet where 
you can try on clothes in a store before deciding whether you want to purchase the items. Some dressing 
rooms are more comfortable than others, offering seating or refreshments, but beyond the furnishings there 
is not much variance. A virtual dressing room would introduce some real changes to the scene. Although 
there are different ideas for how a digital dressing room would be implemented, the basic system works like 
this: the customer enters a booth that is a mix between a photo booth and a dressing room and stands before 
a large screen. Cameras (usually Kinect depth sensors) in the room scan the customer’s body and create a 
virtual model of the person that is displayed on the screen. The customer then selects the clothes they want 
to “try on” from a digital catalog on the side of the screen, or on a device such as an iPad. The clothes are 
then mapped onto the customer on the onscreen display, much like a virtual mirror. 
 Japanese fashion brand Urban Research began testing virtual dressing rooms in its stores in 2014. The 
image on the screen is said to respond to the user’s movements in real time through “3D real-time fitting” 
technology. The company even says the system will be able to provide the virtual experience of feeling the 
texture of the clothes through “cloth simulation.” 
 Interactive  Retail Displays 
 Several stores and businesses are experimenting with digital in-store experiences. From window displays 
to interactive shelving and tables, various projection-mapping installations are providing entertainment 
and appeal. The experience of shopping online is very different than shopping in a store. For one thing, 
there is no tactile interaction with the object, so unless the consumer has previously seen the product, they 
are making the purchase based on an image. To make up for this loss, online stores provide more in-depth 
information about the product. Often the page includes a fit guide, customer reviews, and an anecdote 
about the product; this information works to provide confidence for the consumer. In a physical store, this 
information is sometimes written on the clothing tag, but shoppers are unlikely to carefully read the tags and 
labels in the store. However, researchers have found this information is present alongside the product on an 
iPad or other interactive device, it is more inviting and approachable. 

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
193
 Design studio Perch Interactive has created a customizable retail shelf and table that provide an 
interactive experience for shopping and projects information about the product on the surface that changes 
depending on user input. This makes the shopping experience feel more personal, halfway between 
browsing products at a store and being in a museum. The consumer gets the best of both worlds: the 
tactile experience of physically touching the garment, and the digital experience of consuming background 
information before making the decision to buy. 
 Culture and  Society  
 These  new trends and materials will ultimately lead to changes in the culture and societal norms around 
apparel. As you saw from the review of the history of wearables in Chapter   1 , new technologies do not 
become widespread until they become affordable. Before this, they are viewed as rare luxury items for 
a select group of (often wealthy) people and do not have much influence power over society as a whole. 
Wearable technology is already following this pattern. Although it may be adopted in certain fields, such as 
medicine and sports, where the potential gains outweigh the expenses, it will not find its place in everyday 
fashion until it is less expensive. 
 The cost of bringing these goods to market, as you saw in previous chapters, is related to many factors 
such as materials, supply chain, and manufacturing processes. It will be difficult for all these factors to align 
without the support of large companies that can afford to experiment and take risks until the system is 
established. This is why the early adopters of this technology include big brands and companies like Intel, 
Google, and Levi’s. 
 Costs and Benefits 
 The cost of a pair of Levi’s jeans currently runs around $80; Levi’s customer base therefore is composed of 
people who can afford and expect their pants to be in this price range. It is unlikely that the brand would 
release a pair of technologically enhanced jeans until it can price them in this range. Levi’s is not looking 
to exclude its current consumers and shift toward a more exclusive market; doing so would hurt the brand 
and result in many unhappy people who would take their business elsewhere. Additionally, if Levi’s were to 
release a short run of electronic jeans, it might face the same fate as other products that were released “at the 
wrong time,” such as Google Glass. Similar to people with an NFC chip implant, users would quickly realize 
that although there were many things their pants were capable of doing, the infrastructure for this tool was 
not quite in place. 
 Brands that are likely to unlock the  secret formula for weaving electronics into clothes are already 
investing funds and energy in ongoing research projects. This secret formula may take the form of a new 
weaving or sewing machine that can incorporate LEDs, conductive threads, and other materials into the 
fabric. Using high-tech camera vision like SoftWear automation’s ThreadVision (discussed in Chapter   9 ), 
these machines could be repurposed to work with electronics. Machines like the MarkForged 3D printer 
that can print strong materials are also an exciting part of this solution. As apparel engineer Yolita Nugent 
(designer of the No Contact Jacket from Chapter   14 ) explains, “Imagine that they can print on textiles and 
then reinforce those textiles with Kevlar or space age materials such as polyimide aerogel. Then combine 
this technique with Voxel8’s first 3-D printer for electronics. It’s all very exciting.”  
 Privacy Concerns 
 Susan McGregor’s data jewelry from Chapter   14 demonstrated how wearables can be used to help facilitate 
data privacy, but other types of wearable technology pose a threat to privacy. Although wearable health 
trackers and monitors are constantly logging data about the wearer’s biometrics, vitals, and possibly even 
location, this information is still kept confidential. What would happen if doctors and insurance companies 

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
194
had access to this information? One possibility is that insurance companies may subsidize these health 
trackers for patients who have chronic conditions. Or perhaps they would prefer that clothing be embedded 
with this technology. This may mean insurance companies would be dealing directly with fashion designers 
to negotiate prices and styles for these garments. 
 Another, more dystopian, possibility is that this information could be used to calculate the cost of 
human lives. Your health, bank, and social information could all be analyzed to predict your every move. 
Everyone with a social media profile is already voluntarily contributing part of this information. Most of the 
other channels are also online and could easily be uploaded to the same program that analyzes every digital 
representation of a person’s life. 
 Social  Robotics 
 You’ve seen the potential market and manufacturing impacts of wearable technology, but I haven’t 
discussed the cultural and psychological impacts. As clothing and environments become smarter, how will 
people change? When you board a subway car in any big city, you’ll probably notice that more than half of 
the commuters are glued to their smart devices, watching movies, playing games, and reading email. This 
results in a loss of connection with the physical environment; people are literally engulfed by a digital world, 
tuning out of much of the world around them. This image may make it seem as though digital technology 
is imposing an introverted nature on society, but this is hardly the case. On the contrary, people are more 
social and connected than ever before, at least in digital life, if not in real life. 
 As the work presented in Chapter   14 shows, technology can also be used to promote emotional 
expression and help users interact with their environments. One field that is particularly interested in this 
relationship is  social robotics . Social robotics concentrates on the development and design of robots that are 
social: that is, robots that interact with humans, as other humans would. An example of how this fits in with 
wearables can be seen Adam Whiton’s  Zipperbot . The Zipperbot is a tiny robot that attaches to clothing and 
zips and unzips a zipper. It can be seen unzipping a skirt in Figure  16-6 . The Zipperbot may fill the place of a 
friend who could help you with a zipper when your hands are full or, better yet, help you release a zipper 
that is stuck in place!

CHAPTER 16 ■ SPECULATIONS ON WEARABLE FUTURES
195
 On the other hand, people may have conflicts with their robotic clothing. It is already common to see 
people get frustrated with their smartphones and blame them for typos or mis-scheduling an appointment. 
Although the technology may not have functioned as it was supposed to and could be at fault, in the end 
the only one to blame for these mistakes is the user who trusted and relied on the technology. Introducing 
robotic clothing may release a whole new  culture of technical difficulties. What if you programmed your 
shirt to glow red, and halfway through the day it turned green due to a software error and clashed with the 
rest of your outfit? Naturally, you would be upset with the shirt; but such disappointment is definitely a sign 
of intimacy and acceptance. To logically be upset with the shirt, you must admit that you put the shirt in the 
place of a social object that has the power to make you happy or upset. Hopefully the future does not lend 
itself to a time when people are walking around and complaining to their clothes—that would definitely be 
very strange. 
 Summary 
 This chapter has offered a sneak peek into the near future of the fashion and textiles world. What will come 
after these more predictable eventual changes is more difficult to imagine. As you have seen, these industries 
are linked and are becoming more connected and intertwined with each new technological development. A 
world where electronic textiles and clothes are as ordinary as cellphones is a world where fitness monitors 
are not an optional accessory but are woven into the fabric of wearables: a world where makeup not only 
shines, it lights up. 
 In the beginning of this book, I defined  wearables  as anything that is intended to be worn, although I 
made the distinction that the term has become widely adopted to mean “wearable  technology .” Perhaps 
at this point you also feel that  wearables is not the best term for describing these creations. Some of these 
technologies are not intended to be worn on the body so much as applied or implanted. A more appropriate 
term for this field that is being adopted by designers and researchers is  body technology or  body architecture . 
 Body technology  is fairly self-explanatory and can refer to anything that combines technology with the 
body. Thus electronic shirts, cyborg enhancements, and new design tools for prototyping directly on the 
body all fit under this umbrella.  Body architecture is in a sense a subset of body technology that refers more 
specifically to the manipulation of forms for the body. 
 You have almost reached the end—congratulations! I will leave you with one last tutorial in the 
appendix. Connected clothing with RFID tags visit    http://www.etologyglobal.com/  . This project was largely 
inspired by my research for this book, and I hope that you too will imagine new ideas and projects after 
reading the book. 
 As you travel further into the world of fashion and technology, discovering new innovations and 
techniques, remember to reflect on what you have seen. Fashion and technology are both interdisciplinary 
processes, spanning fields and toolsets. The most interesting and promising discoveries combine values 
and principles of fashion, design, and engineering, and work to create an exciting and accessible user 
experience. I encourage you to stray from the norms, try on things that you’d normally never wear, think 
dynamically, and design critically.

 APPENDIX  
 Cyborg “Fingercaps” and 
Resources 
 While researching and writing this book, I came across several inspirational projects that led to many 
different project ideas of my own. One piece that I was especially drawn to was a set of 3D-printed fingernails 
developed by Studio XO (mentioned in Chapter   14 ) for Lexus. You can see the full video explaining the 
collaboration online at   https://vimeo.com/102814854  . 
 I had recently seen cyborg artist Neil Harbisson (mentioned in Chapter   13 ) give a talk about his 
experiences as a cyborg and the work he has done with the Cyborg Foundation. I found that I was curious 
about cyborg enhancements myself, but not enough to actually implant something in my body. I decided 
I wanted to create a way to try out different augmentations. The most common place to get this type of 
implant in the body seems to be the fingertip. Borrowing from the concepts of 3D-printed fingernails 
and Katia Vega’s Beauty Tech nails (from Chapter   12 ), I decided to make a kit of  Cyborg Fingercaps: a set 
of modular 3D-printed pieces that fit on the top of your finger and can be customized to include cyborg 
enhancements such as magnets, RFID tags, NFC chips, USB drives, and more. This project, shown in 
Figure  A-1 , ties together a lot of the themes and techniques explained in this book.

 Harbisson made the important point during his talk that if we are able to turn the enhancements on and 
off, our brains won’t accept them as an extension of our bodies. If you’ve ever removed a ring after wearing 
it for a long period of time, you’ve probably noticed that your finger feels a bit odd—some say their fingers 
feel “naked.” With the fingercaps, my hope is that if worn continuously they may feel like an extension of the 
finger, a bit like a prosthetic. 
 Recipe for Cyborg Fingercaps 
 First I list the tools and  materials I used when developing this kit. The fingercaps could be made with 
different methods—for example, they could be cast or carved. I chose  3D printing because it allowed for 
quick iterations of different designs. 
 You need the following  materials :
• 
 LED lights (3 mm or surface mount) 
• 
 Small coin batteries 
• 
 Rare earth magnet (14" disc or smaller) 
• 
 RFID tag 
• 
 NFC chip 
• 
 Thermochromatic paint 
• 
 Photoluminscent paint 
• 
 Tilt-ball switch 
• 
 Thin-gauge wire 
• 
 Nail polish 
• 
 Transparent filament 
• 
 Thin padding or cushion material 
• 
 Glue dots 
• 
 USB  drive 
 You also need these  tools :
• 
 Soldering iron 
• 
 3D printer 
• 
 Wire cutters and strippers 
• 
 3D scanner (optional) 
• 
 Calipers 
• 
 Electrical tape 
 Follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 Measure your fingertips, around which the fingercaps will go. You can do this 
through traditional means by measuring them with calipers, or you can use 
3D-scanning technology (described in Chapter   8 ). 

APPENDIX ■ CYBORG “FINGERCAPS” AND RESOURCES
199
 
 2. 
 Decide how you’d like the fingercaps to look, and model them. Figure  A-2 shows 
three of the fingercaps I modeled. Several  different modeling programs are 
available, many of which are detailed in Chapter   8 . 
 Figure A-2.  Three different fingercap models 
 
 3. 
 Print out the models on a 3D printer using transparent or white filament. If you 
do not have access to a  3D printer , you can most likely find one at your local 
makerspace, hackerspace, or fablab.  3D Hubs   provides a database of venues 
with 3D printers around the world. There are also services online that let you 
mail-order 3D models to be printed, such as Ponoko and Shapeways. I used an 
 Ultimaker Extended to print out my models at my local fablab; you can see a 
picture of the process in Figure  A-3 .

 4. 
 Depending on the  quality of your printer, there may be rough edges around the 
corners or your print. You can use sandpaper or a file to lightly brush off any 
unevenness along the surface. You want the surfaces to be smooth, especially if 
you are  planning to paint them! 
 
 5. 
 Build the  circuits that you want to embed into the fingercaps. For the first version, 
I chose to build an  LED throwie : a simple circuit composed of just an LED and a 
battery. To make these circuits resilient, I chose to solder them together. 
 
 6. 
 Paint the fingercaps using your desired  paints . I used a combination of nail 
polish, spray paint, thermochromatic (heat sensitive) and photochromatic 
(glow-in-the dark) paints. The thermochromatic paint serves as a temperature 
sensor, in that it changes color when it is over a certain threshold temperature as 
explained in Chapter   7 . The photochromatic paint serves as a light sensor, in that 
it gives off a faint light or glow in the dark. You can see the parts and tools I used 
in Figures  A-4 and  A-5 . 
 Figure A-3.  Models being printed on an  Ultimaker 2

 7. 
 Place the circuits into the fingercaps such that the  LED lights   shine through one 
of the sides. Other objects you wish to embed, like the magnet, you can attach 
with a non-permanent but strong adhesive such as glue dots. Test each fingercap 
to make sure the circuit or object is visible or effective from the outside. 
 
 8. 
 Try them on! If they are uncomfortable or loose, you may want to add some thin 
padding or coat the inside with a thin layer of silicone. You may also choose to 
make some changes to the circuits based on how they feel and work when you 
are wearing them. For example, do you want the light to shine  outward , away 
from your finger, or inward, toward your hand, like the thumb and index fingers 
in Figure  A-6 ? 
 Figure A-6.  Trying on the  fingercaps 
 
 9. 
 To notice the  effects , you must wear the fingercaps continuously for a period 
of time—at least a few days. Depending on how comfortable they are, you 
will probably want to remove them at night. I chose a geometric design with 
a lot of sharp corners; I will try to make a version that is designed to be more 
comfortable in version 2.
