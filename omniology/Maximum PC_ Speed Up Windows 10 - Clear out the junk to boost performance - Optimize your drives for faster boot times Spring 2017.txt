XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
EMAIL 
was 
in 
my freshman year of college in 
1988. I attended Dartmouth, and 
we had a system named BlitzMail. 
Every student was granted an email 
address and access to the system. 
Like most students, I didn‚Äôt use it at 
all. It‚Äôs hard for even me to believe, 
but back then I was in the habit of 
writing letters and postcards.
I vividly recall the tipping point, 
though. In 1re years and my first job 
in PC Week‚Äôs lab in 1992 to actually 
start using it. Like a lot of corporate 
workplaces, email was commonly 
used for interoffice communications. 
But the volume wa989 in the middle 
of my sophomore year, I was eating 
lunch with a few freshmen who were 
talking about how great email was 
for chatting up women. I remember 
being shocked at the notion that 
these guys didn‚Äôt have the courage to 
pick up the phone. Little did I know. 
I‚Äôd be lying if I said that I took to 
email the next day. I didn‚Äôt. It took 
three more years and my first job 
in PC Week‚Äôs lab in 1992 to actually 
start using it. Like a lot of corporate 
workplaces, email was commonly 
used for interoffice communications. 
But the volume was manageable; I 
remember going two or three hours 
without new email. That sounds 
absolutely crazy now, but this was 
the era before SPAM even existed. 
As more friends started working 
and came online, the postcard- and 
letter-writing days ended forever. 
(That lab job was also awesome 
because after four years of using 
a Mac in college, I was able to get 
back to PC gaming‚Äîafter hours, of 
course.)
I‚Äôll be honest; I still love checking 
my inbox and discovering email‚Äî
from 
friends, 
family, 
writers, 
readers, PR people, whomever‚Äîeven 
if it has become a bit overwhelming. 
Between re years and my first job 
in PC Week‚Äôs lab in 1992 to actually 
start usingaccounts, I‚Äôve never had 
trouble keeping up. Until now. This is 
partially what inspired this month‚Äôs 
cover story. Over the last 18 months, 
I‚Äôve begun to notice that my ability to 
quickly parse, read, and respond to 
email just isn‚Äôt fast enough anymore. 
I need to develop new systems and 
shortcuts. I need to change my ways. 
I‚Äôm 
curious‚Äîare 
you 
finding 
yourself in the same boat as I am? 
If so, what have you done to better 
manage your email life? Let me know 
at George@maximumpc.com.

WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME fussing about 
with hardware. Tinkering, tweaking, and 
otherwise trying to squeeze out every 
last drop of GPU and CPU performance. 
You can Ô¨Ånd endless amounts of 
resources that tell you what you should 
and shouldn‚Äôt do with your hardware. 
But very little attention is given to the 
operating system side of the computer, 
which is unfortunate, because that‚Äôs 
ultimately where the results matter the 
most. So we‚Äôve gone and done just that.
Windows 10 is, without doubt, one of 
Microsoft‚Äôs best releases of Windows. 
It‚Äôs well made, stable, and chock-full of 
features‚Äîsome of which you may not 
actually want or use. Take, for example, 
Cortana, the smart assistant not unlike 
Apple‚Äôs Siri, Amazon‚Äôs Echo, or Google 
Assistant. Sure, it can tell jokes, look up 
information on Wikipedia, and search 
your computer, but I personally don‚Äôt 
use it. I reckon my keyboard skills can 
get me what I need much faster. So I 
disable it, freeing up system resources 
for other duties.
Things don‚Äôt end there, though. There 
are other areas of Windows 10 that you 
can dive into, and with a little know-how, 
gain just not increased performance 
from your PC, but enough performance to 
witness actual usability improvements. 
Startup 
options, 
system 
services, 
clearing out old system update Ô¨Åles, and 
more‚Äîour crack team of experts show 
you a wide range of pro-level tricks to 
take your rig by the horns.
Some of you might be thinking to 
yourselves, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve done all that, 
but tell me what‚Äôs going to give me 
giant leaps in performance on my next 
upgrade.‚Äù The answer might surprise 
you: displays.
Earlier this year, at CES, I witnessed 
a Ô¨Çurry of display announcements. 8K 
displays Ô¨Ånally debuted, with some 
companies showing working demos. 
HDR is on the rise, primarily in HDTVs, 
but it‚Äôll no doubt show up in computer 
displays this year. Refresh rates are 
going up, too, and a new HDMI spec was 
announced, delivering 4K resolution at an 
astonishing 120Hz. The display industry 
is moving forward at an ever-increasing 
rate, and this will also push the PC.
So, we took it upon ourselves to 
bring all the newest bad-ass displays 
into the lab, and run them through our 
tests. Some are better than others, 
but one result is consistent across the 
board: Current displays have advanced 
signiÔ¨Åcantly in just a few years.
Which brings me to my sage advice: 
Invest in a display. A good display is 
always the most expensive part of my 
build, because I spend all my computing 
time staring at it, and a good display will 
outlast your PC, for the most part. You 
might upgrade this and that inside, but 
the screen will be there for some time. 
What do I use? Two 32-inch 4K 
displays. But with 8K on the way, I‚Äôm 
starting to get an itch.

Commercial 3D memory Ô¨Ånally arrives
Intel‚Äôs Optane 
Technology Ships
individual transistors. These 
first modules have two layers 
of memory cells, but three-
layer cells are due later in the 
year. The exact physics and 
manufacturing method has yet 
to be revealed. 
Intel‚Äôs announcements about 
Optane veer into hyperbole. 
It will ‚Äúchange the face of 
computing with an unparalleled 
combination 
of 
speed, 
endurance, and density.‚Äù These 
first modules are about three 
times faster than a standard 
SSD in random and sequential 
read. Write speeds are less 
impressive‚Äîstill capable of 
beating SSDs, but by much 
slimmer margins. The 32GB 
module manages 1,600MB/s on 
reads and 500MB/s on writes. 
Latency is between SSD and 
DRAM. We have nothing on 
price yet, but they won‚Äôt be 
cheap. Expect to pay around five 
times the price of flash RAM, or 
twice that of DRAM.
Sure, they are fast, but 
you are right to feel a little 
underwhelmed at this point. 
This doesn‚Äôt beat emerging 
NVDIMM or NVMe technology, 
and 
isn‚Äôt 
what 
we 
were 
promised. Early presentations 
about 3D XPoint spoke of speed 
boosts of up to a thousand times 
SSD, and touched on the long-
held dream of unified RAM and 
storage. Alas, these claims have 
proved elusive. The tantalizing 
early 
proclamations 
were 
based on the core performance 
of the chips at the cell level. 
Once it goes through all the 
subsystems of the hardware and 
software, the speed is degraded 
considerably. Perhaps it might 
have been wiser not to publicize 
such appetizing claims in the 
first place. 
Larger capacity SSD versions 
are currently being tested in 
servers by IBM and Facebook. 
Before the end of the year, we 
will see more mainstream 
applications, which currently 
sport ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù codenames‚Äî
Mansion Beach, Stony Beach, 
and Carson Beach‚Äîeach a 
family of Optane SSDs running 
on PCIe or SATA. Its future as 
a DRAM replacement is less 
obvious. Conventional modules 
are already cheap and fast, but 
its use in servers cannot be 
far away.
Optane is having a slightly 
difficult birth, and the 8000p is 
a bit of a dull start. However, 
a huge research budget and 
much effort has been poured 
into its success. This is just a 
taster. A single unified high-
speed memory is still a long 
way away, but we do have 
commercial 3D memory that is 
already faster than NAND, and 
has an interesting roadmap. 
You will be hearing a lot more 
about Optane. ‚ÄìCL
THE LAUNCH of an M.2 SSD 
memory 
module 
is 
not 
normally of much interest, but 
Intel‚Äôs new 8000p is based on 
the company‚Äôs new Optane 
technology, which has been 
several years in the making, 
and responsible for quite a few 
promises along the way. The 
modules come in 16GB and 32GB 
sizes, and you‚Äôll need a specific 
set of hardware to run them: a 
Kaby Lake chip, a 200-series 
chipset, a compatible M.2 slot, 
and a compatible BIOS. They 
have been designed to boost 
Intel‚Äôs Rapid Cache Technology 
performance, and a small 
number of machines have been 
announced that are Optane-
ready, among them Lenovo‚Äôs 
ThinkPad T570 and HP‚Äôs Envy 
Curved 34.
Optane is Intel‚Äôs brand name 
for the 3D XPoint technology, 
a 3D memory system jointly 
developed by Intel and Micron. 
The tech has been in the labs 
since 2012. Memory cells sit in 
a three-dimensional mesh, and 
use the change in resistance 
of the materials to store data. 
Importantly,

THE CHINESE MINISTRY of Industry and 
Information has announced the start of a 
14-month campaign to target the use of 
VPNs in China to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù the Internet, 
and encourage the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù development 
of the industry. Running a VPN business 
inside China will now require a state license, 
and presumably close co-operation with the 
authorities. President Xi Jinping recently 
delivered a speech to the World Economic 
Forum on the beneÔ¨Åts of opening up 
world trade and world borders. The irony 
is palpable.
Details on the new rules are a little 
vague, but the clear targets are businesses 
inside China who provide VPNs for its 
citizens. 
The 
Ô¨Årewall 
that 
surrounds 
China has also started blocking VPN sites. 
Large corporations are unaffected so 
far. VPNs are popular in China to access 
otherwise blocked sites, such as Google and 
YouTube, and evade censorship on speciÔ¨Åc 
subjects, principally anything concerning 
dissatisfaction with the state. 
The Internet arrived in China in 1994, 
and the state started to attempt to control 
it in 1998; a Ô¨Årewall for the entire nation 
followed in 2003. China‚Äôs efforts to control 
the Internet were initially greeted with much 
skepticism in the West. The Internet was 
seen as too porous and too distributed to 
be stopped. While it is still difÔ¨Åcult to stop a 
determined individual, the state has proved 
remarkably effective at suppressing the 
curious. In China, you expect to be tracked, 
and self-censorship is natural.
Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, VPNs 
are free to use and popular, even if the 
authorities aren‚Äôt always keen on the uses 
they are put to. China has shown that it is 
possible to effectively control what it was 
once thought almost impossible to police. 
Let‚Äôs hope nobody else gets any ideas. ‚ÄìCL 
PRESS WINDOWS AND G in the latest 
Windows Creator Update, and you 
enter the much anticipated Game 
Mode. As expected, it‚Äôs mostly about 
resource allocation, speciÔ¨Åcally CPU and GPU resources to the game, getting all 
processor cores running effectively, and keeping the GPU focused on the game 
graphics. The emphasis is not so much on performance increases‚Äîthese are 
marginal, at 2‚Äì5 percent‚Äîbut to get Win 10 rigs, Xbox One, and the forthcoming 
Scorpio console to offer a consistent experience. The target standard is 900p 
to 1080p for Xbox One, and 4K at 60fps for Scorpio. The ‚ÄúGames‚Äù section in 
‚ÄúSettings‚Äù sports the Xbox logo, and here you can conÔ¨Ågure each game. Win32 
support has been conÔ¨Årmed, too, which is welcome. You also have game 
streaming via Beam, and a new Game DVR settings page. It‚Äôs about blurring the 
lines between platforms, and focusing on a consistent game experience. ‚ÄìCL

THE LAST TWO BIG PLAYERS making 3D TVs‚Äî
LG and Sony‚Äîare to drop their support with 
this year‚Äôs models. The format is dead, for the 
mass market at least. Lack of content was obvious; there was very little broadcast 3D, and 
even that has now stopped. Enthusiasm from consumers dropped off sharply, and the TV 
people‚Äôs attention has shifted to HDR and 4K. 3D content will live on, but only through VR. 
3D TVs came on the back of 3D movies, which appeared in sporadic waves since the 
1950s, each powered by new technology. The Ô¨Årst wave lasted just three years, and the 
revivals fared little better. The current dalliance with 3D movies has at least attracted some 
big budget titles, but there are signs that this is fading, too. The odds are that 3D will return 
at some point, probably using yet another technology, but for now you had better start 
hoarding those 3D Blu-rays if you want any use out of your 3D TV. ‚ÄìCL

TECH TALK
The Current State of 
Integrated Graphics
The good news is that Intel started putting more 
effort into improving graphics when it created HD 
Graphics, in 2010. The latest iteration is its 600 
series, in the new Kaby Lake CPUs, which is largely 
the same as the 500 series. A huge chunk of the 
processor is devoted to graphics‚Äîroughly one third 
of the die. But even so, performance isn‚Äôt stellar.
I ran tests on 15 modern games, and even at low 
quality settings and 1280x720, less than half were 
playable. But there is some good news in that all 15 
games rendered without any noticeable errors. Less 
demanding games such as Overwatch, League of 
Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, 
and many indie titles are also deÔ¨Ånitely playable.
Perhaps more interesting is what Intel has 
been doing over the past seven generations of 
Core processors. Intel more than quadrupled its 
mainstream 
integrated 
graphics 
performance 
going from Ô¨Årst-gen to third-gen Core, but since 
then, most of the desktop parts (Broadwell being 
the exception) haven‚Äôt seen much improvement. In 
raw computational power, the fastest GT2 variants 
of Intel‚Äôs HD Graphics have sat in the 400-450GÔ¨Çops 
range since Haswell‚Äôs HD 4600 in late 2012.
AMD is only slightly better, with its top APUs, like 
the A10-7890K, sitting at 887GÔ¨Çops, while lower-tier 
parts like the A8-7670K (581GÔ¨Çops) and A6-7470K 
(410GÔ¨Çops) are well off the pace. More critically, 
all of these parts, including desktop Skylake and 
THE WORLD OF INTEGRATED GRAPHICS has a long and storied history, 
most of which can be summed up as: they‚Äôre too slow and lacking in 
functionality. For years, the most ‚Äúpopular‚Äù graphics chips have been 
Intel‚Äôs, not because they were fast but because they were ubiquitous.
Kaby Lake at 440GÔ¨Çops, are less 
than half the performance of the 
GTX 1050 (1,733GÔ¨Çops) and RX 460 
(2,150GÔ¨Çops) that represent entry-
level dedicated GPUs. That‚Äôs a big 
part of why most gamers end up 
running a dedicated graphics card.
Other factors include sharing 
system memory bandwidth. Even 
with two or three times as many 
GPU cores, without increasing the 
memory bandwidth, a lot of potential 
performance is lost. An HBM2 cache 
is a potential solution, and Intel has 
used eDRAM caches with its Iris 
products, but few desktop users are 
interested in improving integrated 
graphics when a quick upgrade to 
a dedicated graphics card can more 
than double performance.
Consoles are a different matter, 
where economies of scale come

into play, and by targeting a closed 
platform, manufacturers can do 
more with less. The PS4‚Äôs custom 
AMD processor uses about two-
thirds of the die space on graphics, 
with the relatively slow Jaguar CPU 
cores relegated to one eighth of 
the die. The PS4 also uses GDDR5, 
with a 256-bit interface clocked at 
5,500MT/s, with over four times the 
bandwidth of a dual-channel DDR4-
2667 conÔ¨Åguration, and the PS4 Pro 
should double GPU performance.
I‚Äôm eager to see what AMD does 
with the upcoming Zen APUs. Will 
it include a high-speed memory 
cache, along with substantially 
more GPU cores? It could, and 
I‚Äôve seen rumors of an APU with 
potentially 1,024 Vega GPU cores‚Äî
twice the number found in AMD‚Äôs 
current top APUs. Combined with 
stacked memory (a single 2‚Äì4GB 
HBM2 stack, perhaps), AMD could 
end up surpassing the performance 
of its RX 460. Certainly, AMD has 
the expertise to pull this off, but 
I‚Äôm not convinced it will be enough 
to capture the interest of gamers, 
with price being a major factor. AMD 
might end up cannibalizing sales of 
its $100-200 graphics cards in order 
to sell more $100-200 APUs.
A quick upgrade to a dedicated 
graphics card can more than 
double performance.
AMD‚Äôs Kaveri APU uses half the die 
space on graphics functionality.

SPRING 2017
The Ô¨Årst big thing that offers promise is the Vulkan 
graphics API, the spiritual successor to OpenGL. As 
an open API, Vulkan has promised a cross-platform 
API for developers who want to develop for Linux, 
Windows, Mac, and even mobile devices. (The API 
also shipped with support for the modern Wayland 
graphics server.) The API spec was published in 
early 2016, and hardware released during the year 
offered support for Vulkan. However, very few 
games offered support, with most released in 2016 
opting for DirectX 11 or 12. Id Software‚Äôs id Tech 
6-powered Doom was a notable exception, showing 
the blistering-fast performance that Vulkan offered. 
Epic‚Äôs Unreal Engine 4 also supports the API.
With a high-performance, modern graphics API 
available for Linux, one would thing there would 
be a tidal wave of AAA games for Linux. That wave 
hasn‚Äôt come. A quick scan of a list of games with 
Vulkan support on Wikipedia shows eight games 
written for Vulkan. Only two of those (Dota 2 and The 
Talos Principle) are available on Linux. (Id‚Äôs Doom is 
curiously Windows-only, breaking from id‚Äôs history 
of releasing shooters for Linux as well as Windows.)
There simply aren‚Äôt many games written for 
Vulkan yet, but given time, that will change. The 
percentage of those games that are released for 
Linux might not, however. The big reason developers 
shy away from Linux development 
is understandable. The market is 
minuscule compared to the number 
of gamers on Windows, and Linux 
presents a moving target in terms 
of libraries and drivers. Anyone 
who‚Äôs broken something like Wi-Fi 
or Bluetooth support because of an 
update knows what I mean. That 
means a huge headache for very 
little return for a game dev shop. 
But there are a few new packaging 
technologies that aim to Ô¨Åx that.
Universal 
Linux 
‚Äúcontainer‚Äù 
formats are one of the most 
important new ideas for desktop 
users. They differ slightly from 
container technologies such as 
Docker, and aim to unify the Linux 
application distribution space.
These technologies promise to 
allow developers to package their 
apps with the libraries that they

OPEN SOURCE
Vulkan Can‚Äôt Bring 
Games to Linux by Itself
FOR YEARS AND YEARS, being a Linux user meant giving up on the idea 
of playing top-tier games when they‚Äôre released. For the most part, 
that‚Äôs still true, but technologies are emerging that will make it easier 
for developers to distribute games for Linux. Unfortunately, these new-
fangled technologies don‚Äôt solve all of the underlying issues.
need. The formats allow them to 
stop chasing library updates, and 
distribute software images that are 
known to run on the vast majority of 
Linux systems without issue.
These formats also aim to 
unify distribution in the face of the 
fracturing caused by each distro‚Äôs 
package 
management 
solution. 
Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint have 
deb; Fedora and openSUSE have 
RPM; Arch and Manjaro use tar.xz; 
Gentoo builds everything from 
source because why the hell not? 
This landscape is hell for software 
distribution (and creates a lot of 
work that volunteers have to do).
Unfortunately, the three new 
competing formats‚ÄîÔ¨Çatpak, snap, 
and AppImage‚Äîsuffer from the 
same problem, in that there‚Äôs three 
of them. Hopefully, 2017 will see a 
clear winner pull ahead of the pack. 
But even if one does, and developers 
have a clearer and more stable 
platform to target, the chicken 
(penguin?) or the egg problem will 
likely persist: There aren‚Äôt many 
gamers on Linux because there 
aren‚Äôt many games for Linux, and 
there aren‚Äôt many games for Linux 
because there aren‚Äôt many gamers.
Doomed? Actually, things are 
looking up for Linux gamers, but 
there‚Äôs still much work to be done.

No matter how careful you are online, you can still be at risk of picking up a nasty virus 
or other malware. If you don‚Äôt want to shell out for an expensive (and resource-hogging) 
antivirus app, there are plenty of free tools to keep you protected. Far from being cut-down 
and basic, even these free programs come with plenty of features to protect your PC. But are 
they too good to be true, and how do they compare to the built-in protection that Windows 
offers? We pit three of the most popular free antivirus tools against each other to Ô¨Ånd out.
AVG AntiVirus vs. Bitdefender 
Antivirus vs. Microsoft Defender
ROUND 1
ROUND 2
Ease of Use
We want our antivirus app to 
be unobtrusive, and keep us 
protected with the minimum of 
fuss. In that regard, Windows 
Defender has a huge advantage, 
as if you‚Äôre running a recent 
version of Windows, it is already 
installed and conÔ¨Ågured. 
Downloading and installing 
Bitdefender is straightforward, 
scanning 
your 
PC 
during 
the 
process. 
The 
interface 
is streamlined and easy to 
understand, and the Autopilot 
mode means you can leave it 
alone to get on with protecting 
you. To scan speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åles, just 
drag and drop them. 
AVG‚Äôs interface has simple 
indications letting you know if 
your PC is protected, and a big 
button to scan your system. It‚Äôs 
not as hands-off as the others, 
but installation is simple. You‚Äôre 
encouraged to install a browser 
plugin to protect you while 
online, but it tries to change your 
homepage and default search 
engine, which we don‚Äôt like.
Tie:
Windows Defender  
and Bitdefender
Features
Defender has virus, malware, 
and spyware detection and 
removal. Real-time protection 
monitors 
downloaded 
Ô¨Åles. 
There‚Äôs no Ô¨Årewall. Cloud-
based 
protection 
defends 
against threats identiÔ¨Åed on 
other users‚Äô PCs. It comes 
preinstalled, with no ads or pop-
ups nagging you to upgrade.
The free version of AVG 
features virus, malware, and 
spyware protection, and real-
time security updates. Unlike 
Defender, it comes with a plugin 
to protect you from unsafe 
links, downloads, and email 
attachments. A gaming mode 
(that cuts down on resources 
used) is welcome, but if you 
want 
Ô¨Årewall 
or 
phishing 
protection, you must pay.
Bitdefender offers similar 
features as AVG, plus comes 
with Autopilot mode, which 
conÔ¨Ågures 
security 
settings 
on the Ô¨Çy, enables automatic 
updates, and more, with no 
annoying pop-ups, but AVG‚Äôs 
gaming mode gives it the edge.
Winner:
AVG
AVG AntiVirus 
also comes 
with a browser 
plugin for 
protection 
when surÔ¨Ång 
the Internet.
Bitdefender 
Antivirus is 
both speedy 
and highly 
effective 
at spotting 
nasties.
Windows 
Defender is 
preinstalled 
with Windows, 
and never 
nags you to 
shell out for 
an upgrade.

ROUND 3
ROUND 4
ROUND 5
And the
Winner 
Is‚Ä¶
Every one of these AV tools 
has something going for it, 
be it Windows Defender‚Äôs 
convenience, 
Bitdefender‚Äôs 
excellent detection rate, or 
AVG‚Äôs speed and lightness. If 
you go with Bitdefender, you 
can be sure your PC is as well 
protected as possible for a 
free program, and if you just 
stick with Windows Defender, 
you‚Äôll at least be protected 
against the majority of threats.
However, the overall winner 
of these tests is AVG. It comes 
with plenty of features, has an 
excellent detection rate, and 
decent scanning speeds. What 
we really love, though, is how 
few resources it takes up when 
running in the background, 
or even when scanning your 
computer. It does a great job 
of protecting your PC, while 
having almost no impact on 
performance‚Äîlike all good AV 
products, you‚Äôll hardly know 
it‚Äôs there. 
Resource Use
Antivirus 
software 
can 
be 
very resource hungry. With 
Microsoft‚Äôs 
knowledge 
of 
Windows, you‚Äôd think Defender 
would have an advantage here. 
While performing a full scan, it 
took up a peak of 275MB of RAM, 
with CPU use (a powerful quad-
core Intel Core i7) hovering 
around 54.6 percent. When not 
in use, it used 152MB of RAM.
Bitdefender was much more 
resource-intensive. When idle, 
it used around 180MB of RAM, 
but when scanning, it had peaks 
of 780MB RAM use (though 
around 400MB for most of the 
scan time), and CPU usage 
spiking at 98 percent, averaging 
about 70 percent. The price to 
pay for such fast scanning.
Meanwhile, we were very 
impressed with the impact of 
AVG. At idle, the software takes 
up 130MB of RAM, while in use 
it only takes up around 160MB. 
Better still, CPU use never went 
higher than 14 percent‚Äîa far 
cry from the stress Bitdefender 
puts the PC under.
Winner:
AVG
Scan Speeds 
On our test machine, Windows 
Defender completed a Quick 
Scan in one minute, scanning 
11,288 Ô¨Åles. We then performed 
a deeper scan on a full 100GB 
hard drive, which completed in 
26 minutes, 42 seconds. Next 
up was Bitdefender, and the 
initial Quick Scan took just 49 
seconds. With the free version 
of Bitdefender, scan choices are 
a bit limited, so we dragged and 
dropped the entire 100GB folder 
on to the program to scan. That 
took just seven minutes, 10 
seconds, which is a lot quicker 
than Windows Defender.
AVG doesn‚Äôt have a Quick 
Scan option, though it offers lots 
of ways to conÔ¨Ågure scans, so 
they only check the bits of your 
PC you want. The default is a 
full, deep scan. This is advisable 
with all AV products, to make 
sure your PC is completely safe. 
However, with our custom scan 
of the 100GB hard drive, it took 
9 minutes, 48 seconds. Much 
faster than Windows Defender, 
but not as quick as Bitdefender. 
Winner:
Bitdefender
Virus Scanning 
In the latest AV Comparatives 
benchmarks 
(which 
are 
carried out by an independent 
company), Bitdefender blocked 
1,618 out of 1,619 test cases 
successfully, with a protection 
rate of 99.9 percent. AVG didn‚Äôt 
catch quite as many, with 1,612, 
and 99.6 percent. Windows 
Defender caught 1,570 test 
cases, for a protection rate of 
97 percent. That‚Äôs still high, but 
not quite as good as the other 
two AV products on test.
AV 
Comparatives 
also 
tested the programs for false 
Ô¨Çags‚Äîthese are safe Ô¨Åles or 
websites that are incorrectly 
identiÔ¨Åed 
as 
harmful, 
and 
blocked by AV programs. Both 
AVG and Bitdefender passed 
the tests with no wrongly 
blocked Ô¨Åles or websites, but 
Windows Defender incorrectly 
blocked 23 cases. While it‚Äôs 
a close call between AVG and 
Bitdefender (with Bitdefender 
just edging a win), Windows 
Defender‚Äôs performance was 
rather disappointing.
Winner:
Bitdefender

THIS MONTH THE DOCTOR TACKLES...
‚Üò submit your questions to: doctor@maximumpc.com
Workstation Power
Hi Doctor. My son is a 3D digital 
design student at Rochester 
Institute of Technology (RIT). 
We purchased a Lenovo P700 
system for his design work and, 
of course, gaming. He uses 
applications such as Maya, 
RealFlow, and Adobe‚Äôs CC suite.
He‚Äôs having an issue setting 
up his hardware to reduce the 
time it takes to render projects 
in Maya‚Äîthey take as long as 30 
hours to complete. I don‚Äôt think 
adding more memory will help, 
and he‚Äôs already running dual 
Xeon processors, with a pretty 
good graphics card.
We looked for ways to 
better utilize both processors, 
but can‚Äôt Ô¨Ågure that out. He 
also thinks a second graphics 
card might help, but can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd 
documentation supporting his 
hypothesis. Any ideas you have 
would be greatly appreciated.
‚ÄìDave Fantauzzo
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
Doc is well versed in matters 
of hardware, but less familiar 
with Maya, and the resources 
its renderer exploits. To get you 
the best answer, the Doc went 
to his friends at Puget Systems 
in Auburn, Washington, who 
test and write about optimizing 
conÔ¨Ågurations for workstation 
applications. Matt Bach, in 
Puget‚Äôs lab, sent over the 
following guidance: ‚ÄúIf faster 
render times from Maya are 
your primary concern, the 
solution isn‚Äôt quick or easy. 
You are correct that more 
RAM likely won‚Äôt help (32GB is 
typically plenty), and as Maya 
uses a CPU-based rendering 
engine, upgrading the GPU 
won‚Äôt improve render times 
either. The weakest link in your 
son‚Äôs dual-Xeon workstation 
is the CPUs themselves. Two 
Xeons can work very well for 
rendering, as they scale nicely 
with higher core counts, but 
the E5-2609 v3 is only one step 
up from the lowest-end CPU of 
that generation. Upgrading a 
dual-Xeon setup isn‚Äôt as cheap 
as adding RAM, but it‚Äôs the only 
thing that will help signiÔ¨Åcantly.
‚ÄúFor rendering, the Xeon 
E5-2630 v3/v4 is usually the 
lowest-end dual-CPU conÔ¨Åg 
we recommend to one of our 
customers. Compared to the 
E5-2609 v3s your son has today, 
a pair of E5-2630 v3s could be 
expected to drop that 30-hour 
render to 17 hours or so. You 
could use a cheaper CPU, but 
anything lower than the -2630 
will typically be outperformed 
by a 6- to 10-core 3GHz-plus 
single-CPU system, which is 
also more affordable. If you 
have the budget to go higher 
than the E5-2630, a quick rule 
of thumb for rendering is to 
use Xeon CPUs that end in a 0 
(-2630, -2640, -2660, and so on).
‚ÄúKeep in mind that many of 
the other tasks you mentioned 
(gaming, Maya modeling, and 
all Adobe software) do not work 
well with dual-Xeon systems. 
There is extra processing 
overhead when you have two 
physical CPUs, and unless the 
software is good at utilizing 
multiple cores at the same 
time‚Äîas rendering is‚Äîyou 
often get better performance 
with one CPU than with two. In 
fact, for gaming and modeling/
animation, four cores running 
at high clock rates yield much 
better performance.‚Äù
Mixing Memory
Dear Doctor, When it comes to 
memory, if I‚Äôm using the same 
brand and speed, does it matter 
if I install two 16GB modules 
with a CAS rating of 14 and two 
4GB sticks at CAS 16? Both 
would be DDR4-3200. Or would 
a slower data rate at CAS 12 be 
better? I‚Äôm doing some gaming, 
Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkStation P700 may require higher-end CPUs for 
optimal rendering performance.

surÔ¨Ång the net, and watching

it‚Äôll be conservative.
I also have a Samsung M.2-
based boot drive and a Samsung 
SSD for user data. If I use an 
external SSD for downloading 
Internet content, and that 
content is infected with a virus, 
would only the portable drive be 
affected, or could the contagion 
spread to other devices? A $60 
external drive lost to cooties 
would be far better than the 
permanent drives.
If this helps, I plan on buying 
a Core i7-6700K, an MSI Gaming

500GB M.2, a Samsung 850 
EVO 1TB, an MSI GeForce GTX 
1080, and a Be Quiet! Dark Base 
900 chassis. 
‚ÄìRay Nimeth
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Let‚Äôs 
start with your memory 
question. The answer isn‚Äôt 
straightforward because 
it depends on a number 
of variables. First, there‚Äôs 
your motherboard‚Äôs BIOS. 
Depending on how the Ô¨Årmware 
was written, it might choose 
the slowest common memory 
settings, the memory settings 
from a preset priority list of 
slots on the board, the serial 
presence detect (SPD) settings 
from a random module, or 
it could refuse to boot when 
presented with conÔ¨Çicting SPD 
information. The memory chips 
on those modules could also be 
incompatible due to different 
densities or capacities.
So, there‚Äôs a lot that could go 
wrong‚Äîif you have the option to 
avoid mixing kits, take it.
If you already have them 
both, try installing the modules 
in alternate slots, so that the 
kits each populate one channel. 
Check your manual for guidance 
on where to put the higher-
capacity modules. Should your 
system boot successfully at 
low baseline settings, dial in 
manual settings for the data 
rate, CL timings, command 
rate, and voltage (that is, don‚Äôt 
use XMP). Specify the lower of 
the settings between both kits.
Should you run into trouble 
booting up, try resetting the 
BIOS settings to default. If the 
issue persists, you‚Äôre likely 
out of luck. Don‚Äôt be surprised 
if this is the case; it could be 
that the capacity differences 
between 16GB and 4GB 
modules are simply too great.
In regard to your external 
drive question‚Äîyes, any virus 
on one drive can potentially 
affect other drives as well.
The Right Connection
Hello, I‚Äôm a long-time 
subscriber, going back to the 
days of Boot. In the January 
2017 issue, editor-in-chief Tuan 
Nguyen‚Äôs Lab Notes article 
‚ÄúShort Circuits‚Äù intrigued me, 
as I recently built a new system. 
I double-checked and veriÔ¨Åed 
that I was using both the CPU_
FAN and CPU_OPT headers, 
which Tuan warns against doing.
I‚Äôve had the system for a 
month and have had no problem 
whatsoever. It consists of a Core 
i5-6600K attached to a Gigabyte 
Z170X-Gaming 7 motherboard, 
with a Corsair H60 CPU cooler. 
The radiator fan is connected to 
the CPU_FAN header, while the 
pump is connected to CPU_OPT. 
I left it as-is for the moment 
because, like I said, zero 
issues. Thoughts? 
‚ÄìMike H.
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Tuan 
was having issues with an Asus 
board; that company‚Äôs support 
folks advised against using both 
headers concurrently to avoid 
the problem he encountered.
The Doc consulted Gigabyte 
about your motherboard, and 
was told that the CPU_FAN 
and CPU_OPT headers can be 
used together without an issue. 
CPU_FAN is either for a heat 
sink or radiator fan that can 
ramp up and down based on 
CPU temperature; CPU_OPT is 
an additional header that can 
provide 100 percent power all 
the time to the pump. Each has 
its own IC to control amperage 
limits. You‚Äôre in the clear.
Reinstalling Win 10
I have a Lenovo laptop that 
came with an OEM copy of 
Windows 8 and a UEFI Ô¨Årmware. 
I upgraded to Windows 10 on 
my own, and it was working 
well. Unfortunately, the OEM 
diagnostic software still thinks 
I‚Äôm using Windows 8.
I‚Äôd like to remove everything 
and reinstall from a Windows 
10 Home disc. However, it is my 
understanding that because 
the laptop has UEFI, it requires 
the original OEM partitions to 
boot. In other words, I can‚Äôt 
delete the OEM partitions and 
software before performing a 
full reinstallation.
Is there any way around this 
requirement, and how does one 
get a laptop with no operating 
system to perform its own 
installation? 
‚ÄìGerald Gibson
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Updating an older system 
to Windows 10 sometimes 
requires a BIOS/UEFI update. 
For anyone else considering 
this, depending on how old the 
laptop is, it may or may not 
support Win 10, or you may run 
into driver limitations.
That said, if you have an 
optical disc drive, Windows 
10 Home media, and the 
key, there should be nothing 
preventing you from starting 
afresh. Update the UEFI by 
downloading the latest version 
from Lenovo‚Äôs website. Pop the 
disc in your drive, and ensure 
your Ô¨Årmware is conÔ¨Ågured 
to look there Ô¨Årst upon boot. 
Or, visit http://go.microsoft.
com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209 
to download Microsoft‚Äôs media 
creation tool.
Jumping to X99
Hey, Doc! I got my hands on a 
Core i7-6850K for a great price, 
and I‚Äôm wondering whether 
I should make the jump to 
X99? I still need to buy a new 
motherboard and RAM.
I have a Core i7-4790K on the 
Z97 chipset, and that‚Äôs working 
Ô¨Åne for me, but I‚Äôd like to take 
advantage of the additional 
cores, PCIe lanes, and support 
for full-speed M.2 drives. I want 
to get the most from my ROG 
Swift PG279Q, a task I suspect 
may require two GPUs.
However, I‚Äôve heard that the 
LGA-2011 v3 interface won‚Äôt be 
used for Skylake-X and Kaby 
Lake-X. And some of the new 
Z270 boards that are coming 
out look quite tempting as well, 
especially with their support for 
Intel‚Äôs upcoming Optane tech.
I mostly do digital drawing 
and gaming, though I do use 
virtual machines from time to 
time. Do you think I‚Äôd be better 
served making the jump to 
the enthusiast X99, or Ô¨Ånding 
some other use for my new CPU 
and sticking with consumer 
platforms like Z270 or (gasp) 
AMD‚Äôs Ryzen?
‚ÄìJordan S.
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The Doc 
wouldn‚Äôt jump to X99 for gaming 
alone; your fast quad-core CPU 
is Ô¨Åne for that. Plus, a single 
GeForce GTX 1080 or 1070 will 
drive your QHD display well 
enough in the latest games. 
Even if you do crave more 
graphics performance, two x8 
slots are plenty for CrossFire 
or SLI. But virtualization does 
beneÔ¨Åt from lots of cores and 
cache. That could be reason 
alone for you to make the 
switch, if the workload is 
important enough. 
Gigabyte‚Äôs Z170X-Gaming 7 supports simultaneous use of its  
CPU_FAN and CPU_OPT headers.

particular paradox of choice 
BIG-SCREEN 
DEBUT

big screen group test

A WINDOW INTO YOUR COMPUTING WORLD. That‚Äôs 
what a PC monitor is. The question is, do you want 
your view to be a miserable, letter-box glimpse, or 
a broad, expansive, and liberating vista?
OK, that‚Äôs a loaded way of posing the problem of 
screen choice. It ain‚Äôt all about size. In fact, at the 
high end, generous proportions are a given. So it‚Äôs 
all the rest that you need to worry about: panel type, 
native resolution, and pixel pitch, for instance.
But that‚Äôs just the basics. The PC monitor market 
is more complex than ever. That begins with a much 
broader choice of shapes and sizes. You can go 
seriously big these days. You can also go seriously 
wide, thanks to 21:9 aspect ratio panels. And you 
can go curved for a wrap-around experience.
Meanwhile, several spectacular new image-
enhancement technologies have emerged over the 
last two years. It wasn‚Äôt that long ago that refresh 
rates for LCD monitors were stuck at 60Hz. Now you 
can go up to 160Hz. Gamers can also opt for dynamic 
refresh rates synched with the output of their video 
card. Then there‚Äôs the widespread adoption of far 
higher resolutions, such as 4K or UHD.
Even more recently, there‚Äôs been a revolution in 
colors and contrast. HDR, or high dynamic range, is 
the latest technology to hit the display market. It‚Äôs 
already pretty much taken over the high-end HDTV 
segment. Now it‚Äôs beginning to assimilate monitors. 
However, the process will be more complicated 
on the PC, as if the practicalities of implementing 
HDR weren‚Äôt already complex enough. Point being, 
you‚Äôll be able to pick and choose between various 
aspects of what has become known as HDR.
An example is quantum dot technology. It‚Äôs 
a color enhancement feature that isn‚Äôt strictly 
associated with increasing dynamic range, but 
it‚Äôs part of the broader HDR toolkit that‚Äôs 
Ô¨Ånding its way into PC monitors. So, 
let‚Äôs dissect the high-end PC 
display market.

MAXIMUMPC
maximumpc.com
SPRING 2017

LET‚ÄôS TAKE A TOUR around the recent history of 
the high-end PC monitor. Remember when a 24-
inch widescreen monitor with a 1920x1200 native 
resolution constituted high end? We‚Äôre thinking 
2004, and the Dell 2405FPW. You can get something 
close to that for about 100 bucks today. Incredible.
About three years later, Dell shook things up 
again with the 3007WFP, a 30-inch 2560x1600 beast 
that was so spectacular at the time, it was hard to 
imagine anything bigger. But a further Ô¨Åve years 
down the road in 2017, and the 3007 is toast.
Screen tech is advancing at breakneck speed. One 
moment you‚Äôre marveling at the latest superwide 
curved monitor, the next you‚Äôre having your entire 
Ô¨Åeld of view saturated by staggering HDR visuals 
courtesy of a 55-inch UHDTV, and every monitor 
you‚Äôve ever used before suddenly seems tiny.
But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. Choices must 
be made. You can‚Äôt have everything in one monitor. 
For instance, let‚Äôs say you wanted a 4K screen with 
160Hz refresh, and 40-inch-plus diagonal. It can‚Äôt be 
had. So, you need to be clear on your priorities.
Let‚Äôs look at gamer-centric tech, including ultra-
high refresh rates. High refresh on the desktop is 
nice. It‚Äôs hard to go back to a 60Hz panel once you‚Äôve 
experienced 120Hz-plus. But, arguably, anything 
above 120Hz for the desktop is redundant. Adaptive 
refresh technology, including Nvidia‚Äôs G-Sync and 
AMD‚Äôs FreeSync, is even more gamer-centric. If you 
don‚Äôt game much, you can probably ignore it.
Now let‚Äôs move on to size and shape. Your options 
are extensive and the choice subjective. It is also 
intimately related to native resolution. For starters, 
bigger isn‚Äôt always better. The UHD or 4K pixel grid of 
3840x2160 sounds impressive. On a 32-inch monitor, 
it gives a nice, tight pixel pitch, crisp fonts, and loads 
of detail. On a 50-inch panel, it‚Äôs a whole different 
ball game. At least, it is at normal PC monitor 
viewing distances. You can move further away with 
a larger panel, but if the apparent size is then the 
same, what‚Äôs the point? Likewise, is a screen hooked 
up to a PC while you sit on a couch 15 feet away a 
monitor or a TV? Similarly, it‚Äôs possible to go too 
big in terms of panel viewability. Beyond 40 inches, 
a screen situated at conventional monitor viewing 
distances requires a whole lot of head craning.
That said, many people who thought 30-inch 
panels were too big 10 years ago are probably happily 
running 32-inch or 34-inch monitors today. What 
feels unwieldy at Ô¨Årst, can soon make reverting to a 
smaller screen seem restrictive. On a similar note, 
where do projectors Ô¨Åt in? A projector can never be a 
direct replacement for a PC monitor, yet nothing can 
compete with their sheer cinematic scale.
POINTS OF VIEW
Aspect ratio is another consideration. Superwide 
21:9-aspect monitors are gaining traction. They‚Äôre 
fantastic for movies. They work great with games. 
They can be thoroughly ergonomic for viewing 
multiple documents or web pages at the same time, 
too. But they‚Äôre also restrictive in terms of vertical 
resolution and desktop space. So, while you may 
be able to view documents side by side more easily, 
your view of each is more limited, which means 
more scrolling. The 21:9 aspect is also distinctly 
sub-optimal for standard 16:9 HDTV video content.
Curved versus Ô¨Çat is yet another geometric 
conundrum. In our experience, this is a question 
of personal preference. Some people love curved 
screens, others think they look ridiculous. We argue 
that the bigger a screen is, the more sense a little 
curve can make. But just remember, 
not all screens sport the same 
curve. Some are curvier than 
others. So, head down to your 
local store, and get a feel for the 
various radii of curve on offer.
All of which brings us to plain, 
old image quality. Partly, that‚Äôs a 
Above from left to right: 
The Asus PA329Q has 
advanced quantum dot 
technology, but it‚Äôs the 
purist‚Äôs choice.
The Dell UP3017Q is 
one of the Ô¨Årst OLED PC 
monitors to arrive‚Äîbut 
it costs a fortune. 
LG‚Äôs 38UC99 is the 
latest superwide 
curved-screen wonder.
This HDTV is big and 
beautiful, but do you 
really want a 50-inch 
screen as a PC monitor?

question of panel choice. At this end of the spectrum, 
it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll be considering a TN panel, though 
some gamers prefer TN at any price, thanks to its 
superior pixel response. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a 
choice between IPS and VA panels, plus closely 
related variants thereof, such as Samsung‚Äôs PLS 
tech, which is essentially IPS by another name.
Ultimately, the traditional divisions here remain. 
IPS is the best choice for color accuracy and viewing 
angles, while VA delivers the best contrast and color 
saturation. So, you‚Äôll want IPS for a super-precise 
pro-style monitor, or VA for the ultimate in visual pop 
and punch. That said, those traditional categories 
are blurring. An IPS display with quantum dot 
backlight technology can have colors with even 
more pop than VA with a conventional LED backlight.
What‚Äôs more, the emergence of HDR, or high 
dynamic range, technology is complicating matters, 
It feels like OLED has been the 
next big thing in monitor tech for 
about a decade. It‚Äôs been one of 
those technologies that seems to 
always be just around the corner, 
but somehow never arrives.
OLED, or Organic Light 
Emitting Diode, tech has actually 
been successful on the small 
scale of smartphone displays 
for several years. Scaling 
the technology reliably and 
affordably for big displays has 
proven more difÔ¨Åcult. However, 
the major brands in the HDTV 
market went big on OLED at CES 
earlier this year. What‚Äôs more, 
the Ô¨Årst laptops with full OLED 
displays have now gone on sale, 
including the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 
Yoga and the latest Alienware 13.
Strictly speaking, the Ô¨Årst 
OLED PC monitors have also 
arrived. The Dell UP3017Q 
delivers an OLED panel in a 
30-inch 4K form factor. Problem 
is, it‚Äôs a $5,000 screen. OLED, 
then, isn‚Äôt exactly mainstream. 
But it will be worth the wait 
when it does become more 
affordable. That‚Äôs because, when 
you get right down to it, LCD is a 
fundamentally borked technology 
on which to base a large, full-
color display. When you sit in 
front of the latest 4K HDR LCD TV, 
that‚Äôs easy to forget. The world‚Äôs 
display engineers have done an 
amazing job of compensating 
for the obvious Ô¨Çaws in LCD 
technology. But the advantage 
OLED has, by virtue of each pixel 
being its own light source in 
terms of contrast, viewing, and 
response, is simply too much. 
Already, OLED beats LCD hands 
down in many areas, and it‚Äôs still 
a nascent technology. A decade 
from now, OLED displays will 
be making anything with an LCD 
panel look utterly ancient.
WHEREFORE ART THOU, OLED?
a subject we covered in depth in our January issue. 
Long story short, HDR uses technologies, including 
local backlight dimming, to dramatically increase 
the range of brightness a screen can display. 
The new HDR standards also bring with them an 
expansion in color spaces, and support for up to 12 
bits of color per channel‚Äîin the past, even high-end 
monitors have been limited to eight bits per channel.
A true HDR monitor is capable of much greater 
highs and much lower lows than a conventional 
screen. The results can be spectacular, but HDR 
may not be for everyone. A 32-inch 4K IPS monitor 
with quantum dot technology is a very different 
proposition from something like a large 4K TV with 
HDR capability, to the point where it‚Äôs more a case 
of what Ô¨Åts your needs than necessarily determining 
which is better. You pays your money. You takes your 
choice. And the end result is a stunning screen. 
Lenovo‚Äôs Yoga 
X1 is one of the 
Ô¨Årst vaguely 
affordable PCs 
with an OLED 
display.

not going to get 10- or 12-bit color support, 
for instance. In strict terms, that limits your 
content mastering options. Nor can you 
expect the U3477PQU to be loaded up with 
the latest gaming-centric goodness. It tops 
out at a 60Hz refresh, it doesn‚Äôt support 
adaptive synching, and it‚Äôs completely Ô¨Çat.
That said, the U3477PQU is far from 
without gaming merit. AOC gives you four 
levels of pixel overdrive, so you can decide 
if you want to minimize blurring by ramping 
the overdrive to the max, in return for some 
inverse ghosting. That 34-inch 21:9 panel, 
with its 3440x1440 grid, is a very nice 
compromise for real-world gaming, too. 
It‚Äôs big enough to feel cinematic, and the 
pixel count provides lots of detail without 
presenting your GPU with a huge overload.
You could make a similar argument for 
the U3477PQU as a day-to-day productivity 
monitor. We‚Äôd prefer 32-inch 4K for the 
superior pixel pitch and additional desktop 
real estate. The 21:9 aspect ratio can also 
create its own problems: 16:9 TV content 
looks silly (and small) framed by thick 
black bars either side, for instance. Those 
1,440 pixels of vertical resolution will feel 
constraining for some. But at this price, 
it‚Äôs a decent compromise if you want a 
screen that can turn its hand to a little bit 
of everything, and look slick in the process.
WHAT TO MAKE OF AOC‚ÄôS slick, superwide 
U3477PQU? It comes down to your point of 
view. If you‚Äôre a serious player in the true 
high end of the monitor market, it‚Äôs not 
going to be on your radar. But if you want to 
get a slice of the high-end action at a more 
attainable price, slap it on your shortlist.
It all starts with the 34-inch LCD panel. 
It‚Äôs a proper IPS item. It‚Äôs also 34 inches 
across the diagonal, and packs a 3440x1440 
pixel punch. For most mere mortals, that‚Äôs 
plenty. The 21:9 aspect ratio also adds an 
element of the exotic. AOC has done a nice 
job of giving the chassis and stand a quality 
consumer electronics vibe, too. 
Image quality doesn‚Äôt disappoint, either. 
It‚Äôs more vibrant than the more expensive LG 
38UC99, even if it can‚Äôt match the quantum-
dot brigade with their eye-popping colors. 
It doesn‚Äôt suffer from any major accuracy 
Ô¨Çaws either. There‚Äôs a little banding when 
viewing gradients, but it‚Äôs subtle. The black 
and white scales show virtually no evidence 
of compression, so the factory calibration 
is solid. It‚Äôs IPS, so the viewing angles are 
great, and both black levels and contrast 
are good. It can‚Äôt compete with a VA panel or 
an HDR screen with local dimming for really 
inky blackness, but that‚Äôs inevitable.
Similarly, you have to be realistic about 
the overall feature set at this price. You‚Äôre 
Six hundred bucks, but still a bargain

rotation to portrait mode. While the overall 
feel is robust, it‚Äôs far from chunky or old-
fashioned, thanks to a very slim bezel. What 
you don‚Äôt get is a curved panel, zany refresh 
rates, frame synching, or crazy levels of 
pixel overdrive. It‚Äôs all about precision.
Fire her up, and initial impressions are 
glorious. The PA329Q is supervibrant, but 
without that uber-saturated look that many 
TVs go for in order to achieve superÔ¨Åcial 
punch. Think of it as both power and control 
when it comes to colors. The viewing angles 
are pretty much immaculate, too, and the 
anti-glare coating is superclean and free 
from grain or sparkle. Plus, there‚Äôs the 
razor sharpness due to that tight pixel pitch. 
The basic calibration is bang on, with 
Ô¨Çawless detail in white and black scales, 
and visually perfect gradients. The default 
6,500K color temperature is a little warm 
subjectively, and the IPS panel can‚Äôt compete 
with the latest VA screens for contrast and 
black levels. Likewise, support for a higher 
refresh rate would be nice, but that‚Äôs limited 
by display interface bandwidth.
In all other regards, this is a screen with 
which you could have a long and meaningful 
relationship. The advent of OLED tech 
notwithstanding, it‚Äôs easy to imagine the 
PA329Q still looking stunning in Ô¨Åve years. 
It ain‚Äôt cheap, but it is a good investment.
SUPERWIDE 21:9 aspect screens with crazy 
curves? Wall-sized UHDTVs masquerading 
as PC monitors? Gaming gimmicks such as 
adaptive sync and 160Hz refresh? They‚Äôre 
all very well, but it‚Äôs time to put away the 
big boys‚Äô toys and get serious. Enter the 
new ProArt PA329Q, Asus‚Äôs shot at a lasting 
monument to visual precision.
It isn‚Äôt big by high-end standards. It‚Äôs 
just 32 inches. But it is 4K, which has 
implications for pixel pitch and sharpness. 
As its name suggests, it‚Äôs aimed at serious 
productivity, therefore the core technology 
is IPS, with added color-Ô¨Ådelity chops.
In terms of color reproduction, that 
includes 10-bit per channel support, along 
with a 14-bit look-up table for precision 
calibration. But what marks the PA329Q out 
as cutting edge is the addition of quantum-
dot backlight enhancement for even greater 
color dynamism. The result is 100 percent 
coverage of the Adobe RGB color space. 
Asus also claims that factory calibration 
guarantees a sub-two Delta E color space.
The bottom line is that this display will 
enable you to properly master content for 
HDR compliance, including the Rec. 2020 
video 
gamut. 
The 
PA329Q‚Äôs 
physical 
bearing reÔ¨Çects its pro remit, too. There‚Äôs 
a pleasing quality to the chassis and stand, 
the latter being fully adjustable, including

and pleasing colors. The out-of-the-
box calibration is mostly very good, too. 
Black and white scales show no signs of 
compression, and if anything we prefer the 
BenQ‚Äôs default color temperature. It‚Äôs bang 
on. That said, a whiff of banding in gradients 
is visible. Similarly, the anti-glare coating 
suffers from just a touch of graininess.
Move the frame of reference beyond its 
Asus nemesis, and it‚Äôs down to personal 
preference. On the one hand, it blows away 
all the larger screens in terms of crispness, 
detail, and accuracy. There‚Äôs no substitute 
for more pixels per inch. On the other, 
it‚Äôs not gaming-centric. There‚Äôs no high 
refresh rate, no frame synching, no HDR 
or mega-bright backlight, or incredible 
contrast ratios. Its pixel response is merely 
adequate, too. And at 32 inches, it‚Äôs not 
going to Ô¨Åll in as a home cinema screen. 
However, most of those complaints are 
largely beside the point. This isn‚Äôt a gaming 
monitor or a home cinema screen, even if 
it can turn its hand to those tasks. Instead, 
it‚Äôs a conventional PC monitor that majors 
on productivity, and delivers an upscale 
experience for a reasonable price. The Asus 
PA329Q may be the superior monitor, but 
it‚Äôs also more expensive. If you can‚Äôt quite 
stretch to the Asus, you‚Äôll be grateful BenQ 
is offering this more affordable option.
SPARE A THOUGHT for the BenQ PD3200U. 
While the Asus ProArt PA329Q struts about, 
Ô¨Çaunting its quantum dot-enhanced colors, 
the PD3200U must make do with an LED 
backlight. However, this otherwise similar 
BenQ monitor has its own appeal.
Mostly, that comes down to price. The 
BenQ rocks in at just under $900, while the 
Asus sports a much heftier $1,250 sticker. 
Both share very similar core speciÔ¨Åcations 
and form factor: 32 inches of precision IPS 
panel, and the 3840x2160 pixel grid that 
denotes full-on 4K action. Like the Asus, the 
BenQ offers 10-bit per channel color, too. 
The PD3200U also cuts a similar dash 
on the desktop. It aims for a sober suit 
that majors on quality and functionality, 
including a fully adjustable stand that 
supports rotation to portrait. That said, it 
doesn‚Äôt have quite as pleasingly slim a bezel 
as the Asus. From there, you begin to see 
where BenQ achieves some cost savings.
The PD3200U delivers 100 percent of the 
smaller sRGB color space, rather than the 
more fulsome Adobe RGB gamut the Asus 
notches up. Similarly, where the Asus is 
fully Rec. 2020 compliant, the BenQ only 
musters the FullHD Rec. 720 color space. 
In practice, however, the BenQ doesn‚Äôt 
feel like you make much of a trade-off. It 
really is beautiful, with subtle yet vibrant

up and to the right by half a pixel, and Ô¨Åre 
again. Rinse and repeat, except so fast the 
eye can‚Äôt see the oscillations, and add clever 
image processing to smooth everything out.
The result isn‚Äôt true 4K. The math works 
out to around four million pixels, where 
1080p is two million, and 4K is eight million. 
But from your video card‚Äôs perspective, the 
projector accepts a 4K input. But what about 
your eyes? Without question, it‚Äôs a huge leap 
over standard HD. The crispness and detail 
is on a whole new level. If you‚Äôd never seen 
a true 4K projector, you‚Äôd probably believe 
this was the real 4K deal. Even if you had, 
you‚Äôd probably be fooled. The step up to true 
4K isn‚Äôt as dramatic as the step from FullHD 
to this pixel-shift option.  
It‚Äôs a very nice projector in general terms, 
too. LCD technology has come a long way, 
and the contrast and colors are superb. The 
full-feature optics are remote-controlled, 
which makes the 5040UB a cinch to set up, 
even when installed on a ceiling mount or 
similar. It‚Äôs virtually silent in operation, 
too. On the other hand, it‚Äôs physically a big 
ol‚Äô box, and the usual projector limitations 
apply. You can‚Äôt just stick it in any old room 
and use it any old time. Ambient lighting 
conditions need to be managed. But for 
gaming and video on a truly cinematic scale, 
nothing else here comes close.
WANT A REGULAR 4K monitor? Not a 
problem. You can have one for 300 bucks. 
Hell, you can get a 40-inch 4K TV for 
even less than that. Prices really have 
plummeted. But projectors? Not so much.
Projectors always have been a niche 
market. Volumes are lower, prices higher, 
innovation not as brisk. It also doesn‚Äôt help 
that one of the major projector technologies, 
Texas Instruments‚Äô DLP, remains locked 
down under patent protection. The likes 
of Intel Ô¨Çirted with shaking things up with 
LCOS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon), then 
decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle.
Anyway, just as 1080p FullHD was slow 
to make the move into the projector market, 
so it is with 4K or UHD. But it is happening. 
There‚Äôs been a number of mega-money 4K 
projectors available for a while, but now 
the Ô¨Årst consumer models are appearing. 
They‚Äôre not cheap‚Äîthe Epson PowerLite 
5040UB rocks the scales at $2,999, but 
it‚Äôs not some $20,000 monster aimed at 
professional installations.
There is a catch: It‚Äôs not true 4K. In fact, 
it‚Äôs a triple-LCD projector, with a native 
resolution of 1920x1080, and what Epson 
calls ‚Äú4K enhancement.‚Äù The details involve 
what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúpixel shift.‚Äù The idea is 
simple: First, project the native 1920x1080 
grid, then use the optics to shift the grid

available, it‚Äôs questionable how relevant 
that all is. Instead, the 38UC99 seems to 
major on what you might call traditional 
monitor qualities. Plenty of pixels. A high-
quality panel. High-Ô¨Ådelity color support. A 
nice, enveloping panel curve. That kind of 
thing. On paper, it‚Äôs our kind of screen.
As soon as you Ô¨Åre it up, however, it‚Äôs 
obvious something is missing‚Äîa sense 
of pizzazz. For sure, the pixel pitch is nice 
and crisp, albeit not as sharp as a 32-inch 
4K panel. For the most part, it‚Äôs nicely 
calibrated out of the box, too. The black 
and white scales show loads of detail, and 
gradients are Ô¨Çawless. Additional points 
should also be awarded for a proper 
execution of FreeSync that isn‚Äôt spoiled by 
nasty ghosting when enabled.
But there‚Äôs no getting away from it. 
Compared to the likes of, say, the Asus 
PA329Q, and its quantum dot-enhanced 
colors, the 38UC99 looks dull. It even looks 
tepid next to some of the cheaper panels 
here. The outright contrast and black levels 
are underwhelming, and the anti-glare 
coating suffers from a little sparkle. All of 
which means it looks great on paper, and 
comes very nicely calibrated, but lacks 
the kind of visual Ô¨Åzz you‚Äôve every right to 
expect at this price. It‚Äôs a certainly good 
monitor, but it‚Äôs deÔ¨Ånitely not a great one.
AS YOU PLAN A GROUP TEST, and the slots Ô¨Åll 
up, there‚Äôs usually one entrant that stands 
out. One that feels like a winner in the 
making. This time, it‚Äôs LG‚Äôs new 38UC99.
As a 21:9 aspect ratio panel, that‚Äôs 
surprising. After all, superwide screens 
are an acquired taste. But with the 38UC99, 
LG has hammered the main shortcoming of 
such screens‚Äîlimited vertical resolution 
and desktop space‚Äîinto the stands.
The Ô¨Årst 29-inch 21:9 LCD monitors 
managed just 1,080 vertical pixels. Then a 
new 34-inch generation arrived, and upped 
the ante to 1,440 vertical pixels. Good 
enough for most, but not quite enough for 
everyone. Now LG has ramped the 21:9 
category up to 38 inches and 1,600 vertical 
pixels. That‚Äôs gotta be enough, surely?
The rest of the specs look promising, 
too. The overall pixel grid is 3840x1600, so 
there‚Äôs oodles of elbow room. The panel 
tech is IPS, and there‚Äôs 10-bit color support 
enabling 99 percent of the sRGB color space. 
LG has also added a few extras in the form 
of 75Hz refresh when used in concert with 
FreeSync adaptive frame rate technology.
That still means there‚Äôs a number of 
cutting-edge features missing. You don‚Äôt 
get really high refresh rates, HDR support, 
a backlight with quantum dots, or any of that 
jazz. Of course, with very little HDR content 
Superwide? Make ours extra large...

HDR, no quantum dots, no high refresh, no 
exotic color space support.
All that would be Ô¨Åne were it not for one 
other detail: It costs around $1,100. That‚Äôs 
mega money given the overall spec, and 
means the Philips is not only nearly double 
the money of the similar AOC monitor, but 
more expensive than the 100Hz, ultra-
curved, quantum dot Samsung CF791. 
Question is, can the Philips somehow make 
up for its implausibly high price?
In a word, no. Don‚Äôt get us wrong, this 
is a very nice screen. It has the measure 
of LG‚Äôs 38UC99 for colors, pop, and punch, 
for instance. There are no nasties from the 
factory calibration, either. The white and 
black scales look good, and the gradients 
are nice and smooth. Ditto the anti-glare 
coating. The pixel response is decent for an 
IPS display, and Philips includes an option in 
the OSD to tweak the overdrive levels, and 
thus choose between speed and accuracy.
The chassis has an intriguingly spacey 
design, and feels well put together, even if 
the tilt-only stand is pathetic at this price. 
All told, it‚Äôs a nice display. Shave $400 or 
$500 off the price, and it would be easy to 
recommend. We wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to 
see it experience a major price drop. Until 
that happens, it‚Äôs impossible to recommend 
when there are better screens for less cash.
FORGIVE US A PHILOSOPHICAL interlude. If 
you need to double-check both the product 
itself and its spec sheet to conÔ¨Årm the 
presence of a given technology or feature, 
does that feature have any value?
Adaptive frame sync had us pondering 
along those lines. It‚Äôs one of those 
technologies where it isn‚Äôt obvious whether 
it‚Äôs working correctly. But we‚Äôve never felt 
like that about curved LCD screens. They 
split opinion, sure, but not being able to see 
the difference hasn‚Äôt been an issue.
Until the Philips Brilliance BDM349OUC, 
that is. That‚Äôs surprising, because it has 
the same 3800R curvature as several other 
34-inch displays. The explanation very 
likely comes down to context. Both of the 
Samsung displays in this group test are so 
curvy by comparison, the Philips looks Ô¨Çat. 
The mild curve makes for moderate impact 
at most. That either makes it a good choice 
if you‚Äôre unsure of the merits of curved 
panels, or a monitor that doesn‚Äôt fully 
deliver on the curved-screen proposition. 
Curvature aside, however, how does the 
BDM349OUC shape up? On paper, it all looks 
pretty familiar. The 3440x1440 pixel grid is 
standard for a 21:9 and 34-inch screen, as 
is the IPS panel technology. Elsewhere, the 
feature set is pretty thin when it comes to 
image quality enhancements. There‚Äôs no 
Ahead of the curve or overpriced?

Brilliance. Whether that‚Äôs a good thing or 
not is subjective. Let‚Äôs just say if you‚Äôre not 
sure about curves, steer clear of the CF791.
Curvature aside, this is a great-looking 
panel. It doesn‚Äôt immediately blow your 
socks off like an HDR UHDTV playing high 
dynamic range content. But it‚Äôs more 
vibrant than a non-quantum dot monitor. 
The default calibration is a bit warm 
for our liking, pushing Ô¨Çesh tones toward 
pink. There‚Äôs a big gap between the color 
temperature presets, too, so you need to do 
a full calibration to dial that out. But that‚Äôs 
typical given the panel tech is VA, rather 
than IPS. Elsewhere, it‚Äôs well set up out of 
the box, with a good balance between detail 
in whites and black, and smooth gradients.
Objective concerns aside, the subjective 
experience rendering 4K video is stunning, 
even if the 3440x1440 native resolution is 
sub-4K Ô¨Ådelity. With that 100Hz refresh 
and adaptive sync support, plus better pixel 
response than just about any VA panel we‚Äôve 
seen, this is one heck of a gaming panel, too. 
And it‚Äôs a good-looking hunk of consumer 
electronics, thanks to Samsung‚Äôs typically 
snazzy styling. With that hefty curvature 
and the extreme 21:9 aspect, it‚Äôs an acquired 
taste rather than a sure-Ô¨Åre hit, but if you‚Äôre 
looking for a 34-inch curved screen, the 
CF791 should be near the top of your list.
IT‚ÄôS REMARKABLE how quickly the 34-inch, 
21:9 aspect segment has become almost 
a staple in the higher echelons of the PC 
monitor market. Even with the addition of a 
curved panel, you‚Äôre still not talking about 
anything exotic. Just a few years ago, a 34-
inch panel with such superwide proportions 
would have seemed almost preposterous.
Still, even by the standards of such 
screens, the Samsung CF791 is special. 
For starters, it boasts an LED backlight 
enhanced with quantum dot technology. 
The basics of quantum dot involve materials 
that absorb certain frequencies of light, 
convert them, and re-emit. The ‚Äúquantum‚Äù 
bit is because the semiconductor crystal 
on which it‚Äôs based leverages a nanoscale 
effect known as quantum conÔ¨Ånement, 
which 
involves 
electron 
holes, 
two-
dimensional potential wells, and the exciton 
Bohr radius. But you knew that, obviously.
Basically, it takes suboptimal light output 
from an LED backlight, and buffs it up to 
enable increased color vibrancy and Ô¨Ådelity. 
The CF791 also sports a couple of gaming-
friendly features: 100Hz refresh and AMD 
FreeSync adaptive refresh support.
Finally, it‚Äôs curved. Not just any old 
curved, but 1500R curved. That means 
the curve‚Äôs radius is a yard and a half or 
so‚Äîover twice as curved as the Philips 
Samsung gets a serious curve on

words, it leaps all the hurdles that TVs used 
to stumble over when used as a PC monitor.
That‚Äôs thanks in part to the fact that 
this 9 Series Samsung is a member of the 
brave new army of HDR TVs. With support 
for the HDR 1000 standard come several 
features that help it perform in the exacting 
environment of a PC, including expanded 
color space, with 10-bit per channel 
capability, and an LED backlight augmented 
by local dimming and quantum dot tech.
The result is stunning, but has its 
limitations. As a gaming monitor, it is 
staggering. The huge panel with plenty of 
curve makes for an incredibly immersive 
experience. It is the most impressive 
gaming display we‚Äôve experienced, though 
the lack of both 120Hz-plus refresh support 
and adaptive frame synching means it can‚Äôt 
check every gaming box.
It‚Äôs stellar for 4K video content, too. But as 
a conventional PC monitor for web browsing 
or productivity work, it‚Äôs less convincing. 
While the pixel pitch is tolerable, fonts aren‚Äôt 
nearly as crisp as a 32-inch 4K monitor. And 
you don‚Äôt actually get any additional screen 
real estate. The practicality of such a huge 
screen is questionable to say the least, too. 
And while the quantum dot-powered panel 
packs an incredible punch, it‚Äôs hardly the 
last word in accuracy.
WORD 
TO 
THE 
WISE: Unless you are 
seriously considering a large UHDTV like 
the Samsung 9 Series as some kind of PC 
monitor, don‚Äôt try one just for fun. It will ruin 
you for conventional PC monitors. It makes 
almost every other monitor seem tiny.
Take the LG 38UC99. It‚Äôs a 38-inch beast, 
with a 21:9 aspect ratio, and by any sane 
metric, it‚Äôs a big PC monitor. But we set it up 
after assessing this Samsung monster, and 
it looked pitiful. At 55 inches, this Samsung 
9 Series model is nothing special by UHDTV 
standards (they go up to 78 inches), but set 
up as a PC monitor at PC monitor viewing 
distances, it dominates your Ô¨Åeld of view, 
and recalibrates your deÔ¨Ånition of big.
However, don‚Äôt go thinking this screen is 
a one-trick pony. This isn‚Äôt like the bad old 
days of large HDTVs, where size was all you 
got, and everything else‚Äîcolor accuracy, 
response, pixel pitch‚Äîsucked. Thanks to 
that 4K 3840x2160 grid, the pixel pitch is 
reasonable, if not awe-inspiring. Just as 
impressive is the out-of-the box calibration 
and ease of use. Hooked up to a modern 
graphics card with HDMI 2.0 support, in 
this case an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, this 
thing just works. What‚Äôs more, both black 
and white scales show plenty of detail, and 
gradient rendering is smooth. There‚Äôs little, 
if any, noticeable input lag, either. In other 
If bigger is better, we‚Äôve found a winner

have a huge amount to offer, though. The 
AOC U3477PQU is the easy pick as the 
value proposition. For around $600, you 
get a great 34-inch superwide IPS panel, 
wrapped in a slick chassis. Sure, it isn‚Äôt 
exactly loaded with extras, but it‚Äôs a large 
heap of screen for the money.
As for the Samsung 9 Series SUHDTV, in 
many ways, it‚Äôs the most stunning display 
that we have ever hooked up to a PC. 
Thanks to its HDR-capable feature set, 4K 
resolution, and epic panel size, it makes for 
a simply stellar gaming experience, even 
without frame synching or high refresh 
support. It‚Äôs not badly calibrated for use as a 
PC monitor, either. However, its size is also 
its downfall, both in terms of practicality, 
and the impact on pixel pitch. Epson‚Äôs 
PowerLite 5040UB, meanwhile, falls into 
a category all of its own. As a vaguely 
affordable way to go beyond 1080p with a 
projector, we highly recommend it. But just 
FIRST, A FEW WORDS ON HDR. It‚Äôs undoubtedly 
the screen technology du jour. But it‚Äôs also 
of marginal beneÔ¨Åt on the PC‚Äîcurrently. 
The hardware is ready. You can buy an 
HDR screen, and the latest graphics cards 
from Nvidia and AMD are ready to roll. 
The problem is the content. There almost 
isn‚Äôt any.
It‚Äôs a particular problem on the PC 
at the moment. Service providers who 
are currently streaming in HDR, such as 
Amazon Prime, are yet to support the PC. 
Meanwhile, true HDR PC games‚Äîrather 
than games that render in HDR internally, 
but then knock the output back to SDR‚Äî
have yet to arrive. With that in mind, we 
would recommend viewing HDR more as an 
investment in the future, rather than a killer 
feature today. The fact that few PC monitors 
are currently HDR-compliant is therefore 
no huge loss. 
HDR or no, there are some fabulous 
screens on test this month. However, two 
stand out as relative stinkers, namely the 
Philips Brilliance BDM3490UC and the LG 
38UC99. The Philips is undone purely by 
pricing. It‚Äôs not a Ô¨Çawed product, it‚Äôs just 
far too expensive. As for the LG, we had 
very high hopes. But its subdued, even dull, 
image quality pulls the rug out from under 
our enthusiasm. The remaining six screens 
like any projector, it has niche, albeit highly 
cinematic, appeal.
That just leaves us with our podium-
position competitors, all three of which are 
superb displays. The Samsung CF791 is a 
fabulous multimedia display. Whether it‚Äôs 
games, video, or productivity, it‚Äôs a delight 
to use and genuinely innovative, with its 
quantum dot tech and extreme curve. 
The BenQ PD3200U, on the other hand, is 
the perfect foil for the CF791. It delivers 
precision and accuracy in a straightforward 
package, and at a competitive price.
But the overall honors have to go to the 
Asus ProArt PA329Q. It‚Äôs a serious piece 
of precision display engineering. It has a 
strong feature set for professional content 
creation, gorgeous high-DPI 4K image 
quality, and plenty of future-prooÔ¨Ång with 
the likes of quantum dot color enhancement. 
If you are serious about computing, it‚Äôs one 
of the very best monitors money can buy. 
The Asus ProArt PA329Q is a serious piece of 
precision display engineering, future-proofed
with quantum dot color enhancement.
ASUS PROART PA329Q

Give Windows a shot in the arm by 
cleaning up and optimizing your PC  
By Nick Peers
S
pring is in the air, so it‚Äôs the perfect 
time to take a virtual vacuum to your 
computer. Every year, it‚Äôs the same 
old story: Despite your best intentions, 
you rapidly lose control of what goes on 
to your PC, as programs are installed 
and forgotten, while gigabytes of Ô¨Åles‚Äî
from documents to photos and videos‚Äî
are copied multiple times to a myriad 
locations, clogging up your hard drives. 
The result? A computer that‚Äôs slow to start, 
performs sluggishly, and is approaching 
the limits of your storage capacity.
The changing of the seasons brings the 
whiff of new life, and again, you resolve to 
clean out your PC, and see whether you 
can bring it back to those heady days of its 
youth, when it performed with a noticeable 
zip. And this is where we come in. We‚Äôre 
going to reveal all the tips and tools you 
need to get your PC properly cleaned up 
and raring to go. We‚Äôll avoid snake-oil 
remedies, such as Registry cleaning, to 
focus on techniques that actually make a 
difference to your PC‚Äôs performance.
We‚Äôve split the feature into four sections, 
enabling you to take your cleaning as far 
as you wish. Don‚Äôt want to dig too deep? 
Our light clean focuses on quick and easy 
ways to clean out space using only those 
tools provided by Windows itself. Feeling 
a bit braver? We introduce a couple of 
tools that go further than Windows does. 
Then we move on to tackle the problem of 
duplicate Ô¨Åles, helping you preserve just 
the essentials, and freeing up tens (or 
hundreds) of gigabytes in the process.
If you‚Äôre still not satisÔ¨Åed, we push the 
boat out even further with our deep clean, 
revealing how to balance the competing 
demands of your PC‚Äôs resources, strip 
back unnecessary services, and optimize 
older hard drives so they perform that bit 
quicker. The end result is a revitalized PC, 
one that more closely resembles the lean, 
mean speed machine you bought, ready 
and better able to face the challenges 
you‚Äôll throw at it over the next 12 months.

A
light spring clean can free up 
drive space and improve your PC‚Äôs 
performance 
without 
involving 
any hard work or even third-party tools. 
Everything we feature on these two pages is 
done using Windows‚Äô own built-in tools, so 
without further ado, let‚Äôs get started.
First, check your hard drive is in good 
working order. The quickest way to force 
Windows 10 to perform a complete check 
on your hard drive is to right-click the 
‚ÄúStart‚Äù button, and choose ‚ÄúCommand 
Prompt (Admin).‚Äù Type the following into the 
command prompt window, then hit Enter:
 $ chkdisk /f /r c:
You‚Äôre told the drive can‚Äôt be locked 
(because it‚Äôs in use), so press Y, then 
when you next restart, Windows performs 
a complete check of your hard drive, 
attempting to correct any errors it comes 
across. If it Ô¨Ånds and Ô¨Åxes any, you may 
immediately get a speed boost. Now repeat 
for any other drives you have attached‚Äîif 
you get a warning about forcing a dismount, 
we suggest hitting N, then Y to run the check 
when you next reboot. Once your drives have 
been checked, it‚Äôs time to begin cleaning.
Remove Unwanted Apps
How many programs have you installed 
on your PC? How many do you still use? 
Now is the perfect time to go through all 
the desktop programs and Microsoft Store 
apps you have installed, cleaning out those 
you no longer need or use. To do this, 
click ‚ÄúStart > Settings.‚Äù Select ‚ÄúSystem,‚Äù 
followed by ‚ÄúApps & features.‚Äù
All installed apps and programs are 
listed alphabetically‚Äîyou can, however, 
sort by size (useful if you need to free up 
drive space) or installation date. Go through 
the list, clicking any programs you no 
longer need, and choosing ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù to 
remove them using the standard program 
installer. Some uninstallers leave Registry 
entries and program Ô¨Åles behind‚Äîfor a 
more thorough way to remove programs, 
turn the page.
Perform a Disk Clean
Open File Explorer, and select ‚ÄúThis PC‚Äù 
on the left to reveal a list of all your hard 
drives. Right-click your C drive (or the 
drive Windows is installed on), and choose 
‚ÄúProperties,‚Äù then click the ‚Äò‚ÄúDisk Clean-
up‚Äù button. The step-by-step guide reveals 
how the tool works‚Äîbasically, it enables 
you to quickly clear up all kinds of detritus, 
from the contents of various temporary 
folders to redundant system error logs, and 
even older System Restore points. You can 
run Disk Cleanup across other drives, too, 
but it‚Äôs usually most effective on the drive 
Windows is installed on.
It‚Äôs worth taking a pause before simply 
deleting everything that Windows suggests. 
For example, if you‚Äôve just upgraded to a 
new version of Windows, you should Ô¨Ånd a 
‚ÄúPrevious Windows installation(s)‚Äù entry, 
offering tens of gigabytes of data ready 
to free up‚Äîdon‚Äôt select this until you‚Äôre  
happy you won‚Äôt be rolling back to that 
previous version (note that Windows  
usually deletes these Ô¨Åles after a set time 
anyway; typically 30 days). 
Recently installed a new driver and not 
sure whether it‚Äôs causing problems? Don‚Äôt 
Hopefully, you‚Äôre making good use of File 
History or Windows Backup to ensure your 
critical Ô¨Åles are kept safe and sound. Both 
methods store multiple versions of your 
backups, giving you the option of rolling back 
the changes with individual Ô¨Åles should you 
wish to restore an earlier version.
This protection comes with a price, 
however‚Äîincreased consumption of drive 
space. If you‚Äôre feeling the squeeze, reclaim 
some breathing room by removing the oldest 
backups. Right-click the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button and 
choose ‚ÄúControl Panel.‚Äù File History users 
should click ‚ÄúSave backup copies of your 
Ô¨Åles with File History,‚Äù then click ‚ÄúAdvanced 
settings.‚Äù You can change the frequency of 
backups (to reduce drive consumption going 
forward), plus set a time limit for how long 
backups are kept (‚ÄúUntil space is needed‚Äù 
is safest, but you can specify your own 
time). Click ‚ÄúClean up versions‚Äù to clear out 
space by choosing what backups to delete 
(anything from all but the most recent to 
those backups older than two years).
If you use the Windows Backup tool, select 
‚ÄúBack up and Restore (Windows 7),‚Äù and 
click ‚ÄúManage space,‚Äù then ‚ÄúView backups‚Äù 
to manually select which backups to 
remove. Remember that older backups may 
contain Ô¨Åles you have subsequently deleted, 
so be sure you haven‚Äôt mislaid any critical 
old Ô¨Åles before cleaning up.

touch ‚ÄúDevice driver packages,‚Äù otherwise 
you lose the ‚ÄúRoll back‚Äù option in Device 
Manager. Finally, if you‚Äôre in the middle of 
troubleshooting a problem using a tool  
such as WhoCrashed (www.resplendence.
com), deleting the ‚ÄúSystem error memory 
dump Ô¨Åles‚Äù is not recommended until you‚Äôve 
Ô¨Ånished Ô¨Åxing your problem. Long story 
short: Make sure you read the description 
of each setting before choosing whether  
or not to delete it, and if in doubt, leave it 
where it is for now.
Trim Startup Items
One of the biggest bottlenecks of PC 
performance is the number of processes 
and programs running in the background. 
We look at more extreme ways of bringing 
these under control later on in the feature, 
but for now, the most effective way to give 
your PC a shot in the arm is to review‚Äîand 
clean out, if necessary‚Äîthe programs that 
are set to start with your PC.
The simplest way to do this is with the 
help of Task Manager, so right-click the 
taskbar, and choose ‚ÄúTask Manager.‚Äù 
Click ‚ÄúMore details,‚Äù if necessary, then 
switch to the ‚ÄúStartup‚Äù tab. You‚Äôll see a 
list of programs set to load with Windows, 
complete with publisher, status (enabled 
at 
this 
point), 
and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîstartup 
impact. This latter column helps you  
quickly determine which are the biggest 
resource-hogging programs.
Some programs are‚Äîby necessity‚Äîvital 
to the well-being of your PC, while others 
may be required on a regular basis, such 
as OneDrive or your cloud sync provider. 
Others, however, can be safely disabled, 
so they only run when you want them to. 
To do this, right-click the offending entry, 
and choose ‚ÄúDisable.‚Äù It‚Äôll shave seconds 
off your startup, free up memory and other 
1. CHOOSE FULL SCAN
The Ô¨Årst time you run Disk Cleanup, you‚Äôre 
prompted to wait while it analyzes selected 
parts of your system. When the scan 
completes, you‚Äôre shown an amount of disk 
space you can gain. For a more thorough 
scan, click the ‚ÄúClean up system Ô¨Åles‚Äù 
button, and wait while the scan repeats.
2. REVIEW SCAN ITEMS
You should Ô¨Ånd Windows has found lots 
more free space it can clear. Review each 
item by highlighting it for a description. 
You can select or unselect boxes to add or 
remove items to be cleaned‚Äîyou should 
see the space gained Ô¨Ågure adjust. Ready 
to clean? Click ‚ÄúOK > Delete Files.‚Äù
3. MORE ITEMS TO CLEAN
If you have System Restore enabled, you 
can launch Disk Cleanup again and click 
‚ÄúClean up system Ô¨Åles‚Äù for a second time. 
Switch to the ‚ÄúMore Options‚Äù tab, and 
quickly wipe all but the most recent Restore 
points by clicking the relevant ‚ÄúClean up‚Äù 
button after reading the warnings.
FREE UP DRIVE SPACE WITH DISK CLEANUP
resources, and if you Ô¨Ånd enough items to 
disable, could make a noticeable difference 
to the performance of your PC.
Don‚Äôt recognize an entry? Right-click it, 
and choose ‚ÄúSearch online‚Äù to search the 
web for the underlying Ô¨Åle name. Disabled 
entries can be restored later‚Äîright-click, 
choose ‚ÄúEnable‚Äù‚Äîbut if you‚Äôd like to remove 
them completely, explore the program‚Äôs 
own settings or preferences for an option 
to do so, and they should vanish from sight.
More Cleanup Tweaks
One way to improve performance is to 
take control of the Windows search index. 
This database helps speed up searches on 
frequently accessed folders, by scanning 
them for content, and storing them in a 
database. Sometimes, you‚Äôll want to add 
folders to this index‚Äîdata folders stored 
outside your user folder, for instance‚Äî
while removing others.
To 
manage 
these 
settings, 
type 
‚Äúindexing‚Äù into the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù box, and 
click ‚ÄúChange how Windows searches.‚Äù 
Click ‚ÄúModify‚Äù to choose which folders get 
indexed, by selecting or unselecting them, 
or click ‚ÄúAdvanced,‚Äù where you can change 
the index location (handy if you‚Äôd like to 
store it on another partition for retrieving 
after a Windows reinstall), or switch to the 
‚ÄúFile Types‚Äù tab to choose exactly which 
sort of Ô¨Åles you want to include in your 
index. This latter tip enables you to tune the 
search index to only Ô¨Ånd speciÔ¨Åc document 
or image types, if those are the kinds of Ô¨Åles 
you typically search for.
If you‚Äôre left feeling dissatisÔ¨Åed by your 
light spring clean, turn the page to dig 
deeper and really start to clear the clutter.

D
issatisÔ¨Åed with the results of spring 
cleaning with Windows‚Äô own tools? 
Time to go further. In this section, 
we‚Äôll perform a deeper clean on areas 
already covered, with the help of free third-
party tools, which can also reach areas not 
touched by Windows. As always, caution 
should be your keyword. While cleaning out 
gigabytes of data is satisfying, it can lose 
its allure if you‚Äôve been hasty and discover 
useful shortcuts, such as the Jump lists of 
programs, have been removed.
Remove Apps Thoroughly
Standard program uninstallers tend to 
be conservative, leaving lots of detritus 
behind. This can soon mount up, and while 
you could employ the services of a Registry 
cleaner, the best time to clean up after a 
program is when you remove it. 
Our tool of choice for cleaning out old 
programs is IObit Uninstaller (www.iobit.
com/en/advanceduninstaller.php), 
which 
offers a ‚Äúpowerful scan‚Äù feature after a 
program‚Äôs standard uninstaller Ô¨Ånishes. 
This roots out leftover Ô¨Åles and Registry 
entries, which you review manually, then 
decide whether or not to keep.
During installation, look out for prompts 
to install Advanced SystemCare Free‚Äîit‚Äôs 
from IObit, so safe, but not needed for this 
feature. Once done, Uninstaller launches 
and you‚Äôll see a list of desktop programs. A 
number of options appear on the left, from 
‚ÄúAll Programs‚Äù to ‚ÄúLarge Programs‚Äù and 
‚ÄúInfrequently Used.‚Äù The latter is good for 
weeding out programs you‚Äôre not using.
You‚Äôll see a bin button appear on the right 
of each entry‚Äîclick it, and the program in 
question is uninstalled. IObit Uninstaller 
offers to take a System Restore point 
before uninstalling, which we recommend 
for safety purposes. It then invokes the 
program‚Äôs 
own 
uninstaller‚Äîignore 
prompts to reboot now‚Äîand performs its 
own powerful scan. This roots out potential 
leftovers in the form of Ô¨Åles and Registry 
entries‚Äîyou review the list, decide what to 
remove, then reboot if necessary.
To remove programs in batches, select 
each program you want to get rid of, then 
click ‚ÄúUninstall.‚Äù The ‚ÄúPrograms‚Äù list 
focuses on desktop programs only, so 
select ‚ÄúWindows Apps‚Äù to get a list of apps 
you‚Äôve installed through the Microsoft 
Store, enabling you to remove those, too. 
Select ‚ÄúToolbars & Plug-ins‚Äù to quickly 
review all the browser add-ons you have 
installed (all popular variants‚ÄîIE, Chrome, 
Firefox, Opera, and Edge‚Äîare supported), 
plus remove those you don‚Äôt want, need, or 
recognize. It‚Äôs a quick and effective way to 
trim down your browser‚Äôs resource usage.
Clean More Settings
One of the best free cleanup tools is 
CCleaner (www.piriform.com). The app 
boasts a number of tools to help you clean 
out the detritus and recover gigabytes of 
Ô¨Åles. Its main cleaning component searches 
more than just basic Windows settings, 
including browser settings (a source of 
hundreds of megabytes of potential waste), 
plus popular programs, and apps. It‚Äôs 
tempting to click ‚ÄúAnalyze,‚Äù then clean out 
everything it recommends, but you‚Äôll end up 
losing potentially useful settings. The step-
by-step guide reveals how to use it to free 
up space without deleting those Ô¨Åles you 
didn‚Äôt know you needed.
Outside of its primary cleaning element, 
CCleaner offers a number of other tools. 
Its Registry cleaner is potentially the most 
dangerous, so skip that. Instead, select 
‚ÄúTools,‚Äù where you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd seven cleanup 
tools. The Uninstall section works in the 
same way as Windows‚Äô Apps & Features 
tool, but is outclassed by IObit Uninstaller.
Startup provides you with a more 
comprehensive list of programs and items 
that launch with Windows. This is split into 
three tabs. ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù contains a list of 
programs, organized by location (Registry 
or startup folder). It‚Äôs the same list as in 
Task Manager, with one crucial difference: 
you can permanently delete entries (with 
care), as opposed to just disabling them.
Switch to ‚ÄúScheduled Tasks‚Äù to review 
what tasks Windows and other programs 
have set up‚Äîyou‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd items such as 
backup tasks, program update tasks, 
and so on here. Again, you can disable or 
delete items. Select ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù mode, and 
various Windows-related tasks are shown. 
These should be left alone, so leave the box 
unselected after reviewing it.
One Ô¨Ånal tab‚Äî‚ÄúContext Menu‚Äù‚Äîis worth 
exploring. Frustrated at how programs 
clutter up the menus that appear when you 
right-click items in File Explorer? You‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd 
these items here, referencing ‚ÄúDirectory‚Äù 
(when you right-click a folder), ‚ÄúDrive,‚Äù 
and ‚ÄúFile‚Äù (when you right-click a speciÔ¨Åc 
Ô¨Åle type‚Äîsadly, the actual Ô¨Åle isn‚Äôt listed). 
Disable or delete those you don‚Äôt want‚Äî
if they keep coming back, examine the 
program‚Äôs settings to see if you can disable 
them from there, or use its intransigence  
as an excuse to remove the app completely.
More Tweaks
The ‚ÄúBrowser Plugins‚Äù tab works in a 
similar way to IObit Uninstaller‚Äôs ‚ÄúToolbars 
& Plugins‚Äù section‚Äîit‚Äôs a matter of

clearly labeled, and you can remove them 
individually or in groups (hold Ctrl as you 
click each one to select it) without affecting 
others. The most recent Restore point is 
always grayed out for safety reasons.
The Ô¨Ånal tool, Driver Wiper, makes it 
possible to wipe free space or (with the 
usual precautions) an entire drive securely. 
Instead of marking deleted Ô¨Åles as space 
available for writing over, making them 
vulnerable to data recovery tools, you can 
securely wipe the space by overwriting it. 
This is slow, and should only be done 
when you have sensitive data to wipe. You 
can also wipe free space and mark non-
deleted Ô¨Åles and folders for secure removal 
from CCleaner‚Äôs main Cleaner component‚Äî
scroll to the bottom of the ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù tab, 
and select each box (‚ÄúCustom Files and 
Folders‚Äù refers to any Ô¨Åles or folders you 
specify under ‚ÄúOptions > Include‚Äù). If you‚Äôd 
like CCleaner to securely wipe all Ô¨Åles from 
its Cleaner tool, go to ‚ÄúOptions > Settings,‚Äù 
and select ‚ÄúSecure Ô¨Åle deletion (Slower).‚Äù
4. ANALYZE AND CLEAN
Once you‚Äôre ready, click ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù and 
wait while CCleaner performs a complete 
scan. When it‚Äôs complete, a summary is 
shown, listing all the components you‚Äôve 
selected, complete with how much space 
you might save. As before, review individual 
components by double-clicking them.
1. CHOOSE WHAT TO SCAN
CCleaner‚Äôs Cleaner component comes with 
some settings pre-selected. It‚Äôs a good idea 
to review these thoroughly, unselecting 
those you don‚Äôt want to lose, and selecting 
the settings you‚Äôd like to clean. Unsure 
what Ô¨Åles a particular setting might delete? 
Right-click it and choose ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Ä¶.‚Äù
5. CLEAN UP YOUR PC
Ready? Click ‚ÄúRun Cleaner.‚Äù A warning 
dialog pops up‚Äîthis is your last chance to 
back out (Ô¨Åles are deleted, not sent to the 
Recycle Bin). If you‚Äôre happy to proceed, 
click ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù and watch as CCleaner clears 
up gigabytes of hard drive space to give you 
some much-needed breathing space.
2. REVIEW ANALYSIS
CCleaner performs a limited scan on the 
chosen setting. To view exactly what it‚Äôs 
found, double-click the summary in the 
right-hand pane (such as ‚ÄúMicrosoft Edge‚Äî
Download History‚Äù), and a list of all Ô¨Åles 
is shown. Right-click Ô¨Åles to exclude them 
from future scans or open the parent folder.
6. MANAGE EXCLUSIONS
Click ‚ÄúOptions,‚Äù and select ‚ÄúExclude‚Äù to 
review what items are excluded from your 
scans. You can remove Ô¨Åles you‚Äôve placed 
here (Ctrl-click those Ô¨Åles to select them, 
then click ‚ÄúRemove‚Äù), or add Ô¨Åles, folders, 
Registry keys (not relevant here), and Ô¨Åle 
types to the list by clicking ‚ÄúAdd.‚Äù 
3. CONTINUE CHECKING
Scroll down to view all Windows settings‚Äî
if in doubt, perform an analysis on the 
speciÔ¨Åc setting, or unselect it to exclude it 
from the full scan. When done, switch to the 
‚ÄúApplications‚Äù tab to see which programs 
are supported. Scan these in the same way, 
unselecting those you wish to leave alone.

Y
our PC is hopefully noticeably 
zippier, but there‚Äôs still room for 
improvement. Before we tackle 
a really deep spring clean, let‚Äôs divert 
our attention for a moment to hard drive 
management. Unless you‚Äôre the most 
organized person in the world, it‚Äôs likely 
your Ô¨Åling system is a little haphazard. And 
if you‚Äôve got multiple hard drives, it‚Äôs likely 
you have multiple copies of Ô¨Åles, too.
First, consult the box below for general 
advice on what to look for when rooting out 
and removing duplicates‚Äîthis could save 
you from potentially deleting the wrong Ô¨Åle 
or Ô¨Åles when you come to clean up.
Find Duplicates Quickly
CCleaner comes with a built-in Ô¨Åle duplicate 
Ô¨Ånder, but it‚Äôs not very sophisticated. It 
matches purely on Ô¨Åle name, size, and  
date last modiÔ¨Åed. We want something  
more thorough, so download the free 
version 
of 
Duplicate 
Cleaner 
(www.
digitalvolcano.co.uk/duplicatecleaner.html), 
which has all the functionality you need.
First, choose what to search for‚Äîthe 
default options search Ô¨Åles by content 
rather than name, size, or date. You can also 
set Ô¨Ålters‚Äîsuch as documents, pictures, or 
music‚Äîor Ô¨Åles to include or exclude, plus 
limit your search to Ô¨Åles of a certain size 
and date. For a system-wide sweep, leave 
the defaults as they are, and switch to the 
‚ÄòScan Location‚Äù tab.
Next, elect where to search using the 
tools provided‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs entire drives 
or speciÔ¨Åc folders. If you want to exclude 
a speciÔ¨Åc location, add it in the usual way, 
then right-click it, and choose ‚ÄúExclude 
Selected Path(s).‚Äù When you‚Äôre ready, click 
the ‚ÄúScan Now‚Äù button, and wait while 
Duplicate Cleaner does its work‚Äîit‚Äôs not a 
quick process, so be prepared to leave your 
PC on for several hours or even overnight, 
depending on the size of the folders you‚Äôre 
scanning. If necessary, minimize the scan 
window while you work on other tasks.
You can review the results on the 
‚ÄúDuplicate Files‚Äù tab (‚ÄúDuplicate Folders‚Äù is 
restricted to Pro users only)‚Äîthey‚Äôre listed 
in no particular order. Focus on the largest 
Ô¨Åles by clicking the ‚ÄúSize‚Äù column header 
twice. You can now go through the list, 
manually selecting the duplicates you wish 
to remove, or you can use the ‚ÄúSelection 
Assistant‚Äù buttons to speed things up. 
If you have a single folder or location 
where your original Ô¨Åles sit, you can specify 
that with ‚ÄúSelect by Location,‚Äù which tells 
Duplicate Cleaner to target Ô¨Åles in other 
folders for deletion. Once done, you can 
select all other Ô¨Åles by clicking the magic 
wand button, and choosing ‚ÄúMark > Select 
by group > All but one Ô¨Åle in each group.‚Äù
Duplicate Cleaner offers many matching 
tools to try to automate the selection 
process, but you may Ô¨Ånd it‚Äôs easier, 
quicker, and safer to go through the list 
by hand, weeding out unwanted Ô¨Åles, and 
periodically clicking ‚ÄúFile Removal.‚Äù From 
here, you can choose whether to delete the 
Ô¨Åle completely, or send it to the Recycle Bin.
The program can be quite slow at times, 
and appear non-responsive. The trick is to 
be patient, and it soon comes back to life. 
If there‚Äôs a long list of Ô¨Åles to clean, you 
may want to take a break. Simply close the 
program‚Äîwhen you next launch Duplicate 
Cleaner, your results are ready and waiting 
for you to continue processing.
Manage Your Photos
When it comes to managing your photos, 
you need a tool that can search for similar-
looking images, as well as identical 
matches. You‚Äôll have to upgrade to the 
Pro version of Duplicate Cleaner for that 
functionality, so our favorite alternative 
is the free‚Äîand open-source‚ÄîAntiDupl 
(http://antidupl.sourceforge.net/english/
index.html). Download the latest version, 
and double-click the .exe Ô¨Åle to extract the 
program folder. Open this, and double-click 
‚ÄúAntiDupl.NET.exe‚Äù to get started. The step-
by-step guide reveals the basic procedure 
you need to follow, but as always, it pays to 
Discover how to bring order to your chaotic hard drive
MAKE YOUR HARD 
DRIVE MORE 
MANAGEABLE
Backups of critical Ô¨Åles are‚Äîof course‚Äî
important, so any Ô¨Åle cleaning needs to bear 
this in mind. Also, you may have renamed a 
Ô¨Åle without changing its content, so a good 
duplicate Ô¨Ånder utility should not simply 
match Ô¨Åles by their names (which could 
be disastrous if two completely separate 
Ô¨Åles with the same name become linked 
together), but also by the Ô¨Åle‚Äôs properties, 
too, from its size to the date it was last 
modiÔ¨Åed‚Äîthat‚Äôs especially important with 
digital photos that have been downloaded 
from different cloud providers, each one 
naming them differently. And what about 
the legions of digital photos cluttering up 
space on your hard drive? It‚Äôs not uncommon 
to take Ô¨Åve or more shots to ensure you 
get one usable one, but what about the 
rest? You only want to keep the best copy, 
but manually trawling through all your 
photographs can be a daunting task. Panic 
not‚Äîwe‚Äôll reveal a tool that makes this job 
that bit simpler.
The end result should be this: You have 
one master copy of your Ô¨Åles, plus as many 
backups as you need. These could be stored 
as an exact backup copy in one backup 
folder (which you‚Äôll need to identify to make 
sure it‚Äôs ignored by the duplicate Ô¨Åle Ô¨Ånder), 
or you might have them backed up using a 
tool such as Windows‚Äô own File History, in 
which case, the backup won‚Äôt be touched 
by your Ô¨Åle weeding. All other copies‚Äîor 
slight variations‚Äîthen become candidates 
for removal.
What to Look for 
When Cleaning

move slowly through each photo in the list, 
to be sure you‚Äôve got the right match.
By default, AntiDupl assumes the 
Ô¨Årst folder you added to it is the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù 
folder‚Äîthe one where the Ô¨Åles are (by 
default) left untouched. When the search 
results appear, you‚Äôll see a preview of 
each photo on the left, complete with basic 
information conÔ¨Årming the match. Next 
to each photo, you‚Äôll see three buttons: 
taking the Ô¨Årst photo, the top-most button 
deletes both copies, while the second icon 
overwrites the second copy with the Ô¨Årst. 
The next button removes the top photo. 
Below the two arrow buttons, you‚Äôll 
see three similar buttons, with the Ô¨Årst 
one highlighted in red, indicating that the 
second photo is set to be deleted by default. 
Below this is a button allowing the second 
copy to overwrite the top one, and the Ô¨Ånal 
button‚Äîthe hand signal‚Äîallows you to 
mark this match as a ‚Äúmistake,‚Äù ensuring 
it‚Äôs ignored in future.
Click a button, and the desired action 
is performed now, and the next item is 
selected, ready for you to act on. You‚Äôll see 
similar buttons appear under the menu 
bar‚Äîif you select multiple entries together 
using Ctrl-click, you can click these buttons 
to perform the same action on all the 
matches. There‚Äôs also a ‚ÄúProcess selected 
results automatically‚Äù button for applying 
the default action to all of the results‚Äînot 
something we recommend, unless you‚Äôre 
feeling very brave or working on a small set 
of results.
As you go down the list, you‚Äôll come to 
photos that aren‚Äôt exact matches, allowing 
you to remove similar photos, too. All 
deleted photos are sent to the Recycle Bin 
by default, giving you a fail-safe in case you 
make a mistake, so be sure to empty the Bin 
once you‚Äôre happy to free up the space.
1. SET SEARCH PARAMETERS
Launch AntiDupl, select ‚ÄúSearch > 
Options,‚Äù and select ‚ÄúSearch rotated and 
mirror image dupls‚Äù if you wish (click 
‚ÄúOK‚Äù). Now select ‚ÄúSearch > Paths.‚Äù Click 
‚ÄúAdd Folder‚Äù to add a folder or drive to

you need. Click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù
2. REVIEW RESULTS
Click the play button and wait while 
folders are searched and compared (click 
‚ÄúBackground Mode‚Äù to minimize to the 
System Tray). When the scan Ô¨Ånishes, 
AntiDupl lists all found duplicates and 
similar Ô¨Åles. See the main text for advice 
on what settings to choose for each Ô¨Ånd.
3. PERFORM CLEANUP
As you click a button for each result, it 
disappears from the list, and the next item

A
t last, we reach the Ô¨Ånal curtain. 
If your PC still isn‚Äôt running as 
smoothly as you‚Äôd like, let us take 
more drastic steps to bring it under control 
in this last section on cleaning, diving 
deep to squeeze out every last possible 
optimization we can Ô¨Ånd. We‚Äôll also reveal 
some Ô¨Ånal tips for optimizing drive space, 
to ensure your hard drive doesn‚Äôt Ô¨Åll up too 
quickly going forward.
First, you‚Äôll notice that we haven‚Äôt 
included Registry cleaning as part of this 
feature. Registry cleaners would like you 
to think they can perform minor miracles 
when it comes to performance. They can‚Äôt. 
Even if they weren‚Äôt justiÔ¨Åably shunned 
for their ability to delete critical Registry 
entries along with genuinely redundant 
ones, the act of simply deleting Registry 
entries isn‚Äôt enough in itself to speed things 
up. The fact is, Windows 10 is more than 
capable of managing and optimizing the 
Registry, so leave it well alone.
Defrag Your Drive
These days, more and more people have 
SSD drives, which don‚Äôt require defragging. 
Older platter-based (HDD) drives do, 
however, and it‚Äôs likely that you have at least 
one of these installed, either internally 
or attached via USB. Windows‚Äô built-in 
defrag tool should be adequate for most 
people‚Äôs needs, but if you want to push the 
boat out further, download and install the 
free version of Defraggler (www.piriform.
com/defraggler). 
Defraggler can differentiate between 
SSD and HDD drives, so it only defrags the 
latter. Go to ‚ÄúSettings Options > Defrag 
tab,‚Äù and you can optimize your drive by 
moving larger Ô¨Åles to the end of the drive, 
which can help boost performance that 
bit more. It‚Äôs also possible to analyze and 
defrag individual Ô¨Åles via the ‚ÄúFile list‚Äù tab, 
or by right-clicking the Ô¨Åle in File Explorer‚Äî
handy for a quick boost when working with 
speciÔ¨Åc large Ô¨Åles.
Manage Services
Startup programs aren‚Äôt the only things 
launching with Windows, extending your 
boot time, and grabbing resources‚Äîsystem 
(and third-party) services do, too. You can 
manually review and optimize these via 
the Services management console (type 
‚Äúservices‚Äù into the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù box), but for a 
quick and easy optimization, download the 
free version of PC Services Optimizer (www.
smartpcutilities.com/servicesoptimizer.
html). Once installed, launch the app. After 
visiting Services Manager, waiting while 
the services list is populated, and clicking 
‚ÄúBackup,‚Äù select ‚ÄúAutomatic Tuneup,‚Äù and 
answer a series of questions split into four 
sections: ‚ÄúHardware,‚Äù ‚ÄúSecurity,‚Äù ‚ÄúInternet 
& Network,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSystem Functions.‚Äù Click 
‚ÄúOK,‚Äù and any unnecessary services are 
promptly disabled, providing you with a 
minor speed boost.
Gamers should also check out Gaming 
Mode. This enables you to temporarily 
disable services by switching Gaming Mode 
on to maximize performance for gaming 
or similar processor-intensive tasks, such 
as HD video editing. Click ‚ÄúPreset,‚Äù and 
experiment with ‚ÄúMinimum,‚Äù ‚ÄúNormal,‚Äù or 
‚ÄúMaximum‚Äù settings, or manually select 
which settings to apply. Don‚Äôt be surprised 
if Windows changes appearance‚Äîwhen 
you switch off Gaming Mode, things should 
return to normal.
If things appear to go wrong after you‚Äôve 
made your tweaks, simply click the ‚ÄúRescue 
Center‚Äù button, and select your backup to 
undo your changes.
Visualize Drive Space
Running out of drive space, but unsure 
what‚Äôs gobbling it all up? CCleaner offers 
a Disk Analyzer under ‚ÄúTools‚Äù that can 
provide you with a quick summary for 
individual or collected drives, split into 
various categories (such as pictures, 
documents, or everything). When the scan 
completes, a pie chart divides everything 
Tweak System Restore so it doesn‚Äôt take up 
too much space on your hard drive.

for a collection of more advanced cleaning tips
PERFORM A HEAVY-
DUTY SPRING CLEAN
Why let programs take more resources than 
they need? Instead of installing a program 
on your PC‚Äîletting it scatter itself all over 
your hard drive, and take up valuable space 
in the Registry‚Äîlook to see if a portable 
alternative is available. Portable apps are 
programs that restrict themselves to a 
single folder; everything they need to run 
can be found inside that folder, so not only 
do you keep them in check (delete the folder, 
remove the program‚Äîcompletely), you also 
get to choose where they reside.
Portable apps are a particularly good 
choice when you have Windows installed 
on a small system drive‚Äîsuch as a 64GB 
or even 32GB SSD. You can store the apps 
on another drive, and leave enough space 
for Windows to run smoothly. Not only 
that, but if you have to reinstall Windows 
from scratch, the portable apps (and your 
settings) survive intact. You can even 
store portable apps on a USB thumb drive, 
enabling you to port them‚Äîand your 
preferences‚Äîto another computer.
A great place to start when building 
a 
portable 
app 
collection 
is 
www.
portableapps.com. Install the PortableApps 
Platform tool, which provides a custom Start 
menu for easy access to your portable apps, 
plus makes it easy to install and update 
apps from its own extensive collection. You 
can add other portable apps‚Äîincluding 
those portable tools we‚Äôve covered in this 
feature‚Äîby extracting them into folders 
inside the main PortableApps folder, and 
choosing ‚ÄúApps > Refresh App Icons.‚Äù

up, while the largest Ô¨Åles are listed below, 
complete with a checkbox enabling you to 
select speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åles to delete via the right-
click menu.
An alternative tool to try is SpaceSniffer 
(www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_
sniffer). This portable tool (be sure to right-
click it, and choose ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù 
to access all Ô¨Åles on the selected drive) 
provides a visual view based on folder, 
rather than type, giving you insights into 
where all the space has gone, rather than 
what type of content is gobbling it up. Click 
a folder to peer inside it, or double-click to 
go inside, and drill down deeper until you 
locate what‚Äôs taking all your space. 
More Cleaning Tips
Type ‚Äúrestore point‚Äù into the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù 
box, and click ‚ÄúCreate a restore point.‚Äù 
Verify System Restore is switched on‚Äîif 
not, select your system drive, and click 
‚ÄúConÔ¨Ågure‚Äù to do so. When you come to 
allocate space, consider limiting it to 5GB 
or 5 percent, whichever is smallest. This 
provides a good balance between giving you 
usable Restore points and not swallowing 
up too much drive space.
One obvious way to free up space without 
deleting any Ô¨Åles is to compress them. The 
obvious solution would be to right-click 
the Ô¨Åle (or folder), and choose ‚ÄúSend to > 
Compressed (zip) folder,‚Äù but while you 
can easily browse their contents in File 
Explorer, third-party apps can‚Äôt access the 
content unless you unzip it. An alternative 
is to use NTFS Compression instead, 
which compresses a selected folder while 
retaining its content. The folder is a little 
slower to process, but is more convenient 
to use. To do this, right-click the folder, 
and choose ‚ÄúProperties.‚Äù Click ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù 
under ‚ÄúGeneral,‚Äù and select ‚ÄúCompress 
contents to save disk space.‚Äù Remember, it 
only works on NTFS-formatted hard drives.
One handy time-saving function is Jump 
Lists, which appear when you click ‚Äú>‚Äù next 
to an application in the Start menu, or right-
click its taskbar entry. It pays to take the time 
to manage these thoroughly‚Äîclick the pin 
icon next to an entry to pin it permanently to 
the top of the list, or right-click a redundant 
entry and choose ‚ÄúRemove from this list‚Äù to 
get rid of it. You can quickly clear all Jump 
List entries using CCleaner (look in the 
‚ÄúWindows Explorer‚Äù section of the cleaner).
Finally, if you want to take full control of 
the startup procedure, download and run 
Autoruns (https://bit.ly/autoruns). Switch to 
the ‚ÄúLogon‚Äù tab, and you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcantly 
more startup entries than those provided 
by Task Manager or CCleaner. Unselect an 
entry to disable it, or right-click it for more 
options, including deleting it and checking it 
for possible malware. 
CCleaner and SpaceSniffer enable you to visualize your hard drive usage in different ways.
The act of running multiple programs (never 
mind numerous background processes) 
is a delicate one, requiring a Ô¨Åne balance 
to keep everything running smoothly. It 
doesn‚Äôt always work, which is why your PC 
may sometimes seemingly grind to a halt or 
act sluggishly for a few minutes.
If you‚Äôre running Windows 10 on an older 
PC or low-powered tablet or laptop device, 
you may Ô¨Ånd it frequently sticks, due to the 
competing demands of different processes. 
One solution is to scale back what you do‚Äî
keep open programs to a minimum, and 
trim startup back, too. 
If this doesn‚Äôt help, then downloading 
and installing the Free version of Process 
Lasso 
(https://bitsum.com/processlasso) 
will, and it can even help on more powerful 
setups as well. When prompted, leave the 
default options as they are, and the main 
window opens to show you what‚Äôs running 
on your device, and how Process Lasso 
is balancing it. Its ProBalanced tool is up 
and running from the start, ensuring no 
process can overwhelm the system with 
its demands. A summary tells you how 
it‚Äôs working, and the log reveals which 
processes have been neutered when their 
demands get too high (click ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù for a 
handy summary). 
You can also tweak things further: Open 
the ‚ÄúMain‚Äù menu, and choose ‚ÄúSmartTrim‚Äù 
to free up physical RAM when it‚Äôs safe to 
do so. Select ‚ÄúIdleSaver‚Äù if you‚Äôd like to cut 
energy usage, and choose ‚ÄúGaming mode‚Äù 
for those times when you want to play games 
or perform other CPU-intensive tasks, such 
as ripping or encoding HD video.

Nothing is lost until you‚Äôve looked for it,

IMAGINE 
WITH 
US: 
The 
worst 
has 
happened. Everything you held dear 
is gone. You ignored the clicking of the 
hard drive, those error messages, that 
suspicious-looking Ô¨Åle for too long. 
You¬†clicked the thing you shouldn‚Äôt have 
clicked. You emptied the Recycle Bin out 
of habit after letting your kids near your 
PC. And now? Now your photos are gone, 
your documents are dust, those precious 
family videos cast to the wind. Windows 
has gasped its last breath. All is lost.
Except that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case. 
Data has a habit of hanging around. And 
if you‚Äôre very lucky, and very careful, 
you could‚Äîin this hypothetical scenario 
‚Äîget all, or the vast majority, of your data 
back. Note that we‚Äôre not going to be able 
to help you a huge amount in the case 
of massive hardware failure or physical 
damage, so if you‚Äôve inadvertently sent 
120V to that SSD, or unwisely dunked 
your laptop in the bath, you‚Äôre either 
going to be on the hook for specialist 
clean room data recovery‚Äîwhich could 
set you back thousands of dollars, if it 
works at all‚Äîor completely out of luck.
If you‚Äôre not just imagining things, 
and everything does appear to have 
gone, stop using your PC immediately, 
and read on. And if everything seems 
Ô¨Åne, read on anyway. You might learn a 
few things that‚Äôll save your bacon one 
day, and we‚Äôll help you get your hands 
on some tools that every home computer 
pro should have waiting in their back 
pocket for the worst of times.
And 
don‚Äôt 
worry‚Äîwe‚Äôve 
not 
discounted the possibility that Windows 
has simply collapsed under its own 
weight, rendering your precious data 
comfortably 
stored, 
but 
otherwise

from another operating system entirely, 
you‚Äôll be able to get all that stuÔ¨Ä back, 
too. And hey, if you fancy doing a bit of 
digital forensics, but your drives are 
currently in a good state, why not delete

BEFORE WE CAN EVEN THINK about 
doing any kind of data recovery, it‚Äôs 
worth knowing how data is stored 
on the typical drive. Every situation 
is slightly diÔ¨Äerent, of course, and 
we‚Äôre taking an incredibly basic 
look at NTFS formatting here; other 
Ô¨Ålesystems work in diÔ¨Äerent ways, 
although with the right software, 
you should be able to aÔ¨Äect a 
recovery from just about anything.
The typical drive is broken into 
partitions. These aren‚Äôt physical 
breaks, they‚Äôre logical‚Äîa certain 
portion of the drive‚Äôs bits are 
allocated, in a contiguous manner, 
to 
split 
the 
drive 
apart 
into 
individually 
managed 
sections, 
known as volumes. Information 
about these volumes‚Äîtheir size, 
location on the drive, and the like‚Äî
is stored in the drive‚Äôs Partition 
Table, which sits alongside the 
Master Boot Record (MBR) in the 
Ô¨Årst sectors of the drive. The MBR is 
accessed when you boot your PC, so 
the BIOS knows where it‚Äôs heading. 
Each volume is invisibly broken 
into more sections. The Master File 
Table (MFT) is the most important of 
these. It‚Äôs a database that contains 
information about every Ô¨Åle and 
folder on your drive, pointers to 
them, and, in some cases, even 
entire Ô¨Åles, if they‚Äôre smaller than 
about 512 bytes. Before the MFT 
is a boot sector, which holds a bit 
more speciÔ¨Åc information about 
the 
volume‚Äîmost 
importantly, 
it points to where the MFT is 
located‚Äîand, if the partition is 
both active and designated as a 
primary partition, loads NTldr to 
kick oÔ¨Ä the boot process. The same 
sector is also duplicated at the very 
end of the volume, in case the Ô¨Årst 
one goes bad, as is the MFT itself.
Sandwiched between these tiny 
sections is the Ô¨Ålesystem data 
itself‚Äîthe stuÔ¨Ä the MFT points to. 
These are your Ô¨Åles. When you start 
a fresh NTFS drive, they‚Äôre stored 
quite neatly; a few months or years 
into the drive‚Äôs life, they really are 
not. Files are placed into whatever 
space the MFT designates as free, 
and while the system makes a good 
stab at doing this sensibly, it often 
needs to break your Ô¨Åles apart, and 
spread them over several areas of 
free space, with the references to 
each of the parts stored in the MFT. 
This is why mechanical drives tend 
to slow down; the read head needs 
to jump around the drive to hit each 
bit of the thing you‚Äôre trying to load. 
SSDs don‚Äôt have this problem, since 
they can jump between sectors 
almost instantaneously (relatively 
speaking, at least).
STAYING SAFE
So what does this all mean for you? 
Well, consider this: When Windows 
deletes a Ô¨Åle, it doesn‚Äôt do anything 
to the Ô¨Ålesystem data. It merely 
scrubs the reference from the MFT, 
and allocates the Ô¨Åle‚Äôs space as 
‚Äúempty.‚Äù The data itself is still there, 
almost in its entirety. For now. If the 
MFT later chooses to store a new Ô¨Åle 
in the same space? Some or all of 
that deleted Ô¨Åle‚Äôs data will be gone.
This means the Ô¨Årst critical step 
of any data recovery eÔ¨Äort (and a 
PREVENT DATA LOSS 
Recovering Ô¨Åles is our 
aim here, but all of this 
can be avoided with a 
sensible computing 
regime. If you care 
about your data, build 
in a backup routine. The 
prevailing wisdom states 
that you should follow 
the rule of three (three 
copies of your data, 
stored on at least two 
kinds of media, at least 
one of which is kept off-
site), and it makes sense 
to get as close to this as 
you can. Start duplicating 
your critical Ô¨Åles to a 
cloud backup service 
such as CrashPlan, and 
using external media to 
keep secondary copies 
of the most important 
items. Copying them to 
another partition on the 
same drive‚Äîor another 
physical drive in the 
same machine‚Äîis not 
adequate. Move your 
backup away from your 
main machine‚Äîto a 
different Ô¨Çoor of your 
house, perhaps, or even 
off-site. If you‚Äôre hit by 
a Ô¨Çood or a Ô¨Åre, your 
insurance might buy you 
a new PC, but it won‚Äôt 
cover your Ô¨Åles.
An automated 
process is best‚Äî
again, something that 
CrashPlan and its ilk 
offer‚Äîbecause it pulls 
vital Ô¨Åles when you‚Äôre 
not using your machine, 
ensuring they‚Äôre 
duplicated when disaster 
strikes. If you don‚Äôt want 
to pay for a subscription, 
it‚Äôs plausible to back 
up small pockets of 
Ô¨Åles on free services 
such as Google Drive or 
Microsoft‚Äôs OneDrive, but 
unless you‚Äôre organized 
with your local and 
mirrored folders, you‚Äôre 
one step away from a 
forgetful accident. If you 
want to take it further, 
and customize your own 
backup solution, check 
out Linux app rsync 
(https://linux.die.net/
man/1/rsync), which has 
a Windows wrapper in 
the form of DeltaCopy 
(www.aboutmyip.
com/AboutMyXApp/

won‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd a more 
versatile app when it 
comes to cloning data.

point we‚Äôre going to keep making) 
is to stop what you‚Äôre doing 
immediately, and power down the 
drive. Don‚Äôt risk any of your data 
being inadvertently overwritten, 
because if you want it back, you 
want it intact. Usually, you‚Äôd 
shut down your machine using 
the regular Windows shutdown 
procedure, which is certainly the 
optimal choice if your problem is 
hardware failure, rather than a 
Ô¨Ålesystem glitch. It means your 
drive‚Äôs heads (if it has them) are 
properly and safely disengaged, 
and any write operations completed 
properly, thus avoiding potentially 
corrupted Ô¨Åles. 
But there‚Äôs an issue with this: If 
you have Windows updates waiting, 
shutting down in the regular way is 
essentially giving Microsoft license 
to begin overwriting swathes of 
your drive‚Äôs precious bytes with 
patches that are, at least in the 
current circumstances, less than 
helpful. So if you‚Äôve headed for the 
Start menu to shut down, and you‚Äôre 
getting the dreaded ‚Äúand update‚Äù 
suÔ¨Äix, it‚Äôs time to do something 
we‚Äôd ordinarily never recommend: 
cut the juice. Don‚Äôt even hold down 
your power button for 10 seconds‚Äî
cut the power at the wall, Ô¨Çick the 
switch on your PSU, or pull the 
battery if you can. The next time 
we use this drive, it‚Äôll ideally be in 
read-only mode, which mitigates 
most of the risk to your data.
VITAL PREPARATION
What‚Äôs gone wrong? We don‚Äôt 
know for sure. You might, though. 
The structure of your drive means 
there are a few potential points of 
failure‚Äîthe MBR, the partition 
table, the MFT, a problem with bad 
sectors in the Ô¨Åle storage area‚Äîand 
that‚Äôs not to mention mechanical 
issues, 
a 
problem 
with 
your 
motherboard‚Äôs drive controllers, a 
malicious attack, or the ultimate 
destroyer of Ô¨Åles: you. We‚Äôll come to 
human error later on. For now, we 
need to help the people who haven‚Äôt 
done something silly. 
If you have a donor machine 
you can hook the drive up to (as a 
secondary drive), that‚Äôs the ideal. 
If you don‚Äôt have that luxury, you 
need to cross your Ô¨Ångers that 
your Ô¨Åle loss isn‚Äôt being caused 
by a malfunction on your current 
machine. Keep it powered down 
for now. Whatever the situation, 
have a fresh external drive ready to 
transfer any recovered Ô¨Åles to, and 
STOP RECOVERY FOR GOOD 
We‚Äôve discussed the 
ways in which your drive 
stores Ô¨Åles, and how they 
don‚Äôt really get removed 
when you delete them 
or format your drive. 
What if there are Ô¨Åles 
on there that you really 
want to stay deleted, 
and be excluded from 
any recovery efforts? 
We can use a little of 
our knowledge of Ô¨Åle 
storage to work out how 
to obliterate old data‚Äî
the best way to make 
sure Ô¨Åles don‚Äôt rise from 
the dead is to ensure 
that ‚Äúfree‚Äù space on 
your drive is completely 
overwritten. You could 
painstakingly write Ô¨Åles 
to your drive until it‚Äôs 
full, but that‚Äôs madness. 
Better to use a secure 
deletion tool.
You have a few choices 
here, but we tend to 
favor Eraser (https://
eraser.heidi.ie), which 
goes overboard in its 
efforts, overwriting 
your Ô¨Åles several 
times with speciÔ¨Åc 
random data patterns 
in order to remove 
them‚Äîand, on magnetic 
drives, the microscopic 
traces they leave 
behind‚Äîcompletely. We 
recommend you keep it 
hanging around‚Äîyou 
can securely delete Ô¨Åles 
just by dropping them 
on the app, or even have 
it grind through any 
unused space on your 
partitions, applying its 
algorithms to that space 
to scrub it clean of any 
ghostly data. 
If you really want to 
get rid of all the data on a 
drive‚Äîif you‚Äôre passing 
your hardware on or 
recycling it, say‚ÄîSystem 
Rescue CD includes 
the tool Wipe (http://
wipe.sourceforge.net), 
which does an intense, 
thorough, repeated 
overwriting of every byte 
of data on a drive. Or if 
the hardware doesn‚Äôt 
matter, and you‚Äôre 
absolutely desperate to 
get rid of it, do as one of 
Maximum PC‚Äôs alumni 
once did: Take a hammer 
to your drive, and throw 
it in a lake. But think of 
the Ô¨Åsh before you do it.
Eraser can make up to 35 
passes over your data for 
absolute removal.

be aware that you may need to do a 
little manual cleaning up after.
Now, head to a second machine. If 
you‚Äôre reading this and you haven‚Äôt 
actually suÔ¨Äered any data loss as 
yet, follow this advice anyway: 
As any good Boy Scout knows, one 
must always be prepared. On your 
second machine, download the x86 
version of System Rescue CD from 
www.system-rescue-cd.org, 
and 
write it to a CD or USB stick. There 
are many rescue-focused distros 
of Linux, but this one‚Äîugly text-
based interface and all‚Äîis ours.
PARTITION RECOVERY
Time to get some stuÔ¨Ä back. Plug in 
your large external drive, and boot 
your aÔ¨Äected machine from your 
System Rescue CD media. You may 
have to head into your UEFI menu 
and disable Secure Boot before it 
works. Hit Return to boot with the 
default options, and you‚Äôre thrown 
straight to a command prompt. 
OK, 
not 
the 
most 
welcoming 
introduction, but we don‚Äôt need 
graphical Ô¨Ånery for these tasks. 
You may see a suggestion to mount 
your drive at this point‚Äîdon‚Äôt do it. 
This is a trap for young players; if 
your partition table is hosed, you‚Äôre 
going to want to work on the raw 
disk Ô¨Årst of all. So type ‚Äútestdisk‚Äù 
and you can begin taking a look 
at your connected hardware. Don‚Äôt 
worry about creating a log Ô¨Åle at 
this point. 
You‚Äôre Ô¨Årst given a list of all the 
connected storage devices‚Äîwith 
luck, you‚Äôll see the aÔ¨Äected drive. If 
you don‚Äôt, you can safely diagnose 
your problem as physical: Meaning 
there‚Äôs a cable loose, a power failure, 
or your drive controller has gone up 
in smoke. Presuming you do see the 
drive, take a note of its designation 
(sda, sdb, and so on) as we‚Äôll need 
this a little later. Ensure it‚Äôs 
selected, and hit Return, selecting 
the ‚ÄúIntel‚Äù partition type unless 
you‚Äôre working on a particularly odd 
drive. Now choose ‚ÄúAnalyze.‚Äù One of 
two things is going to happen now: 
If your drive is properly structured, 
it Ô¨Ånds the partition table, and lists 
the partitions‚Äîagain, take note 
of these, and those of the external 
drive you‚Äôve plugged in for your 
recovered Ô¨Åles. If the partition 
table of the rogue drive is missing 
or damaged (TestDisk looks for 
a particular byte at a particular 
point on the drive to discover this), 
you can select ‚ÄúQuick Search‚Äù to 
have it scan your drive, cylinder 
by cylinder, for the telltale signs 
of partition divisions. With any 
luck, it‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd something, and you‚Äôll 
be given the option to restore the 
partition table. If not, you can 
choose to do a deeper scan, which 
is a last-ditch eÔ¨Äort; it takes a long 
time, and stresses a failing drive, 
but if you have no other option, it‚Äôs 
worth a try.
CONNECTING DRIVES
With a healthy partition table, your 
drive should be in good enough 
shape to work with‚Äîyou can 
now start hunting for your Ô¨Åles. 
TestDisk usefully comes with a 
companion program, Photorec, the 
name of which is somewhat out of 
date‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt just recover photos, 
but a host of known Ô¨Åle types from a 
selection of over 480. But before we 
can use it, we need to mount your 
secondary drive to give it a location 
to send the Ô¨Åles to. Mounting, 
essentially, is the process of linking 
a partition of your drive to a Linux 
Ô¨Åle‚Äîabsolutely 
everything 
in 
Linux is a Ô¨Åle‚Äîand telling Linux 
exactly how it should be accessing 
that drive. 
Presuming your backup drive 
is NTFS formatted, we can use a 
program called ntfs-3g to do the 
mounting. First, create a mount 
point‚Äîthe folder location that‚Äôll 
represent your drive‚Äîby typing  
 mkdir /mnt/ntfs  at the prompt. 
Then (replacing ‚Äúsdb‚Äù with the 
partition 
designation 
that 
you 
made a note of earlier) type  
 ntfs-3g /dev/ sdb1 /mnt/ntfs  to 
solidify the link between the two 
locations, and bear in mind that you 
will need the backup drive to be in 
good working order, too‚Äîif ntfs-3g 
detects bad sectors or NTFS errors, 
it forces it into read-only mode. 
Now¬† Ô¨Åre up Photorec by typing  
 photorec  at the prompt. 
FILE RECOVERY
This is the real meat of Ô¨Åle recovery. 
Photorec uses technical knowledge 
of partition anatomy and the exact

this ominous 
message in 
TestDisk, your

WHAT ABOUT RAID?
RAID drives, as you 
might imagine, can 
be tricky beasts to 
recover data from, and 
certain conÔ¨Ågurations 
introduce issues of 
their own. Run a striped 
set in RAID 0 formation, 
for example, and you‚Äôre 
asking for trouble‚Äî
yes, you‚Äôll have some 
of the fastest storage 
going, but if one of 
your drives goes 
down, you‚Äôre stuck. 
There are various 
options that claim to 
be able to recover Ô¨Åles 
from RAIDs 0, 5, and 
10‚ÄîReclaiMe (www.
freeraidrecovery.
com) is the most 
prominent‚Äîbut don‚Äôt 
hold your breath for 
any decent results. On 
the Ô¨Çipside of the 
coin, RAID 1 and 
similar mirrored 
conÔ¨Ågurations 
positively aid in data 
recovery; if one of your 
drives goes down, you 
may need to invest a 
little time and money in 
remirroring with a new 
drive, but catastrophic 
failure is only going to 
come from your own 
hand or a malware 
attack. If this is the 
case, you have the 
same chance to recover 
Ô¨Åles as you would with 
a single drive.
The other issue 
RAID introduces 
is the controller 
itself. If whatever‚Äôs 
managing your RAID 
conÔ¨Åguration‚Äîyour 
NAS, your main 
computer, or specialist 
RAID hardware‚Äîgoes 
bad, it could throw your 
drives into a position 
where recovering data 
is entirely impossible. 
It‚Äôs not unknown for 
specialists to be able to 
engineer speciÔ¨Åc tools 
for speciÔ¨Åc instances 
of RAID failure, but 
this is a highly costly 
procedure, with no 
guarantee of success.
We don‚Äôt have an 
answer for the irony of 
RAID being both safer 
and more dangerous 
than storing on a single 
drive, other than to 
suggest, again, that you 
always keep stringent 
backups away from 
your regular hardware.

and security?

in Raid 1+0.

your data back.
bytes that make up certain Ô¨Åle 
types to skim through your drives 
and automatically pull oÔ¨Ä corrupted 
or lost Ô¨Åles. And while its interface 
is incredibly ugly, it‚Äôs the most 
eÔ¨Äective tool going. Once you‚Äôve 
started it up, pick your aÔ¨Äected 
drive (Photorec only works in read-
only mode, so it‚Äôs safe), choose the 
partition that you noted earlier, 
and select ‚ÄúSearch.‚Äù Photorec asks 
for a location to save its restored 
Ô¨Åles 
to‚Äînavigate 
through 
the 
Linux Ô¨Åle tree to Ô¨Ånd the mount 
point we made earlier, and pick a 
folder on your drive if you have one 
prepared. Hit C when you‚Äôre done. 
Photorec now sifts through your 
drive looking for broken, deleted, or 
incomplete Ô¨Åles, and does its best 
to recover them fully‚Äîgrab a cold 
one, because this is going to take 
a while. All being well, you should 
have the majority, if not all, of your 
stuÔ¨Ä back at this point.
There are simpler ways to get 
the job done. You‚Äôre welcome to 
stick within Windows and try 
running the portable version of 
Piriform‚Äôs Recuva from a USB stick 
(www.piriform.com/recuva/builds), 
which oÔ¨Äers a pretty interface 
and the option to select precisely 
what you‚Äôve lost, rather than just 
batch-copying 
everything, 
but 
it‚Äôs more limited to inadvertently 
deleted Ô¨Åles, and isn‚Äôt particularly 
helpful if you have an ongoing 
malware issue. There are also 
overkill 
methods‚Äîfor 
instance, 
you could, at the other end of the 
spectrum, use partimage (included 
with System Rescue CD) to pull oÔ¨Ä 
a full bit-for-bit copy of your aÔ¨Äected 
drive, preserving it for later forensic 
analysis. Check the guide at www.
partimage.org/Main_Page 
to 
see 
how it‚Äôs done‚Äîyou can compress 
the image as it goes, Ô¨Åtting it on 
to a smaller drive than the source, 
and later restore it if you suspect 
hardware failure.
System Rescue CD has one 
more niche use, too. If Windows 
itself has given up the ghost, and 
is blocking your access to your 
otherwise perfectly stored Ô¨Åles, 
you can mount both your original 
and backup drives, and copy them 
oÔ¨Ä directly. Alternatively, and this 
may be a slightly more comfortable 
option, you could boot up another 
Linux live distro‚Äîthe likes of 
Ubuntu‚Äîand manually back up 
using a graphical interface.

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDES TO IMPROVING YOUR PC
ZAK STOREY 
REVIEWS EDITOR
GPU VRAM
Memory seems to be one of the most 
over-marketed products within the PC 
enthusiast‚Äôs arsenal of componentry. 
Whether it‚Äôs SSD cache being used to 
speed up ageing hard drives, enticingly 
large supplies of GPU memory on 
a $150 card, or desktop DDR4 with 
frequencies up into the 4,000MHz 
range, it tends to be obscured by a 
barrage of baseless promises.
For example, MSI recently stated 
that by increasing DDR4 frequencies 
from 2,400MHz to 4,000MHz, you‚Äôd 
see an in-game improvement in The 
Witcher 3 of average frame rates from 
94.1 to 114.1. In tests in our March 2016 
issue, we saw zero difference in frame 
rates across 10 memory kits with a 
800MHz difference between them.
But my issue lies with graphics 
memory, and how much is ‚Äúenough.‚Äù 
We had an argument with Asus‚Äôs PR 
team regarding the appropriate level 
of VRAM for various cards. The 4GB 
1050 Ti doesn‚Äôt make sense to us, 
when the 3GB 1060 is about $30 more, 
yet performs almost three times 
better. Asus‚Äôs argument is that games 
require ever larger VRAM caches, and 
you‚Äôd be future-prooÔ¨Ång yourself by 
getting a 4GB 1050 Ti over a 3GB 1060. 
We disagree. If you game at 1080p, 
3GB of VRAM is plenty for any game 
today. Larger textures don‚Äôt provide 
any more detail, and if you‚Äôre looking 
to upgrade to higher resolutions, the 
GPU will become the bottleneck. Don‚Äôt 
fall for marketing lies‚Äîbuy a card 
with an appropriate amount of VRAM 
for the resolution and games you play, 
and build a system around that.
DON‚ÄôT INSTALL GEFORCE EXPERIENCE
For people concerned about privacy, the latest Nvidia update 
brought an unwelcome visitor in the form of required account 
creation to access any features. To counter this, head to www.
geforce.com/drivers, manually enter your conditions, and 
click to download the latest drivers as an EXE. On installation, 
deselect ‚ÄúGeForce Experience,‚Äù and you‚Äôre good to go. Check

BACKGROUND
The world of video game platforms has been changing quickly. 
Manufacturers have resorted to mid-gen refreshes to keep up 
with 4K TVs and VR headsets, and here‚Äôs the third iteration of 
the PS4 generation. We may be amateur gamers, but we‚Äôre 
revved up to tear the PlayStation 4 Pro down, professionally. 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
‚Ä¢  Eight-core AMD ‚ÄúJaguar‚Äù X86-64 CPU, clocked at 2.1GHz  
(up from 1.6GHz).
‚Ä¢  4.2TÔ¨Çops AMD Radeon-based graphics.
‚Ä¢ 8GB GDDR5 RAM and 1GB DRAM.
‚Ä¢  1TB removable and upgradable hard drive storage.
‚Ä¢  802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Ethernet, and Bluetooth 4.0 (LE).
‚Ä¢  Blu-ray x6 CAV, DVD x8 CAV.
KEY FINDINGS
‚Ä¢  The triple-decker design is a little different from the ‚ÄúÔ¨Årst‚Äù 
PlayStation 4, but that doesn‚Äôt stop us‚Äîwithout wasting time, 
we Ô¨Çip the console over, pop the Ô¨Årst panel, and hit pay dirt! A 
single, standard Phillips #0 screw stands between us and 
hard-drive-swapping glory. 
‚Ä¢  We‚Äôre gonna have to remove the ‚ÄúWarranty void if seal 
removed‚Äù stickers to go any further. Adding insult to injury, 
the screws hidden beneath are Security Torx screws‚Äî
designed to stop you getting in. With the case cracked open, 
we can remove a large metal shield. Unfortunately, all this 
does is give us a view of the motherboard‚Äôs backside.
‚Ä¢  With the beast on its back, the opposite panel pops off after 
some prodigious prying‚Äîbut no ‚Äúwarranty void‚Äù stickers! 
Alas, removing this panel isn‚Äôt the panel-cea we were hoping 
for. We can pull out the power supply, but nothing else. While 
you can‚Äôt remove the fan, you could certainly clean it from 
here‚Äîmaybe that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre granted this non-warranty-
voiding access zone. 
‚Ä¢  Thwarted by the lack of any more screw heads on the PSU 
side of the PS4 Pro, we Ô¨Çip it back over and turn our attention 
to the motherboard. Burrowing through a layer of shielding 
behind the CPU reveals a cool X-shaped retaining bracket, 
similar to ones we found in another console. And directly 
underneath it, we dig up a plastic-and-metal cover that 
seems to be the consumer electronics version of a pizza 
saver, protecting the back of the board from the heatsink 
retaining bracket. 
‚Ä¢  Repairability Score: 8 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). No 
adhesive makes disassembly and reassembly easy. The 
non-proprietary hard drive is simple to access and upgrade 
or replace‚Äîand doing so doesn‚Äôt void your warranty. While 
you can clean the fan, removing it‚Äîand other components‚Äî
requires lots of (warranty-voiding) disassembly. Security 
screws and tamper-evident seals discourage users from 
disassembling and repairing their PlayStation 4 Pro. 
Remarkably simple, 
although that‚Äôs not 
really surprising.
Fortunately, you can 
still swap out the hard 
drive, a PlayStation 
staple since the PS3.
We‚Äôre a huge fan 
of easy-to-remove 
components.

Set Up a Twitter Bot
On the Raspberry Pi
1
PRELIMINARY STEPS
Bots have practical uses, too. They can be programed to tweet 
at regular intervals, so can be used as a ‚Äúdead man‚Äôs switch‚Äù to 
tweet a message unless you reset it every day. It‚Äôs also possible to 
schedule a tweet for a future date, so you can use the bot to send 
out reminders. 
>> If you Ô¨Ånd any of these possibilities intriguing, you need to set 
up a dedicated Twitter account for your bot. Do not be tempted to 
use your existing Twitter account for this if you have one, because 
repeated tweets could be mistaken as spam by Twitter, and your 
account could be suspended.
>> In order to proceed, we need a new Twitter account with a 
conÔ¨Årmed cell phone number. If you already have a Twitter account, 
visit https://support.twitter.com/articles/81940# and follow the 
steps there to delete your cell phone number from your account for 
the time being.
2
CREATE NEW TWITTER ACCOUNT AND APP
Next, visit www.twitter.com and choose ‚ÄúSign Up.‚Äù You can 
use any email address you wish, provided it‚Äôs not already 
registered with Twitter. Choose a name that is appropriate for the 
bot. For the purposes of this tutorial, we‚Äôre creating a bot named 
Sherlock Bot, with user ID @holmesbot1 [Image A]. 
>> You are asked to provide your cell phone number, and then 
conÔ¨Årm it by SMS. Twitter requires this for bots to reduce the 
likelihood of spam. 
>> Once your Twitter account has been created, you may need to 
click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù a few times at the top-right to skip invitations to 
import your contacts or follow other users. 
>> Next, we need to create a Twitter application that allows your 
Raspberry Pi to access your Twitter account. Go to http://apps.
twitter.com, then click ‚ÄúCreate New App.‚Äù
THE SIMPLEST DESCRIPTION OF A TWITTER BOT is a program designed to produce automated 
posts on Twitter. The most common use for bots is spam. The bot examines key words‚Äîcleaning 
products, for example‚Äîthen responds with a promotional link for people to click to be taken to the 
spammer‚Äôs website. The feature also has non-spammy uses, however. Bots can be programed to 
search for any word or phrase, and respond accordingly. One entertaining implementation of this was 
@BDZNappa, which searched for people tweeting the phrase ‚Äúover 9,000,‚Äù to which it always 
responded, ‚ÄúWHAT!? NINE THOUSAND?‚Äù Bots can also tweet from a text source, such as 
@SunTzuBot, which tweets daily quotes from The Art of War. More sophisticated bots, such as 
@JustDiedBot, actively search the Internet for source material. @JustDiedBot searches Wikipedia 
for information about recent deaths, and tweets RIP announcements as they happen. ‚ÄìNATE DRAKE

INPUT DETAILS
You are asked to Ô¨Åll in the ‚ÄúApplication Details.‚Äù 
For this tutorial, we‚Äôre creating a bot that regularly 
tweets the Sherlock Holmes stories, but you‚Äôre welcome to 
change the ‚ÄúName‚Äù and ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù as you see Ô¨Åt.
>> Under ‚ÄúWebsite,‚Äù for now simply put ‚Äúhttp://www.
twitter.com.‚Äù Leave the Ô¨Åeld named ‚ÄúCallback URL‚Äù blank. 
Check the box to say you agree to the Twitter Developer 
Agreement, then click the gray button marked ‚ÄúCreate 
your Twitter Application.‚Äù
>> Make sure ‚ÄúAccess Level‚Äù reads ‚ÄúRead and Write.‚Äù 
If not, click ‚ÄúModify App Permissions‚Äù to change it. Next, 
click on ‚ÄúManage Keys and Access Tokens.‚Äù Scroll to the 
bottom of the page, and click the gray button marked 
‚ÄúCreate My Access Token.‚Äù
>> You see a message saying the access token has been 
generated. Keep a copy of this page in a safe place, or leave 
it open in your browser, because we‚Äôll need it shortly.

WORKING ON THE PI
Next, open the terminal app on your Raspberry Pi or 
connect to it via SSH. We need to install some extra 
software by using the following command:
 sudo easy_install pip
>> Next, create a directory for the bot and open it:
 mkdir holmesbot1 && cd holmesbot1
>> For this example, we‚Äôre going to use a Python library 
created by Edwin Dalmaijer, named Markovbot. The 
software essentially takes some text from a source (in this 
case, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) and randomly 
constructs plausible-looking sentences with it. 
>> You need to download and unzip the software with the 
following command:
 wget https://github.com/esdalmaijer/markovbot/
 archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip
>> Move to the new directory with  cd markovbot-master  
and install more required software with these commands:
 wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py && sudo
 python ez_setup.py
 sudo easy_install twitter
>> Next, we need to download a text Ô¨Åle to use as the 
source for our bot‚Äôs random tweets. This Ô¨Åle comes from 
the Project Gutenberg website, but feel free to use any TXT 
Ô¨Åle you like:

>> Then we create an empty Ô¨Åle to place our code. You can choose 
any name you like, provided you use the extension  .py  at the end:
nano sherlock1.py
>> Enter the following code in the new Ô¨Åle:
import os

ENTER YOUR PERSONAL VALUES
Once the code has been entered, you need to use your 
arrow keys to navigate to  ‚Äòyourconsumerkeyhere‚Äô , 
 ‚Äòyourconsumersecrethere‚Äô¬† ,  ‚Äòyouraccesstokenhere‚Äô , and 
 ‚Äòyouraccesstokensecrethere‚Äô , and replace these with the values 
from Twitter‚Äôs website that you noted down earlier. Leave the 
quotation marks. You‚Äôll also notice the Ô¨Åle name  pg661.txt  under 
the words  Construct the path to the book , so change the 
Ô¨Åle name to your own text Ô¨Åle also. 
>> Now scroll down to the bottom of the code and note 
that, by default, this code will tweet once every minute. 
Change this if you wish‚Äîfor example, to once a day: 
 days=1, hours=0, minutes=0 . Finally, you may wish to 
change the sufÔ¨Åx placed after every tweet to something 
else or to  None .
>> Press Ctrl-X when done, then Y, then Return to save. 
You can run your script at any time with the command:
 sudo python sherlock1.py
>> Be sure to substitute  sherlock1.py  with the actual 
name of your Ô¨Åle. The terminal will show the tweets but 
you can also check on the website.

GOING FURTHER
There are many more possible Python projects 
you can do with Twitter, including responding to 
keywords, automatic retweets, and even grabbing values 
from web pages, such as stock market prices. Head over to 
www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tag/python/ to see some of the 
exciting projects that have been achieved with Python. 
Bots have been around for several years, and some have 
thousands of followers. Some of them simply react to words 
in tweets. For instance, anyone using the phrase ‚Äúillegal 
immigrant‚Äù can expect a response from @DroptheIBot saying, 
‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt illegal. Try saying ‚Äòundocumented immigrant‚Äô 
or ‚Äòunauthorized immigrant‚Äô instead.‚Äù
The @everyword bot began tweeting every word in the 
English language in 2007. It tweeted a new word every half-
hour until it completed its task in 2014, after 109,157 words. 
There are also bots that exist for political parody. 
Mentioning the words ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù or ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù provokes 
the ire of @RedScareBot Robot J McCarthy himself, who tells 
you the ‚ÄúRed Storm is rising‚Äù and to ‚Äúcircle the wagons.‚Äù
@DeepDrumpf is a Twitter bot created by MIT, which uses 
neural network technology to analyze data and post tweets in 
the supposed speaking style of Donald Trump. The developers 
claim the bot was trained via transcripts of Trump‚Äôs speeches.
The twitter bot @factbot1 makes good use of images. 
Creator Eric Drass programed the bot in response to the 
tendency of some people to believe unproven facts, provided 
they‚Äôre accompanied by an image. The bot regularly tweets 
nearly true and nonsensical facts. One such ‚Äúfact‚Äù is that the 
Canadian government derives 38 percent of its income from 
the sale of donuts. This is plausible, given the ubiquity of Tim 
Hortons caf√©s in the land of the maple leaf, but sadly false.

Colorize Black and
White Photos
1
CHANGE COLOR FORMAT
Open your image Ô¨Åle in Photoshop. If you‚Äôve scanned a black 
and white photo or photographed it, you‚Äôve probably got a Ô¨Åle 
that uses the RGB color format, which means each pixel is deÔ¨Åned 
by values of red, green, and blue. We‚Äôre going to change this to 
CMYK, the format used in printing things like this magazine, for 
no other reason than we were messing around with the Ô¨Åle, and 
we discovered it works better this way. Head to ‚ÄúImage > Mode 
> CMYK color‚Äù [Image A] and make the change‚Äînothing should 
happen to your image, but the color format information up by the 
Ô¨Åle name alters.
2
CREATE A SKIN TONE
Now we‚Äôre going to create the colors that will be used in 
the image. First, go to the History palette, and create a new 
snapshot of your original image. To do this, right-click the most 
recent History state (probably ‚ÄúCMYK color‚Äù), and select ‚ÄúNew 
Snapshot.‚Äù Select ‚ÄúMerged Layers‚Äù from the drop-down, give it 
a name (such as ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù), and click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù Now, on the right of 
Photoshop‚Äôs interface, you should Ô¨Ånd the Channels palette. If it‚Äôs 
not there, open it from the Window menu. In the palette, select 
the Cyan channel, and select a ‚ÄúBrightness/Contrast‚Äù adjustment 
from the Adjustments palette (Ô¨Ånd it in the Window menu if it‚Äôs not 
visible). Use this to brighten the channel and increase its contrast, 
and hopefully you should get something resembling a skin tone 
(we‚Äôre assuming that your photo has a person in it, because these 
are the most common subjects for the colorization treatment). 
Close the window when you‚Äôre done. 
ONCE, THE WORLD WAS BLACK AND WHITE. Created by MGM for The Wizard of Oz (a Ô¨Ålm cruelly 
overlooked at the Oscars in favor of Gone With the Wind, which invented wind), color wouldn‚Äôt become 
mainstream technology until halfway through the 20th century, and even then pockets of resistance 
lingered, where people refused to install the relevant upgrades, claiming that monochrome was 
good enough, and that they didn‚Äôt trust the free update not to give their eyes typhoid.
Pity the PC owner in this world of perpetual twilight. The twinkling LEDs in his keyboard could 
only show shades of gray, Hercules made all graphics cards (they were fairly high res though), and 
people weren‚Äôt really certain about dithering. Artifacts of this time still exist in the form of black 
and white photos, but we can bring them into the present with a little image editing. Colorizing a 
mono photo can never bring back the true colors from the moment it was taken, but it can have a 
charming look all of its own. ‚ÄìIAN EVENDEN

MAKE MORE COLORS
Create a new snapshot just as you did in step two, 
and call this one ‚ÄúSkin.‚Äù You‚Äôll see the snapshots 
stack up above the History palette as you work. Next, 
create some colors that would be appropriate for the 
other objects and areas in your photo. We‚Äôre going to make 
them for the gentleman‚Äôs suit, his hair, his sweater, and a 
general background color, but you can make as many as 
you need. To do this, we‚Äôre going to use the Adjustments 
palette again, but this time using the ‚ÄúColor Balance‚Äù 
adjustment, the icon for which looks like a tiny pair of 
scales [Image B]. When you open it, you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd color sliders 
that are paired off, so you can slide them between cyan and 
red, for example, or yellow and blue. 
4
COLOR EACH AREA
Look at the area you want to color, and mess with 
the sliders until it‚Äôs the hue you want, or at least 
an acceptable color if Ô¨Ånding the exact shade is proving 
difÔ¨Åcult. You‚Äôll notice that your changes affect the entire 
image, changing the skin tone color you created earlier, but 
this doesn‚Äôt matter. When you‚Äôve Ô¨Ånished, create another 
new snapshot, naming it appropriately. Go on to do this for 
every color you want to use. Planning ahead is essential at 
this stage, because it‚Äôs tricky to come back later and create 
a new color without undoing a lot of your work. It‚Äôs worth 
making sure that the snapshot with the largest areas of 
coloring on is created last, because this saves time.

USE THE HISTORY BRUSH TOOL
The next stage requires a steady hand and can take some 
time. We‚Äôre going to use a paintbrush tool to merge all the 
snapshots we created into one image, making sure the colors 
go in the appropriate places. Thanks to the mono nature of our 
source, the shading is taken care of for us‚Äîwe just have to make 
sure we don‚Äôt paint over the edges too much. Select the newest 
snapshot in the stack, usually the one at the bottom, and make sure 
that you‚Äôve selected an image layer in the Layers palette, and not an 
adjustment layer. Back in the History palette, click the checkbox at 
the side of one of the other snapshots‚Äîit should appear like a brush 
with an arrow next to it; this is the History Brush tool. 
6
START PAINTING
Now, as you paint, the colors from the checked layer should 
be painted on to your selected layer [Image C]. Paint in short 
D
bursts, so you can use Ctrl-Z to undo any mistakes you 
make, and use a selection tool to help you stay in the right 
area if you need to. Feathering the edge of the selection 
(Shift-F6) by a few pixels [Image D] can create a soft border 
between colors if it‚Äôs looking a little harsh. Make sure you 
save repeatedly as you go, and it can be worth creating 
extra Full Document snapshots as you work, because 
the History Brush process can do strange things to your 
History palette. 
7
FINISHING TOUCHES
This can be a painstaking process, but it‚Äôs worth 
doing for a result you can proudly present to an aged 
relative. When you‚Äôve Ô¨Ånished, save the layers as a PSD 
Ô¨Åle, then Ô¨Çatten it, convert back to RGB, and export as a 
JPEG ready for printing. 
C
CMYK is used in commercial printing, and splits an image 
into cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black), which represent 
the inks mixed on the press to create any other color. Most 
images designed to be viewed on a screen are RGB, which 
uses a mixture of red, green, and blue light, to achieve the 
same effect. Monitors, which operate in RGB, don‚Äôt always 
accurately represent CMYK colors, especially where reds 
are concerned, but a system of color proÔ¨Åles and screen 
calibrators means colors can be kept consistent across 
screens and on to the press. We‚Äôve only used CMYK here, 
because it made one step easier‚Äîyou‚Äôll want to convert back 
to RGB before you Ô¨Ånish, and not just because CMYK Ô¨Åles can 
be signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than RGB ones.

Boost Your NAS With
Link Aggregation
1
CHOOSE THE RIGHT DRIVE
If your NAS drive [Image A] 
has twin Ethernet ports, 
check its manual or specs to see 
what forms of link aggregation 
it supports. Most drives should 
offer LACP support, although 
the terminology varies between 
manufacturers: 
QNAP 
and 
Synology 
drives 
refer 
to 
‚Äú802.3ad dynamic,‚Äù for example. 
If your drive doesn‚Äôt support 
LACP, check to see whether it 
provides its own proprietary 
form of load balancing‚Äîsee the 
‚ÄúWot, No Link Aggregation?‚Äù box on the right for details.
>> If you‚Äôre in the market for a LACP-compatible drive, look for 
a higher-end SOHO or small business model‚ÄîQNAP‚Äôs TS-231+ is 
around $170 diskless, for example.
2
BUY THE RIGHT SWITCH
Most home routers don‚Äôt come with link aggregation 
support on board. The most cost-effective way to add link 
aggregation support to your home network is through a managed 
switch [Image B]. It‚Äôs important that you carefully check the link 
aggregation features offered by your chosen switch, because 
cheaper models may not have all the features you need (as we‚Äôve 
discovered to our cost). For example, TP-Link‚Äôs TL-SG108 model 
DOES YOUR NAS DRIVE come with two Gigabit Ethernet ports? When plugged into a compatible 
switch, the two ports enable you to combine the two connections using technology called ‚Äúlink 
aggregation‚Äù or ‚Äúport trunking.‚Äù Link aggregation is a catch-all term for various methods of 
providing a parallel network connection through multiple Ethernet ports. One basic use is 
to provide a layer of redundancy‚Äîif one port fails, the other can still be used. But a more exciting‚Äî 
and practical‚Äîuse for link aggregation is LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol).
LACP increases the throughput of your NAS drive, which means you can speed up the shoveling 
of data to and from the drive. Hurrah, you cry: double the transfer speed! Sadly, no. You can‚Äôt 
increase the speed of a single network connection using LACP, but you can increase the available 
bandwidth for multiple connections. This helps when two or more users attempt to access the drive 
at once‚Äîfor example, uploading and downloading Ô¨Åles at the same time, or attempting to run two 
movie streams simultaneously, which is why it‚Äôs often referred to as ‚Äúload balancing.‚Äù Read on to 
discover what equipment you need, how to conÔ¨Ågure it, and how to test your tweaks. ‚ÄìNICK PEERS

costs under $30, but doesn‚Äôt support LACP. Instead, you 
need to shell out $69 for the next model up, TP-Link‚Äôs SG-
T2008, which we‚Äôre using as the focus of this tutorial. If 
you‚Äôre using a different model, you need to adapt the steps 
according to your switch‚Äôs instructions.
3
BENCHMARK THE DRIVE
Take a rough and ready ‚Äúbefore‚Äù benchmark by 
copying a large multi-gigabyte Ô¨Åle, such as a drive 
image, to or from the NAS. Make a note of the transfer 
speed. Now repeat the process using two separate PCs 
or Macs, and you should Ô¨Ånd the transfer speed is roughly 
halved on each device, illustrating the current bottleneck.
4
IDENTIFY IP ADDRESS AND LOG ON TO SWITCH
First, verify that your NAS‚Äôs Ethernet cables don‚Äôt 
need to be plugged into speciÔ¨Åc ports for link 
aggregation support (any ports can be used on the TL-
SG2008, so we‚Äôve plugged our NAS into ports 7 and 8, the 
two closest to the power switch). 
>> Smart switches are managed one of two ways: either 
through a third-party utility, or (in the case of TP-Link‚Äôs 
TL-SG2008 model) through your web browser. Type its IP 
address into your web browser, then log on using the required 
credentials (if you haven‚Äôt previously logged on to the switch, 
use the manufacturer defaults, then change them for 
security reasons). If you‚Äôre struggling to identify your switch‚Äôs 
IP address, use a tool such as Fing (www.Ô¨Ång.io) to locate it.

TEST CONNECTION AND TWEAK SETTINGS
Repeat your benchmarks‚Äîthere‚Äôs now little or no 
difference when one PC accesses the drive, but the 
drop-off when two PCs are connected should be greatly 
reduced (if not eliminated). If this isn‚Äôt the case, double-
check your settings‚ÄîLACP should be enabled, but passive, 
on the switch side, and just enabled on the NAS side.
8 
SPEED UP SINGLE CONNECTIONS
We lied when we said it isn‚Äôt possible to speed up 
transfer times between your NAS and a single PC 
using LACP, but it requires a lot more effort. Find out 
more with our editor-in-chief‚Äôs handy online guide at 
www.pcgamer.com/how-to-set-up-nic-teaming-link-
aggregation‚Äîjust ask yourself if it‚Äôs worth it, though.
>> One tip if you go down this route‚Äîif you‚Äôre using the 
TL-SG2008 to set up multiple LACP connections, assign a 
different Admin Key to each separate LAG pairing you set 
up [Image E]. When repeating step Ô¨Åve of the walkthrough, 
set the Admin Key to ‚Äú2‚Äù for this new grouping, which 
should identify itself as LAG2 when done. 
E
Even if your switch or router doesn‚Äôt support link aggregation, 
your NAS drive should still be able to support some limited 
form of load balancing through its twin Ethernet ports using 
proprietary technologies built into the NAS itself. Check the 
port trunking or link aggregation settings for a load balancing 
option that doesn‚Äôt require link aggregation: WD MyCloud 
users should try the ‚ÄúRound Robin‚Äù setting, while Synology 
boxes refer to ‚ÄúAdaptive Load Balance,‚Äù and QNAP users 
should look for ‚ÄúBalance-alb.‚Äù These settings should support 
load balancing and redundancy, so if one port fails, the other 
continues to function. Attach each port to a different switch, 
and the connection is maintained even if one switch fails.

own built-in tools, from self-healing to troubleshooters, fail to do the job.
There‚Äôs still no substitute for the self-help approach, and one of the best tools for this is the Event 
Viewer. It‚Äôs where you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd Windows‚Äô log Ô¨Åles, a record of everything that‚Äôs going on, including 
symptoms of problems both evident and still hidden away. By carefully examining these logs, you 
can Ô¨Ånd out what‚Äôs causing all kinds of glitches, from obvious‚Äîif cryptic‚Äîerror messages to more 
vague issues, such as sluggish behavior or periodic freezes. This tutorial can help you decipher 
these logs and Ô¨Ånd a solution to your problem. ‚ÄìNICK PEERS

BROWSE EVENTS 
Click ‚Äú+‚Äù next to a section to expand it and view a 
summary of the events [Image B]. Focus on event 
types that last occurred around the time your problem 
manifested itself (within the hour, 24-hour, or seven-day 
ranges). Double-click an event to open its Summary page, 
then try to identify possible events that correlate to the 
problem you‚Äôre investigating.
>> Review all instances of the event type, focusing on the 
time and date each instance occurred. This can help link 
the event to your problem, but go through all event types 
under ‚ÄúCritical,‚Äù ‚ÄúError,‚Äù and possibly ‚ÄúWarning‚Äù to see 
whether there are multiple events linked to the problem. 
Make a note of each one, then read on to discover how to 
examine them in more depth.

these into a search engine, and see what results come up. You may 
Ô¨Ånd more troubleshooting information via a web page or forum.
>> If too few results are returned, search for fewer words or 
omit the Source or Event ID from your terms. If too many results 
come back, narrow it down by including more information. Include 
speciÔ¨Åc references to Ô¨Åle names in the event log, for example, 
or provide more general information, such as your version of 
Windows, hardware device, or software program.

BROWSING & FILTERING LOGS
What happens if you can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd the information you‚Äôre looking 
for? It‚Äôs likely the events you need to track are buried away. 
Manually browse the logs to narrow your search. Expand ‚ÄúWindows

type ‚Äú*‚Äù followed by your message (for example, ‚Äú*Error 
Alert‚Äù) into ‚ÄúAdd Arguments.‚Äù Click ‚ÄúNext > Finish > OK.‚Äù
>> Event Viewer also lets you create alerts that are 
triggered when speciÔ¨Åc events occur. This can be useful 
for troubleshooting underlying problems, as you may Ô¨Ånd 
a seemingly unrelated event is triggering the error, or get 
early warning that something nasty is about to happen. 
Once you‚Äôve located the event you wish to monitor, right-
click it and choose ‚ÄúAttach Task to This Event.‚Äù

REMOVE ALERT
Eventually, you may no longer want that alert 
popping up (because you‚Äôve Ô¨Åxed the problem!). To 
remove it, open Task Scheduler‚Äîtype ‚Äúscheduler‚Äù into the 
‚ÄúSearch‚Äù box, and click ‚ÄúTask Scheduler‚Äù when it appears, 
or press Win-R, type ‚Äúcontrol schedtasks,‚Äù and click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù 
Expand ‚ÄúTask Scheduler Library > Event Viewer Tasks,‚Äù 
right-click the alert, and choose ‚ÄúDelete,‚Äù then ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

TROUBLESHOOTING MADE EASIER
Now you‚Äôve discovered the basics of how Event 
Viewer works, you can use it to help you track 
down problems in the future. By examining your system 
logs using its interface [Image F], you should be able 
to locate the information you need to go out and not just 
diagnose what‚Äôs ailing your PC, but also hopefully Ô¨Ånd a

starts automatically; ignore the links that appear on the following 
page. Run the software installer, leaving the default settings as 
they are.

MICROPHONE CHECK
Launch Audacity and take a look at the microphone and 
speaker settings at the top. Make sure these are set 
correctly, so you aren‚Äôt recording from your webcam, rather than 
your USB microphone, for example. If you‚Äôre not sure which device 
is selected, click the area marked ‚ÄúClick to start monitoring,‚Äù and 
the input from the selected microphone is shown as a green bar.
WITH AN INEXPENSIVE PC MICROPHONE, it‚Äôs easy to record your own podcasts, music, audio 
books, or narration for videos. The results can sound great, but by taking a little time to enhance 
them, you can bring them up to professional standards. Audacity is the perfect software for this; it‚Äôs 
powerful, but easy to use, and it‚Äôs free.
Audacity does an excellent job of cleaning up audio, but there are a few steps you can take to 
ensure you get the best possible recording quality in the Ô¨Årst place. First, make sure the input 
volume is set correctly by right-clicking the speaker icon in the System Tray, selecting ‚ÄúRecording 
devices > Microphone > Set up microphone,‚Äù and following the instructions.
It‚Äôs also worth using a pop Ô¨Ålter to prevent noises being created by the rapid movement of air as 
you sing or speak. Make your own by following the guide at http://bit.ly/1Y2JwWh. ‚ÄìCAT ELLIS

MAKE YOUR RECORDING
Click the red button or tap Shift-R to start 
recording. Try to keep a constant distance from the 
microphone, and don‚Äôt worry if you trip over a word‚Äîpause 
for a second and say that part again. You can easily cut any 
mistakes afterward. Once you‚Äôre done, click the rewind 
button, then click play to see how it sounds. It‚Äôs best to use 
headphones for this. 
>> If you notice background noise in your recording, select 
a quiet bit of the track by clicking and dragging on a Ô¨Çat part 
of the blue waveform. Click ‚ÄúEffects > Noise reduction‚Äù 
[Image A], then click ‚ÄúGet noise proÔ¨Åle.‚Äù Tap Ctrl-A to select 
your recording, click ‚ÄúEffects > Noise reduction‚Äù again, 
then use the sliders and preview to adjust the strength of 
the effect. When you‚Äôre happy, click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù
4
TRIM TO SIZE 
If there‚Äôs a pause at the start of your recording that 
you don‚Äôt want, click and drag to select this part 
of the waveform, then tap Delete. You can also use this 
technique to remove any sections of audio where you made 
a mistake and had to repeat yourself. If you only want to 
keep a small part of the recording, select that section, then 
click ‚ÄúTrim Audio‚Äù beside the ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù button.
5
ADJUST LEVELS
Did you accidentally move away from your 
microphone while you were recording? If so, some 
parts of the resulting audio might be louder than others. If 
that‚Äôs the case, tap Ctrl-A to select everything, then click 
‚ÄúEffects > Leveling,‚Äù and experiment with the options

ELIMINATE PROBLEMS
If there‚Äôs a single particularly loud part of your recording, 
select it, then tap Ctrl-1 repeatedly to zoom in and isolate 
the speciÔ¨Åc waves that are causing it. Make sure you have just 
these waves selected, then click ‚ÄúEffect > Amplify,‚Äù and reduce the 
volume by a few decibels. Use the ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù button to check how it 
sounds before clicking ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù Tap Ctrl-T to zoom back out. 
>> Harsh ‚Äús‚Äù sounds are a common problem in home audio 
recordings, but there‚Äôs a plugin for Audacity called SpitÔ¨Åsh that can 
reduce them. Download it from http://bit.ly/1i1zfRG. Extract the ZIP 
archive to ‚ÄúProgram Files (X86) > Audacity > Plugins.‚Äù Return 
to Audacity, click ‚ÄúFile > Export Audio,‚Äù save your audio in WAV 
format, then restart the program.

TONE DOWN HARSH SIBILANCE
Re-open your Ô¨Åle, selecting the option to make a 
copy in case you need to undo your changes. Now 
select ‚ÄúEffects > Add/remove plugins > SPITFISH > 
Enable > OK.‚Äù Tap Ctrl-A, then click ‚ÄúEffect > SpitÔ¨Åsh  
de-esser,‚Äù and experiment with the settings to tone down 
the sibilance [Image C].

EXPORT AND SAVE
Your audio should now sound much better! Click 
‚ÄúFile > Export Audio,‚Äù and choose a Ô¨Åle type. If 
you‚Äôre planning to edit it again later, or use it as a soundtrack 
for a video, save it in WAV format to keep the quality high. 
If it‚Äôs Ô¨Ånished, and you‚Äôre ready to share it, save it in MP3 
or WMA format; these provide compression to reduce Ô¨Åle 
size, and are supported by most media players. 
1. RECORD AND PLAY
Use these buttons to make and listen to 
recordings. Hover your mouse over each 
one to see its corresponding keyboard 
shortcut and any variations. 
2. QUICK CONTROLS
These buttons are used to cut, copy, and 
paste sections of audio. You can also 
mute a section (‚ÄúSilence‚Äù), or cut away 
everything before and after it (‚ÄúTrim‚Äù).
3. EFFECTS
In this section, you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd all of Audacity‚Äôs 
tools for reÔ¨Åning recordings, plus 
creative options, such as ‚ÄúAuto Duck,‚Äù 
which enables you to speak over a music 
track by lowering its volume.
4. SELECTION
Click and drag on the waveform to select 
part of the recording. If you want Ô¨Åner 
control, tap Ctrl-1 to zoom in.
5. WAVEFORM
A representation of your recording.  
Audacity records in stereo by default, so 
there are two tracks (left and right) with 
identical waveforms.
6. RECORDING AND PLAYBACK
Make sure you have the correct input and 
output devices selected, to ensure you 
aren‚Äôt recording via your webcam instead 
of your USB microphone, for example.

Just How
s?
Many Cores?
m
SINCE THE LAUNCH of Intel‚Äôs Core 
series processors, way back in 2009, 
there‚Äôs been one simple rule associated 
with its mighty lineup of chips: If you‚Äôre 
into gaming, to avoid bottlenecks, you‚Äôre 
going to want to equip yourself with a 
Core i5, minimum. Four cores are king‚Äî
any more, and you‚Äôre wasting your hard-
earned dollar; any fewer, and you‚Äôre in 
for a world of frame rate hurt. 
However, a lot has changed since 
2009. And although the incremental 
processor performance increases Intel 
has staggered out of the gates since 
then have been somewhat lackluster, 
cumulatively 
they‚Äôve 
provided 
us 
consumers with about a 70‚Äì80 percent 
increase in computational performance.  
So we got to thinking: As game devs 
still haven‚Äôt managed to take advantage 
of the multiple cores we already have, 
does that old saying still ring true? Do 
you still beneÔ¨Åt from having a quad-
core, high-clocked i5, over a dual-core 
i3? Or have those IPC improvements 
lead us into an age when you can get 
away with a cheaper Pentium for all your 
1080p gaming needs? With Kaby Lake 
Ô¨Ånally introducing Hyper-Threading on 
its Pentium range, allowing for dual-
core and four-thread budget offerings, 
we decided to put it to the test in this 
quad-optioned mid-range build.
THE CONCEPT
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM 
Is it time to ditch the old gaming adage?

CORE VARIANCES 
DUE TO PAGE LAYOUT RESTRAINTS, we can‚Äôt put all four variants 
of our system in the table on the right. However, as it‚Äôs only the 
processor that changes during testing, we‚Äôll list them here. 
Our base system features the Pentium G4600 listed in the table, 
with two cores, four threads, and a 3.6GHz clock speed (no turbo) 
for a total of $1,236. The next uses Intel‚Äôs Core i3-7300, with two 
cores and four threads, still sans turbo, packing an impressive 
4.0GHz, taking the total to $1,278. The next step up is substantial: 
the Core i5-7600K, a four-cored, four-threaded turbo behemoth, 
capable of hitting 4.2GHz at stock, and bumping the price up to 
$1,361. And, Ô¨Ånally, the Core i7-7700K. Four cores, eight threads, 
and a 4.4GHz maximum turbo brings the total skyrocketing up to 
$1,438‚Äîa difference of $202 from Pentium to Core i7.
We decided to take advantage of Corsair‚Äôs Carbide 270R. This 
budget chassis checks all the boxes for our mid-range build. It‚Äôs 
accessible, comes with just enough hard drive support to keep 
us happy, and provides a clean-looking aesthetic inside and out. 
Cooling support is strong, and the addition of a clean PSU cover 
made it a no-brainer. For GPU, we chose Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 1060 6GB. 
We could have gone with an AMD RX 480 8GB, but the GTX 1060 
provides more frames per dollar than the RX 480, so it wasn‚Äôt a 
tough call to make. On top of that, two SSD hard drives and 16GB 
of DDR4 pull this beauty right into 2017 with a bang.
COOLER MASTER‚ÄôS LATEST 240MM AIO was a headache, 
as it deviates from the traditional Asetek mounting 
design. With most coolers, you secure the backplate to 
the motherboard using double-ended screws of varying 
sizes, depending on whether you‚Äôre attaching it to a 2011 
board, a 1150/51 board, or an AMD offering. Then you 
place the CPU block on the four screws, and secure it 
with four thumb screws. With the MasterLiquid Pro, 
Cooler Master has removed the screw between the 
board and the backplate, so you have to position the 
backplate through the board, with long pre-attached 
screws. Then, while holding the backplate in place, 
you position the block on the screws. Finally, while 
somehow holding it so it doesn‚Äôt move, you use the 
thumb screws to secure it. Pro tip? Find a buddy or, as 
we did, literally use your head to hold the block in place.
ONE OF THE FEW COMPLAINTS we have about Corsair‚Äôs 
270R stems from the uppermost fan mounts‚Äî
primarily that they lack any form of dust cover. Being 
an awkward size and not supporting 360mm radiators 
either, regardless of its dimensions, makes things even 
more frustrating when you‚Äôre on the hunt for a dust 
Ô¨Ålter. Your best bet, if building in this particular chassis, 
would be to use two 120mm fans to blow air out of the 
top of the chassis. This should at least prevent too much 
dust entering your system while it‚Äôs running, although it 
will need some loving maintenance to keep it truly clean 
in the long term.

OH, THE PROBLEMS of using bits and pieces from our storage 
cupboard: We wanted to use a custom cable kit in conjunction 
with our Corsair RM650X power supply, just to spruce it up a 
bit, but our only kit had already been cannibalized for our 
editor‚Äôs Dream PC from two issues ago, so there were only a 
few bits remaining. A single CPU power, one spare ATX power 
(speciÔ¨Åcally designed for the RMX, as the HXi has different 24-
pin requirements), and a single GPU cable. The GPU cable in 
question, however, was a dual connector, so we were left with 
one part hanging out just below the GPU, which we couldn‚Äôt hide 
around the back, or behind the cable cut-out situated below.
COLOR CO-ORDINATION wasn‚Äôt at the front of our minds 
when we built this machine, but we‚Äôre actually quite 
impressed with how it turned out. We threw in a Corsair 
ML120 Pro in red in the back to spice it up a little, and help 
the air shift around efÔ¨Åciently inside, but the combination of 
the red motherboard with the blue cooler and green GPU 
actually kinda works, especially considering the price. The 
Z270X-Ultra Gaming does come with additional strips if you 
do want to change out to another color‚Äîbut, hooey, that‚Äôs a 
lot of effort for not a lot of gain.

GPU CABLE ISSUES 
PSU COVER
CABLE MANAGEMENT SORTED
LED CORNUCOPIA
ALTHOUGH CORSAIR still doesn‚Äôt have quite as clean and 
beautiful a PSU cover as a lot of its competitors, it‚Äôs damn 
good to see one included here. Three-quarter sized, it 
provides plenty of ventilation for multiple orientations of 
power supply, and easily lets us hide the vast majority of our 
excess cables below. One thing that still haunts us from our 
water-cooling days, however, is fan orientation. We always 
advise that you install your power supply with the fan facing 
down wherever possible, because a leak from the AIO or a 
GPU block, for instance, is likely to kill it.
WE WENT ALL-OUT with this little build to get the cable 
management just right. Using a plethora of cable ties, we 
secured what we could to the back of the chassis, to make sure 
airÔ¨Çow wasn‚Äôt restricted, and to ensure that the rear side panel 
was easier to replace‚Äîand, to be honest, to keep everything 
looking a little tidier. Take your time on this bit: Figure out which 
cables go under what, and where you can hide stuff, without it 
being too much of a major issue.

Although you can‚Äôt see it from the 
front, it‚Äôs entirely possible to mount 
two 3.5-inch hard drives in the back. Strip 
out the crazy 1TB SSD here and replace it 
with an HDD instead, and you could easily 
save $200.

We had issues with the fans running 
in push conÔ¨Åguration in this chassis. 
Cooler Master‚Äôs fan design allows the fan 
blade unit to move forward, eventually 
scraping against the chassis at higher 
speeds. We added rubber spacers to stop 
this from happening.
3
Gigabyte‚Äôs Z270X-Ultra offers 
extra spacing between front panel 
headers, making it easy to identify where 
to install your power cables. Additionally, 
we never install the HD audio pass-
through, because quality generally tends 
to be far worse than via the rear I/O.
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT FOLKS: a double 
whammy mini feature buried within Build It. 
So, is this the end of the road for Intel‚Äôs Core i5 
series processor? Probably not. Legacies are 
always difÔ¨Åcult to quash, and just as AMD‚Äôs 
Ryzen has one hell of a stigma to overcome 
in the mind of the average PC enthusiast, so 
does the concept of the Core i5 not being the 
king of gaming.
Take a glance at the Internet, and you‚Äôll see 
dozens of commentators purporting that the 
Core i5 is the way to go, and that even going up 
to the Core i7 isn‚Äôt worth the cash, because you 
only gain 10 percent performance in games. 
The reality, on the other hand, is very different. 
Across the board, from one of Intel‚Äôs lowest 
$80 chips all the way up to its mainstream 
rendering powerhouse at $350, there‚Äôs 
absolutely no difference in game. It seems 
those IPC improvements have been making a 
difference to the ecosystem after all‚Äîjust not 
in the way we might think.
Building this particular system was actually 
considerably frustrating‚Äîmostly due to the 
cooler being so incredibly annoying to install. 
The backplate, coupled with the fans scraping 
the front of the chassis, and the pipes being 
far too resistant to movement, really gave us 
pause for thought as to whether this was the 
right cooler for us. We even had to unplug and 
reinstall the PWM pump fan header at Ô¨Årst, 
because it refused to pump water around 
the system, forcing our Intel Core i7, that we 
tested Ô¨Årst, to install Windows 10 on to the 
SSD at 99‚Äì100 C, at a paltry 200MHz. Although 
it was certainly impressive to witness, it was 
also excruciatingly frustrating.
Cooler problems aside, it turned out to be 
a pretty clean-looking build. Keeping all the 
storage around the back of the motherboard 
tray actually makes a world of difference. And, 
although the PSU cover is only a 75 percent 
case Ô¨Åt, it does leave plenty of room for 
radiators and cooling up front, and it grows 
on you after a while. Is there anything we 
would change? Well, if this were genuinely 
a build for purchase, not designed for that 
wide range of processor testing, we would 
probably drop the 1TB SSD in favor of an HDD, 
potentially go down to a B250 motherboard to 
save a bit of cash, use a lower specced PSU, 
and potentially even 8GB of DDR4, depending 
on budget constraints. That would bring 
this particular build down to around $630, 
including shipping. 
THE END OF THE ROAD FOR THE CORE i5?

ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, we put the giant 
blue box that was Digital Storm‚Äôs Aventum 3 
desktop to the test. It was a beastly gaming 
machine, but heavy as hell, and just as 
expensive. We‚Äôre thinking of the Velox as 
the Aventum‚Äôs little brother, and for a little 
more than half the cost, it performs nearly 
as well as its elder sibling.
A big part of the Aventum‚Äôs $8,500 price 
tag was due to its Hyper-Threaded Core i7-
6950X, which checks in at $1,700. The Velox 
makes up for skipping on the enthusiast-
class CPU route thanks to Intel‚Äôs new Kaby 
Lake processors. Our unit was outÔ¨Åtted 
with a Core i7-7700K, overclocked to 
4.9GHz, one of the highest desktop core 
clocks we‚Äôve seen on a prebuilt system. 
While it doesn‚Äôt quite keep up with the 
6950X in Cinebench R15 or x264, which 
really take advantage of Hyper-Threading, 
the 7700K was hot on the Aventum‚Äôs heels 
in PCMark 8 Creative, with a score of 9,404. 
To complement the Kaby Lake CPU, the 
Velox features an Asus Maximus IX Hero 
Z270 motherboard. Slotted in there is 32GB 
of DDR4-2666 RAM, and a 512GB Samsung 
960 Pro SSD, connected via NVMe. For 
additional storage, the 960 Pro is backed 
up by a 3TB Toshiba HDD. A Corsair H115i 
liquid cooler keeps CPU temperatures 
down, while the case is outÔ¨Åtted with 
Thermaltake Riing fans for everything 
else. Finally, graphics are handled by a 
pair of GeForce GTX 1080s, outÔ¨Åtted with 
EVGA‚Äôs ACX 3.0 cooling solution.
Size-wise, the Velox‚Äôs all-metal chassis 
is exactly what we like to see from a top-
end gaming desktop: big (22 x 19.5 x 10 
White-hot performance
Digital Storm Velox
inches) but not excessive, with a large side 
panel through which to see its glorious 
innards. Even better, the side panels attach 
via metal pegs Ô¨Åtted into rubber sockets, in 
lieu of thumb screws. The panels attach and 
detach with a snap, making it exceptionally 
easy to access the mobo and hard drive 
cages. There‚Äôs a lot of empty space, giving 
things a minimalist aesthetic, but it also 
means the case can only accommodate one 
additional HDD in the main cage, and two 
SSDs behind the motherboard. That‚Äôs not a 
lot of expandability for this level of system, 
but it should be enough for most users. 
Either way, Digital Storm uses custom-
color sleeved PSU extension cables and 
cable combs to keep things tidy, combined 
with remote-controlled LEDs, making it all 
very pretty to look at. 
BEAUTY AND BEAST
Aesthetics are one thing, but they don‚Äôt 
count for much without performance to 
match. Luckily, the Velox plays games as 
good as it looks. The pair of EVGA GeForce 
GTX 1080s handled all the difÔ¨Åcult tasks we 
threw at them with aplomb, but sometimes 
faltered at the seemingly easier tasks: 
rendering games at the paltry resolution of 
1080p. We measured an average of 113fps 
across Rise of the Tomb Raider‚Äôs three-
part benchmark in 1080p at max settings, 
while The Division registered 150fps at the 
same settings. Far Cry Primal, on the other 
hand, pulled in only 82fps at 1080p‚Äîa low 
score for what should be an easy task.
This can largely be accounted for by SLI 
not playing nice with lower resolutions,

VERDICT
Digital Storm Velox
 BROTHERLY LOVE Beautiful 
build quality; outstanding 
high-resolution gaming 
performance; way less 
expensive than the Aventum 3.
 ESTRANGED FAMILY Few empty drive bays; 
poor 1080p performance.
$4,737, www.digitalstorm.com
and all of our tests fared much better at 
higher resolutions. Far Cry Primal, for 
instance, actually scored the same in 4K 
as it did in 1080p, with its best frame rate 
showing up in 1440p (95fps). RotTR and The 
Division scored 104 and 114fps in 1440p; 
76 and 70fps in 4K, respectively, all at max 
settings. This is thoroughly impressive, 
because 
even 
big 
brother 
Aventum 
sometimes struggled to keep 4K frame 
rates consistently above 60fps. 
Even at half the Aventum‚Äôs price, the 
Velox is still an expensive machine. Like 
most custom-built systems, you could 
probably shave $1,000 or more off the price 
by building it yourself, but Digital Storm 
brings a lot to the table here. Between 
build quality and all the beneÔ¨Åts of having 
a warranty and customer service, the 
Velox delivers on the promise of a top-end 
gaming machine. ‚ÄìBO MOORE

WITH THE VAST MAJORITY of boards, as far 
as average users are concerned, providing 
little beyond greater connectivity and 
expandability, forking out the cash for 
Ô¨Çashier mobos often makes little to no 
sense. 
Performance 
differentials 
are 
almost non-existent, and taking a GTX 1080 
and a Core i7-7700 from a $70 B250 mobo 
all the way up to the $300 kings of Z270 
will likely provide practically no difference 
beyond increased connectivity, better 
looks, and a Ô¨Çashier UEFI BIOS. Unless 
you‚Äôre on the liquid-nitrogen cooling train, 
with a full-Ô¨Çedged arsenal of Core i7s 
beside you, you‚Äôre unlikely to see much 
difference, as the PC ecosphere tends to 
lend itself more to silicon limits within the 
processors themselves than anything the 
motherboards can muster.
So, Gigabyte‚Äôs Z270X-Ultra Gaming 
impressed us from the get-go. On the 
outside, it certainly looks like a high-
end choice. A quick glance, and you‚Äôll see 
brushed black aluminum heatsinks, the 
now ever-present RGB lighting, a rear I/O 
shield, and a cornucopia of connectivity, 
including a single M.2 PCIe x4 slot, a U.2 
connector, a bank of four SATA ports 
(including SATA Express), two separate 
SATA 6Gb/s ports, and two internal USB 
3.0 headers as well. No doubt a premium 
offering, then? Well, perhaps not‚Äîthe 
A badass budget-busting bombproof board
Gigabyte Z270X-Ultra  
Gaming
Z270X-Ultra Gaming is currently available 
for a meager $165. That‚Äôs $30 less than the 
ITX board we picked up from MSI this issue, 
and half the price of MSI‚Äôs overclocking 
pro Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium we 
reviewed the issue before.
Does it show? Sort of, but not in the 
places you might expect. Performance 
across the board was actually pretty 
impressive. At stock, it easily outpaced 
every single motherboard we‚Äôve tested 
to date, scoring a pleasing 21.16fps 
in X265, and a staggering 995 points 
consistently in Cinebench R15. Memory 
latency was also top-notch, coming in at an 
incredible 54.0ns.
However, it‚Äôs not all plain sailing, and 
it‚Äôs only when you start looking at how the  
board handles voltage, in particular, that 
you realize just where it‚Äôs coming unstuck. 
By default, the Ultra Gaming auto-Ô¨Åxes 
CPU Vcore voltage between 1.3 and 1.35V‚Äî
at most, 0.1V higher than Intel‚Äôs prescribed 
settings, and more than 0.05V higher than 
most other competitors. Not only does this 
improve general stability, but it also allows 
Gigabyte to optimize CPU performance 
across the board at stock.  The downside, 
however, is that it draws notably more 
power from the wall under load, with our 
Ô¨Ågures showing 156W maximum, with only 
the XPower coming close out of the Ô¨Åve 
boards we‚Äôve now tested, at 131W. And, 
alas, that isn‚Äôt the end of the Ultra‚Äôs voltage 
problems. During our overclocking spree, 
and similar to all the boards previously 
tested, it still managed to achieve the 5GHz 
silicon limit, but at a noticeably higher 
voltage than the others, at 1.33V, with 
only the Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon coming 
close, at 1.32V. Undervolting also failed to 
impress, with the Gigabyte again being the 
highest, at 1.12V at stock.
Overclocking is only a small part of 
the package, of course, and although 
tweaking voltages can reduce overall 
processor temperatures, it‚Äôll probably be 
an afterthought for the majority of people. 
Voltages aside, the plethora of connectivity 
options, fantastic aesthetics, strong stock 
performance, and price make the Z270X-
Ultra Gaming phenomenally good value 
for money. And similar to the offerings 
Gigabyte mustered last generation, we 
can‚Äôt see many, if any, mobo manufacturers 
ousting Gigabyte from the top spot of best 
bang for buck just yet. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY

IN THE EARLY NOUGHTIES, an interesting 
concept arose from our fervent pursuit 
of 
more 
powerful 
technology: 
As 
transistor size shrank, efÔ¨Åciency per watt 
increased, and die size fell, manufacturers 
aggressively pushed for smaller and 
smaller devices. The ITX form factor was 
developed in 2001 by VIA Technologies as 
a way of shrinking desktop computers to 
a more manageable size, and it has since 
become a staple for enthusiasts looking to 
build a tiny desk-sitting powerhouse.
MSI‚Äôs Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon is the 
Ô¨Årst in the latest line of Kaby Lake boards 
we‚Äôve seen that deals with ITX. And we‚Äôll 
be honest: Although the on-board support 
is as good as, if not better than, it has ever 
been, the rear I/O gives us pause. This 
isn't limited to MSI, though‚ÄîGigabyte, 
Asus, and ASRock have all stripped down 
the rear I/O of their ITX offerings, and put 
about 25 percent less stuff on it. Because, 
you know, ITX system users have fewer 
peripherals, or something. Yeah, we 
don‚Äôt get that logic either. Anyway, let‚Äôs 
compare the Z97i Gaming AC against the 
Z170i Gaming Pro and the Z270i Gaming 
Pro Carbon. The Z97i has four USB 3.0 and 
Z270 ITX oÔ¨Äering
four USB 2.0 connections, giving a total of 
eight. The Z170i has four USB 3.1 and two 
USB 2.0, for a total of six. And the Z270i has 
three USB 3.1 and two USB 2.0‚Äîa total of 
just Ô¨Åve. It sounds like a petty complaint, 
but look at the plethora of peripherals that 
connect via USB, and it‚Äôs easy to see how 
quickly those connections can be taken 
up. A mouse, a dual-port keyboard with a 
pass-through, a webcam, a USB headset‚Äî
that‚Äôs Ô¨Åve ports taken up immediately. Got 
a wireless dongle? Too bad. A wireless 
controller? Not any more. 
PIN POINTS
USB woes aside, MSI‚Äôs Z270i Gaming Pro 
Carbon is a solid board. It‚Äôs nice to see the 
ITX layout get Ô¨Ånalized, with 24-pin and 
8-pin power getting concrete placement, 
and SATA and USB being more accessible 
than before. The reinforced DDR and PCIe 
ports, although laughable, do give you a 
little more assurance‚Äîthe weight of a GPU 
isn‚Äôt going to shatter them. And the M.2 
PCIe x4 slot on the back keeps us happy 
when it comes to super-fast storage.
Performance 
was 
consistent, 
as 
always, with little variance between many 
of the benchmarks. Memory latency took a 
hit, and our X265 benchmark was the worst 
of the boards we‚Äôve tested so far, but that 
was made up for by the lower power draws. 
Overclocking was a little under par‚Äî
our lowest undervolt from stock was 1.1V, 
the highest of the boards we‚Äôve tested, and 
we managed 5GHz at 1.32V, compared to 
the 1.3V of last issue‚Äôs more overclocking-
oriented XPower Titanium. It is a solid 
offering‚Äîit‚Äôs just a shame that the rear I/O 
is shrinking at such a rate. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY

SOLID-STATE STORAGE is one of the wonders 
of the modern world. Thinking about it, 
we‚Äôre reminded of the immortal words of 
Arthur C Clarke, the great science Ô¨Åction 
writer. He reckoned that any sufÔ¨Åciently 
advanced technology seems like magic.
Go back 100 years, and what would 
anyone make of, for instance, a 256GB 
MicroSD card? The notion something so 
tiny could store hundreds of thousands of 
books would surely seem like witchcraft. 
Nowadays, it‚Äôs pretty impressive that you 
can bag a 128GB USB stick for under $25.
Despite that, SSDs aren‚Äôt yet the default 
option for mass storage. That will happen 
eventually. But not yet, not even thanks to 
Crucial‚Äôs 2TB MX300. It‚Äôs about as close 
as you‚Äôll get to a really big SSD aimed at 
a mainstream audience. At $549, however, 
it‚Äôs getting on for 10 times the price of the 
cheapest 2TB magnetic hard drive.
Of course, the MX300 still majors on 
capacity rather than performance. That‚Äôs 
because it‚Äôs a SATA drive, rather than a PCI 
Express model, which brings limitations in 
terms of the peak bandwidth on the SATA 
interface and the inefÔ¨Åciencies of the AHCI 
protocol it uses. The latter never being 
designed with solid-state storage in mind.
Thus, we‚Äôre talking peak claimed 
performance around 500MB/s for reads 
and writes, and IOPs a fair bit below 
100,000. The 2TB MX300, incidentally, 
has the same claimed performance for 
sequential throughput and IOPs as the 1TB, 
The cheapest  
2TB SSD in town
750GB, and 525GB MX300 models. Only 
the entry-level 275GB model differs with 
slightly lower performance. It also shares 
the familiar Marvell 88SS1074 controller 
with the rest of the MX300 family.
Similarly, this 2TB model uses the 
same 384Gb TLC 3D Ô¨Çash memory dies 
as previous MX300s. It‚Äôs that unusual 
capacity per die that leads to the MX300 
range having odd sizes, with this drive 
serving up 2,050GB. The MX300 range also 
has a dynamic write acceleration mode 
that switches a portion of the memory to 
SLC mode for increased performance. For 
the 2TB model, the amount of memory that 
can be switched to SLC mode is increased. 
The MX300 also comes with Crucial‚Äôs 
SSD management software, which enables 
you to tweak settings and performance. 
Among other features, you can update the 
Ô¨Årmware, monitor the health of the NAND 
chips, and toggle the Momentum Cache 
feature, which uses system memory to 
buffer random writes.
If all that reads like a feature list without 
much real-world analysis, the truth is that 
the MX300‚Äôs real-world performance isn‚Äôt 
all that interesting. SATA SSDs such as 
this are a fairly mature technology, and 
the limitations we mentioned mean there‚Äôs 
zero chance of this drive setting any new 
records. What you want is a reliable drive 
with no performance nasties. That‚Äôs what 
the 2TB MX300 largely delivers.
In our synthetic performance tests, it 
delivers pretty much exactly what you‚Äôd 
expect, with peak performance around 
500MB/s, and 4K results in the mid-20MB/s 
area for reads, and 120‚Äì140MB/s for 
writes, depending on the benchmark app 
in question. It‚Äôs a similar story of generic 
SATA drive performance in our real-world 
compression and copy benchmarks. All of 
which means the MX300 ultimately trades 
on price, which is handy, because it‚Äôs 
comfortably the cheapest 2TB SSD you can 
currently buy. ‚ÄìJEREMY LAIRD

IT‚ÄôS VERY LIKELY end of days for Intel‚Äôs CPU 
strategy as we know it. We don‚Äôt mean that 
in an apocalyptic sense. Intel isn‚Äôt about to 
suffer an existential calamity. But AMD‚Äôs 
Ryzen processor is coming, and we‚Äôre 
conÔ¨Ådent it‚Äôs going to shake things up.
That‚Äôs the context into which Intel‚Äôs 
Pentium G4600 arrives. Based on the 
latest Kaby Lake microarchitecture, it‚Äôs 
very much a child of the last Ô¨Åve years 
or so, when Intel ruled on the high seas, 
across the land, and up in the air. Within 
that narrative, the fact that Intel has 
bequeathed the G4600, plus two other 
new Kaby Lake Pentiums, with Hyper-
Threading capability constitutes news.
Hyper-Threading is the ability for each 
CPU core to process two software threads 
in parallel. And it‚Äôs been baked into every 
Intel Core processor since Nehalem in 
2008. Actually, it‚Äôs rumored that it was also 
in the Core 2 Duo, just not enabled. And, of 
course, it was Ô¨Årst seen in the Pentium 4 
Netburst chip way, way back in 2000.
The point is that it‚Äôs always in any 
desktop CPU model you buy from Intel; it‚Äôs 
just enabled or disabled to help cook up a 
few different chip models. It‚Äôs the sort of 
ruse you can get away with when you have 
little to no competition‚Äîa situation that 
prevails today, but isn‚Äôt going to last.
Anyway, the Pentium G4600 slots in at 
$82, and offers up two Hyper-Threading 
enabled 3.6GHz cores, supported by 3MB 
of cache memory. And that‚Äôs pretty much it 
Hip, hip, hooray for 
Hyper-Threading
for the CPU side of things. There‚Äôs no turbo 
mode, and the CPU multiplier is locked, so 
overclocking is essentially a non-starter.
Like all mainstream desktop CPUs, the 
processor cores are only half the story‚Äî
literally, as integrated graphics make up 
almost half of the G4600‚Äôs 14nm CPU die. 
In this case, it‚Äôs an Intel HD Graphics 630 
GPU, at the top end of the smaller of the 
two graphics cores Intel is sticking in its 
Kaby Lake chips. It has 24 execution units 
to the 48 of the Iris Plus cores. So, even by 
integrated standards, it‚Äôs nothing special. 
But for $82, you aren‚Äôt getting special.
What you are getting is very good 
single-threaded performance. The G4600 
cranks out 151 points in Cinebench R15 in 
single-threaded mode. The Core i7-7700K 
manages 182. Put another way, if all you 
were interested in was single-threaded 
performance, and overclocking wasn‚Äôt in 
your vocabulary, there‚Äôd be little reason to 
spend more than 82 bucks on a G4600.
Flick the multi-threading switch, on 
the other hand, and those numbers jump 
to 385 and 970. The 7700K is only a quad-
core chip, of course. The 10-core Core i7-
6950X monster will spew out about 1,750 
points in Cinebench. Then again,  it costs 
about 15 times as much. Arguably, then, 
what matters is that for general-purpose 
computing, the G4600 gets the job done. 
It feels perfectly zippy for web browsing, 
playing back HD video content, and most 
anything else you‚Äôre likely to do day to day.
It even turns in decent numbers in 
games, showing that the age-old problem 
of coding games to scale beyond a few 
cores remains. Just don‚Äôt try to use it to 
re-encode hours of 4K video or render a 
pro-level 3D scene. In the current reality, 
then, the G4600 is appealing. But change 
is in the air, and the measure by which CPU 
value is assessed could be very different 
within just a few weeks. ‚ÄìJEREMY LAIRD

THERE‚ÄôS LITTLE WE LOVE more than a 
case that cuts that Ô¨Åne line between 
sophisticated and garish. Corsair has long 
been a master of balancing on that knife 
point, its chassis beautifully comprised of 
elegant panels shaped in a manner that 
would put Apple‚Äôs design studios to shame. 
But they‚Äôve always come at a cost. Literally. 
Most of the high-end cases pass the $100 
mark by a mile, with only the Carbide 400C 
scraping in just under the margin, and 
anything else relegated to ITX lovers.
The Carbide 270R bucks that trend. 
Coming in at a reasonably affordable $70, 
it‚Äôs the Ô¨Årst Corsair case that incorporates 
the look and feel of the more sophisticated 
400C but at a more aggressive price 
point. The front panel curves down into a 
smooth, brushed aluminum-effect plastic 
Ô¨Ånish, with the front I/O tucked away down 
the side in a recess. You‚Äôre not spoilt for 
choice there, though, with a single power 
button, two USB 3.0 ports, headphone and 
microphone pass-throughs, a hard drive 
operation indicator, and a single reset 
button. On either side (once you get past 
the front I/O), you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd a large section 
of Ô¨Åltered fan intakes, around one inch 
deep‚Äîmore than enough to keep your 
choice of front system fans well fed.
Speaking of cooling, there‚Äôs room 
for a 360mm/280mm radiator in the 
front (3x 120mm fans or 2x 140mm), a 
240mm/280mm radiator in the roof (2x 
120mm/140mm), and a single 120mm 
radiator in the rear. Pretty neat, if water 
cooling is your thing. The vent on the roof is 
something of a nuisance, though. It‚Äôs really 
long‚Äîat Ô¨Årst glance, you‚Äôd be forgiven for 
thinking you could mount three 120mm 
fans there. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs just shy of 
being the right size for that, although with 
a touch of modding and some seriously 
secure screws, it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard to 
mount a 360mm radiator in the top, then 
mount additional fans on to it. However, 
at that point, it may be worth just buying 
Classy chassis 
comprised of 
compromise
another chassis. Our biggest gripe with 
the top fan mount lies with the fact that it‚Äôs 
huge and has zero dust-Ô¨Åltering. If you‚Äôre 
running any setup other than exhaust, 
you‚Äôre going to have a bad time when it 
comes to keeping the inside of your chassis 
dust-free, and for a windowed case, that 
can be a real deal-breaker.
CONSPICUOUS BY ABSENCE
The rest of the chassis is very spartan. 
There‚Äôs no 5.25-inch drive bay, no hard 
drive cages in the front, and a simple three-
quarter-length power supply cover across 
the bottom of the rig, with a cable cutout to 
route those pesky front panel connectors. 
Turn the case around, and you‚Äôre greeted 
by one huge CPU cutout, two 2.5-inch SSD 
mounts on the back of the motherboard 
tray, and two 3.5-inch hard drive mounts 
on the left-most panel closest to the front. 
Cable tie points are plentiful, but there 
are no rubber grommets protecting the 
cable routing holes. Although not hugely 
important, it can help hide cable mess, and 
is something we‚Äôd have liked to have seen.
We can‚Äôt help but go back to that price, 
too, and compare it to the competition. 
For $70, you could get NZXT‚Äôs S340 case, 
which looks crisper and cleaner, and has 
substantially better dust Ô¨Åltration systems 
than the 270R. It is, however, more limited 
in its cooling support. But if that‚Äôs a 
problem, you could swap over to the Fractal 
DeÔ¨Åne S instead, coming in at $80, which 
provides you with full unhinged access to 
up to two 360mm radiators top and front‚Äî
but with an increase in size, and the lack 
of a PSU cover. The Corsair Carbide 270R 
is a happy medium between the two. It‚Äôs 
not perfect, but for the price, it‚Äôs damn 
impressive, and deÔ¨Ånitely one of our top 
three mid-range chassis. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST time Razer has 
unleashed the Kraken, and it‚Äôs not the 
Ô¨Årst time we‚Äôve faced it down. Its Ô¨Årst go-
around, when we reviewed the shiny white 
Kraken Pro V1 in December 2015, didn‚Äôt 
exactly impress; its bass-above-all-else 
sound stage was a bit much, and we had 
trouble with the mic. Can this 7.1 model, 
which sits alongside the newly-tuned Pro 
V2, offer us something more palatable? 
We‚Äôll address the issues we had with 
the original shortly‚Äîlet‚Äôs begin with the 
beneÔ¨Åts (or not) that the 7.1 offers over the 
Pro model. The most obvious difference is 
the lack of a four-pole jack, consigning the 
7.1 to USB-based use only. There‚Äôs also a 
bit of added virtual surround technology, 
Razer‚Äôs Chroma LED lighting, a MEMS 
microphone in place of the Pro‚Äôs more 
standard electret number, and active noise 
canceling through Razer‚Äôs Synapse app. 
Like the V1 before it, this Kraken is a 
mighty aluminum monster‚Äîlight, strong, 
and padded to within an inch of its life. It 
has even fatter circumaural ear pads‚Äî
replaceable with oval models, which would 
suit larger ears, but only if you‚Äôre willing to 
pay for the upgrade‚Äîand despite its snug 
Ô¨Åt, this is a headset that you can wear 
from dawn to dusk without worrying about 
squeezing or discomfort. 
The 7.1 virtual surround is, frankly, a 
bit weird. It‚Äôs highly adjustable through 
the app, but so subtle that it might as 
well not be there. When you do happen to 
catch a moving sound, it feels as though 
the Kraken is painting more of a vertical 
than horizontal picture, a disconcerting 
sensation, which throws one out of the 
game somewhat. The Chroma lighting, 
similarly, might as well not be there, 
seeing as you‚Äôll ideally be wearing this 
headset rather than looking at it. It‚Äôs all 
about making a statement to those around 
you; if you‚Äôve been dying to state ‚Äúmy ears 
are glowing purple,‚Äù more power to you. 
Here‚Äôs something the Kraken 7.1 V2 
does oh-so-right, though: its 5V-powered 
microphone. 
Retractable 
into 
the 
earphone and perfectly poseable, the 
microelectromechanical, 
fully 
silicon-
based construction of the mic pulls in a 
Exploring the 
depths of bass
clear, rich, quality sound that‚Äôs leagues 
above any tiny electret in this price 
bracket. The noise canceling is decent, too. 
This is an utterly, utterly impressive piece 
of gear. We‚Äôd like to see MEMS spread 
all the way across the mid-level headset 
market, and it‚Äôs a valid reason‚Äîone that 
isn‚Äôt silly pretty lights‚Äîto settle for USB-
only headset solutions.
BASS CAMP
That‚Äôs one check in the box, then. So 
what of that all-important sound stage? 
We were a bit concerned when Razer 
described it as ‚Äúlouder‚Äù than its older 
sibling, which we diagnosed with acute 
Gamer Syndrome, as it leaned so heavily 
on the bass. Let‚Äôs begin with the good 
news: through Razer‚Äôs 50mm drivers, 
the crackles of treble and burbles in the 
middle are present and sound perfectly 
correct. You won‚Äôt be dragging anyone in 
to listen to your new headset, but there‚Äôs 
nothing missing, and a rich, satisfying level 
of sound reproduction is on offer. But then 
the bass kicks in, and those clear tones get 
hammered down by a relentless assault of 
low-frequency sound, boosted to within an 
inch of its life, and sometimes beyond the 
point of clarity. It‚Äôs more pleasant than its 
predecessor, and you can futz with the EQ 
controls in Synapse to calm it down a little 
(or, if you‚Äôre a real masochist, switch on the 
unnecessary bass boost), but this headset 
is positioned as a skull-shaker, and that‚Äôs 
precisely what it does. And, overall, it is 
objectively a better headset than the Ô¨Årst 
wave of Kraken cans. 
The microphone is out of this world, the 
padding luxurious, the gimmicks ladled on, 
and the sound, er, enhanced. But you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd 
a much more balanced sound elsewhere 
in the market. This is an explosive gaming 
headset, and if you‚Äôre not consistently 
immersed in a world of combat, you‚Äôll 
be disappointed. ‚ÄìALEX COX

STEELSERIES: a legend in the hardware 
world. Its reputation is only trumped by 
its own new products supplanting itself 
on the way to the top of the peripheral 
hill. The company is neither the huge 
production foundries of Logitech, churning 
out hundreds of thousands of products 
each year, nor the niche-audience-slaying 
design houses of Mionix or BenQ Zowie, 
but a happy mix of the two. And that 
balance speaks volumes. With a legacy 
encompassing products such as the 
Sensei ambidextrous gaming mouse, the 
HV3 lineup of headphones, and even the 
Ô¨Årst ever Rival, SteelSeries has deÔ¨Ånitely 
cemented its place in our hearts when 
it comes to those additional little input 
methods we use on our prized systems. 
That said, mouse development seems 
to have come to a grinding halt, certainly 
as far as innovation is concerned. With 
high-dpi optical sensors now perfected, 
RGB lighting mastered, and a plethora 
of mice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and 
button complements, it‚Äôs hard to imagine 
where the pointy rodent will go next. Well, 
that‚Äôs what we thought, until two mice 
in particular caught our attention in the 
last 12 months: Mionix‚Äôs vital-statistics-
tracking Naos QG, and SteelSeries‚Äôs 
extravagant Ô¨Çagship, the Rival 700. We 
didn‚Äôt manage to get the latter into the mag 
at the time‚Äînot for lack of trying, mind 
you. We initially had our hands on a sample 
in the ofÔ¨Åce way back in April 2016, when 
we thought it was absolutely fantastic. 
However, due to SteelSeries‚Äôs concerns 
with the braided cables being too ‚Äúgrippy,‚Äù 
the company (frustratingly) delayed the 
release, and took the mouse back to the 
drawing board for another four months, 
to redesign the cable‚Äîyep, SteelSeries is 
that serious.
THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX
So, here we are at last, with the mythical 
beast sitting in front of us. The SteelSeries 
Rival 700. We rarely speak about the 
unboxing experience in our reviews, but 
with the Rival, it‚Äôs something else. You get 
a small rectangular box, split diagonally. 
Opening it up on its hinge reveals nothing 
Perfection in non-
ambidextrous form
more than the mouse itself and a small 
cardboard box. You‚Äôd be forgiven at this 
point for thinking that the Rival 700 is a 
wireless mouse‚Äîit‚Äôs only when you dig a 
little deeper that you begin to understand 
what‚Äôs going on. In short, the choice of 
cable rests with the consumer. You get 
one six-foot braided cable, one six-foot 
plastic-coated cable, plus a plastic-coated 
three-foot cable. On top of that, you can 
also swap out the cover on the rear belly 
of the mouse to either a glossy black or an 
anti-sweat soft-touch variant instead ($15 
for the pack). 
And then, of course, there‚Äôs the sensor. 
By default, the Rival 700 comes with 
an optical PixArt 3360, pumping out a 
whopping 16,000 dpi if needed, with zero 
hardware acceleration. However, if optical 
is simply not your jam, you can grab 
yourself the PixArt 9800 laser module 
instead for $25. Simply unscrew the four 
Phillips-head screws underneath, place 
your new sensor inside, and wham-bam-
thank-you-ma‚Äôam, you‚Äôre all set.
Customization aside, there‚Äôs a few little 
extras that really make the Rival 700 stand 
out. You can‚Äôt quite seen the OLED screen 
in the above shot, but it enables you to slap 
any number of small GIFs or images on 
the side of the mouse, alongside in-game 
notiÔ¨Åcations‚Äînot 
particularly 
useful, 
granted, as you should be looking at the 
screen. But what‚Äôs most impressive is the 
inclusion of rumble feedback‚Äîyou can 
assign tactile feedback to any of the seven 
buttons, in a variety of ways. Although not 
hugely useful for the two main buttons, 
having a tactile response from whichever 
button you press helps train your brain to 
use buttons that you would otherwise get 
confused about, making it one neat and 
surprisingly useful addition. The vibrations 
themselves 
are 
exceedingly 
precise, 
and don‚Äôt cause any jitter in your mouse 
positioning. We bound this feature to one 
of our focus buttons in Sniper Elite V3, and 
had no trouble picking off targets at our 
usual rate.
All in all, the SteelSeries Rival 700 is a 
well-tuned, customizable gaming mouse 
at the pinnacle of its Ô¨Åeld, designed to 
incorporate 
absolutely 
everything 
in 
today‚Äôs gaming mouse market. It does cost 
$80, which is a lot for a pixel-pointer, but 
it‚Äôs well worth it in our eyes. ‚ÄìZAK STOREY

WE LIKE ASHAMPOO. It‚Äôs hard to hold anything 
against a software company whose slogan 
is ‚ÄúWe make software!‚Äù And we admire its 
directness‚Äîeven if we‚Äôre not totally sure 
about that name. 
We respect it, too, for still making 
burning software in 2017, when the world 
has long since moved on to Ô¨Çash or cloud 
storage for transferring Ô¨Åles. There are 
a great many uses for those shiny disks, 
however, and with BDXL discs capable of 
holding 100‚Äì128GB of data, the market for 
them as an archivable backup solution is 
strong. But in a world where you can Ô¨Ånd 
DVD burning apps for free on the Internet, 
why go to the effort of paying for one?
 Fans of the Burning Studio series will 
no doubt be wondering why Ashampoo has 
done a Microsoft and skipped a number, 
going straight from Burning Studio 16 to 18. 
Something to do with 17 being an unlucky 
number, apparently, and anyone who‚Äôs felt 
better for noticing that a building lacks a 
13th Ô¨Çoor will surely sympathize with that. 
So, what‚Äôs here that‚Äôs worth paying 
for? Free apps tend to be limited in scope, 
so having every feature in one place is 
certainly nice. Along with the standard 
burning of data folders to a disc, and the 
production of audio CDs, you get a mode 
that tunes a disc especially for the model of 
For those who haven‚Äôt dumped the optical drive
stereo in your car. Now, we‚Äôve never had a 
problem getting in our Benz and worrying 
that a CD might have been made with a 
Ford in mind, but we‚Äôre talking about MP3 
CDs here, and not all car stereos want the 
same folder structure from a disc, so it‚Äôs a 
thoughtful inclusion. The app also includes 
an equalizer for tweaking the output of your 
music Ô¨Åles when burning as a standard 
audio disc.
Movies get a similar level of attention 
to detail‚Äîwith MPEG-4, H.264, and AAC 
added to the list of supported formats, the 
masterpieces you shoot on your cell phone 
can be committed to shiny polycarbonate 
for posterity. That these are also common 
formats found on torrent sites (or so we‚Äôre 
told) is merely a happy accident. The app 
wants to be an editing suite, too, bringing in 
cuts and transitions, sound effects, photo 
slideshows, and a cover designer.
It‚Äôs also a backup app. Large amounts 
of data can be stored across multiple 
discs, thanks to disc-spanning, and there‚Äôs 
compression 
and 
password-protection, 
too. The main reason you‚Äôd want to do this 
rather than chuck everything on a suitably 
sized external hard drive is longevity‚Äîwhile 
most disc formats offer only a lifespan of up 
to Ô¨Åve years, Millenniata‚Äôs M-Discs claim 
up to 1,000 (although this is difÔ¨Åcult to test; 
we‚Äôre working on communicating with some 
cyborg future-Zak to Ô¨Ånd out if they live up 
to their promise). That‚Äôs the kind of long-
term data archival capability untouched by 
hard drives.
You‚Äôre mainly buying convenience and 
peace of mind when you purchase an app 
like this. With so many functions bundled 
into one package, you‚Äôd have to skip across 
several free apps to get the same level of 
service, and deal with a dearth of updates, 
or poor coding, or a lack of compatibility 
with disparate hardware. If disc-burning 
is still something that‚Äôs important to you, 
Burning Studio 18 is packed full of features 
and works well. Anyone else should just buy 
a big USB drive. ‚ÄìIAN EVENDEN

pretending to be puzzled by the weird ‚Äúskis‚Äù 
people are using on its slopes. 
Skiing is one of four sports in the 
game‚ÄîÔ¨Åve, if you count walking. There‚Äôs 
snowboarding and paragliding, too, or you 
can ease into a wingsuit, dragging one of Far 
Cry 4‚Äôs more distinctive modes of transport 
out of the closet, and jump off a mountain 
whenever the mood takes you. 
Graphically, there‚Äôs a lot of white, 
although special mention has to be made 
of the crunchy snow simulation, even 
if it sometimes appears too ‚Äúdigital‚Äù‚Äî
your board leaves a distinct pattern of 
depressions, rather than cutting smoothly 
through‚Äîand the curious lack of feedback 
from running over someone else‚Äôs trails. 
The ability to change the time of day is a nice 
touch, as are the hot air balloons, anchored 
somehow in the air above the Alps to provide 
additional launching points for wingsuiters.
Imagine a Far Cry game with no main 
quest drawing you to speciÔ¨Åc areas. Instead, 
wherever one side-quest takes you, you 
pick up three more. You can go where you 
want, and progress is made by completing 
events, scoring points by performing tricks, 
discovering areas, missing obstacles, and 
Ô¨Ånding creative routes down the mountain. 
As you advance, more areas unlock, and you 
get a feel for the mountains. They really are 
a playground, with no penalties for messing 
up, and speedy restarts if you really can‚Äôt 
get back to the course.

Shadow tactics: stand by wall with sun behind you
Shadow Tactics:  
Blades of the Shogun
FROM A ROOFTOP, you see it all. The guards 
move in predictable patterns, their vision 
cones making it explicit what they can and 
can‚Äôt see. Your samurai partner is in some 
bushes just behind a guard and his ofÔ¨Åcer, 
though neither is looking in his direction. 
Up high across the map, a sniper awaits 
your command. All you have to do is spin 
the winch, and a crane will drop its load 
on three guards, while your samurai cuts 
down his two, and the sniper drops the 
remaining witness. They carry out their 
orders simultaneously, and there‚Äôs nothing 
left to stop you entering the next area.
Shadow Tactics‚Äô name reveals its 
purpose. 
A 
top-down 
stealth 
game, 
rendered in a lovely, painterly style, it‚Äôs 
probably not pushing your GPU as hard as 
Dishonored 2 would, but taxes the wetware 
between your ears just as much. Its world is 
one of predictable patterns and overlapping 
attention spans. Opportunities overlap, 
coalesce, and dissolve as you watch, until 
you judge the moment is right to strike. 
With up to Ô¨Åve characters under your 
control, attacks can get complex. You can 
use your heroes one at a time, but entering 
Shadow Mode allows you to set up moves 
in advance, which are then carried out 
at the press of a key, and this can lead to 
perfectly timed ambushes or, more likely, 
abject failure. So load and have another 
go. The game absolutely encourages you to 
quicksave, even going as far as assigning 
it a button on the controller, if you‚Äôre using 
one. It nags you if you‚Äôve spent as much as 
an entire minute without saving, but only 
offers your last three saves for reloading. 
This makes it a game in which trial and 
error are the way forward, but one that‚Äôs 
not going to punish you too badly for making 
the latter, despite its occasionally punishing 
difÔ¨Åculty level.
It may be set in Edo-period Japan, with 
shogun, samurai, and shinobi taking major 
roles, but Shadow Tactics evokes a later 
period in world history and an earlier one 
in videogames: the WWII-set Commandos 
games. This isn‚Äôt a bad thing, as it‚Äôs 
always good to see fresh ideas pumped 
into a stale genre. It‚Äôs been 14 years since 
Commandos 3: Destination Berlin, which

Being discovered brings extra guards

now sounds rather like a movie portraying a 
bachelor party, in which someone thinks it‚Äôs 
hilarious to dress up as a Nazi, rather than a 
gritty wartime tactics game.
In doing this, Shadow Tactics feels like 
something new, even if it‚Äôs just the latest 
point on a line that stretches back to the 
original Syndicate. It would be easy to 
imagine this harsh but mostly fair game in

I‚ÄôVE BEEN HEARING about AMD‚Äôs Zen, now 
Ryzen, for what feels like forever. The Zen 
architecture was Ô¨Årst mentioned in 2012, 
and ever since, the repeated refrain of AMD 
CPU apologists has been ‚Äújust wait for Zen.‚Äù 
That wait is Ô¨Ånally over, and Ryzen is now 
available. But as we go to print, I still don‚Äôt 
know exactly what AMD‚Äôs Ryzen lineup will 
be in terms of core counts, clock speeds, 
and pricing. It‚Äôs quite the contrast compared 
to AMD‚Äôs open discussion of the Ryzen 
architectural details, not to mention Intel‚Äôs 
routinely leaked product roadmaps.
Here‚Äôs what I do know. AMD is planning 
on a full release of Ryzen processors, all 
multiplier unlocked. Ryzen uses a quad-
core module as its building block, with 
SMT providing eight threads, similar to 
Intel‚Äôs Hyper-Threading, and 8MB L3 cache. 
AMD claims a 40 percent improvement 
in IPC compared to its existing Excavator 
architecture, with clock speeds of at least 
3.7GHz on the eight-core part. Architectural 
changes include a reworked, more efÔ¨Åcient 
pipeline. Each core is a six-wide superscalar 
design (four-wide fetch), compared to the 
previous four-wide design, the branch 
prediction is more accurate, and cache 
latencies and bandwidth are both improved. 
The result is that Ryzen should be much 
more competitive with Intel‚Äôs CPU offerings.
Interestingly, AMD apparently won‚Äôt have 
a six-core model; instead, it will have an 
eight-core chip without SMT as its mid-tier 
offering. That means that at each product 
segment, AMD will deliver double the cores/
threads as Intel. Intel will almost certainly 
maintain its lead in per-core performance, 
but if 4C/8T Ryzen SR3 goes up against 
Core i3‚Äôs 2C/4T design, or 8C/8T Ryzen SR5 
versus Core i5‚Äôs 4C/4T, even with slightly 
lower clock speeds, Ryzen should come out 
ahead in many benchmarks. We‚Äôll have the 
full skinny next month.
Double the cores, double the fun, but no six-pack

WE HAVE A PENCHANT at MaximumPC for 
high-quality audio. Although there are 
some pretty snazzy gaming headsets, 
they tend to meander well into the $250-
plus range for anything close to decent 
sound reproduction.
Turn your head to audiophile offerings 
without a microphone, however, and 
you can easily Ô¨Ånd pairs for under 
$150 
(Audiotechnica‚Äôs 
ATH-M50Xs, 
for example). For the vast majority, 
no mic is no problem, but for gamers, 
lacking a way to communicate with your 
buddies can be a deal breaker. And for 
those unwilling to chunk out for a $200 
dedicated desktop microphone, there‚Äôs 
not a huge deal of choice.
Except, maybe there is. Antlion saw 
this gap in the market, and jumped in 
with this fantastic modular microphone.
Available in two models, the 4 and the 
5 (the 5 has both a four-pole and a USB 
adapter), the ModMic attaches to the 
side of any headset with a small adhesive 
magnetic clip. Don‚Äôt need the mic today? 
Pull it off your headset, and place it in 
its faux leather case. Sound quality is 
impeccable, and the mic supports up to 
24-bit 192KHz without worry, delivering 
some fantastically crisp and clean sound; 
not too bass-heavy, not too tinny. The 
adhesive sticker is easy to remove, and 
it comes with a variety of clips to secure 
the ModMic‚Äôs cable to your standard 
headphone cable, too. There‚Äôs very little 
to dislike‚Äîwe just wish it rotated a bit 
better on that magnetic mount. ‚ÄìZS

TRON V9.9.0
Being my family‚Äôs on-
call tech support, I‚Äôve 
run into my fair share of 
systems compromised 
by a pile of bloatware, 
unnecessary toolbars, and viruses. Most 
of us know the standard system recovery 
utilities‚ÄîCCleaner, Malwarebytes, and their 
ilk‚Äîbut there‚Äôs an even better option, before 
going nuclear, and reinstalling the OS. 
Tron is an open-source script that 
automates the full process of cleaning and 
disinfecting a Windows system. First, it 
preps your system, creating a restore point, 
and running tools and scripts that ensure 
the rest of the process runs smoothly. Next, 
it runs cleaning utilities such as CCleaner 
and BleachBit, followed by de-bloating, 
ditching OEM bloatware, toolbars, and other 
pre-installed apps (excluding useful stuff 
such as Calculator and Paint). Disinfection 
is handled by Malwarebytes, KVRT, and 
Sophos, while a series of scripts check and 
repair Windows. Finally, Tron updates and 
optimizes your system, patching Adobe, 
Java, and whatever else needs updating.
It‚Äôs an impressive list of tasks that should 
take care of almost any problem. Even 
better, it‚Äôs a single download that, once 
started, runs itself‚Äîthough it can take six to 
eight hours to Ô¨Ånish.

DISKDIGGER  
My smartphone recently 
decided that it no longer 
liked my microSD card. 
I can‚Äôt remember if it 
was after a restart or 
update, but my screen displayed a prompt 
saying that the Samsung microSD wasn‚Äôt 
recognized, and would I like to try to format 
it? An offer that the phone couldn‚Äôt deliver 
on, as it appeared to have been corrupted. 
Long story short: No matter how many 
machines, adapters, tools, and OSes I tried, 
I couldn‚Äôt get the card to play nicely again. 
A dead microSD card is hardly the stuff 
of nightmares, particularly as the data that 
really matters was automatically uploaded 
to my Google account. Even so, it‚Äôd be good 
to take a look at what‚Äôs on the card before I 
consign it to the big trash bin in the sky. 
The problem is that Android 6.0 has 
changed the way it handles SD cards, so 
plugging the card into Windows (or Linux) 
reveals nothing. So I turned to Ô¨Åle recovery 
tools to see what was lurking beneath its 
seemingly blank surface. One tool that did 
well, and was free to try, was DiskDigger‚Äîa 
portable app that scans for a selection of 
Ô¨Åles, and allows you to save them off with 
minimum fuss. It took a while to scan the 
entire card (30 minutes for 32GB), but did 
recover a few MP3s and a couple of log Ô¨Åles.

WE TACKLE TOUGH READER QUESTIONS ON...
Cooler Fans
Zak‚Äôs piece on his upgrade 
build had me reading it at 
least six times to make sure 
I learned all there was to 
be learned (‚ÄúThe Ultimate 
Upgrade,‚Äù Feb 2017, pg. 68). 
There was one confusing 
part, though: I could not tell 
if he replaced the very good 
stock fans on the new NZXT 
Kraken cooler with Corsair 
MLs, or if he added them to 
the inside of the radiator, 
meaning the radiator would 
have four fans in push-pull. 
I can‚Äôt tell if the two stock 
fans are there on the front of 
the case, or if he discarded 
them and replaced them 
with the Corsair MLs.
For a new builder, fan 
placement and control is 
very confusing.
My first build is about to 
be the Kaby Lake i7-7700K, 
Be Quiet! Dark Base Pro 
900, and I just switched the 
cooler from the Corsair H115 
to the NZXT Kraken X62, 
which he loved in his build 
(you used the 52, but also 
said 240 radiators now had 
less appeal, and suggested 
280 radiators, with 140 
fans). I‚Äôm also using the MSI 
GeForce 1080 Seahawk X 
GPU, which has a radiator 
and included Corsair fan.    
That means I have three 
brands of new PWM LED 
fans to deal with: the three 
Be Quiet! fans on the case, 
the Corsair fan on the GPU 
radiator, and two NZXT fans 
on the Kraken cooler. All of 
these stock fans are LED 
and PWM. I was tempted to 
change them for matching 
Corsair MLs with white 
LEDs, but decided not to. 
Zak added two Corsair fans 
to the inside of the Kraken 
radiator. Did he replace the 
two stock fans on the Kraken 
radiator with the two Corsair 
MLs, or are there four fans 
in push-pull? ‚ÄìGreg Johnson
REVIEWS EDITOR ZAK STOREY 
RESPONDS: The fan situation 
was a mixed bag. I knew 
I wanted to use Corsair‚Äôs 
ML120s, because I wasn‚Äôt 
massively fond of Corsair‚Äôs 
old-school SP series, due 
to the excessive noise they 
produced. The ML120s drop 
well below 500rpm, and 
produce Noctua-rivaling 
figures, so they were 
definitely my preference.
Originally, due to the 
lack of available airflow in 
the S340 Elite, I intended 
to run the Kraken X52 in a 
push-pull configuration, 
like you said. I actually went 
out and bought another 
two ML120 Pros‚Äîbut just 
the standard ones. Theory 
being, I could place them in 
push configuration, at the 
front of the radiator, out of 
sight, and then have the LED 
variants pulling air through, 
while on display. 
Unfortunately, the cable 
tidy bar NZXT includes 
stops you from installing 
an additional pair of fans 
inside the chassis, because 
the bar sticks out at an odd 
angle at the top, preventing 
the radiator or fans coming 
back any further. On top of 
that, you can‚Äôt mount them 
outside the chassis in the 
inch of space given by the 
front panel for airflow, as 
you‚Äôll suffocate them, and 
there‚Äôs also the magnetic 
dust filter in the way, too.
I‚Äôm a bit particular when 
it comes to cooling, and 
prefer all the fans to be the 
same model, as (I like to tell 
myself) it gives me a greater 
understanding of the noise 
and airflow I‚Äôm passing 
through the system. I also 
love consistency when it 
comes to aesthetic decisions 
like that. So, I‚Äôm not actually 
using push-pull, but if I 
could, I would. 
Apples and Oranges
On page 53 of the February 
issue, the table says 
the Core i5-7600 is 31 
percent faster than the 
Core i7-7700T (3.8 versus 
2.9Hz). This surprised me. A 
few years ago, I got a Core i7 
with a Lenovo T440P, and 
was never that impressed 
with the speed. I just 
assumed it would be faster 
and better than any Core i5. 
Now I‚Äôm confused about 
what to buy when I next 
upgrade in a year or two. I‚Äôm 
a business user, with some 
heavy computing with Visio 
plugins, running semantic 
web inference engines, 
and I use Lightroom a fair 
bit, but no video editing. 
I‚Äôm not a gamer. The last 
game I played was Q-Bert 
at a grocery store in 1980. I 
got addicted and quit, cold 
turkey.

frequency of a processor 
shouldn‚Äôt be confused with 
its performance. A single-
core CPU running at 5GHz 
will be thrashed in most 
metrics by a quad-core

Generational improvements 
can also be a factor‚Äîa 
modern chip running at the

more complex, because 
you‚Äôre pitching a full-
fledged desktop Core i5 (the 
7600K has a TDP of 91W) 
against a low-power Core i7 
(the 7700T has a TDP of just 
35W). So while the Core i5-
7600K does run at 3.8GHz, 
and the Core i7-7700T runs 
at 2.9GHz, they‚Äôre designed 
with very different uses 
in mind‚Äîthe Core i7 can 
be found in tiny NUC-sized 
machines, while the 7600K 
is for more bullish systems. 
Given what you use your 
machine for, though, I‚Äôd 
recommend a top-end Core 
i7, although which particular 
model you go for depends on 
what machine you‚Äôre looking 
to buy‚Äîyour options for 
laptops are more limited by 
thermals than what you‚Äôll 
see in desktops, and some 
of Intel‚Äôs naming conditions 
can be confusing (the Core 
i7-6500U, for instance, only 
has two cores), so it pays to 
look at the details. 
Raspberry Cloud
I am having trouble with 
the ‚ÄúCreate a Pi Cloud with 
OwnCloud‚Äù feature from the 
November issue, and have 
spent hours trying to figure 
out issues on my own. I am 
having trouble installing 
OwnCloud (the current 
version is now 9.1.3). Yes, I 
did read the update in the 
‚ÄúLetters‚Äù of the magazine‚Äôs 
Holiday 2016 issue.
Here is where I am stuck:

chown: cannot access ‚Äò/var/
www/html/owncloud/apps‚Äô: 
No such file or directory
‚ÄìJoseph Keller
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: There‚Äôs 
no doubting the appeal 
of running your own 
cloud server, but getting 
a server up and running 
isn‚Äôt always easy. Even 
with a detailed tutorial 
that runs through the main 
installation, there‚Äôs going to 
be problems‚Äîin order for 
it to work, there are certain 
dependencies that need to 
be sorted, such as a working 
database to operate from, 
a web server to integrate 
with, and a whole host of 
permissions to sort out. 
While it looks like it‚Äôs file 
ownership that has tripped 
you up, the fact that you‚Äôre 
getting a ‚ÄúNo such file or 
directory‚Äù error suggests 
it‚Äôs the previous step that 
has failed. Just to recap 
the process: You need to 
download the latest version 
of OwnCloud from https://
owncloud.org/install, making 
sure you get the OwnCloud 
server build, the one that 
has the ‚Äútar.bz2‚Äù extension. 
Next, go into a terminal 
window, and make your 
way to wherever you‚Äôve 
downloaded it, then unpack 
that tarball with:
 $ sudo tar -C /var/www/html 
 -xf owncloud-9.1.3.tar.bz2
Make sure the files are 
unpacked by browsing to 
/var/www/html/, and 
making sure there is an 
‚Äúowncloud‚Äù directory, and 
there are files inside it. Only 
then can you change the 
ownership of those files. 
We ran through the 
whole tutorial again, just to 
make sure (using a laptop 
running Ubuntu 16.04, which 
forced us to do a few things 
differently), but it definitely 
does work. So keep going, 
and good luck!
Not an Upgrade
I do not agree with the fuss 
Alan Dexter made about 
Windows 10 activation, 
and, based on Windows 10 
licensing, I don‚Äôt believe he 
was eligible for activation of 
Windows 10 on his computer. 
What he describes as an 
upgrade is really a new PC. 
So, to expect Microsoft to 
recognize that he had done 
a simple upgrade to his PC 
is ridiculous. There was 
nothing left in the machine 
to identify the old computer.
It is also obvious that he 
was basing his complaint 
on an OEM license, which 
is not transferable to a 
new computer. The idea 
that he considered this an 
upgrade is baffling. I have 
done upgrades with a fresh 
install of Win 10 without a 
key, and Win 10 activated 
automatically because it 
recognized the computer.
Your magazine caters to 
advanced computer users, 
and your readers expect 
advanced technical info and 
advice. 
‚ÄìWilliam LeDuc
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: We‚Äôve 
upgraded lots of machines 
without issue here on 
Maximum PC, but that 
wasn‚Äôt the point of my 
rant‚Äîit was the fact that 
the process can go wrong, 
and when it does, it‚Äôs 
frustrating. For instance, 
when you say, ‚Äúthere was 
nothing in the machine to 
identify the old computer,‚Äù 
I assume we have to ignore 
the SSD? Or the fact that 
said installation was tied to 
a Microsoft Live account? 
Just to reiterate why 
I had to upgrade in the 
first place, it wasn‚Äôt on a 
whim; it was because the 
motherboard had failed. And 
as a seasoned upgrader, 
you‚Äôll know that when your 
motherboard dies, it isn‚Äôt 
always easy to find direct 
replacements, so before 
you know it, you‚Äôre looking 
at a major overhaul. There‚Äôs 
nothing in the Microsoft 
licensing agreement that 
prevents this, at least on 
a full or upgrade license. 
As you say, an OEM license 
does prevent certain 
upgrades (and, indeed, 
direct technical support), 
but that wasn‚Äôt the case 
here‚Äîsomething underlined 
by fact that the machine was 
activated after talking to a 
support engineer. 
While you may not agree 
with the fuss I made, and it 
may not line up with your 
experiences, highlighting 
problems where they exist, 
and making our readers 
aware of potential problems 
(and their solutions) is 
part of what we do here on

WHICH GRAPHICS SETTINGS 
SHOULD I DISABLE?
We love cranking game 
settings up to 11. But even 
with top-end hardware, 
there are some settings that 
offer little visual difference 
but can have a large impact 
on your frame rate. And 
if you‚Äôre running on older 
hardware, you should 
turn these down to boost 
your frame rate without 
making everything look 
terrible. Graphics options

game to game, so it‚Äôs a 
good idea to check out a 
game-speciÔ¨Åc optimization 
guide, but we‚Äôve come up 
with a selection of settings 
that generally provide 
the least ‚Äúbang for your 
buck‚Äù in terms of detail 
versus performance.

KABY LAKE COMETH, and although it seems to have added very little 
to overall performance, it‚Äôs difÔ¨Åcult to argue with a new chipset 
and slightly better performance for the same price. This month, we 
decided to piece together something of a themed build. This checks 
all those clich√©d red and black boxes, the color scheme that‚Äôs 
become synonymous with gamers. We also decided to change a few 
things around in an attempt to bring the storage up to modern-day 
standards‚Äîor at least, more modern. Dropping Samsung‚Äôs 850 Evo 
250GB SSD, we went with Intel‚Äôs 600p M.2 PCIe SSD instead. At only 
$3 more, this budget offering tops out at nearly 1,600MB/s sequential 
reads for snappy program load times. Trying to scrape back a bit of 
cash, we dropped the WD Black drive for a Blue variant instead, saving 
us a sweet $25, and we also went for an ever so slightly cheaper kit 
of DDR4. 
WHAT A PRICE DROP THIS TIME AROUND! This issue enlightened us 
about one key tidbit of information when it comes to system building: 
In this day and age of supercharged IPC performance, the desire 
for a more substantial processor on a base system like this is null 
and void. As long as your GPU has the necessary heft, and you‚Äôre 
buying a modern CPU, you‚Äôre not likely to encounter any bottlenecks. 
This is where the Pentium G4600 comes in. At $90, it‚Äôs a wallet-
pleasing $115 cheaper than the Core i5 we recommended in last 
month‚Äôs issue‚Äîand, honestly, you won‚Äôt lose a lot by jumping ship. 
And if you‚Äôre just looking for a standard ofÔ¨Åce PC, you can strip out 
the GPU, swap out the SSD for a 120GB variant, along with a 500GB 
HDD, and that‚Äôll take this already paltry Ô¨Ågure all the way down to 
an outstanding $438‚Äînot including a copy of Windows 10, of course 
(which we talk about on page 92).

THIS MONTH HAS SEEN the biggest changes ever hit to our Turbo build. 
We decided it was time we appeased the small form factor gods by 
opting for this classy yet powerful microATX system. The decision 
came about primarily because of the phenomenal saving we could 
achieve on the EVGA X99 Micro 2. At $183, it‚Äôs over $40 cheaper than 
the MSI X99A SLI Plus from last issue, yet it still provides us with all 
the connectivity and power we were utilizing anyway. Because of this, 
we had to swap out the chassis to something more Ô¨Åtting‚ÄîFractal 
Design‚Äôs DeÔ¨Åne Mini C Windowed edition‚Äîshaving off another $82, 
and then managed even greater savings by swapping from MSI‚Äôs GTX 
1080 Gaming X to EVGA‚Äôs SC Gaming ACX, which propped us up with 
another $60 on top. This meant we could plump for some fancier 
accessories elsewhere, and still save a boatload. We bumped up the 
cooler to the stunningly beautiful NZXT Kraken X52 AIO, and could 
even afford to drop another $30 on Corsair‚Äôs legendary Dominator 
Platinums. We also saw a price drop of $84 on Samsung‚Äôs 960 Pro 
1TB. What this all adds up to, even with the splurge on prettier 
cooling and memory, is a saving of $186 over last issue. Pump that 
into the processor, and you could grab the slightly better specced 
Core i7-6850K to net an additional 12 PCIe lanes and a 0.2GHz core 
clock increase at stock. However, we‚Äôd advise you to just grab a 
custom cable kit and some better fans instead.  
UPGRADE OF THE MONTH
Choosing how to cool your prized processor is always a curious 
decision. For instance, forking out extra cash for what amounts 
to a slim 240mm radiator rarely offers any greater advantage 
over another model, outside of a better designed fan and 
easier mounting solutions. However, we just can‚Äôt get past 
how fantastic the Kraken X52 is. With a plethora of lighting 
options, it‚Äôs a meeting of minds between the gaming RGB craze 
that‚Äôs been forced upon us and a desire to retain a degree of 
professionalism that, arguably, all our readers wish to see in 
their purchases.
