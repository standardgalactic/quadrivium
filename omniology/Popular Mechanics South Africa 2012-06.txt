ontrary to widespread belief, 
South Africa does not lurk at 
the bottom end of the techno-
logical food chain. In fact, when 
it comes to connecting with the 
future through new technologies 
and exploiting every avenue of 
communication, our hunger 
knows no bounds – as does our 
pride in home-grown innovation.
Now say hello to FutureTech 
2012, a unique POPULAR MECHANICS 
initiative that will bring together 
tech-savvy people from all over 
South Africa for an exciting and 
inspiring conference. It happens 
in Johannesburg on 25 October, 
and it’s destined to be a “must” 
on the calendar of anyone who 
wants to get up to speed in a 
world ruled by technology. The 
theme of our inaugural confer-
ence is “connect”, a word that 
will resonate with anyone who 
understands the mechanics of 
the 21st century.
Representing the top echelon 
of science and technology, our 
presenters will unpack techno-
logies that are already changing 
our lives for the better, enabling 
us to share world-changing ideas 
and solve challenges together. 
Programme details and booking 
information will be available 
soon; please watch for announce-
ments via our Web site, our 
weekly e-mail newsletters (“The 
Cutting Edge”) our TV commer-
cials and other channels.
There’s also some good news 
for South Africa’s vibrant invent-
ing community: our Inventor of 
the Year Competition remains as 
an integral part of the FutureTech 
initiative. Details of the annual 
challenge, which offers even big-
ger cash prizes for 2012, will be 
released within the next few 
weeks (see elsewhere in this issue).
Now to this month’s magazine.
Our cover story, “Re-engineer-
ing the human”, explores some 
remarkable breakthroughs in 
the design of prosthetic limbs, 
artiﬁcial organs, bones and 
even blood cells. Bionic limbs 
with machine intelligence can 
now sense their environment 
and predict a user’s intentions. 
The prosthetic arm on our cover 
is actually composed of a swarm

EDITOR'S NOTES
UNVEILING OUR TECH FUTURE. 
of robots, each detachable seg-
ment housing a processor that 
works in concert with the others. 
Wonderful stuff, and it’s bring-
ing new hope to many people.
We hope you enjoy our bumper 
32-page Tech Focus supplement, 
which comes free with this 
month’s issue. It introduces fas-
cinating and increasingly relevant 
technologies in the ﬁelds of home 
entertainment, automotive safety, 
leisure pursuits, communications, 
and much more. We provide ad-
vice on buying a new TV, intro-
duce a couple of outrageous 
bicycles, unpack appliances with 
brains, and ask what it will take 
for tablets to replace PCs. 
As always, we showcase a 
heady assortment of new gadgets 
throughout the magazine – which 
brings me to an opportunity for 
full disclosure. Having been con-
sumed with guilt for the past 
few weeks, I should now confess 
to my wife (who is morally 
obliged to read PM every month) 
that the 600 mW laser pointer, 
Music Angel docking station, 
multi-bladed camping knife and 
Samurai steel LED watch were 
not, in fact, “for the ofﬁce”.
Finally, regular PM readers 
who may have been alarmed by 
our “haunted house” headline 
need not be concerned: it’s not 
about exorcism or exploring 
beyond the veil. Instead, we 
explain what makes doors bang 
and ﬂoors creak in your ageing 
house, then tell how you to ﬁx 
them. It’s what we do.

LET’S BRING THEM 
BACK   
I was interested to see the poll results in your 
issue of March 2012 indicating that 25 per cent of 
your readers believe scientists should not resurrect 
the woolly mammoth because they “went extinct 
10 000 years ago for a reason”, and because “it is not 
up to us to play creator”.
What these readers have not taken into account is research, published in 
the same month, indicating that woolly mammoths would probably not have 
been extinct in the ﬁ rst place were it not for people. Our forebears played as 
much a role in the end of that species as Nature.
Graham Prescott and David Williams, zoologists from the University of 
Cambridge, developed a model to calculate how climate change and the arrival 
of humans respectively correlated to the disappearance of species of megafauna. 
They found it very likely that Stone Age hunters had a hand in at least some 
of these extinctions.
Not only the woolly mammoth seems to have been our victim, but possibly 
also giant kangaroos and some big ﬂ ightless birds. The ﬁ ndings, published in 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, are a poignant reminder of 
how destructive our species has been since its early days. If we can undo some 
of that harm, why not?

Think big, people     
It’s time for a big South African company 
to reach into its deep pockets (call it a 
marketing strategy, if you like) and pull out 
a plan to galvanise our country’s legions of 
inventors and innovators. POPULAR MECHANICS 
has laid some wonderful groundwork with 
its Inventors Conferences and competitions, 
but now it’s the turn of the Big Players.
My advice: take your cue from the 
X Prize Foundation (www.xprize.org). 
These guys have big ideas, and set serious 
challenges – and it works. A few months 
ago, they launched the Tricorder X Prize, 
sponsored by Qualcomm – an R80 million 
bonanza to be awarded for creating a 
mobile device that can “diagnose patients 
better than or equal to a panel of board 
certiﬁ ed physicians”. They have also part-
nered with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun-
dation to develop a prize for a better 
tuberculosis diagnostic tool. 
Getting the idea? We need a R10 million 
prize for someone who develops a basic 
but durable house costing no more than 
R1 000, or a device that halves infant mor-
tality in impoverished areas, or a foolproof 
detector of political venality. Who’s doing 
the brainstorming?
CRAIG ABBOTT
OBSERVATORY
Editor’s note: Excellent idea. In the mean-
time, we’re about to release details of our 
second annual Inventors Competition, 
which carries even bigger cash prizes this 
year, and we’re working on an exciting 
conference that promises to light a ﬁ re 
among “connected” South Africans.
Timeless hints dept
As you point out in “Editor’s notes”, 
it’s amazing how many of the tips from 
old issues of PM still hold good today 
(“100 years of top tips”, April issue). For 
example, my wife still uses half a potato 
to moisten the adhesive on envelopes that 
we mail to our clients (if you haven’t licked 
an envelope for a while, believe me when 
I say the taste is awful). Another hint that 
sounded familiar was the one about adding 
sand to ﬂ oor paint to create a non-slip sur-
face. Since an elderly relative slipped and 
fell on our wet front porch last winter, we’ve 
coated all potentially hazardous ﬂ oors 
with non-slip paint. It works beautifully.

black-painted galvanised pipes inside a 
box, the surface of which was a large 
pane of window glass. The box was 
placed where it wouldn’t be smashed by 
falling mangoes or coconuts. Of course, 
the pipes don’t last as long as copper, but 
at least they are cheap to replace. I’m 
sure this approach is not exclusive to 
Kenya, but I am unable to ﬁnd anyone

World’s biggest parachute?
A Tech Watch article in your March issue

You discuss “a parachute 100 metres in

You’re welcome, dude
I cannot begin to tell you how much I 
enjoyed the April issue of POPULAR MECHANICS, 
having been an avid fan ever since seeing 
it for the ﬁrst time on a railway station 
bookshelf when I was 11 years old, way 
back in 1943. Memories came ﬂooding 
back of the many innovative ideas found 
in PM in years gone by. Thank you for 
reawakening those memories.
I especially enjoy the projects that are 
once again appearing for the do-it-your-
self readers. Thanks for the wonderful 
work you and your staff do in bringing us 
our own South African POPULAR MECHANICS.
P.S.  I am the “dude” who designed and 
built the workbench that you featured in 
the third issue of your magazine (October 
2002).

Questions, questions           
Your article on Waldo Stakes and his Sonic Wind car (“The 3 000 km/h obsession”, 
January issue) refers. Here are some aspects that bother me:
l Wing Commander Andy Green was in South Africa late last year on a lecture tour; 
Thrust SSC smashed the sound barrier in 1997; Bloodhound (another potential record-
breaker) is to go beyond that.
l A wind tunnel cannot be used for testing the model of a supersonic car as there is 
no “ground effect”.
l Where does the money come from? Waldo “moonlights as a rocket scientist” but 
he has no qualiﬁcations. Who employs him?
l Where is the planned test ground? Bloodhound will come to Hakskeen Pan in the  
Northern Cape. The track will be 20 km long – for 1 600 km/h. How long for 3 000 km/h?
l Is it so wrong to chase a dream beyond one’s grasp? Maybe not, but, in this case, 
it may prove to be fatally foolish. Are there no restraints in the US regarding people 
wanting to exit this world in a spectacular fashion?
But I marvel at all this. As a young lad, back in the Fifties, I was fascinated by speed 
and the sound barrier. I sketched my hero, Sir Malcolm Campbell, and imagined him 
breaking the sound barrier in Bluebird. I have also lived to see some of the science  
ﬁction of Dan Dare (Eagle comics) become reality. Good luck, Waldo!
