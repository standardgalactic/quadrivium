DANIEL C. DENNETT  
Memes and the Exploitation of Imagination  
The general issue addressed in a Mandel Lecture 
is how or whether art promotes human evolution 
or development. I shall understand the term "art" 
in its broadest connotations-perhaps broader 
than one normally recognizes. I shall understand 
art to include all artifice, all human invention. 
What I say will a fortiori include art in the 
narrower sense. 
There are few ideas more hackneyed than the 
idea of the evolution of ideas. It is often said that 
schools of thought evolve into their successors. 
In the struggle for attention, the best ideas win, 
according to the principle of the survival of the 
fittest, which ruthlessly winnows out the banal, 
the unimaginative, the false. Few ideas are more 
hackneyed-or more abused. Almost no one writ- 
ing about the evolution of ideas or cultural evolu- 
tion treats the underlying Darwinian ideas with 
the care they deserve. I propose to begin to 
remedy that. 
The outlines of the theory of evolution by 
natural selection are now clear. Evolution oc- 
curs whenever the following conditions exist: 
(1) variation: a continuing abundance of different 
elements 
(2) heredity or replication: the elements have the 
capacity to create copies or replicas of themselves 
(3) differential "fitness": the number of copies of an 
element created in a given time depends on interac- 
tions between the features of that element (whatever it 
is that makes it different from other elements) and 
features of its environment. 
This definition, drawn from biology, says 
nothing specific about organic molecules, nutri- 
tion, or even life. It is a more general and ab- 
stract characterization of evolution by natural 
selection. As the zoologist Richard Dawkins has 
pointed out, the fundamental principle is "that 
all life evolves by the differential survival of 
replicating entities. "* 
The gene, the DNA molecule, happens to be the 
replicating entity which prevails on our own planet. 
There may be others. If there are, provided certain 
other conditions are met, they will almost inevitably 
tend to become the basis for an evolutionary process. 
But do we have to go to distant worlds to find other 
kinds of replication and other, consequent, kinds of 
evolution? I think that a new kind of replicator has 
recently emerged on this very planet. It is staring us in 
the face. It is still in its infancy, still drifting clumsily 
about in its primeval soup, but already it is achieving 
evolutionary change at a rate which leaves the old 
gene panting far behind." 
These newfangled replicators are, roughly, 
ideas. Not the "simple ideas" of Locke and 
Hume (the idea of red, or the idea of round or hot 
or cold), but the sort of complex ideas that form 
themselves into distinct memorable units. For 
example the ideas of: 
arch 
wheel 
wearing clothes 
vendetta 
right triangle 
alphabet 
calendar 
the Odyssey 
calculus 
chess 
perspective drawing 
evolution by natuc-al selection 
impressionism

"read my lips" 
deconstructionism. 
Intuitively these are identifiable cultural units, 
but we can say something more precise about 
how we draw the boundaries-about why D-F#-
A isn't a unit, while the theme from the slow 
movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is. 
Units are the smallest elements that replicate 
themselves with reliability and fecundity. Daw- 
kins coins a term for such units: memes- 
a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 
'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I 
want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene' . . . it 
could alternatively be thought of as being related to 
'memory' or to the French word m2me. .. . 
Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, 
clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building 
arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene 
pool by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, 
so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by 
leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the 
broad sense, can be called imitation. If a scientist 
hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to 
his colleagues and students. He mentions it in his 
articles and his lectures. If the idea catches on, it can 
be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to 
brain.4 
So far this seems to be just a crisp reworking 
of the standard fare about the evolution and 
spread of ideas, but in The Selfish Gene, Daw- 
kins urges us to take the idea of meme evolution 
literally. Meme evolution is not just analogous to 
biological or genic evolution. It is not just a 
process that can be metaphorically described in 
these evolutionary idioms, but a phenomenon 
that obeys the laws of natural selection exactly. 
The theory of evolution by natural selection is 
neutral regarding the differences between memes 
and genes. They are just different kinds of rep- 
licators evolving in different media at different 
rates. And just as the genes for animals could not 
come into existence on this planet until the evo- 
lution of plants had paved the way (creating the 
oxygen-rich atmosphere and ready supply of 
convertible nutrients), so the evolution of memes 
could not get started until the evolution of ani- 
mals had paved the way by creating a species- 
homo sapiens-with 
brains that could provide 
The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 
shelter, and habits of communication that could 
provide transmission media for memes. 
This is a new way of thinking about ideas. It is 
also, I hope to show, a good way, but at the 
outset the perspective it provides is distinctly 
unsettling, even appalling. We can sum it up 
with a slogan: 
A scholar is just a library's way of making 
another library. 
I don't know about you, but I am not initially 
attracted by the idea of my brain as a sort of 
dung-heap in which the larvae of other people's 
ideas renew themselves, before sending out cop- 
ies of themselves in an informational Diaspora. 
It seems at first to rob my mind of its importance 
as an author and a critic. Who is in charge, 
according to this vision-we or our memes? 
There is, of course, no simple answer. We 
would like to think of ourselves as godlike crea- 
tors of ideas, manipulating and controlling them 
as our whim dictates, and judging them from an 
independent, Olympian standpoint. But even if 
this is our ideal, we know that it is seldom if ever 
the reality, even with the most masterful and 
creative minds. As Mozart allegedly observed of 
his own brainchildren: 
When I feel well and in a good humor, or when I am 
taking a drive or walking after a good meal, or in the 
night when I cannot sleep, thoughts crowd into my 
mind as easily as you would wish. Whence and how 
do they come? I do not know and Ihave nothing to do 
with it. Those which please me I keep in my head and 
hum them: at least others have told me that I do so.5 
Mozart is in good company. Rare is the novel- 
ist who doesn 'tclaim characters who "take on a 
life of their own"; artists are rather fond of 
confessing that their paintings take over and 
paint themselves, and poets humbly submit that 
they are the servants or even slaves to the ideas 
that teem in their heads. And we all can cite 
cases of memes that persist unbidden and unap- 
preciated in our own minds. 
The other day I was embarrassed-dismayed- 
to catch myself walking along humming a mel- 
ody to myself: not a theme of Haydn or Brahms 
or Charlie Parker or even Bob Dylan. I was 
energetically humming: "It Takes Two to Tan- 
go," a perfectly dismal and entirely unredeemed 

Dennett Memes 
bit of chewing gum for the ears that was unac- 
countably popular sometime in the 1950s. I am 
sure I have never in my life chosen to listen to 
this melody, esteemed this melody, or in any way 
judged it to be better than silence, but there it 
was, a horrible musical virus, at least as robust 
in my meme pool as any melody I actually 
esteem. And now, to make matters worse, I have 
resurrected the virus in many of you, who will 
no doubt curse me in days to come when you 
find yourself humming, for the first time in 
thirty years, that boring tune. 
The first rules of memes, as it is for genes, is 
that replication is not necessarily for the good of 
anything; replicators flourish that are good at ... 
replicating! As Dawkins has put it, 
A meme that made its bodies run over cliffs would 
have a fate like that of a gene for making bodies run 
over cliffs. It would tend to be eliminated from the 
meme-pool. ... But this does not mean that the 
ultimate criterion for success in meme selection is 
gene survival. ... Obviously a meme that causes 
individuals bearing it to kill themselves has a grave 
disadvantage, but not necessarily a fatal one. . .. a 
suicidal meme can spread, as when a dramatic and 
well-publicized martyrdom inspires others to die for a 
deeply loved cause, and this in turn inspires others to 
die, and so om6 
The important point is that there is no neces-
sary connection between a meme's replicative 
power, its "fitness" from its point of view, and 
its contribution to our fitness (by whatever stan- 
dard we judge that). The situation is not totally 
desperate. While some memes definitely manip- 
ulate us into collaborating on their replication in 
spite of our judging them useless or ugly or even 
dangerous to our health and welfare, many- 
most, if we are lucky-of the memes that repli- 
cate themselves do so not just with our blessings, 
but because of our esteem for them. I think there 
can be little controversy that the following memes 
are, all things considered, good from our per- 
spective, and not just from their own perspective 
as selfish self-replicators. 
Such very general memes as: 
cooperation 
music 
writing 
calendars 
education 
environmental awareness 
arms-reduction. 
And such particular memes as: 
The Prisoner's Dilemma 
The Marriage of Figaro 
Moby Dick 
long weekends 
returnable bottles 
the SALT Treaties 
undergraduate major. 
Other memes are more controversial. We can see 
why they spread, and why, all things consid- 
ered, we should tolerate them, in spite of the 
problems they cause for us: 
colorization of classic films 
teaching assistants 
grade point averages 
advertising on television 
Hustler magazine. 
Still others are unquestionably pernicious, but 
extremely hard to eradicate: 
anti-Semitism 
hijacking airliners 
computer viruses 
spray-can graffiti. 
Genes are invisible. They are carried by gene- 
vehicles (organisms) in which they tend to pro- 
duce characteristic effects ("phenotypic" effects) 
by which their fates are, in the long run, deter- 
mined. Memes are also invisible, and are car- 
ried by meme-vehicles, namely pictures, books, 
sayings (in particular languages, oral or written, 
on paper or magnetically encoded, etc.). A 
meme's existence depends on a physical embod- 
iment in some medium. If all such physical 
embodiments are destroyed, that meme is extin- 
guished. The fate of memes depends on the 
selective forces that act directly on the physical 
vehicles that embody them. (An existent meme 
might make a subsequent independent reappear- 
ance-just as dinosaur genes could, in principle, 
get together again in some distant future to 
create and inhabit new dinosaurs. These dino- 
saurs would not be descendants of the original 

dinosaurs-or at least not any more directly than 
we are. Such second comings of memes would 
also not be copies of their predecessors, but 
reinventions.) 
Meme vehicles inhabit our world alongside 
the fauna and flora. They are "visible" only to 
the human species, however. Consider the envi- 
ronment of the average New York City pigeon, 
whose eyes and ears are assaulted every day by 
approximately as many words, pictures, and 
other signs and symbols as assault each human 
New Yorker. These physical meme-vehicles may 
impinge importantly on the pigeon's welfare, 
but not in virtue of the memes they carry. It is 
nothing to the pigeon that it is under a page of 
The National Inquirer, not The New York Times, 
that it finds a crumb. 
To human beings, on the other hand, each 
meme-vehicle is a potential friend or foe, bear- 
ing a gift that will enhance our powers or a gift 
horse that will distract us. burden our memories. 
derange our judgment. We might compare these 
airborne invaders of our eyes and ears to the 
parasites that enter our bodies by other routes. 
There are the beneficial ~arasites such as the 
bacteria in our digestive systems without which 
we could not digest our food, the tolerable para- 
sites, not worth the trouble of eliminating, such 
as all the normal denizens of our skin and scalps, 
and the pernicious invaders that are hard to 
eradicate such as fleas, lice and the AIDS virus. 
So far, the meme's eye perspective may ap- 
pear simply a graphic way of organizing very 
familiar observations about the way items in our 
cultures affect us, and affect each other. But 
Dawkins suggests that in our explanations we 
tend to overlook the fundamental fact that "a 
cultural trait may have evolved in the way it has 
simply because it is advantageous to itself."7 
This is the key to answering the question of 
whether or not the meme meme is one we should 
exploit and replicate. There is an unmistakable 
tension between the meme's-eye view and our 
normal perspective on the transmission of ideas. 
It is time to clarifv it. 
The normal view is also a normative view. It 
embodies a canon or ideal about which ideas we 
ought to "accept" or admire or approve of. (It 
concentrates on acceptance, rather than trans- 
mission and replication; it tends to be individ- 
ualistic, not communitarian. It is epistemology 
and aesthetics, not communication theory.) In 
The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 
brief, we ought to accept the true and the beau- 
tiful. 
In the normal view, the fact that an idea is 
deemed true or beautiful is sufficient to explain 
why it is accepted, and the fact that it is deemed 
false or ugly is sufficient to explain its rejection. 
These norms are constitutive. We require partic- 
ular explanations of deviations from these norms; 
their status grounds the air of paradox in such 
aberrations as "The Metropolitan Museum of Ba- 
nalities" or "The Encyclopedia of Falsehoods." 
There is a nice parallel in physics. Aristotelian 
physics supposed that an object's continuing to 
move in a straight line required explanation, in 
terms of something like forces continuing to act 
on it. Central to Newton's great perspective shift 
was the idea that such rectilinear motion did not 
require explanation; only deviations from it did- 
accelerations. We can discern a similar differ- 
ence in what requires explanation in the two 
views of ideas. According to the normal view, 
the following are virtually tautological: 
Idea X was believed by the people because X 
was deemed true. 
People approved of X because people found X 
to be beautiful. 
What requires special explanation are the 
cases in which, in spite of the truth or beauty of 
an idea, it is not accepted, or in spite of its 
ugliness or falsehood it is accepted. The meme's- 
eye view purports to be a general alternative 
perspective from which these deviations can be 
explained. What is tautological for it is 
Meme X spread among the people because X 
was a good replicator. 
There is a non-random correlation between 
the two; it is no accident. We would not survive 
unless we had a better than chance habit of 
choosing the memes that help us. Our meme- 
immunological systems are not foolproof, but 
not hopeless either. We can rely, as a rule of 
thumb, on the coincidence of the two perspec- 
tives. By and large, the good memes are the ones 
that are also the good replicators. 
The theory becomes interesting only when we 
look at the exceptions, the circumstances under 
which there is a pulling apart of the two per- 

Dennett Memes 
spectives. Only if meme theory permits us better 
to understand the deviations from the normal 
scheme will it have any warrant for being ac- 
cepted. (Note that in its own terms, whether or 
not the meme meme replicates successfully is 
strictly independent of its epistemological vir- 
tue; it might spread in spite of its pernicious- 
ness, or go extinct in spite of its virtue.) 
I need not dwell on the importance of the 
founding memes for language, and for writing, 
in creating the infosphere. These are the under- 
lying technologies of transmission and replica- 
tion analogous to the technologies of DNA and 
RNA in the biosmhere. Nor shall I bother re- 
viewing the familiar facts about the explosive 
proliferation of these media via the memes for 
movable type, radio and television, xerography, 
computers, fax machines, and electronic mail. 
We are all well aware that we live, today, awash 
in a sea of paper-borne memes, breathing in an 
atmosphere of electronically-borne memes. 
Memes now spread around the world at the 
speed of light, and replicate at rates that make 
even fruit flies and yeast cells look glacial in 
comparison. They leap promiscuously from ve- 
hicle to vehicle, and from medium to medium, 
and are proving to be virtually unquarantinable. 
Memes, like genes, are potentially immortal, 
but, like genes, they depend on the existence of 
a continuous chain of physical vehicles, persist- 
ing in the face of the Second Law of Ther- 
modynamics. Books are relatively permanent, 
and inscriptions on monuments are even more 
permanent, but unless these are under the pro- 
tection of human conservators, they tend to dis- 
solve in time. As with genes, immortality is 
more a matter of replication than of the longevity 
of individual vehicles. The preservation of the 
Platonic memes, via a series of copies of copies, 
is a particularly striking case of this. Although 
some papyrus fragments of Plato's texts roughly 
contemporaneous with him have been recently 
discovered, the survival of the memes owes al- 
most nothing to such long-range persistence. 
Today's libraries contain thousands if not mil- 
lions of physical copies (and translations) of the 
Meno, while the key ancestors in the transmis- 
sion of this text turned to dust centuries ago. 
Brute physical replication of vehicles is not 
enough to ensure meme longevity. A few thou- 
sand hard-bound copies of a book can disappear 
with scarcely a trace in a few years. Who knows 
how many brilliant letters to the editor, repro- 
duced in hundreds of thousands of copies, disap- 
pear into landfills and incinerators every day? 
The day may come when non-human meme-
evaluators suffice to select and arrange for the 
preservation of particular memes, but for the 
time being, memes still depend at least indi- 
rectly on one or more of their vehicles spending 
at least a brief, pupal stage in a remarkable sort 
of meme-nest: a human mind. 
Minds are in limited supply, and each mind 
has a limited capacity for memes, and hence 
there is a considerable competition among memes 
for entry into as many minds as possible. This 
competition is the major selective force in the 
infosphere, and, just as in the biosphere, the 
challenge has been met with great ingenuity. For 
instance, whatever virtues (from our perspec- 
tive) the following memes have, they have in 
common the property of having phenotypic ex- 
pressions that tend to make their own replication 
more likely by disabling or pre-empting the en- 
vironmental forces that would tend to extinguish 
them: the meme forfaith, which discourages the 
exercise of the sort of critical judgment that 
might decide that the idea of faith was all things 
considered a dangerous idea8; the meme for 
tolerance orfree speech; the meme of including 
in a chain letter a warning about the terrible fates 
of those who have broken the chain in the past; 
the conspiracy theory meme, which has a built- 
in response to the objection that there is no good 
evidence of the conspiracy: "Of course not- 
that's how powerful the conspiracy is!" Some of 
these memes are "good" perhaps and others 
"bad." What they have in common is a phe- 
notypic effect that systematically tends to dis- 
able the selective forces arrayed against them. 
Other things being equal, population memetics 
predicts that conspiracy theory memes will per- 
sist quite independently of their truth, and the 
meme for faith is apt to secure its own survival, 
and that of the religious memes that ride piggy- 
back on it, in even the most rationalistic envi- 
ronments. Indeed, the meme for faith exhibits 
frequency-dependent3tness: it flourishes partic- 
ularly in the company of rationalistic memes. 
Other concepts from population genetics also 
transfer smoothly. Here is a case of what a ge- 
neticist would call linked loci: two memes that 
happen to be physically tied together so that they 
tend to replicate together, a fact that affects their 

chances of replicating. There is a magnificent 
ceremonial march, familiar to us all, and one 
that would be much used for commencements, 
weddings, and other festive occasions, perhaps 
driving "Pomp and Circumstance" and the Wed- 
ding March from "Lohengrin" to near extinc- 
tion, were it not for the fact that its musical 
meme is so tightly linked to its title meme, 
which we all tend to think of as soon as we hear 
the music: Sir Arthur Sullivan's unusable mas- 
terpiece, "Behold the Lord High Executioner." 
This is a vivid case of one of the most impor- 
tant phenomena in the infosphere: the mis-filter- 
ing of memes due to such linkages. We all have 
filters of the following sort: 
ignore everything that appears in X. 
For some people, X is The National Inquirer or 
Pravda; for others it is The New York Review of 
Books. We all take our chances, counting on the 
"good" ideas to make it eventually through the 
stacks of filters of others into the limelight of our 
attention. 
This structure of filters is itself a meme con- 
struction of considerable robustness. John Mc- 
Carthy, the founder of Artificial Intelligence (or 
in any event, the coiner of its name, a meme with 
its own, independent base in the infosphere) 
once suggested to a humanist audience that elec- 
tronic mail networks could revolutionize the 
ecology of the poet. Only a handful of poets can 
make their living by selling their poems, Mc- 
Carthy noted, because poetry books are slender, 
expensive volumes purchased by very few indi- 
viduals and libraries. But imagine what would 
happen if poets could put their poems on an 
international network, where anybody could read 
them or copy them for a penny, electronically 
transferred to the poet's royalty account. This 
could provide a steady source of income for 
many poets, he surmised. Quite independently 
of any aesthetic objections poets and poetry 
lovers might have to poems embodied in elec- 
tronic media (more to the point: poems dis- 
played in patterns of excited phosphor dots on 
computer screens), the obvious counter-hypoth- 
esis arises from population memetics. If such a 
network were established, no poetry lover would 
be willing to wade through thousands of elec- 
tronic files filled with doggerel, looking for the 
good poems. There would be a niche created for 
The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 
various memes for poetry-filters. One could 
subscribe, for a few pennies, to an editorial 
service that scanned the infosphere for good 
poems. Different services, with different criti- 
cal standards, would flourish, as would services 
for reviewing all the different services and still 
more services that screened, collected, format- 
ted, and presented the works of the best poets in 
slender electronic volumes which only a few 
would purchase. The memes for editing and 
criticism will find niches in any environment in 
the infosphere. They flourish because of the 
short supply and limited capacity of minds, 
whatever the transmission media between minds. 
The structure of filters is complex and quick 
to respond to new challenges, but it doesn't 
always "work." The competition among memes 
to break through the filters leads to an "arms 
race" of ploy and counterploy, with ever more 
elaborate "advertising" raised against ever more 
layers of selective filters. 
Whether this is a good or bad thing depends 
on your point of view. The huge arrays of garish 
signs that compete for our attention along com- 
mercial strips in every region of the country are 
the exact counterpart, in the infosphere, of the 
magnificent redwood forests of the biosphere. If 
only those redwoods could get together and 
agree on some sensible zoning restrictions and 
stop competing with each other for sunlight, 
they could avoid the trouble of building those 
ridiculous and expensive trunks, stay low and 
thrifty shrubs, and get just as much sunlight as 
b e f ~ r e ! ~
In the more dignified ecology of aca- 
demia, the same arms race is 'manifested in de- 
partment letterheads, "blind refereeing," the 
proliferation of specialized journals, book re- 
views, reviews of book reviews, and anthologies 
of "classic works. " 
These filters are not even always intended to 
preserve the best. Philosophers might care to ask 
themselves, for instance, how often they are 
accomplices in increasing the audience for a 
second-rate article simply because their intro- 
ductory course needs a simple-minded version 
of a bad idea that even the freshmen can refute. 
Some of the most often reprinted articles in 
twentieth century philosophy are famous pre- 
cisely because nobody believes them; everybody 
can see what is wrong with them. lo 
A related phenomenon in the competition of 
memes for our attention is positivefeedback. In 

Dennett Memes 
biology, this is manifested in such phenomena as 
the "runaway sexual selection" that explains the 
long and cumbersome tail of the bird of paradise 
or the peacock. Dawkins provides an example 
from the world of publishing: "Best-seller lists 
of books are published weekly, and it is undoubt- 
edly true that as soon as a book sells enough 
copies to appear in one of these lists, its sales 
increase even more, simply by virtue of that 
fact. Publishers speak of a book "taking off," 
and those publishers with some knowledge of 
science even speak of a "critical mass for take- 
off."'' 
The haven all memes depend on reaching is 
the human mind. which is itself an artifact cre- 
ated when memes restructure a human brain in 
order to make it a better habitat for memes. The 
avenues for entry and departure are modified to 
suit local conditions, and strengthened by vari- 
ous artificial devices that enhance fidelity and 
prolixity of replication. Native Chinese minds 
differ dramatically from native French minds, 
and literate minds differ from illiterate minds. 
What memes provide in return to the organisms 
in which they reside is an incalculable store of 
advantages-with some Trojan horses thrown in 
for good measure, no doubt. Normal human 
brains are not all alike; they vary considerably in 
size, shape, and in the myriad details of connec- 
tion on which their prowess depends. But the 
most striking differences in human prowess de- 
pend on micro-structural differences (still in- 
scrutable to neuroscience) induced by the vari- 
ous memes that have entered them and taken up 
residence. The memes enhance each other's 06- 
portunities: the meme for education, for in- 
stance, is a meme that reinforces the very pro- 
. . 
cess of meme-implantation. 
If it is true that human minds are themselves 
to a great degree the creations of memes, we 
cannot sustain the polarity of vision with which 
we started. It cannot be "memes versus us." 
because earlier infestations of memes have al- 
ready played a major role in determining who or 
what we are. (Some folks say you are what you 
eat, but it is closer to the truth to say you are 
what you read.) The "independent" mind strug- 
gling to protect itself from alien and dangerous 
memes is a myth. There is (in the basement, one 
might say) a persisting tension between the bio- 
logical imperative of the genes and the imper- 
atives of the memes, but we would be foolish to 
"side with" our genes-that 
is to commit the 
most egregious error of pop sociobiology. What 
foundation, then, can we stand on as we struggle 
to keep our feet in the memestorm in which we 
are engulfed? If replicative might does not make 
right, what is to be the eternal ideal relative to 
which "we" will judge the value of memes? We 
should note that the memes for normative con- 
cepts-for ought and good and truth and beauty 
are among the most entrenched denizens of our 
minds, and that among the memes that constitute 
us, they play a central role. Our existence as us, 
as what we as thinkers are-not as what we as or- 
ganisms are-is not independent of these memes. 
Dawkins ends The Selfish Gene with a pas- 
sage that many of his critics must not have read: 
We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our 
birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our 
indoctrination. . . . We are built as gene machines and 
cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to 
turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can 
rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators. 
( P  215) 
In thus distancing himself thus forcefully from 
the oversimplifications of pop sociobiology, he 
somewhat overstates his case. This "we" that 
transcends not only its genetic creators but also 
its memetic creators is a myth. Dawkins seems 
to acknowledge this in his later work. In The 
Extended Phenotype, Dawkins argues for the 
biological perspective that recognizes the bea- 
ver's dam, the spider's web, the bird's nest as not 
merely products of the phenotype-the individ-
ual organism considered as a functional whole- 
but rather as parts of the phenotype, on a par 
with the beaver's teeth, the spider's legs, the 
bird's wing. From this perspective, the vast pro- 
tective networks of memes we spin is as integral 
to our phenotypes-to explaining our competen- 
cies, our chances, our vicissitudes-as anything 
in our more narrowly biological endowment.I2 
There is no radical discontinuity; one can be a 
mammal, a father, a citizen, scholar, Democrat, 
and an associate professor with tenure. Just as 
man-made barns are an integral part of the barn 
swallow's ecology, so cathedrals and universi- 
ties-and factories and prisons-are an integral 
part of our ecology."They are the memes without 
which we could not live in these environments. 
Homo sapiens has been around for half a 

million years. The first serious invasion of 
memes began with spoken language only tens of 
thousands of years ago. The second great wave, 
riding on the meme for writing, is considerably 
less than ten thousand years in progress-a brief 
moment in biological time. Since memetic evo- 
lution occurs on a time scale thousands of times 
faster than genetic evolution, however, in the 
period since there have been memes-only tens 
of thousands of years-the 
contributing effects 
of meme-structures on our constitution-on hu-
man phenotypes-vastly outweigh the effects of 
genetic evolution during that period. So we can 
answer the defining question of the Mandel Lec- 
ture with a rousing affirmative. Does art (in the 
broad sense) contribute to human evolution? It 
certainly does. In fact, since art appeared on the 
scene, it has virtually supplanted all other con- 
tributions to human evolution. l 3  
I would like to close with some observations 
on the history of the meme meme itself, and how 
its spread was temporarily curtailed. When Daw- 
luns introduced memes in 1976, he described his 
innovation as a literal extension of the classical 
Darwinian theory and so I have treated it here. 
Dawkins, however, has since drawn in his horns 
slightly. In The Blind Watchmaker (1988), he 
speaks of an analogy "which I find inspiring but 
which can be taken too far if we are not careful" 
(p. 196). He go on to say "Cultural 'evolution' 
is not really evolution at all if we are being fussy 
and purist about our use of words, but there may 
be enough in common between them to justify 
some comparison of principles" (p. 2 16). Why 
did he retreat like this? Why, indeed, is the 
meme meme so little discussed thirteen years 
after The Se@sh Gene appeared? 
In The Extended Phenotype, Dawkins replies 
forcefully to the storm of criticism from sociobi- 
ologists, while conceding some interesting but in- 
essential disanalogies between genes and memes- 
memes are not strung out along linear chromosomes, 
and it is not clear that they occupy and compete for 
discrete 'loci', or that they have identifiable 'alleles' 
...The copying process is probably much less precise 
than in the case of genes ... memes may partially 
blend with each other in a way that genes do not. 
( P  112) 
But then he retreats further, apparently in the 
face of unnamed and unquoted adversaries: 
The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 
My own feeling is that its [the meme meme's] main 
value may lie not so much in helping us to understand 
human culture as in sharpening our perception of 
genetic natural selection. This is the only reason I am 
presumptuous enough to discuss it, for I do not know 
enough about the existing literature on human culture 
to make an authoritative contribution to it. (p. 112) 
I think that what happened to the meme meme 
is quite obvious: "humanist" minds have set up 
a particularly aggressive set of filters against 
memes coming from "sociobiology." Once Daw- 
kins was identified as a sociobiologist, this al- 
most guaranteed rejection of whatever this inter- 
loper had to say about culture-not 
for good 
reasons, but just in a sort of immunological 
rejection. l4 
But look how the meme meme has now infil- 
trated itself into another, less alien vehicle, a 
clearly identified, card-carrying academic hu- 
manist, a philosopher. In this guise-clothed in a 
philosopher's sort of words-will it find better 
chances of replication? I hope so. 
My chosen role in this Mandel Lecture has 
been a humble one, a mere vector, a transmitter, 
with just a few embellishments and mutations, 
of a meme that has come to play a large role in 
my mind-large enough, for instance, to deter- 
mine the content of this lecture. My purpose, 
after all, has been to create in your minds robust, 
aggressive copies of various memes that inhabit 
my mind. I hope that I have succeeded in that 
modest goal, and moreover, that you will forgive 
me for reviving "It Takes Two to Tango" and be 
grateful to me for passing on the meme meme.

5. Peter Kivy informed me after the Mandel Lecture that 
this oft-quoted passage is counterfeit-not Mozart at all. I

found it in Jacques Hadamard's classic study, The Psychol- 
ogy oflnventing in the Mathematical Field (Princeton Uni- 
versity Press, 1949). p. 16 [emphasis added], and first 
quoted it myself in "Why the Law of Effect Will Not Go 
Away," Journal ofthe Theory of Social Behaviour 5 (1975): 
169-87, reprinted in my book, Brainstorms (MIT PressIA 
Bradford Book, 1978). I persist in quoting it here, in spite of 
Kivy's correction, because it not only expresses but exem- 
plifies the thesis that memes, once they exist, are indepen- 
dent of authors and critics alike. Historical accuracy is 
important (which is why I have written this footnote), but the 
passage so well suits my purposes that I am choosing to 
ignore its pedigree. I might not have persisted in this, had I 
not encountered a supporting meme the day after Kivy 
informed me: I overheard a guide at the Metropolitan Mu- 
seum of Art, commenting on the Gilbert Stuart portrait of 
George Washington: "This may not be what George Wash- 
ington looked like then, but this is what he looks like now."

9. This, the "tragedy of the commons," deserves a more 
careful treatment than I can offer on this occasion. Note too 
that I am submerging a complication that properly should 
bring our discussion full circle, back to the ideas of Adam 
Smith about economic competition that first inspired Dar- 
win. The competition of the billboards is competition for our 
attention, but the ulterior goal of acquiring our attention is 
the seller's goal of acquiring our money, not the meme's goal 
of replicating itself. The academic examples are not inde- 
pendent of economics, of course, but economics plays a less 
dominant role, as was ironically acknowledged on a T-shirt 
worn by a member of the audience at the Mandel Lecture: 
"Philosophy: I'm in it for the money." 
10. The confirmation of this claim is left as an exercise 
for the reader. Among the memes that structure the info- 
sphere and hence affect the transmission of other memes are 
the laws of libel.

Longman Scientific, 1986). p. 219. Dawkins' discussion of 
these complex phenomena, in the chapter "Explosions and 
Spirals" (pp. 195-220), is a tour de force of explanatory 
clarity and vividness. 
12. In several recent essays I have expanded on the claim 
that the very structure of our minds is more a product of 
culture than of the neuroanatomy we are born with: "Julian 
Jaynes' Software Archeology," in Canadian Psychology 27

ity," originally published as "Why we are all novelists,"

13. Those who are familiar with the Baldwin Effect will 
recognize that art contributes not merely to the fixing of 
phenotypic plasticity, but can thereby change the selective 
environment and hence hasten the pace of genetic evolution. 
See my discussion in "The Evolution of Consciousness," 
and Jonathan Schull, "Are Species Intelligent?" forthcom- 
ing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 
14. A striking example of the vituperative and uncom- 
prehending dismissal of Dawkins by a humanist who identi- 
fies him as a sociobiologist is found in Mary Midgley, 
"Gene Juggling," Philosophy 54 (1979): 439-458, an attack 
so wide of the mark that it should not be read without its an- 
tidote: Dawkins's response. "In Defence of Selfish Genes," 
Philosophy 56 (1981): 556-573.
