About the Authors
Alan L. Rubin, MD, is one of the nation’s foremost experts on diabetes.
He is a professional member of the American Diabetes Association and the
Endocrine Society and has been in private practice specializing in diabetes
and thyroid disease for over 25 years. Dr. Rubin was assistant clinical profes-
sor of medicine at University of California Medical Center in San Francisco for
20 years. He has spoken about diabetes to professional medical audiences and
nonmedical audiences around the world. He has been a consultant to many
pharmaceutical companies and companies that make diabetes products.
Dr. Rubin was one of the first specialists in his field to recognize the signifi-
cance of patient self-testing of blood glucose, the major advance in diabetes
care since the advent of insulin. As a result, he has been on numerous radio
and television programs, talking about the cause, prevention, and treatment
of diabetes and its complications. His first book, Diabetes For Dummies, is a
basic reference for any nonprofessional who wants to understand diabetes.
It has sold more than 250,000 copies and has been translated into French,
Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian. It is out in a second edition. He is also the
author of Thyroid For Dummies and High Blood Pressure For Dummies.
Alison G. Acerra, RD, is a registered dietitian/nutrition consultant. She
received her undergraduate degree in applied nutrition at Pennsylvania State
University and continued her graduate studies at New York University, where
she earned her Master of Science degree in clinical nutrition. Alison is cur-
rently working as an outpatient dietitian in San Francisco, where she con-
ducts individual and group nutrition counseling sessions. She also consults
privately with clients, specializing in weight management, diabetes preven-
tion and management, cardiovascular health, sports nutrition, and gastric
bypass surgery. A lover of good food and wine, Alison cooks often but enjoys
dining out more! She stays active exploring San Francisco and is currently
considering the location of her second marathon.
Chef Denise Sharf, who created many of the breakfast, lunch, and appetizer
recipes in this book, as well as in the first edition, has received accreditation
by the American Culinary Federation as a Certified Chef de Cuisine. She is a
retired personal chef and has held positions as an executive chef and chef de
garde manger for several major hotel chains and restaurants. Chef Sharf has
achieved recognition as a culinary competitor, judge, and presenter of semi-
nars and can be reached by e-mail at ChefDeni@bellsouth.net.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the great chefs and restaurant owners, especially
the ones in this book, who spend all their time and creative energy producing
delicious and nutritious food in a beautiful environment and making sure that
it is served in a way that complements the taste.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Acquisitions editor Mikal Belicove, who shepherded this second edition
through all the committees that had to approve it, deserves special commen-
dation. Project editor Traci Cumbay, who had to go on maternity leave; her
outstanding replacement, project editor Georgette Beatty; along with senior
copy editor Tina Sims made certain that the book is understandable and
readable in the great For Dummies tradition.
Chef Denise Sharf, as she did for the first edition, produced most of the
recipes for breakfast, lunch, and appetizers. Her help has been invaluable,
and she has set an example for really nutritious food.
Heather Dismore is responsible for most of the discussions of food and the
organization of the recipes in the book, and she also contributed a number of
excellent recipes. Her tremendous skill in doing so is apparent in this book
and in another book that she helped author, Cooking Around the World All-in-
One For Dummies.
Recipe tester Emily Nolan has not only checked every recipe to verify that
it can be successfully prepared and tastes very good but has also offered
numerous suggestions for replacing or reducing ingredients so that the fin-
ished product is a perfect fit for a person with diabetes.
Reviewers Dawn M. Ayers, MD, and Patty Santelli did a fantastic job of ensur-
ing that the information in the book is accurate.
Dr. Rubin’s wife, Enid, has shown great patience, perseverance, and love in
providing the time and the environment in which he could write this book.

Introduction
P
eople with diabetes can eat great food! We don’t have to prove that
statement anymore. The recipes in Dr. Rubin’s previous book, Diabetes
For Dummies (published by Wiley), and the first edition of this book show
that people can follow a diabetic diet at home or anywhere they travel and
still enjoy a five-star meal. They just have to know how to cook it or where
to go to get it.
More and more eating is being done away from home or, if at home, from food
in the form of take-out from a local supermarket or restaurant, and people with
diabetes want to know what they can and can’t eat.
If you bought Diabetes For Dummies, you know that you can find such food in
Chicago, New York City, Santa Monica, and San Francisco. But what about the
rest of the world? This book is both a cookbook that shows you how to pre-
pare great foods in your own home and a guide to eating out in restaurants
and fast-food places.
Is diet important for a person with diabetes? Do salmon swim upstream? The
Diabetes Control and Complications Trials showed that a good diabetic diet
could lower the hemoglobin A1c, a test of overall blood glucose control, by
over 1 percent. That much improvement will result in a reduction of compli-
cations of diabetes such as eye disease, nerve disease, and kidney disease
by 25 percent or more. The progression of complications that have already
started to occur can be significantly slowed.
Of course, there’s much more to managing diabetes than diet alone. In
this book, you can discover the place of diet in a complete program of dia-
betes care.
About This Book
You wouldn’t read a cookbook from cover to cover, and this book is no excep-
tion to that rule. There’s no reason to read about setting up your kitchen if
you simply want a place to eat in New York where you can find healthy nutri-
tion for your diabetes. You may want to read the first few chapters to get an
overview of the place of diet in your overall diabetes management, but if you
just need a great entree for tonight’s supper or a great restaurant wherever
you are, go right to that information. The book is written to be understood no
matter where you find yourself in it.

Conventions Used in This Book
The recipes in this book are produced in a standard form that tells you what
you’re cooking, how much you’re cooking, and how to cook it. The prepara-
tion time, cooking time (which is in addition to the prep time), and yield, or
number of servings, are all presented at the beginning of the recipe, followed
by a list of ingredients. We suggest that you always read through a recipe
completely before you start preparing it so that you can make sure you have
all the ingredients and equipment you need.
Chefs sometimes use exotic ingredients that may not be easily available to
you. With the permission of the chefs, we have tried to substitute more
common ingredients. On the other hand, walking into a store that sells spe-
cial ingredients for a Chinese meal or an Indian meal, for example, can be a
fascinating experience. We always define ingredients that are unfamiliar to
English-speaking eaters in the introduction to the recipe.
You can find nutrition information and diabetic exchanges at the end of every
recipe so that you can incorporate the recipe into your nutrition plan. The
nutrition information is always given in the following order:
 Kcalories (see Chapter 1)
 Kcalories from fat
 Grams of fat
 Grams of saturated fat
 Milligrams of cholesterol
 Milligrams of sodium
 Grams of carbohydrate
 Grams of fiber
 Grams of protein
If salt is listed in a recipe as an optional ingredient or listed “to taste,” it isn’t
figured into the nutritional information; but if a specific amount of salt is
listed in the recipe, that amount is calculated into the nutritional information.
Serving sizes are always calculated as the total recipe divided by the number
of servings listed at the beginning of the recipe.
You can find more information about the exchange lists in Chapter 2 and a
comprehensive list of food exchanges in Appendix B.
2
Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Here are a few other guidelines to keep in mind about the recipes:
 All butter is unsalted. Margarine is not a suitable substitute for butter,
because of the difference in flavor and nutritional value. Butter is a nat-
ural product, while margarine is man-made and contains trans fatty acids.
 All eggs are large.
 All flour is all-purpose unless otherwise specified.
 All milk is lowfat unless otherwise specified.
 All onions are yellow unless otherwise specified.
 All pepper is freshly ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.
 All salt is table salt unless otherwise specified.
 All mentions of Splenda refer to the regular sugar substitute unless
Splenda for Baking is specified.
 All dry ingredient measurements are level — use a dry ingredient mea-
suring cup, fill it to the top, and scrape it even with a straight object,
such as the flat side of a knife.
 All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (See Appendix D for information about
converting temperatures to Celsius.)
 A handful of recipes that appeared in the first edition of this book are
featured in this edition and called “Classics” in their recipe names.
T If you need or want vegetarian recipes, scan the list of “Recipes in This
Chapter” on the first page of each chapter in Part II. A little tomato,
rather than a triangle, in front of the name of a recipe marks that recipe
as vegetarian. (See the tomato to the left of this paragraph.)
This isn’t a complete book about diagnosing and treating diabetes and its
complications. Check out Diabetes For Dummies if you need diagnosis and
treatment information.
What You’re Not to Read
All For Dummies books have shaded areas called sidebars. They contain inter-
esting but nonessential information. If you aren’t interested in the nitty-gritty,
you can skip these sidebars. We promise not to include that information on
the test.
3
Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
The book assumes that you’ve done some cooking, you’re familiar with the
right knife to use to slice an onion without cutting your finger, and you can
tell one pot from another. Beyond that, you can find many cooking terms in
Appendix C at the end of the book.
How This Book Is Organized
The book is divided into five parts to help you incorporate the benefits of a
good diet into your diabetes management program, while showing you that
the food can be great.
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes
This part takes you on the road to long life and great health as you incorpo-
rate the needs of being a person with diabetes into the rest of your life. It
begins by showing you all aspects of a healthy lifestyle and continues by
focusing on food and its importance to you. When you cook for a person with
diabetes (either yourself or a loved one), you must keep some special consid-
erations in mind, but this part shows you that a diet for diabetes is an excel-
lent diet for anyone. We guide you around the kitchen and take you to the
supermarket to find out about meal-enhancing ingredients, as well as the
ones to bypass as you navigate the aisles.
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great
This part presents recipes from A to Z (apples to zucchini) and everything in
between. The chapters take you through your eating day, starting with your
breakfast, providing snacks for midmorning and midafternoon, and offering
larger meals at lunch and dinner. They end, naturally, with wonderful desserts,
which show that you’re not doomed to give up what you may consider the
best part of the meal. You just need to be careful about calories. In this part,
we feature the recipes from the great restaurants that have participated in the
creation of this book.
Part III: Eating Away from Home
In this book, we can’t cover every city and every restaurant you may visit.
What do you do if you find yourself without a suggestion from this book?
4
Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part III tells you how to eat well and stay healthy wherever you are. You can
always visit a fast-food franchise, but a lot of that food isn’t good for you. If you
pick and choose well, however, you’ll be able to select a meal even when your
only choice is the one fast-food restaurant off the next exit on the freeway.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
We love to help you solve your problems in groups of ten. If you have 13 prob-
lems, you’ll just have to wait for the next book to solve the last three. In this
part, we provide ten steps to improve your eating habits and ten food substi-
tutions that you can easily make within a recipe. You can explore ten strate-
gies to normalize your blood glucose and ten ways to promote healthy eating
in children.
Part V: Appendixes
Appendix A has info about the restaurants that provided many of the deli-
cious recipes in this book. You find out about their particular style of cooking
and the chefs who make this possible. Appendix B contains exchange lists for
the person with diabetes. In Appendix C, you find a glossary of key cooking
terms. Appendix D offers guidelines if you want to substitute other sweeten-
ers for sugar, as well as cooking equivalents, such as how many tablespoons
make up a cup. In Appendix E, you find other resources in books and on the
Web for recipes and nutritional information for people with diabetes.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are like bookmarks, pointing out information that we
think is especially important. You may want to pick out one particular icon that
appeals to you. For example, if you like stories about people, the Anecdote icon
is for you. The Anecdote icon points you to a lot of interesting stories about
others with diabetes and how they cope with their diets. If your interests lie in
the direction of very mild fear, look for the Warning icon. Here are the icons
used in this book:
We use this icon whenever we tell a story about our patients.
Whenever we want to emphasize the importance of the current information
to your nutritional plan, we use this icon.
5
Introduction

When you see the Remember icon, pay special attention because the informa-
tion is essential.
This icon flags situations when you should see your doctor (for example, if
your blood glucose level is too high or you need a particular test done).
This helpful icon marks important information that can save you time and
energy.
Watch for this icon; it warns about potential problems (for example, the pos-
sible results if you don’t treat a condition).
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends on your immediate needs. If you want an
introduction to the place of nutrition in diabetes management, start with
Chapter 1. If you are hungry and want some lunch, go to Chapter 8 or 9. If you
are about to travel or eat out, head for Part III. At any time, the Part of Tens
can provide useful tips for healthy eating. Finally, the Appendixes help you
cook for yourself or choose a restaurant. Feel free to jump around, but take
the time to go through Part II so that you realize that diabetes and great food
are not mutually exclusive.

Part I
Thriving with
Diabetes

In this part . . .
D
iabetes is a disease with which you can live. In this
part, we show you not only how to live with diabetes
but also how to thrive with diabetes. It requires that you
think about every aspect of your lifestyle, and we try to
cover all the issues. But it starts with the way you eat,
because diet is central to a healthy lifestyle. We show you
what to eat, how much to eat, and, especially, how to pre-
pare your food so that the fact that you have diabetes
doesn’t prevent you from enjoying a variety of delicious
cuisine.

Chapter 1
What It Means to Thrive
with Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Getting a grip on diabetes
 Controlling calories
 Working exercise into your schedule
 Keeping your blood pressure down
 Making lifestyle changes that count
A
few months after the first edition of Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies
came out, we received an e-mail from someone who told us that she had
never felt as good as she did now that she was diagnosed with diabetes. As a
result of the diagnosis and following the recommendations in that book, she
had lost weight, was much more active, and generally felt better physically
and mentally.
In this chapter, you get the latest information about what diabetes means,
how diabetes is diagnosed, and the things you need to do to thrive just like
her. Don’t waste another minute. Get started right away. We love getting
happy e-mails.
Recognizing Diabetes
With so much diabetes around these days, you may think that recognizing it
should be easy. The truth is that it’s not easy, because diabetes is defined by
blood tests. You can’t just look at someone and know the level of glucose in
his or her blood.
Glucose is the name of the type of sugar found in our bodies that provides all
the energy needed by your cells and organs to carry on all the chemical reac-
tions that permit you to live and move.

Diabetes by the numbers
The level of glucose that means you have diabetes is as follows:
 A casual blood glucose of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) or more at
any time of day or night, along with symptoms such as fatigue, frequent
urination and thirst, slow healing of skin, urinary infections, and vaginal
itching in women. A normal casual blood glucose should be between 70
and 139 mg/dl.
 A fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dl or more after no food for at least eight
hours. A normal fasting blood glucose should be less than 100 mg/dl.
 A blood glucose of 200 mg/dl or greater 2 hours after consuming 75 grams
of glucose.
A diagnosis of diabetes requires at least two abnormal levels on two different
occasions. Don’t accept a lifelong diagnosis of diabetes on the basis of a
single test.
The United States uses milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl) for units of measurement of
the concentration of something in a liquid. Most of the rest of the world uses
the International System (SI) of units, in which the concentration in a liquid is
designated millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To convert mg/dl to mmol/L, divide
the value of mg/dl by 18. For example, 126 mg/dl becomes 7 mmol/L.
A fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl or casual blood glucose
between 140 and 199 mg/dl is pre-diabetes. Most people with pre-diabetes will
develop diabetes within ten years. Although people with pre-diabetes don’t
usually develop small blood vessel complications of diabetes like blindness,
kidney failure, and nerve damage, they’re more prone to large vessel disease
like heart attacks and strokes, so you want to get that level of glucose down.
Forty-one million people in the United States have pre-diabetes.
Types of diabetes
Three main types of diabetes exist:
 Type 1 diabetes: This used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin-
dependent diabetes. It mostly begins in childhood and results from the
body’s self-destruction of its own pancreas. The pancreas is an organ of
the body that sits behind the stomach and makes insulin, the chemical
or “hormone” that gets glucose into cells where it can be used. You can’t
live without insulin, so people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin
shots (inhaled insulin will be available in the near future). Of the 18 mil-
lion Americans with diabetes, about 10 percent have type 1.
10
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

 Type 2 diabetes: Once called adult-onset diabetes, type 2 used to begin
around the age of 40, but it is occurring more often in children, many of
whom are getting heavier and heavier and exercising less and less. The
problem in type 2 diabetes is not a total lack of insulin, as occurs in
type 1, but a resistance to the insulin, so that the glucose still doesn’t
get into cells but remains in the blood.
 Gestational diabetes: This type of diabetes is like type 2 diabetes but
occurs in women during pregnancy, when a lot of chemicals in the
mother’s blood oppose the action of insulin. About 4 percent of all preg-
nancies are complicated by gestational diabetes. If the mother isn’t
treated to lower the blood glucose, the glucose gets into the baby’s
bloodstream. The baby produces plenty of insulin and begins to store
the excess glucose as fat in all the wrong places. If this happens, the
baby may be larger than usual and therefore may be hard to deliver.
When the baby is born, he is cut off from the large sugar supply but is
still making lots of insulin, so his blood glucose can drop severely after
birth. The mother is at risk of gestational diabetes in later pregnancies
and of type 2 diabetes as she gets older.
Consequences of diabetes
If your blood glucose isn’t controlled — that is, kept between 70 and 139 mg/dl
after eating or under 100 mg/dl fasting — damage can occur to your body. This
damage can be temporary or permanent depending on how long it goes on.
The damage can be divided into three categories: irritations, short-term com-
plications, and long-term complications.
Irritations
Irritations are mild and reversible but still unpleasant results of high blood
glucose levels. The levels aren’t so high that the person is in immediate life-
threatening danger. The most important of these irritations are the following:
 Blurred vision
 Fatigue
 Frequent urination and thirst
 Genital itching, especially in females
 Gum and urinary tract infections
 Obesity
 Slow healing of the skin
11
Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes

Short-term complications
These complications can be very serious and lead to death if not treated.
They’re associated with very high levels of blood glucose — in the 400s and
above. The three main short-term complications are the following:
 Ketoacidosis: This complication is found mostly in type 1 diabetes.
Without insulin, the glucose rises very high, and the body begins to use
fat for energy. As fat breaks down, it produces chemicals called ketones
that make the blood very acid. The acid condition makes the patient
nauseated and unable to eat or drink. He or she becomes very dehy-
drated but continues to lose fluids due to excessive urination or vomit-
ing. The increased urine takes important body constituents, such as
potassium, with it. The patient becomes very sick and will die if not
treated with large volumes of fluids and large amounts of insulin. After
the situation is reversed, however, the patient is fine.
 Hyperosmolar syndrome: This condition is often seen in neglected
older people. Their blood glucose rises due to severe dehydration and
the fact that the kidneys of the older population can’t get rid of glucose
the way younger kidneys can. The blood becomes like thick syrup. The
person can die if large amounts of fluids aren’t restored, but replenishing
fluids is tricky in older people, who often have heart failure already.
When heart failure is present, the heart can’t handle too much fluid at
one time. The excess fluid can get into the lungs and cause swelling of
the legs. They don’t need that much insulin to recover. After the condi-
tion is reversed, these people can return to a normal state.
 Hypoglycemia or low blood glucose: This complication happens when
the patient is on a drug like insulin or a pill that drives the glucose down
but isn’t getting enough food or is getting too much exercise. After it
falls below 70 mg/dl, the patient begins to feel bad. Typical symptoms
include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hunger, nervousness, confusion, and
coma if the low glucose is prolonged. Glucose by mouth, or by venous
injection if the person is unconscious, is the usual treatment. This com-
plication usually causes no permanent damage.
Long-term complications
These problems occur after ten or more years of poorly controlled diabetes
or, in the case of the macrovascular complications, after years of pre-diabetes
or diabetes. They have a substantial impact on quality of life. After these
complications become established, reversing them is hard, but treatment is
available for them early in their course, so watch for them five years after
your initial diagnosis of diabetes. See Dr. Rubin’s book Diabetes For Dummies,
2nd Edition (Wiley), for information on screening for these complications.
12
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

The long-term complications are divided into two groups: microvascular, which
are due at least in part to small blood vessel damage, and macrovascular, asso-
ciated with damage to large blood vessels.
Microvascular complications include the following:
 Diabetic retinopathy: Eye damage that leads to blindness if untreated.
 Diabetic nephropathy: Kidney damage that can lead to kidney failure.
 Diabetic neuropathy: Nerve damage that results in many clinical symp-
toms, the most common of which are tingling and numbness in the feet.
Lack of sensation in the feet can result in severe injury without aware-
ness unless you carefully look at your feet regularly. Such injury can
result in infection and even amputation.
Macrovascular complications also occur in pre-diabetes and consist of the
following:
 Arteriosclerotic heart disease: Blockage of the blood vessels of the
heart. This is the most common cause of death in diabetes due to a
heart attack.
 Arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease: Blockage of blood vessels to
the brain, resulting in a stroke.
 Arteriosclerotic peripheral vascular disease involving the blood ves-
sels of the legs: These vessels can become clogged and result in amputa-
tion of the feet or legs.
If you control your blood glucose, none of these complications need ever
occur. Controlling your blood pressure and your cholesterol also helps pre-
vent these complications.
Treating diabetes
Treatment of diabetes involves three essential elements:
 Diet: If you follow the recommendations in this book, you can lower
your average blood glucose by as much as 30 to 50 mg/dl. Doing so can
reduce the complication rate by as much as 33 percent.
 Exercise: We touch on exercise in Chapter 3 and cover it more exten-
sively in Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
 Medication: Diabetes medications abound — there are far too many to
discuss here, but you can find out about them in Diabetes For Dummies,
2nd Edition.
13
Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes

Controlling Calories
Just as the three most important factors in the value of a house are location,
location, location, the three most important factors in diet for people with
diabetes are moderation, moderation, moderation. If you’re overweight or
obese, which is true of most people with type 2 diabetes and a lot of people
with type 1 diabetes who are on intensive insulin treatment (four shots of
insulin daily), weight loss will make a huge difference in your blood glucose
levels. If you maintain the weight loss, you’ll avoid the complications of dia-
betes discussed earlier in this chapter.
To successfully lose weight, you need to control your total calories. You must
burn up the same amount of calories you take in by mouth, or you will gain
weight. To lose weight, you need to burn up more calories than you eat.
Sounds simple, eh!
As you reduce your portions, reduce your intake of added sugars, fats, and
alcohol. These items contain no nutrients such as vitamins and minerals and
are simply sources of empty calories.
If you are predisposed to have diabetes because, for example, your parents
both had diabetes, you can prevent it by maintaining a healthy weight. If you
already have diabetes, you can minimize its impact by losing weight and
keeping it off.
Do you need a highly complicated formula to figure out how to moderate your
food intake? No! It’s as simple as looking at the portions you currently eat and
cutting them in half. At home, where you control the amount of food on your
plate, you can start with a small portion, so you may not need to reduce it by
half. However, in restaurants, where more and more people are eating their
meals, especially the fast food restaurants, discussed extensively in Chapters
17 and 18, the rule of eating half may not be strong enough. There you may
need to eat only a third of the portion. You may need to apply the same por-
tion control when you eat at someone else’s home. Figure 1-1 shows you the
difference between reasonably sized portions and ones that are too big.
Controlling calories isn’t easy when TV commercials suggest that eating cer-
tain foods will make you sexier and more beautiful. Another challenge is
eating in a restaurant where the menu makes everything sound like the food
eaten by the Greek gods. And when the portions arrive at your table, they’re
about twice what you should be eating. Use these tips to help you visualize
portion sizes:
 An ounce of meat is the size of a pack of matches.
 Three ounces of meat is the size of a deck of cards.
14
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

 A medium fruit is the size of a tennis ball.
 A medium potato is the size of a computer mouse.
 A medium bagel is the size of a hockey puck.
 An ounce of cheese is the size of a domino.
 A cup of fruit is the size of a baseball.
 A cup of broccoli is the size of a light bulb.
The European chefs who worked on some of the recipes in this book told me
again and again that, compared to Europeans, people in the United States
expect huge portions. And they eat it all! Think about a hockey puck the next
time you buy bagels that each look like a small cake. Even if you cut the bagel
in half, you’ll still be eating more than the correct portion. You may think that
you’re eating the right amount, but you’re most likely eating two to three
times more than you need.
You don’t need to take in many extra calories over time to gain weight. Just
100 extra kilocalories (see the “Kilocalories versus calories” sidebar for an
explanation of kilocalories) on a daily basis results in a weight gain of 12
pounds in a year. An extra glass of wine is that many kilocalories. On the
other hand, if you reduce your daily intake by 100 kilocalories, you can lose
those 12 pounds over a year.
Look at a few examples of the portion sizes provided today compared to 20
years ago. Table 1-1 shows the kilocalories in the portions of 20 years ago and
today and how much exercise you have to do to burn up the extra kilocalo-
ries so you don’t gain weight.

Including Exercise (And Rest)
Exercise is just as important as diet in controlling your blood glucose. A
group of people who were expected to develop diabetes because their par-
ents both had diabetes was asked to walk 30 minutes a day. Eighty percent of
those who did walk did not develop the disease. These people didn’t neces-
sarily lose weight, but they did exercise.
16
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Kilocalories versus calories
We use the term kilocalories (or kcalories)
rather than calories because experts in health
and medicine measure energy in a diet plan or
in food in kilocalories (a kilocalorie is 1,000 times
greater than a calorie). Unfortunately, the term
calories has been established on food labels
and in diets, and health officials don’t want to
confuse the public by attempting to correct this
error.
Calorie counts in the text of this book and in the
nutritional analyses of the recipes are given in
kilocalories.

Exercise isn’t only for the person with diabetes. Anyone who wants a healthy
lifestyle should exercise, but for the diabetic, exercise is especially important
because it protects against both the microvascular and the macrovascular
complications of diabetes.
You don’t have to spend hours exercising. About 30 minutes a day of moder-
ate exercise, such as walking, gives you all that you need. If walking doesn’t
interest you, you can bike, swim, jog, play a sport, or just about anything that
gets your heart pumping faster and your muscles moving. Don’t let winter
weather stop you from exercising — try cross-country skiing, for example.
Too many people complain that they just can’t find the time to exercise. This
excuse isn’t acceptable, especially when you realize how much difference
exercise can make in your life and your diabetes. Here are some ways that 
different amounts of exercise can help you:
 Thirty minutes of exercise a day will get you in excellent physical shape
and reduce your blood glucose substantially.
 Sixty minutes of exercise a day will help you to maintain a weight loss
and get you in even better physical shape (and probably allow you to dis-
continue all medications for diabetes unless you have type 1 diabetes).
 Ninety minutes of exercise a day will cause you to lose weight.
If you say that you can’t find 90 extra minutes in your day, that’s probably not
an unreasonable assessment of your schedule, but do consider the benefits
before ruling out the possibility!
An exercise partner helps ensure that you get out and do your thing. We find
it extremely helpful to have someone waiting for us so that we can exercise
together.
Here are some more facts about exercise to keep in mind:
 You don’t have to get in all your minutes of exercise in one session. Two
30-minute workouts are just as good as and possibly better than one 60-
minute workout.
 Although walking is excellent exercise, especially for the older popula-
tion, the benefits of more vigorous exercise and for a longer time are
greater still.
 Everything counts when it comes to exercise. Your decision to take the
stairs instead of the elevator may not seem like much, but if you do so
day after day, it makes a profound difference. Another suggestion that
may help over time is to park your car farther from your office.
 A pedometer (a small gadget worn on your belt that counts your steps)
may help you to achieve your exercise goals. The objective is to get up
to 10,000 steps a day by increasing your step count every week.
17
Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes

You also want to do something to strengthen your muscles. Larger muscles
take in more glucose, providing another way of keeping it under control. A
program of light weight training may be all you need. You may want to have a
trainer show you a routine at the start and then take over on your own. You
can buy hand-held weights very inexpensively at most sport shops. You don’t
need to do weight training exercises every day, as we suggest for walking —
three or four times a week is enough. You’ll be surprised by how much your
stamina will increase and how much your blood glucose will fall.
Place a daily limit on activities that are completely sedentary, such as watch-
ing television or surfing the Web. Use the time you might have once spent on
these activities to exercise. This advice is especially helpful for overweight
children.
You want to be active, but don’t do it at the cost of getting plenty of rest each
day. People who sleep eight hours a night tend to be less hungry and leaner
than people who sleep less.
Controlling Your Blood Pressure
Keeping your blood pressure in check is particularly important in preventing
the macrovascular complications of diabetes. But elevated blood pressure
also plays a role in bringing on eye disease, kidney disease, and neuropathy.
You should have your blood pressure tested every time you see your doctor.
The goal is to keep your blood pressure under 130/80. (See Dr. Rubin’s book

Keeping up to speed on treatment developments
By the time you read this book, several months
will have passed since we wrote these words.
Several important discoveries about diabetes or
related medical information may have occurred
that you need to know about. How can you keep
up with the latest and greatest treatments?
 Take a course with a certified diabetes edu-
cator (CDE). Here you learn how to manage
your diabetes right now and find out about
what’s coming up.
 Go to the Web and do a search for diabetes.
If you want to be sure that the sites you
come up with are both accurate and help-
ful, go to Dr. Rubin’s Web site, www.dr
rubin.com, where you’ll find a page on
Useful Diabetes Related Web sites. He has
checked all of them out for you, so you
know you can rely on them.
 Come to your doctor prepared to ask ques-
tions. If you don’t get a satisfactory answer,
see a specialist.
 Take another certified course after several
years. You’ll be amazed at the changes.

High Blood Pressure For Dummies, published by Wiley, for a complete explana-
tion of the meaning of these numbers.) You may want to get your own blood
pressure monitor so that you can check it at home yourself.
The statistics about diabetes and high blood pressure are daunting. Seventy-
one percent of diabetics have high blood pressure, but almost a third are
unaware of it. Almost half of them weren’t being treated for high blood pres-
sure. Among the treated patients, less than half were treated in a way that
reduced their pressure to lower than 130/80.
You can do plenty of things to lower your blood pressure, including losing
weight, avoiding salt, eating more fruits and vegetables, and, of course, exer-
cising. But if all else fails, your doctor may prescribe medication. Many blood
pressure medicines are available, and one or two will be exactly right for you.
See High Blood Pressure For Dummies for an extensive discussion of the large
number of blood pressure medications.
One class of drugs in particular is very useful for diabetics with high blood
pressure: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), which
are especially protective of your kidneys. If kidney damage is detected early,
ACE inhibitors can reverse the damage. Some experts believe that all diabet-
ics should take ACE inhibitors. We believe that if there’s no evidence of
kidney damage and the diabetes is well controlled, this isn’t necessary.
Considering the Rest of Your Lifestyle
Diabetes is just one part of your life. It can affect the rest of your lifestyle, how-
ever, and your lifestyle certainly affects your diabetes. In this section, we take
up some of these other parts of your lifestyle, all of which you can alter to the
benefit of your health and your diabetes. Try making changes one at a time,
and when you think you have that one under control, move on to the next.
Drinking alcohol safely
A glass of wine is a pleasant addition to dinner, and studies show that alcohol
in moderation can lower the risk of a heart attack (see the sidebar “How alco-
hol helps heart disease” in this chapter). For a diabetic, it is especially impor-
tant that food accompany the wine because alcohol reduces the blood glucose;
a complication called hypoglycemia may occur (see the section “Short-term
complications,” earlier in this chapter).
Never drink alcohol without food, especially when you’re taking glucose-
lowering medication.
19
Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes

The following people should not drink alcohol at all:
 Pregnant women
 Women who are breastfeeding
 Children and adolescents
 People who take medications that interact with alcohol
 People with medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, such as
liver disease and certain diseases of the pancreas
The amount of wine that is safe on a daily basis is a maximum of two 4-ounce
glasses for a man or one 4-ounce glass for a woman. Men metabolize alcohol
more rapidly than women, so they can drink more. But you should drink no
more than a maximum of five days out of seven.
In terms of alcohol content, 11⁄2 ounces of hard liquor, such as gin, rum, vodka,
or whisky, or 12 ounces of light beer are the equivalent of a 4-ounce glass of
wine.
Alcohol adds calories without any nutrition. Alcohol has no vitamins or min-
erals, but you do have to account for the calories in your diet. If you stop
drinking alcohol, you may lose a significant amount of weight. For example,
a person who has been drinking three drinks a night and stops will lose 26
pounds in a year.
Alcohol can cause cirrhosis of the liver and raises blood pressure. It also wors-
ens diabetic neuropathy. Do you need any more reasons not to drink alcohol?
Avoiding tobacco
Whether you smoke it, chew it, or inhale it because someone else is using it,
tobacco shortens your life and makes you a prime candidate for many types
of cancer. The connection between cancer and tobacco is a scientific fact.
Just why tobacco is not a banned substance like heroin or crack cocaine is a
mystery (although the tobacco companies know the solution to this one).
Everything about tobacco is negative. It stains your teeth and fingers, gives
you bad breath, causes wrinkles, and ruins your heart, lungs, and many other
organs. And people are dumb enough to pay for it! People with diabetes who
smoke are much more prone to amputations of their feet and legs.
There are numerous ways to stop if you already smoke. Unfortunately many
smokers quit only after the first major event, such as a heart attack or a cancer
they’re lucky enough to survive. Don’t be in that group. Give it up, now!
20
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

Staying away from illicit drugs
Do you really want to screw up your life and make your diabetes almost
impossible to control? Add illicit drugs to the mix. Some of them interact with
your diabetes drugs, causing high or low blood glucose levels. If you use nee-
dles to inject these drugs, you’ll have infections, hepatitis, and even AIDS
sooner or later.
You can get high without illegal drugs. Try exercise instead. Climb those
steps up to your office and enjoy the feeling that comes when you’re no
longer carrying those extra 20 pounds of weight on your stomach. These
highs will benefit your diabetes at the same time.
Driving safely
Having diabetes means you need to take special precautions before you
drive. You should test your blood glucose before driving for more than a half-
hour and raise it to normal before you get behind the wheel. Always carry a
source of glucose in your car to take should your glucose fall. When it falls
below 70 or so while driving, you begin to drive as though you were drunk.
Wear a seat belt when you drive. Doing so prevents major injury if you get
into an accident. Of course, we’re sure that you’ll never drive faster than the
speed limit, but it is the other driver that we’re concerned about. You never
know what he or she is going to do.
21
Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes
How alcohol helps heart disease
When taken in moderation, alcohol has a
number of effects that help prevent heart dis-
ease and heart attacks. Alcohol can do the 
following:
 Decrease insulin resistance
 Increase the level of the good cholesterol,
called HDL cholesterol
 Decrease the tendency of blood platelets to
form clots that block arteries in the heart
 Increase the tendency of chemicals in the
blood to break down clots that form

Benefiting from relationships
People in relationships live longer than those who live alone. This is espe-
cially true for diabetics, many of whom depend to some extent on support
from someone else. For example, your spouse or significant other may be the
one who buys or prepares the food that you eat. He or she can be your exer-
cise partner. On the rare occasions when your blood glucose falls very low,
he or she can help you to get the nutrition that will restore you.
Belonging to some special-interest group also is helpful. For example, maybe
you’re a biker or a stamp collector or a bridge player. Getting together with
others who share your interest is a great stress reducer, which can benefit
your diabetes.
The person with diabetes may want to join a diabetes support group. Here
you can discover that you’re not alone in your troubles and that others may
have helpful suggestions on managing their diabetes that you can use as well.
Maintaining your sense of humor
If you have diabetes, or any other chronic disease for that matter, keeping a
sense of humor makes the inconveniences and associated complications
much easier to bear. Author and editor Norman Cousins claimed in several
books that he reversed a disease he had that was considered irreversible by
exposing himself to all kinds of funny experiences. He listened to audiotapes
of the comedians whom he found the funniest. He read humor books that
kept him laughing. He watched movies that made him roar with laughter.
Someone wrote that life is a human comedy. Surely there are things in your
life, even associated with your diabetes, that you can laugh about.
Dr. Rubin went to a conference a few years ago on the healing qualities of
humor. The opening speaker asked everyone to write down his or her
favorite comedian. Then the participants mingled and shared their selec-
tions. Everyone was amazed at the variety of choices. If Woody Allen or the
Marx Brothers don’t do it for you, maybe Jerry Seinfeld or Bill Cosby or Will
Smith gets you going. Like beauty, humor is in the eyes of the beholder.
Find your favorites and get their performances in any media available. Watch
or listen to them regularly. It may be time to change that old saying to “a
laugh a day keeps the doctor away.”

How What You Eat Affects
Your Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Coping with carbohydrates
 Selecting protein
 Cutting the fat in your diet
 Eating enough micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
 Timing your food
S
ince the previous edition of this book, the problem of obesity in the United
States and throughout the world has continued to explode. The incidence
of diabetes has exploded with it in a parallel fashion. Between 1999 and 2002,
65 percent of U.S. adults were reported to be overweight compared with 56 per-
cent from 1988 to 1994. The percentage of adults who were obese went from
23 percent in the earlier time period to 30 percent between 1999 and 2002.
Children and adolescents aren’t spared in this epidemic of overweight, with
16 percent of them falling into this category between 1999 and 2002.
The United States has to reverse this trend. Otherwise, millions of people will
become blind, develop kidney failure, and require amputations. In addition,
millions of people will become heart attack victims, many of whom will not
survive their first heart attack.
Diet can lower the hemoglobin A1c, a measure of the average glucose in the
blood for the last 90 days, by 1 percent or more. For every 1 percent reduc-
tion in hemoglobin A1c, there is a 33 percent reduction in complications of
diabetes. See Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), for more informa-
tion on hemoglobin A1c.
This chapter tells you how much to eat, what to eat, and when to eat. Because
most people with diabetes are overweight, we provide advice so that eating
healthy becomes a way of life for you. And don’t forget the important value of
exercise, particularly “skipping” soda, “skipping” fatty foods, and “skipping”
desserts.

The first thing you need to know when you plan your diet is how much you
should be eating. To find out how many kilocalories (commonly called calo-
ries) you need, you have to do a little math. Chapter 3 shows you how to
determine your ideal weight and the number of kilocalories you need,
depending on your lifestyle and weight goals.
After you know your total calorie intake objective, break it down into the
three sources of energy: carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
Calculating Carbohydrates — 
Precursors of Glucose
When you eat a meal, the immediate source of glucose in your blood comes
from the carbohydrates in that meal. One group of carbohydrates is the
starches, such as cereals, grains, pastas, breads, crackers, starchy vegeta-
bles, beans, peas, and lentils. Fruits make up a second major source of carbo-
hydrate. Milk and milk products contain not only carbohydrate but also
protein and a variable amount of fat, depending on whether the milk is whole,
lowfat, or fat-free. Other sources of carbohydrate include cakes, cookies, can-
dies, sweetened beverages, and ice cream. These foods also contain a vari-
able amount of fat.
To determine what else is found in food, check a source such as The Official
Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges, published by the American Diabetes
Association and the American Dietetic Association, or The Diabetes
Carbohydrate and Fat Gram Guide, published by the American Diabetes
Association.
Determining the amount of carbohydrate
How much carbohydrate should you have in your diet? At one time, experts
prescribed exact percentages of carbohydrate, protein, and fat calories in the
daily diet. Now, we are much more flexible and allow the percentage of carbo-
hydrate to vary from 40 to 65 percent of daily calories. In our experience,
those who keep their carbohydrate intake on the lower side of that range
have less trouble controlling their blood glucose levels and maintaining lower
levels of blood fats. Your registered dietitian may recommend more. We
wouldn’t argue as long as you can maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels
while not increasing the level of triglyceride, a blood fat.
24
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

Considering the glycemic index
The various carbohydrate sources differ in the degree to which they raise the
blood glucose. This difference is called the glycemic index (GI), and it refers
to the glucose-raising power of a food compared with white bread.
In general, choose foods with a lower glycemic index in order to keep the
rise in blood glucose to a minimum. Carbohydrate sources that have lower
glycemic indexes are foods such as whole-grain breads, unrefined cereals
(such as oats), and basmati rice. Cookies, cakes, and muffins made with fruits
and whole grains tend to have a lower glycemic index as well. Predicting the
glycemic index of a mixed meal (one that contains an appetizer, a main dish,
and a dessert) is nearly impossible, but you can make some simple substitu-
tions to lower the glycemic index of your diet, as shown in Table 2-1.
Table 2-1
Simple Diet Substitutions to Lower GI
High GI foods
Low GI foods

Whole-grain bread

Unrefined cereals like oats or processed
low-GI cereals

Cakes and muffins
Cakes and muffins made with fruits, oats,
and whole grains
Tropical fruits like bananas
Temperate-climate fruits like apples and
plums
Potatoes
Pasta or legumes
Rice
Basmati or other low-GI rice
Many of these lower glycemic index foods contain a lot of fiber. Fiber is a car-
bohydrate that can’t be broken down by digestive enzymes, so it doesn’t
raise blood glucose and adds no calories. Fiber has been shown to reduce the
risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes while it improves bowel function,
preventing constipation. For the person who has diabetes already, fiber
reduces blood glucose levels.
If a food has a lot of fiber in it (more than 5 grams per serving), you can sub-
tract the grams of fiber from the number of carbohydrates in that food.
25
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes

The best sources of fiber are fruits, grains, and vegetables, especially the
legumes. Animal food sources don’t provide fiber. It is recommended that you
consume 25 grams of fiber daily. The best sources are whole grains, fruits,
and vegetables. Table 2-2 shows some sources of larger amounts of fiber.

Fiber can be present in two forms:
 Insoluble: It doesn’t dissolve in water but stays in the intestine as
roughage, which helps to prevent constipation; for example, fiber found
in whole-grain breads and cereals, and the skin of fruits and vegetables.
 Soluble: It dissolves in water and enters the blood, where it helps lower
glucose and cholesterol; for example, fiber found in barley, brown rice,
and beans, as well as vegetables and fruits.
Whole grains like whole wheat provide much more fiber than refined grains
like white flour. When the grain is refined, it is cracked, crushed, or flaked.
This process removes the parts of the grain that contain the fiber as well as
vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. For a food to be whole grain,
it must contain at least 51 percent of the whole grain parts that contain those
nutrients.
For years, doctors told their patients with diabetes not to eat sugar. Now we
know that many foods, such as corn and potatoes, raise blood glucose just as
fast as table sugar, and we would never ban those foods. The recommenda-
tions have changed.
26
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

You can take a spoonful of sugar in your coffee and have a little sugar in your
food, but be aware of the number of calories you are adding with no micronu-
trients (vitamins and minerals present in tiny amounts but essential). See
“Monitoring Your Micronutrients,” later in this chapter, for more info.
Choosing sugar substitutes
Although people with diabetes are allowed to have some sugar in their diet,
sugar is more appropriate for a diabetic who is at normal weight than an
obese diabetic. Preventing obesity may be a matter of avoiding as little as 50
extra calories a day. If this can be accomplished by using artificial sweeten-
ers, which provide sweetening power but no calories, so much the better.
Some of the recipes in this book call for 1⁄4 cup or more of sugar. These are
perfect opportunities to use a sugar substitute and significantly lower the
calories from sugar.
Kilocalorie-containing sweeteners
Several sugars besides sucrose (table sugar) are present in food. These sugars
have different properties than glucose, are taken up differently from the intes-
tine, and raise the blood level at a slower rate or not at all if they’re not ulti-
mately converted into glucose. They sometimes cause diarrhea.
Although these kilocalorie-containing sweeteners are sweeter than sugar and
you use them in smaller amounts, they do have calories that you must count
in your daily intake.
The following sweeteners contain kilocalories but act differently in the body
than sucrose:
 Fructose, found in fruits and berries: Fructose is sweeter than table
sugar and is absorbed more slowly than glucose, so it raises the glucose
level more slowly. When it enters the bloodstream, it is taken up by the
liver, where it is converted to glucose.
 Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries: Xylitol is also sweeter
than table sugar and has fewer kilocalories per gram. It is absorbed
more slowly than sugar. When used in gum, for example, it reduces the
occurrence of dental caries (tooth decay).
 Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants: Sorbitol and
mannitol are half as sweet as table sugar and have little effect on blood
glucose. They change to fructose in the body.
Sweeteners without calories
This group of non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners (with the exception of
Stevia, which comes from a plant) is much sweeter than table sugar and 
27
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes

contains no calories at all. Much less of these sweeteners will provide the
same level of sweetness as a larger amount of sugar. However, the taste of
some of them may seem a little “off” compared to sugar or honey. They
include the following:
 Saccharin: This has 300 to 400 times the sweetening power of sugar, and
it is heat stable so it can be used in baking and cooking. Brand names for
saccharin are Sucaryl, SugarTwin, and Sweet’N Low.
 Aspartame: This is more expensive than saccharin, but people often
prefer its taste. It is 150 to 200 times as sweet as sugar. Equal and
Sweetmate are two of the brands. It loses its sweetening power when
heated, so it can’t be used if food has to be cooked for longer than 20
minutes.
 Acesulfame-K: This is 200 times sweeter than sugar and is heat stable,
so it is used in baking and cooking.
 Stevia: This is 250 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It hasn’t yet been
approved for use as a sweetener in the United States, but because it may
be used as a dietary supplement, you may run across it. It is used exten-
sively in Japan in soda and food products and for table use.
 Sucralose: This sweetener, which is made from sugar, is 600 times
sweeter than its parent, sucrose. The brand name is Splenda. It remains
stable when heated and has become a favorite sweetener in the food
industry. Because foods don’t bake the same when made with Splenda, a
combination of Splenda and sugar called “Pure Magic” is sold to reduce
calories while providing the baking characteristics of sugar.
Appendix D shows the amount of these various sweeteners that will give the
sweetening power of a measured amount of sucrose (table sugar). Feel free to
substitute calorie-free sweeteners whenever sugar is called for. The calories
you save could make a big difference in your diabetes.
Contrary to opinions that you may see or read, there is no scientific evidence
that these sweeteners are associated with a higher incidence of cancer.
Getting Enough Protein 
(Not Just from Meat)
Most Americans are already eating more than the recommended daily intake of
protein. Protein comes from meat, fish, poultry, milk, and cheese. It can also be
found in beans, peas, and lentils, which we mention in the carbohydrate dis-
cussion in the preceding section. Meat sources of protein can be low or very
28
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

high in fat, depending on the source. Because people with diabetes should be
trying to keep the fat content of their diets fairly low, lowfat sources of protein,
such as skinless white meat chicken or turkey, flounder or halibut, and fat-free
cheese are preferred. Beans, peas, and lentils, which can be very good sources
of protein, don’t contain fat but do contain carbohydrate.
How much protein should you eat? We recommend that 40 percent of your
calories should be carbohydrate, and in the next section, we suggest that you
limit your fat intake to 30 percent of your calories. The remaining 30 percent
is protein.
Protein doesn’t cause an immediate rise in blood glucose, but it can raise glu-
cose levels several hours later, after your liver processes the protein and con-
verts some of it into glucose. Therefore, protein isn’t a good choice if you
want to treat low blood glucose, but a snack containing protein at bedtime
may help prevent low blood glucose during the night.
Focusing on Fat
Fat comes in many different forms. The one everyone talks about is choles-
terol, the type found in the yolk of an egg. However, most of the fat that
people eat comes in a chemical form known as triglyceride. This term refers
to the chemistry of the fat, and we don’t have to get into the details of it for
you to understand how to handle fat in your diet. In the following sections,
we start with a discussion of cholesterol and then turn to other forms of fat.
Zeroing in on cholesterol
These days, just about everyone knows his or her cholesterol level. If you
have ever had blood tests ordered by a doctor, the chances are good that a
cholesterol check was part of that chemical profile. You can also have a cho-
lesterol reading performed at a local health fair. You usually find out your
total cholesterol level, a combination of so-called good cholesterol and bad
cholesterol. If your total is high, much of that cholesterol may be the good
kind — HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. If you’re interested in know-
ing the balance between good and bad cholesterol in your body, talk with
your medical practitioner, who may recommend a lipid panel that delivers
more details.
The Framingham Study, an ongoing study of the health of the citizens of
Framingham, Massachusetts, has shown that the total cholesterol amount
divided by the good cholesterol figure gives a number that is a reasonable
measure of the risk of a heart attack. People who had results that were less
29
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes

than 4.5 were at lower risk of heart attacks, while those with results of more
that 4.5 were at higher risk. The risk increases as the number rises.
More recently, another component of the total cholesterol in your blood, the
so-called bad cholesterol or LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) has
been found to have a very important role in causing heart attacks. For people
at high risk of a heart attack, the recommended level for LDL used to be less
than 100 mg/dl but has recently been lowered to less than 70 mg/dl.
Most foods don’t contain much cholesterol — with the exception of eggs. The
daily recommendation for cholesterol is less than 300 milligrams, and one egg
almost reaches that level. Some doctors say that eating an egg two or three
times a week won’t hurt you, but this isn’t true if you have diabetes. Avoid
eggs and foods such as organ meats that are high in cholesterol.
Taking a look at other types of fat
Although cholesterol gets all the press, most of the fat you eat is in the form of
triglyceride, the fat you see on fatty meats, contained in whole-fat dairy prod-
ucts and in many processed foods. There are several forms of triglyceride:
 Saturated fat is the kind of fat that comes from animal sources like that
big piece of rib-eye steak you ate the other night. Butter, bacon, cream,
and cream cheese are other examples. Saturated fat increases your bad
cholesterol levels and should be avoided.
 Trans fats were invented by food manufacturers to replace butter, which
is more expensive. Unfortunately trans fats, which are currently listed as
partially hydrogenated oil on food labels, may be worse than saturated
fat in causing coronary heart disease. They’re found in margarine, cake
mixes, dried soup mixes, many fast foods, and many frozen foods, dough-
nuts, cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals, candies, and whipped top-
pings. Keep them out of your diet by reading food labels, which must list
them.
 Unsaturated fats come from vegetable sources such as olive oil and
canola oil. There are two forms of unsaturated fats:
• Monounsaturated fats, which don’t raise cholesterol in the blood.
Olive oil, canola oil, and avocado are some examples. The oil in
nuts is also monounsaturated.
• Polyunsaturated fats, which don’t raise cholesterol but can lower
good or HDL cholesterol. Corn oil, mayonnaise, and some mar-
garines have this form of fat.
30
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

Curbing your fat intake
Fat has concentrated calories, so don’t eat too much fat in your diet. However,
monounsaturated fats seem to protect against heart disease. The increased
intake of olive oil by people living around the Mediterranean Sea may be the
reason for their lower incidence of heart disease.
Although vegetable sources of fat are generally better than animal sources,
the exceptions are palm oil and coconut oil, which are highly saturated fats.
Here’s our bottom line recommendation: No more than 30 percent of your
kilocalories should come from fat, and of that, no more than a third should
come from saturated fats. For a person eating 1,500 kilocalories a day, this
recommendation would mean 450 kilocalories from fat, and 150 of those kilo-
calories from saturated fat.
Use vegetable oils, preferably canola oil and olive oil, as your primary sources
of fat, because these lower cholesterol.
Choose fish or poultry as your source of protein in order to avoid consuming
too much fat along with your protein. If you remove the skin from chicken,
you’ll get little fat. Fish actually has certain fatty acids that lower cholesterol.
There’s a little danger in eating too much salmon, however. One man ate so
many salmon croquettes, salmon steaks, and salmon salads that he had to
fight the urge to go north and spawn.
31
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
Demystifying fatspeak
If you’re concerned about the amount of fat in
your diet (and of course you are), you should
understand the government definitions of words
describing the amounts of fat in various foods.
Here are the definitions:
 Fat-free: Less than 0.5 grams of fat per 
serving
 Lowfat: Less than 3 grams of fat per serving
 Reduced fat: 25 percent less fat when com-
pared with a similar food
 Lean meat: Less than 10 grams of fat, less
than 4 grams of saturated fat, and less than
95 milligrams of cholesterol per serving
 Low saturated fat: 1 gram or less of satu-
rated fat and no more than 15 percent of
calories from saturated fat
 Cholesterol-free: Less than 2 milligrams of
cholesterol per serving or 2 grams or less of
saturated fat per serving
 Low cholesterol: Less than 20 milligrams of
cholesterol or less than 2 grams of satu-
rated fat per serving
 Reduced cholesterol: At least 25 percent
less cholesterol compared to a similar food
and 2 grams or less of saturated fat

Figuring Out Your Diet
After you know how much to eat of each energy source (carbohydrate, fat,
and protein), how do you translate this into actual foods? You can use three
basic approaches.
Using the food guide pyramid
The federal government, with the assistance of many experts, has come up
with a simple way for you to eat a good, balanced diet: the food guide pyra-
mid. This pyramid was revised in April 2005 to be more specific about food
choices and portions depending on an individual’s specific needs. You can
see the basic changes in Figure 2-1.
For complete information about the new pyramid and how you can use it to
your best advantage, be sure to check out www.mypyramid.gov. This Web
site is full of great nutritional information and tips on how to adapt the pyra-
mid’s recommendations to your lifestyle.
Fats, Oils,
& Sweets
(Use only for
discretionary calories)
Milk, Yogurt, &
Cheese Group
(3 cups daily of lowfat
or fat-free milk or
equivalent milk products)
Vegetable Group
(2 1/2 cups daily selected from
dark green, orange, legumes, starchy,
and other vegetables on different days)
Grain Group
(6 ounces daily, with at least 3 ounces from whole grain sources)
Fruit Group
(2 cups daily)
Meat, Poultry,
Fish, Dry Beans,
Eggs, & Nuts Group
(5.5 ounces daily)
Figure 2-1:
The latest
changes to
the food

32
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

The food guide pyramid presents all your food choices:
 The new recommendation is that you eat 6 ounces of grains every day,
with at least half of that coming from whole-grain sources. Three ounces
of a whole-grain cereal fulfills this requirement. The rest of the grains
should be enriched or whole grain as well.
 Instead of 3 to 5 servings of other vegetables and 2 to 4 servings of fruits
as in the old recommendations, the new pyramid specifically recom-
mends 2 cups of fruit and 21⁄2 cups of vegetables every day. The vegeta-
bles should be from five different subgroups during the week — dark
green, orange, legumes, starchy vegetables, and other vegetables — in
order to provide all the micronutrients you need.
 Three cups of lowfat or fat-free milk or the equivalent milk products are
suggested for daily consumption to provide the calcium needed in the
diet. However, if you can’t have dairy products in your diet, you can sub-
stitute products such as soy milk and tofu as well as spinach, turnip
greens, and kale so that you get your calcium.
 The new guidelines recommend 5.5 ounces of foods in the meat group,
such as chicken, steak, and fish.
The reason for these more specific recommendations is that the government
wants to ensure that everyone gets sufficient amounts of all the micronutri-
ents, vitamins, and minerals for a complete diet. Certain “nutrients of con-
cern,” such as potassium; fiber; magnesium; vitamins A, C, D, and E; calcium;
iron; and folic acid may be lacking if people don’t eat all these foods in the
amounts recommended. Even when people do eat as recommended, they still
may need to supplement some nutrients.
After all the nutrient needs are met, some calories, known as discretionary
calories, may still be available in the diet. You can use them to add fats, oils,
alcohol, and sweets, but usually you won’t have many available at the end of
the day. For example the discretionary calories in a 2,000 kcalorie diet don’t
cover the carbohydrate content of one soft drink.
Notice that the food guide pyramid permits an egg, which is not recommended
on a daily basis for people with diabetes.
The food guide pyramid is probably a good tool for a person with type 2 dia-
betes who doesn’t tend to gain weight, but the person with type 1 diabetes
or the person who is obese with type 2 diabetes needs to know the specific
number of calories and particularly the carbohydrate calories that he or she
is eating. That’s the reason we provide information about diabetic exchanges
and carbohydrate counting in the next sections.
33
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes

Working with diabetic exchanges
Despite the huge variety of foods that you can make from the various ingredi-
ents available, all foods can be placed in one of several exchange groupings
so that a given quantity of that food has approximately the same calorie
count and content of carbohydrate, protein, and/or fat. For example, one-half
of a small bagel can replace 1 slice of bread, half of a hot dog bun, 1 small
roll, a 6-inch tortilla, or 1⁄2 cup of bran cereal. In Appendix B, all foods that con-
tain the same kilocalorie count coming from the same amounts of carbohy-
drate, protein, and fat are shown in the various exchange lists.
The exchange lists consist of starches, fruits, milks, other carbohydrates,
vegetables, meats and meat substitutes, fats, and free foods, those that con-
tain no calories and can be eaten “freely.” When you know how many calories
of each energy source you can eat, you can create a diet for yourself. Because
balancing all the information — and the foodstuffs — may be complicated,
you probably will want the help of a dietitian.
With the new government dietary guidelines, all exchanges are no longer
equal. In choosing exchanges, you should try to follow the recommendations
for more fiber, whole grains, and so forth by choosing exchanges that empha-
size those nutrients. A diabetic who follows these guidelines will have much
better blood glucose levels.
Using the percentages we offer in the preceding sections, here’s how the
exchange system works for a man who should eat 1,800 kilocalories per day:
 Carbohydrate: He can eat 40 percent of his kilocalories as carbohydrate,
which gives him around 720 kilocalories of carbohydrate. Because each
gram of carbohydrate is 4 kilocalories, he can eat 180 grams of carbohy-
drate. As you can see in the Appendix B exchange lists, one exchange of
carbohydrate is 15 grams, so he can eat 12 carbohydrate exchanges in
a day.
Carbohydrate is found in milk, fruit, starch, vegetable, and other carbo-
hydrate groups.
 Protein: He can eat 30 percent of his diet, or 540 kilocalories, as protein.
A gram of protein is 4 kilocalories, so he can eat 135 grams of protein.
Each meat or meat substitute exchange has 7 grams of protein in it.
Therefore, he can eat about 19 protein exchanges each day, which corre-
sponds to about 19 ounces of protein daily.
Protein is found not just in meat but also in milk, starch, and some 
vegetables.
34
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

 Fat: He can eat no more than 30 percent, or 540 kilocalories, of fat per day.
A gram of fat is 9 kilocalories, so he can eat no more than 60 grams of fat
per day. A fat exchange is 5 grams of fat, so he can eat 12 fat exchanges in
a day.
Fat is found in milk, meat, and the other carbohydrate groups as well as
pure fats like butter.
Table 2-3 provides a visual perspective of this 1,800-kilocalorie per-day diet
and its exchange system particulars.

The following sample of an 1,800-calorie diet shows proportions of 40 percent
carbohydrate, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent fat.
Breakfast:

1 starch exchange
1 medium-fat meat exchange
2 fat exchanges
1 lowfat milk exchange
Lunch:

Dinner:
4 lean-meat exchanges
2 starch exchanges
2 vegetable exchanges
1 fruit exchange
3 fat exchanges
Snack:
2 starch exchanges
2 lean-meat exchanges
1⁄2 lowfat milk exchange
Using the exchange lists in Appendix B, you can figure exchanges by the food it
represents. For example, the fruit exchange for breakfast could be 1⁄2 grapefruit,
1⁄3 small cantaloupe, or 1⁄2 glass of fruit juice. The four lean-meat exchanges for
dinner could be 4 ounces of tuna, or 4 ounces of dark meat turkey or chicken,
or 1 cup of cottage cheese.
This technique of creating a diet gives you an infinite variety. In Part II of this
book, where we provide actual recipes, we break down the recipes into food
exchanges so that you can fit them into your exchange plan. Remember that
you can take exchanges from one meal and move them to another so that a
recipe that doesn’t fit into a single meal can borrow some exchanges from
other times of day. This approach makes for a very flexible diet program.
Counting carbohydrates
People with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin
may find the technique of counting carbohydrates to be the easiest for them.
You still need to know how much carbohydrate you should eat in a given day.
You divide the total into the meals and snacks that you eat and then, with the
help of your doctor or certified diabetes educator, you determine your short-
acting insulin needs based upon that amount of carbohydrates and the blood
glucose that you measure before that meal.
36
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

For example, suppose that a person with diabetes is about to have a breakfast
containing 60 grams of carbohydrate. He has found that each unit of lispro
insulin controls about 20 grams of carbohydrate intake in his body. Figuring
the proper amount of short-acting insulin can be accomplished by a process
of trial and error: knowing the amount of carbohydrate intake and determining
how many units are needed to keep the blood glucose level about the same
after eating the carbohydrate as it was before. (The number of carbohydrate
grams that each unit of insulin can control differs for each individual, and
another person might control only 15 grams per unit.)
In this example, the person’s measured blood glucose is 150 mg/dl (milligrams
per deciliter). This result is about 50 mg/dl higher than he wants it to be. He
knows that he can lower his blood glucose by 50 mg/dl for every unit of
insulin he takes. Therefore, he needs 3 units of lispro for the carbohydrate
intake and 1 unit for the elevated blood glucose for a total of 4 units. For more
information on lispro, other types of insulin, and figuring out insulin sensitiv-
ity, see Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) by Dr. Alan Rubin, one of
the authors of this book.
He has a morning that is more active than he expected. When lunchtime
comes, his blood glucose is down to 60 mg/dl. He’s about to eat a lunch con-
taining 75 grams of carbohydrate. He takes 4 units of lispro for the food but
reduces it by 1 unit to a total of 3 units because his blood glucose is low.
At dinner, he is eating 45 grams of carbohydrate. His blood glucose is 115
mg/dl. He takes 2 units of lispro for the food intake and needs no change for
the blood glucose, so he takes only 2 units.
To be a successful carbohydrate counter, you must
 Have an accurate knowledge of the grams of carbohydrate in the food
you are about to eat and how many units of insulin you need for a given
number of grams of carbohydrate.
 Measure your blood glucose and know how your body responds to each
unit of insulin.
You can make this calculation a little easier by using constant carbohydrates,
which means that you try to choose carbohydrates so that you are eating
about the same amount at every meal and snack. This approach makes deter-
mining proper amounts of insulin less tricky; just add or subtract units based
upon your blood glucose level before that meal. A few sessions with your
physician or a certified diabetes educator can help you feel more comfort-
able about counting carbohydrates.
37
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes

Monitoring Your Micronutrients
Food contains a lot more than just carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Most of
the other components are micronutrients (present in tiny or micro quantities),
which are essential for maintaining the health of human beings. Examples of
micronutrients include vitamins (such as vitamin C and vitamin K) and miner-
als (such as calcium, magnesium, and iron). Most micronutrients are needed
in such small amounts that it’s extremely unlikely that you would ever suffer
a deficiency of them. A person who eats a balanced diet by using the pyramid
technique or the exchange technique doesn’t have to worry about getting
sufficient quantities of micronutrients — with a few exceptions, which follow:
 Adults need to be sure to take in at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium each
day. If you’re a young person still growing, pregnant, or elderly, you need
1,500 milligrams daily. The best food sources of calcium are plain nonfat
yogurt, fat-free or lowfat milk, fortified ready-to-eat cereals, and calcium-
fortified soy beverages.
 Some menstruating women lose more iron than their bodies can spare
and need to take iron supplements. The best sources of iron are iron-
rich plant foods like spinach and lowfat meats.
 You probably take in 20 to 40 times more salt (sodium) than you need
and are better off leaving added salt out of your diet.
 You should increase your uptake of potassium to help lower blood pres-
sure. The best sources are leafy green vegetables, fruit from vines, and
root vegetables. For more information on micronutrients, check out
Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Recognizing the Importance of Timing
of Food and Medication
If you take insulin, the peak of your insulin activity should correspond with
the greatest availability of glucose in your blood. To accomplish this, you
need to know the time when your insulin is most active, how long it lasts, and
when it is no longer active.
 Regular insulin, which has been around for decades, takes 30 minutes to
start to lower the glucose level, peaks at 3 hours, and is gone by 6 to 8
hours. This insulin is used before meals to keep glucose low until the
next meal. The problem with regular insulin has always been that you
38
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

have to take it 30 minutes before you eat or run the risk of becoming
hypoglycemic at first, and hyperglycemic later when the insulin is no
longer around but your food is providing glucose.
 Rapid-acting lispro insulin is the newest preparation and the shortest
acting. Lispro insulin begins to lower the glucose level within 5 minutes
after its administration, peaks at about 1 hour, and is no longer active by
about 3 hours. Lispro is a great advance because it frees the person with
diabetes to take a shot only when he or she eats. Because its activity
begins and ends so quickly, lispro doesn’t cause hypoglycemia as often
as the older preparation.
Given a choice, because of its rapid onset and fall-off in activity, we recom-
mend lispro as the short-acting insulin of choice for people with type 1 dia-
betes and those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin.
If you’re going out to eat, you rarely know when the food will be served. Using
lispro, you can measure your blood glucose when the food arrives and take
an immediate shot. This preparation really frees you to take insulin when you
need it. It adds a level of flexibility to your schedule that didn’t exist before.
If you take regular insulin, keep to a more regular schedule of eating. In addi-
tion to short-acting insulin, if you have type 1 diabetes, or in some instances
type 2 diabetes, you need to take a longer-acting preparation. The reason is
to ensure that some insulin is always circulating to keep your body’s meta-
bolism running smoothly. Lantus insulin is a preparation that has no peak of
activity but is available for 24 hours. You take one shot of Lantus daily at bed-
time, and it covers your needs for insulin except when large amounts of glu-
cose enter your blood after meals. That is what lispro is for.
Each person responds in his or her own way to different preparations of
insulin. You need to test your blood glucose to determine your individual
response.
An additional factor affecting the onset of insulin is the location of the injec-
tion. Because your abdominal muscles are usually at rest, injection of insulin
into the abdomen results in more consistent blood glucose levels. If you use
the arms or legs, the insulin will be taken up faster or slower, depending on
whether you exercise or not.
The depth of the injection also affects the onset of activity of the insulin. A
deeper injection results in a faster onset of action. If you use the same length
needle and insert it to its maximum length each time, you’ll ensure more uni-
form activity.
39
Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes

You can see from the discussion in this section that a great deal of variation
is possible in the taking of an insulin shot. It’s no wonder that people who
must inject insulin tend to have many more ups and downs in their blood 
glucose. But with proper education, these variations can be reduced.
If you take oral medication, in particular the sulfonylurea drugs like micronase
and glucotrol, the timing of food in relation to the taking of your medication
must also be considered. For a complete explanation of this balance between
food and medication, see Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

Chapter 3
Planning Meals for 
Your Weight Goal
In This Chapter
 Deciding how many calories to eat
 Shedding weight quickly at 1,200 kilocalories
 Dropping weight more slowly at 1,500 kilocalories
 Staying at your current weight with 1,800 kilocalories
 Looking at other diets
You can eat wisely, get all the nutrients you need, and continue to eat
great food, but you do have to limit your portions. In this chapter, we
show you how to plan three different daily levels of kilocalories (the proper
term for what most people call calories). You can lose weight rapidly, lose
more slowly, or maintain your weight.
We prefer the slower approach to losing weight. With this method, you’ll
probably feel less hungry, and cutting back a few hundred kilocalories a day
doesn’t cause a major upheaval in daily life. Also, maintaining a weight loss
may be easier if you lose the weight slowly.
Exercise can help speed up weight loss or permit you to eat more and still lose
weight. Twenty minutes of walking burns up 100 kilocalories, and 30 minutes
of walking burns up 150 kilocalories. Walk for 30 minutes a day, and you lose
about 1⁄3 of a pound per week (7 times 150 equals 1,050 kilocalories divided into
3,500) — without reducing your calories. That activity amounts to an annual
weight loss of 17 pounds in a year. Who says you can’t lose weight by exercis-
ing but not dieting?

Figuring Out How Many 
Calories You Need
Before planning a nutritional program, you need to know how much you need
to eat on a daily basis to maintain your current weight. Then you can figure
how rapidly a deficit of calories will get you to your goal.
Finding your ideal weight range
The ideal weight for your height is a range and not a single weight at each
height, but we use numbers that give us a weight in the middle of that range.
Because people have different amounts of muscle and different size frames,
you’re considered normal if your weight is plus or minus 10 percent of this
number. For example, a person who is calculated to have an ideal weight of
150 pounds is considered normal at a weight of 135 (150 minus 10 percent)
to 165 (150 plus 10 percent) pounds.
Because no two people, even twins, are totally alike in all aspects of their
lives, we can only approximate your ideal weight and the number of calories
you need to maintain that weight. You’ll test the correctness of the approxi-
mation by adding or subtracting calories. If your daily caloric needs are 2,000
kilocalories and you find yourself putting on weight, try reducing your intake
by 100 kilocalories and see whether you maintain your weight on fewer 
kilocalories.
42
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Considering the calories you’re storing
Patients often worry that they’re going to feel
hungry if they take in fewer calories than they
need. Does a bear feel hungry as it lives off its
fat all winter long? No, it sleeps.
One of our favorite tasks is to point out how many
calories of energy are stored in the body of an
overweight or obese person. Each pound of fat
contains 3,500 kilocalories. If you’re 25 pounds
overweight, you have 87,500 kilocalories (25
times 3,500) of stored energy in your body. We
can give you an idea of what you could do with
that much energy. You need 100 kilocalories
to walk 20 minutes at 4 miles an hour. So a
walk of 11⁄3 miles (one-third of 4 miles) burns 
100 kilocalories. Your stored energy — 87,500 
kilocalories — would take you about 1,100 miles
(87,500 divided by 100 times 11⁄3)!
We certainly don’t suggest that you stop eating
and fast for any length of time in order to lose
weight, but recognize that your stored energy,
in the form of fat, will provide all the calories
necessary to continue your daily activities with-
out fatigue and often without hunger.

If you’re a male, your approximate ideal weight is 106 pounds for 5 feet of
height plus 6 pounds for each inch over 5 feet. If you’re a female, your ideal
weight is 100 pounds for 5 feet plus 5 pounds for each inch over 5 feet tall.
Table 3-1 shows the ideal weights for females and males from 4 feet, 10 inches
to 6 feet, 2 inches in height.

Now you know your ideal weight for your height. What a surprise! Yes, we
know. You have big bones, but bear with us. It is amazing how often we have
seen big bones melt away as weight is lost.
Determining your caloric needs
After you know about how much you should weigh, figure out how many
calories you need to maintain your ideal weight. Start by multiplying your
43
Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal

ideal weight by ten. For example, if you’re a male, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, your
ideal weight is 142 pounds. Your daily kilocalorie allowance is about 1,400.
But this number is ideal only if you don’t take a breath or have a heartbeat. It
is considered your basal caloric need. You must increase your calorie intake
depending upon the amount of physical activity you do each day. Table 3-2
shows this graduated increase.

manual labor need so many extra calories that they should not be held to
only 40 percent more than their basal calorie intake. This requirement
becomes clear as the person gains or loses weight on his or her food plan.
You gain weight when your daily intake of kilocalories exceeds your daily
needs. Each pound of fat has 3,500 kilocalories, so when the excess has
reached that number of calories, you are a pound heavier. On the other hand,
you lose weight when your daily expenditure of calories exceeds your daily
intake. You lose a pound of fat each time you burn up 3,500 kilocalories more
than you take in, whether you do it by burning an extra 100 kilocalories per
day for 35 days or an extra 500 kilocalories per day for 7 days.
Now you can create a nutritional program and fill in the blanks with carbohy-
drates, proteins, fats, and real foods.
Losing Weight Rapidly 
at 1,200 Kilocalories
If you’re a moderately active male, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, you need 1,680 or
approximately 1,700 kilocalories daily to maintain your weight. (Refer to
Table 3-2.) If you eat only 1,200 kilocalories daily, you’ll have a daily deficit of
approximately 500 kilocalories. By dividing the kilocalories in a pound of fat
(3,500) by 500, you can see that you’ll lose 1 pound per week (3,500 divided
by 500 is 7, so the loss will take 7 days).

You can use the exchange system to create a nutritional plan providing 1,200
kilocalories per day with a breakdown of about 40 percent carbohydrate, 30
percent protein, and 30 percent fat. You can find the various food exchange
lists in Appendix B, and Chapter 2 explains the exchange system. You’ll defi-
nitely want the help of a registered dietitian as you set up your plan.
Each item in an exchange list — for example, the fruits list — is considered to
have the same nutrient content as any other item in that list and can, there-
fore, be exchanged for one another in the plan. For example, a small apple is
the same as 4 apricots or 12 cherries or 1⁄2 cup of grape juice.
Table 3-3 shows the exchanges for a 1,200-kilocalorie diet. If you’re a woman,
you’ll probably want to add some calcium in the form of tablets.

The plan provides about 480 kilocalories of carbohydrate, 360 kilocalories of
protein, and 360 kilocalories of fat.
After you know the various exchanges and the breakdown of exchanges in a
specific nutritional plan, you can fill in the blanks with whatever food you
prefer. Table 3-4 shows an example of a 1,200-kilocalorie diet.

Because you can exchange many food items, you can make up an entirely dif-
ferent menu plan that provides the same number of calories. Table 3-5 offers
another 1,200-kilocalorie diet that uses entirely different selections.

Dinner
Snack
3 ounces turkey
3 cups popcorn, no fat added
3 ounces french-fried potatoes
1⁄2 cup 1% milk
1 cup cauliflower
1⁄2 cup fruit cocktail
1⁄2 cup 1% milk
Notice that the dinner in the second sample menu (Table 3-5) didn’t contain
two separate fat exchanges. The potatoes contain the fat, so it’s not added
separately. A french-fried potato is a simple example of a combination food,
which is a food containing two or more energy sources (like fat and carbohy-
drate in this case). Understanding combination foods gets much more com-
plex when you or a restaurant creates a dish containing multiple energy
sources. Here are a few examples:
 Chow mein (2 cups) with no noodles or rice is 1 starch and 2 lean-meat
exchanges.
 Pizza (2 slices of 10-inch size) with a meat topping is 2 starches,
2 medium-fat meats, and 2 fat exchanges.
 Turkey (11 ounces) with gravy, mashed potatoes, and dressing is
2 starches, 2 medium-fat meats, and 2 fat exchanges.
 Lasagna (8 ounces) is 2 starches and 2 medium-fat meat exchanges.
That is why it is so important to check the food labels, as explained in
Chapter 5, to find out how much carbohydrate, protein, and fat the food 
actually contains.
The portions on all food labels are based on a 2,000-kilocalorie diet. Not one
of the diets in this chapter allows you to eat that many calories. Such a por-
tion may be much too large for a person on a 1,200-kilocalorie diet.
Losing Weight More Slowly 
at 1,500 Kilocalories
The smaller the deficit of calories between what you need and what you eat,
the more slowly you’ll lose weight. If your daily needs are 1,700 kilocalories
and you eat 1,500, you’ll be missing 200 kilocalories each day. Because a
47
Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal

pound of fat is 3,500 kilocalories, you’ll lose a pound in about 17 days (3,500
divided by 200). You’ll lose almost 2 pounds a month, or 24 pounds in a year.
You can accomplish this loss by reducing your daily intake by only the equiv-
alent of a piece of bread and two teaspoons of margarine. Put that way, losing
the weight doesn’t seem difficult at all.
Table 3-6 shows the appropriate exchanges for a 1,500-kilocalorie diet. As you
can see, it differs from the diet in the preceding section by having two more
lean-meat exchanges, one additional starch exchange, one additional veg-
etable exchange, one more fat exchange, and one more fruit exchange.
Table 3-6

In this plan, you’re eating 600 kilocalories of carbohydrate, 450 kilocalories of
protein, and 450 kilocalories of fat.
With the exchange lists in Appendix B in front of you, you can create an infi-
nite number of daily menus.
As you create your meals, you’ll be amazed at how small the portions really
are. Four ounces of lean meat isn’t much compared to what most people are
used to eating at home or in restaurants. Eating proper portions is very impor-
tant because it will ultimately make the difference between weight gain and
weight maintenance or loss. Portion size may also be the difference between
controlling your blood glucose and not controlling it. Check out Chapter 1 for
more about portion sizes.
48
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

Think of the money you will save if — each time you go to a restaurant — your
knowledge of portion sizes allows you to take home half of your meal to eat
another day.
Maintaining Your Weight 
at 1,800 Kilocalories
Suppose that you have finally reached a weight (not necessarily your “ideal”
weight that we calculate in the section “Figuring Your Daily Caloric Needs”)
that allows your blood glucose levels to remain between 80 and 140 mg/dl all
the time. Now, you want to maintain that weight. You want to eat about 1,800
kilocalories, up another 300 from the previous diet in this chapter. Compared
to the 1,200-kilocalorie diet, this may seem like a lot of food.
The differences between this plan and the 1,500-kilocalorie diet are 2 addi-
tional fat exchanges, 2 additional starch exchanges, and 1 additional lean-
meat exchange. The exchange list looks like Table 3-7.

Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal

This plan provides 180 grams of carbohydrate, 135 grams of protein, and 60
grams of fat, maintaining the 40:30:30 division of calories.
If you have type 2 diabetes, this plan is an excellent way for you to eat the right
amount of calories in the right ratios of energy sources. If you have type 1 dia-
betes, or you have type 2 and take insulin, you need to know the grams of car-
bohydrate in each meal in order to determine your insulin needs for that meal.
Checking Out Other Diets
If you go to the diet section of any large bookstore, you’ll be overwhelmed by
the choices. You’ll find diets that recommend protein and no carbohydrate,
carbohydrate and no protein, one type of carbohydrate and not another, all
rice, all grapefruit, and on and on. How is it possible for all these diets, many
of which are exactly the opposite of others on the same shelf, to actually
work for you? The answer is they do and they don’t. If you follow any diet
closely, you’ll lose weight. But will the weight stay off? That is the most diffi-
cult part (as we’re sure you know).
In this section we tell you about the most popular diets presently recom-
mended by this or that brilliant “scientist.” Which one do we recommend?
None of them and all of them. If you find that you can get started losing
weight successfully with one of these programs, go ahead and do it, but
remember that in the end you want to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat
and protein and uses carbohydrates that emphasize whole grains and fiber.
And remember that you won’t be successful without exercise.
The low carbohydrate group
These diets are based on the claim that carbohydrates promote hunger. By
reducing or eliminating them, you lose your hunger as you lose your weight.
The first of them, the Atkins Diet, promotes any kind of protein, including
protein high in fat. Naturally, other diets were developed promoting very
little carbohydrate but less fatty protein. Here are your choices:
50
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Exercise for prevention
A study published in the October 20, 1999, edi-
tion of The Journal of the American Medical
Association showed that walking may prevent
the onset of diabetes. Among a large group of
nurses, the occurrence of diabetes was less for
those who walked compared with those who
were sedentary. The women who walked most
briskly had the lowest incidence of diabetes.

 Atkins Diet: This plan allows any quantity of meats, shellfish, eggs, and
cheese but doesn’t permit high-carbohydrate foods like fruits, starchy
vegetables, and pasta. Small quantities of the forbidden foods are added
in later. The program does recommend exercise but doesn’t suggest
changes in your eating behavior.
 South Beach Diet: This diet restricts carbohydrates while the recom-
mended proteins are low in fat, unlike the Atkins Diet. Daily exercise is an
important component, but the plan doesn’t suggest any changes in eating
behavior. Over time some carbohydrate is reintroduced into the diet.
 Ultimate Weight Solution: This plan recommends a lot of protein, which
naturally results in a reduction in carbohydrate. This program also
advises you not to eat foods that are high in fat. Support groups in
which you learn how to modify your eating behaviors are very impor-
tant, and you’re supposed to stay in these groups throughout your life.
The plan also emphasizes regular exercise, such as walking.
 Zone Diet: In this diet, you have to balance your food intake into exact
amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. You’re not permitted to eat
high-carbohydrate and high-fat food. Regular exercise is recommended,
but the plan doesn’t suggest changes in your eating behavior. You have to
continue with this balance throughout life to maintain your weight loss.
The portion control group
These diets recognize that it’s not what you eat but how much you eat that
determines your weight. They generally follow the recommendations of the
government food guidelines. Here are some examples of portion control diets:
 DASH Diet: Here, the emphasis is on grains, fruits, and vegetables and
restricting the amounts of fat. A further modification for those with high
blood pressure recommends very little salt. Animal protein, such as
meat, fish, and poultry, is limited. An exercise program is suggested but
not defined. This diet includes suggested changes in eating behavior. It
is a diet for life (and a very good one).
 Jenny Craig: This diet is balanced in terms of carbohydrates, protein, and
fat but pushes its own food products, which can get expensive. You are
directed to exercise by the counselor, who is an important (and costly)
part of the program as well. To stay on this diet, you need their products
lifelong.
 Weight Watchers: This plan uses a point system in which foods are given
points according to the amount of fat, fiber, and calories in them. To get
to and maintain a certain weight, you’re given a daily number of points.
As long as you stay within these points, you’ll be successful. Therefore
foods that have large amounts of calories will use up your daily points
quickly. The program suggests exercise and changes in your lifestyle.
51
Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal

A diet that emphasizes weight training
The Abs Diet is similar to the diets that recommend a balanced approach to
eating, with carbohydrates that aren’t refined and dairy and meat that are
low in fat as the most suggested foods. However, the major emphasis in this
diet is on a program called “Total Body Strength Training Workout” to build
up the muscles. Changes in eating behavior aren’t a large part of the pro-
gram. To maintain weight loss, you must eat and exercise as the diet pre-
scribes for your entire life.
More extreme diets
These diets require a level of participation that may be difficult for people
who have a life. You really need to give your time and energy to staying on
the diet. If you go away for a few weeks and stay within their program, you’ll
have some short-term success. But after you return home, sticking to the pro-
gram gets difficult. Here are the two major programs currently available:
 Dean Ornish Program: This plan allows fruits, vegetables, and whole
grains along with the leanest of meats and poultry. You can’t eat
processed foods or drink caffeine or alcohol, and you must avoid sugar,
salt, and oil. Exercise is recommended as is help with eating behaviors.
Meetings are an important part of this program, which you’re supposed
to follow for life.
 Pritikin Eating Plan: Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are essential
foods, and the diet allows almost no protein or fat. Exercise is a part of
the program as is changing your lifestyle to promote better eating behav-
iors. You’re expected to follow this program for life.
With the exception of the DASH Diet, which is recommended by the U.S.
Government, none of the diets described in the preceding sections have long-
term studies that show, convincingly, that they’re better than any other. Each
one of them has anecdotal evidence, meaning that one or two or ten people
tell you how great they did on this or that diet. But you never hear from
those who didn’t do so great.

H
aving diabetes doesn’t mean you have to give up the foods that you
grew up with and the foods you love the most. Some parts of every
ethnic diet fit well in a diabetic regimen. You can find recipes to prove this
premise in Part II of this book. You can also use all kinds of tricks to substi-
tute good-for-you ingredients for those that won’t help your diabetes. That’s
what this chapter is all about. Even foods that seemingly have no business on
the plate of a diabetic can be enjoyed if eaten in small portions.
We wish we could eliminate the word “diet” from the diabetic vocabulary. The
word implies taking something away or having to suffer somehow in order to
follow it. This is not the case at all. You can eat great food and enjoy the taste
of every ethnic variety, provided you concentrate on the amount of food and
its breakdown into the sources of energy, keeping fats and carbohydrates in
control. Perhaps the phrase “nutritional plan” would be better than “diet.”
Stop dieting and start eating delicious foods. It may take a lot of willpower,
but you can give up dieting if you try hard enough.
Following Your Eating Plan
Creating an eating plan that provides the proper number of kilocalories from
carbohydrate, protein, and fat (see Chapter 3) is particularly important when
you have diabetes. After you know how much of each you need, you can trans-
late those numbers into exchanges and pick out the food that is the delicious

end point of all the calculating. Make sure that your choices come from a vari-
ety of foods rather than eating the same thing over and over. You will be much
more likely to stay on your program if you aren’t bored with what you eat.
Before you cook, make sure that the recipes fit into your eating plan. If you
have already eaten your carbohydrate portions for the day, make sure that
the food you’re about to eat has little carbohydrate in it. The same is true for
protein and, of course, fat. If you think “moderation” as you make your meal
plan, you’ll keep to the portions you need to eat and no more.
Seasonal foods should play a primary role in your eating plan for several 
reasons:
 Seasonal foods are the freshest foods in the market.
 They are the least expensive foods.
 The recipes you can prepare with these fresh foods are some of the most
delicious. The recipes in this book show the tremendous influence that
fresh ingredients have had on the imaginations of the best chefs in the
United States and Canada.
In addition, time is an important factor in your eating plan. You may not have
a great deal of time to prepare your food, and some of the recipes in this
book may take more time than you can spare. Choose the meals that fit into
your schedule. But remember that after you’ve prepared a recipe a few times,
preparation is much faster and easier. Consider the time you spend preparing
delicious, healthy food as an investment in your well-being. Take the time to
eat properly now so that later you won’t have to give up your time being sick.
As a person with diabetes, especially if you have type 1 diabetes, you must
figure the timing of your food in your eating plan. You need to eat when your
medications will balance your carbohydrates. This process is much easier
with the rapid-acting insulin, lispro, but if you’re still using regular insulin,
you’ll have to eat about 30 minutes after you take your shot.
Another essential part of your planning is what to do when you feel hungry
but shouldn’t eat. You can prepare a low-calorie snack for such occasions, or
you can provide yourself with some diversion, such as a hobby, a movie, or,
best of all, some exercise. Examples of low-calorie snacks are baby carrots,
cherry tomatoes, a piece of fruit, and lowfat pudding.
Your diabetes medication may require you to have three meals a day, but if
not, having three meals is still important. This approach spreads calories
over the day and helps you avoid coming to a meal extremely hungry. Try not
to skip breakfast, even though our society doesn’t encourage taking the time
for this meal. Making your own lunch as often as possible gives you control
54
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

over what you eat. The fast lunches served in restaurants may not provide
the lowfat nutrition that you think you’re getting. For example, salads are
often covered with a lot of oil. It may be the right type of oil, but it still pro-
vides a lot of fat calories.
Eating the Best of Ethnic Cuisines
If you become diabetic, you don’t have to give up the kinds of food you’ve
always eaten. You can eat the same foods but decrease the portions, particu-
larly if you’re obese. People in ethnic groups who are normal in weight are
doing two things that you need to do as well: eating smaller portions and
keeping physically fit with exercise.
After you receive a diagnosis of diabetes, try to find a dietitian who treats many
members of your ethnic group. This person will be best trained to show you
how to keep eating what you love, while altering it slightly to fit your needs.
The alteration may be no greater than simply reducing the amount of food that
you eat each day. Or it may involve changing ingredients so that a high-fat
source of energy is replaced by a lowfat energy source with no loss in taste.
Valuing African American food
African American food, sometimes called soul food, combines the food pref-
erences and cooking methods of the African slaves with the available ingredi-
ents and available fuel found in the United States. Slow cooking with lots of
vegetables and meats, eating lots of greens, combining fruits and meats in
main dishes, and deep-frying meats and vegetables were cooking traditions
brought to the United States. At the time, their foods, which contained too
much fat, cholesterol, sugar, and salt, did not hurt the overworked and
abused slaves because their daily energy needs were so great. Today, the
more sedentary African American population suffers from one of the highest
incidences of obesity and diabetes, not to mention high blood pressure and
the consequences of those diseases. As their energy needs fell, African
Americans didn’t reduce their calorie intake.
The term soul food also points to the central place of eating in the African
American population. In the slave quarters, the preparation and sharing of
good food helped the slaves to maintain their humanity, helping those even
less fortunate than themselves, who might have had no food at all. Because
they had no other material possessions, food became the one symbol of
wealth that wasn’t taken from them. It also served as the focus of the creativ-
ity and artistic expression of the female slave.
55
Chapter 4: Eating What You Like

But people don’t have to abandon soul food. African American cooks at home
and chefs in restaurants have learned to use all the healthful ingredients, such
as fruits, vegetables, and grains, with much smaller amounts of fat, sugar, and
salt. They use spices in place of salt in very creative ways to bring out the
taste of their fresh ingredients. The meats are leaner, and they use egg whites
instead of the whole egg. They also avoid deep-frying as much as possible.
The psychological implications of food in the African American population
means that changing from less healthy to more healthy food requires a change
in mind-set. African-American cooks can be just as creative or even more so
with healthful ingredients. The use of less fat, less salt, and less sugar is essen-
tial, but other ingredients have to take their place. Quantities of food must be
modified, and this may be the most difficult change, given the importance of
food both as a symbol of wealth and for sharing. People must eat fewer cakes,
pies, and cookies and find ways to creatively prepare fruit to take the place of
sweet baked goods.
Appreciating Chinese food
When you think of Chinese food, you think rice. But China is such a huge place,
and rice can’t be grown everywhere. In the north, millet is used to make cereal.
About 1500 BC, wheat was introduced from West Asia. Vegetables such as soy-
beans and cucumbers were added to the rice, and occasionally a little bit of
chicken or beef was added. Ginger became a favorite flavoring because it was
so readily available.
The Thais gave chicken to China, and pork was already there, while Westerners
brought sheep and cattle. The Chinese, mostly peasants, had little fuel and
little cooking oil. Consequently, they learned to cut their food into very small
pieces so it would cook rapidly, using little oil for their stir-frying.
Around 1000 AD, because Buddhists, who made up a large part of the popula-
tion, wouldn’t eat meat, tofu or bean curd was introduced. The Chinese also
learned to make long noodles from wheat and rice.
Chinese cuisine is generally healthful. It includes lots of vegetables, fruits,
and seafood, while keeping sugar and desserts to a minimum. People with
diabetes need to avoid eating too much rice. Chinese restaurants offer won-
derful vegetable dishes, many with tofu as a protein source.
When you cook Chinese food, use as little sugar and fat as possible, and steer
clear of making deep-fried dishes.
56
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

Welcoming French food
French food is always associated with the term “haute cuisine,” which means
fine food prepared by highly skilled chefs. This kind of cooking derives from
Italy and was introduced to France by Catherine de Medici. The French added
their own subtle techniques to the methods of the Italians from Florence,
adopting their use of truffles and mushrooms and preparing lighter sauces.
The French gave the world the technique of serving a series of dishes, one
after the other, instead of a large buffet where people helped themselves to
everything at once.
France has several distinct culinary regions:
 The north: Abundant forests provide game, and streams provide fish.
 The central area: The red wines provide the basis for much of the 
cooking.
 The south: Goose liver, truffles, and Roquefort cheese combine with
Mediterranean olive oil, garlic, and tomatoes to produce the distinctive
cuisine that is loved throughout the Western world, especially in its new
lighter form.
French food is made of a lot of butter and cream, but some restaurants do
use these ingredients much more sparingly. The essence of the new French
food is very fresh ingredients cooked in light sauces (including fresh fish and
shellfish), whole grains, and light oil. Too much of the delicious French bread,
especially when used to mop up the heavy French sauces or slathered with
butter, will quickly take you over the calorie count you so cleverly calculated.
Tasting Indian food
Although India brings to mind vegetarian food, Indian food includes plenty of
chicken and beef. Meat, including the now-sacred cow, was eaten throughout
India until the fifth century BC when the concept of Ahimsa, or reverence for
life, began to be promoted by the Buddhists. (Now beef is eaten mainly in the
north.) The fact that it coincided with a growing shortage of cows made it
even more appropriate to prevent their slaughter. Vegetarianism spread from
northern India to the south, especially among the Brahmins, the caste of
priests and intellectuals. People in India practice many varieties of vegetari-
anism. For example, some vegetarians eat fish, and some eat lamb but don’t
eat chicken or eggs. Go figure!
57
Chapter 4: Eating What You Like

Southern India, which has the greatest variety of fruits and vegetables, became
the main area for vegetarianism. If any questions arose about caring about the
life of an animal in southern India — for example, a mouse — the statement
“Remember, you might have been a mouse in your last life” was often used to
settle the matter. The north, which was invaded by the Muslims, was intro-
duced to a new cuisine that featured meat as a central food.
Vegetarian food features rice and lentils, but Indians use numerous varieties of
both. For example, they have long-grain rice, round-grain rice, polished rice,
pressed rice, and beaten rice — in all, more than a thousand varieties of rice.
They also have yellow, red, small, large, round, flat, and many other kinds of
lentils. With such a wealth of ingredients, the possibilities are endless.
A large expanse of southern India is seacoast. The suggestion that these
people avoid eating fish, including shellfish, is unrealistic. In northern India,
by contrast, lamb is king. The varieties of lamb dishes are almost as numer-
ous as the varieties of rice. Because of the Muslim influence, the people there
don’t eat pork and rarely eat beef because the cow was considered sacred.
Because of their distance from the sea, they weren’t able to create much
seafood cuisine. Chicken dishes are available, but they don’t compare in their
quality to those made with lamb, some of which can be quite spicy.
Indian food, like all the others discussed here, is good for the person with
diabetes, so long as he or she doesn’t eat too much of it. Overeating is easy
to do since the food is so delicious. Watch out for too much white rice and
the traditional bread called naan. A vegetarian diet can be especially con-
ducive to good health because it lacks all the saturated fat found in meat.
Enjoying Italian food
Italian food reflects the history of Italy. Until 1870, Italy was divided into
many different regions, with each one developing its own cuisine. Therefore,
there is no one Italian food, but there are some common trends.
 The food of northern Italy features more wild game, such as deer and
rabbits, along with some farm animals, such as beef, chickens, and
goats. Seasonings include garlic, onions, rosemary, and bay leaf.
 In the south, much closer to the sea, seafood received much more
emphasis. Southerners also developed some of the famous cheeses like
ricotta and pecorino. It was here where the Italian staple, the artichoke,
was first discovered and cultivated.
58
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

The invasions of Arabs from North Africa in southern Italy around 800 AD
brought some of the foods that are now most typically thought of as Italian,
things like melons, dates, rice, and lemons, but their major contribution was
pasta. The Spanish gave the tomato to Italy, but the Italians took it over and
made it their own.
Today, northern Italian cooking emphasizes cream and meat sauces. Rice
dishes like risotto and polenta made from yellow corn are enjoyed along with
gnocchi, a dumpling contributed by Germany.
As you move south, the olive becomes part of many dishes, along with wine
for cooking. In southern Italy, the tomato is the basis of most cooking, partic-
ularly its use in pasta dishes. The cheeses mentioned earlier also are fea-
tured. The closeness of all parts of this region to the sea, as well as to the
islands off the western coast, means that fish will be found in many meals.
These mouthwatering dishes aren’t denied to the person with diabetes. The
Mediterranean diet, with its emphasis on olive oil, has been shown to be
healthy for your heart. One of the key changes you may need to make, how-
ever, is to reduce the amount of fat in your ingredients. Olive oil is a fat, and
as you add more of it to your dishes, the calories climb rapidly. When Italians
worked hard in the fields all day or traveled long distances to hunt or fish,
they needed those extra calories to sustain them. But when was the last time
you lifted a shovel or bagged a deer?
A second important step is reducing the size of your portion of pasta or
risotto, whether you eat it at home or in the wonderful Italian restaurants
(see Chapter 17 for more about eating healthy at restaurants). If you look
back at the exchanges you find for the various diets for weight loss in
Chapter 3, you see that you’re never permitted to eat more than a cup of
pasta or 2⁄3 cup of rice (2 starch exchanges) in any meal or snack. Compare
that with the usual 3 cups of pasta at a restaurant, and you quickly discover
what changes you need to make.
On the other hand, the great fresh fruits and vegetables in Italian cooking are
just what the doctor ordered, like the tomato, the artichoke, and the beans.
These fit perfectly into the new emphasis of the federal food guidelines on
fiber and reduction of fat.
Top off your meal with a glass of Chianti from Tuscany. (Chapter 1 tells you
about the benefits of alcohol.) But skip the rich Italian desserts or share a
dessert with three other people. We don’t think these changes will be a hard-
ship. They take nothing away from the glory of Italian cooking.

Feasting on Mexican food
Mexican food comes from the Mayan Indians of the southeastern part of the
country. They were hunters and fisherman, so their main sources of food
were wild game, such as rabbit and turkey, and fish. Their diet also included
beans and corn. The Aztecs later added chocolate, vanilla, honey, and chili
peppers. After Spain conquered the country in 1521, the Spanish diet began
to influence Mexican food. The Spanish brought livestock like cows and pigs
and taught the Mexicans to make cheese and bread.
The type of Mexican food that has become so popular in the United States,
the burrito, is a stuffed wheat tortilla. The Spanish brought in the wheat, so
the burrito isn’t exactly an indigenous food of Mexico. The Mexican tortilla is
made of cornmeal, not wheat.
Mexico has been influenced by other colonial powers, including France,
Portugal, all of the surrounding islands in the Caribbean, West Africa, and
South America.
As a result of the influences of other countries, Mexican food can be much
more complex than the burrito. If you buy a small burrito, you get a fairly
good combination of beans, chicken or beef, rice, and salsa, but you may also
get your daily dose of salt in this single food. When you make your own, how-
ever, you can control the amount of salt.
The ingredients in a burrito, minus the high salt content, can make a nice
meal in a hurry. When you make burritos, be sure to avoid cheese and exces-
sive rice and watch out, especially, for the hot pepper.
Sharing Russian food
In the last few decades, many Russian people have immigrated to the United
States, bringing their dietary customs with them. The vastness of the coun-
try, as well as its borders with 14 other countries, has produced a similarly
large number of different cuisines. The Russian climate has played a major
role in what its people eat as well. In the very cold areas of western Russia,
such as Siberia, dishes with plenty of fat provide the energy needed to ward
off the cold. Vegetables and fresh fruits were less available and therefore
eaten less often. Rye grows rapidly in a climate with a short growing season,
so rye breads were a staple. The key components of Russian food are eggs,
bread, meat, potatoes, and butter — not exactly the healthiest foods for
people who lead less physically active lives and don’t need as much food for
energy. Of course, vodka has always played a role in the Russian diet.
60
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

When Peter the Great unified Russia around 1725, he encouraged the intro-
duction of Western food, and the wealthy began to eat more like the French.
The peasants continued to eat their rye bread.
The Russians who came to the United States brought their high-caloric
energy diet with them, leading to a lot of obesity, diabetes, and coronary
artery disease.
If you cook Russian food, stay away from the fatty, fried dishes and avoid
eating too much bread. A little Russian food goes a long way in meeting your
daily caloric needs, so keep your portions small and save some of the deli-
cious food for another meal. Watch out for all the salt in the pickled foods
and the salted herring. And take it easy on the vodka.
Savoring Thai food
Thai food is a good choice for people with diabetes. It is cooked with little fat
because stir-frying is the method of choice. Thai cooking keeps the meat, fish,
and poultry to small quantities, thus providing taste rather than bulk, as in a
Western diet. The dipping sauces have strong tastes, so they’re used in very
small quantities, minimizing the salt and sugar in the diet. Vegetables are
eaten in larger quantities. At the end of the meal Thais enjoy fruits like mango,
pineapple, guava, and papaya, which provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
Thai food, like Italian food, is also the product of many influences. Westerners
introduced milk into Thai cooking, and because coconut milk is so readily
available, this became a staple of Thai dishes. The Chinese coming down
from the north brought stir-frying with them, as well as noodles. Thanks to
the Chinese, the five basic flavors of Asian cuisine — bitter, salt, sour, hot,
and sweet — were established, and Thai meals use them as their basis for a
balance of flavors. Dishes made with soy and ginger are a good example.
India brought curry dishes to Thailand, with coconut milk serving as an anti-
dote to the hot spices in some of those curry dishes. The Thais have put their
own delicious stamp on these curries, using a lot of green chili pepper, also
given to them originally by Westerners.
Southern Thai food is usually hot and spicy, and fish is a major ingredient
because the area is so close to the sea. However, you can always get dishes
that aren’t so spicy, and the subtle tastes of good Thai cooking have made it
tremendously popular in the United States and throughout the world wher-
ever Thais are found. Rice generally is part of the meal.
61
Chapter 4: Eating What You Like

Most Thai dishes have garlic, a condiment that grows all over Thailand.
Coconut milk, actually a combination of the coconut flesh and the liquid
inside the coconut, is added to Thai curries and soups. Fish sauce, made by
fermenting shrimp, salt, and water together, takes the place of soy sauce in
Thai cooking.
In American Thai restaurants, a dish called pad thai has become a favorite
entrée. It means “Thai-style stir-fried noodles” and was brought to Thailand
by the Chinese. When employment was low in Thailand after World War II, the
government promoted noodle shops and stalls as a way of getting people
back to work, and pad thai noodles became popular throughout the country.

Choosing from familiar foods
Esmeralda Cruz, a patient from a region of the
Philippines called Pampanga, figured out how
to successfully manage her diabetes without
giving up the staples of her native cuisine. And
good thing — her home is considered by many
to be the culinary capital of the country.
Esmeralda is a 46-year-old woman with type 2
diabetes, which has been diagnosed for five
years. She is 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighs 156
pounds. Her blood glucose averages 176 mg/dl,
and she has a hemoglobin A1c of 8.6 percent.
Esmeralda followed a typical Filipino diet and
gained at least 3 to 6 pounds each year for the
last four years. She ate a lot of food fried in
lard and too much rice for the calories and 
carbohydrate that is planned for her diet. She
also tended not to trim the fat from the meat that
she ate.
Her dietitian advised her to make modifications
that would help her keep her diabetes in line
without sacrificing the foods she loved. She
recommended that Esmeralda do the following:
 Cut off visible fat from her meats
 Reduce the amount of frying and begin
broiling and roasting instead
 Switch to canola oil in place of lard
 Reduce the amount of fat she used
 Eat less rice and choose low-glycemic
types, like basmati
 Add more fish and poultry to her diet
Esmeralda found that the alterations usually
didn’t affect the food’s appeal. For example, one
of her dishes, a pork dish called Tortung Babi,
was made with three eggs, but reducing the
number to two didn’t diminish the taste.
After discovering how to modify her diet rather
than giving up her native food, Esmeralda began
to lose weight. She gradually lost 12 pounds
over the next six months, and her blood glucose
began to fall to the point that it averaged 132
mg/dl with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.9 percent.
Because she made these changes for all mem-
bers of her family, everyone has benefited.

Thai immigrants brought the dish to the United States. It’s not exactly repre-
sentative of the finest Thai cuisine, but it’s eaten so frequently in the United
States that it must be considered when the diabetic has Thai food, particu-
larly because the sauce often contains a lot of sugar. A small portion of pad
thai is fine for the person with diabetes, but leave at least half the serving for
another day.
Thai food is so nutritious that there is little about it to warn the person with
diabetes. As always, avoid large portions and too much rice. And be careful
of the hot spices.
Eating the rest of the world’s cuisine
Covering all the world’s wonderful cuisines in detail isn’t possible in this book.
We tried to cover the most popular foods in the English-speaking world, but we
could devote an entire book to every type of cuisine. We know that we left out
delicious cuisines that many of you love from other countries, such as Greece,
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Brazil. But we hope that you will still
come away with a few general tips about these foods from around the world:
 You don’t have to give up the foods you love because you have diabetes.
 Food is also love, sharing, social status, wealth (which it represented for
slaves), and a lot more.
 You can reduce the fat in your food, and it will still be delicious.
 You can reduce the salt and lower your blood pressure.
 You can avoid the empty calories in fatty, sugary desserts.
 The biggest problem is the large size of the portions. Try sharing or
saving the food for another meal instead.
 A lot of exercise will reverse the damage of just about any dietary 
indiscretion.
We want you to learn to eat to live — not live to eat. What you put in your
mouth has a lot to do with your state of health, no matter where the food
comes from.
Stocking Up with the Right Ingredients
Some common ingredients are used in many different recipes. Having them at
hand is convenient, saving you needless trips to the market and more expo-
sure to foods you don’t need.

With these ingredients, you’re ready for just about any of the recipes in the
book. The exceptions are exotic ingredients, such as in ethnic foods, that you
can buy in specialty stores as you need them.
Prepare a list of these ingredients and make multiple copies so that you can
check off what you need before you go to the market. Leave a little space for
the perishables such as fresh fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, fish, and poultry.
In the next chapter, we tell you more about the process of shopping for these
ingredients.
Using the Right Tools
Just as you wouldn’t try to bang in a nail with a shoe (especially with your
foot inside), don’t try to cook without the right tools. Spending a little more
at the beginning pays huge dividends later on. For example, get the best set
of knives you can afford. They make all cutting jobs much easier, and they
last a long time. Buy good nonstick pans; they make cooking without oils
much easier.
Here’s the basic equipment that all kitchens should have in order to turn out
delicious meals:
Chopping boards
Pots and pans
Food processor
Salad spinner
Knives
Scales
Measuring cups and spoons
Steamer with double boiler
Microwave
Thermometers (for roasts and turkey)
Mixer with dough hook

Making Simple Modifications
You can make all kinds of simple modifications that will reduce calories and
reduce the amounts of foods (such as those containing cholesterol) that you
are trying to keep in check. You can easily do the following:
 Use skim milk instead of whole milk.
 Use cuts of meat that are low in fat instead of high-fat meats. Lowfat
meats include lean beef, lean pork, and skinless white-meat poultry.
 Trim all visible fat off meats and poultry.
 Stay away from packaged luncheon meats, which tend to be high in fat.
 Select foods that are low in sodium and saturated fats (check the label
on the food).
 Choose high-fiber foods like whole fruits, vegetables, and grains.
 Enjoy nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream.
 Have dressings, sauces, and gravies served on the side.
 Substitute lentils and beans for meat, fish, and poultry.
 Replace butter with olive oil, herbs, spices, or lemon juice.
 Prepare foods by baking, broiling, and so on — any method other than
frying.
Use your imagination to come up with your own unique ways to cut calories
and fat.
Taking Holiday Measures
This is a particularly good heading for this section, because the key to getting
through a holiday in good diabetic control is to control the portions of every-
thing you eat during the holidays. Eating too much is easy.
If you encounter a buffet table, vow to make only one trip. You’ll probably fill
your plate with more food than you need, so plan to leave a large portion on
the plate. Focus on the foods that you should eat and avoid high-fat and high-
sugar foods, particularly desserts. Stick to fruits for high-fiber, low-calorie
desserts.

Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

If you’re invited to a potluck dinner, make something that you know will work
for your nutritional plan. You can certainly find something in this book that
fits for you. These recipes have all been taste-tested and are delicious, so you
don’t have to think that you’re bringing something inferior. We suggest that
you have a snack before you go to a party so that you don’t arrive feeling
hungry.
Most important of all, try to forget the all-or-nothing mind-set. If you go off
your nutritional plan once or twice, put the lapse behind you and get back to
doing the things you know are right for you. The benefits will be immediate in
the form of a general feeling of well-being and, of course, long-term in the fact
that you won’t develop the long-term complications of diabetes.

How the Supermarket Can Help
In This Chapter
 Having a grocery shopping plan
 Reading the Nutrition Facts label
 Figuring out exchange values
E
very trip to the market is an adventure. This chapter is about coping
with the challenge of going grocery shopping without being lured into
buying items that aren’t good for your diabetes nutritional plan. But it’s also
about overcoming your natural desire to take home what you know isn’t good
for you.
You deserve the best, and that holds true for the food you eat as much as
anything else. Of course, you could be like the man whose doctor told him
that the best thing he could do for himself would be to get on a really good
diet, stop chasing women, and stop drinking so much alcohol. The patient
replied: “I don’t deserve the best. What about second best?” We hope you
won’t settle for second best.
Going to the Market with a Plan
If you have a hobby, you’ve probably developed a series of steps by which
you can accomplish your hobby in the most efficient manner, whether it’s
painting pictures or raising tomatoes. If you paint pictures, you certainly
wouldn’t start painting without deciding on a subject and buying the right
paints, brushes, and canvas. If you raise tomatoes, you prepare the soil, add
amendments such as manure, and buy the seeds or, more likely, the plants.
You use a watering system as well as tomato cages to hold up your crop.
You should plan your excursion to the market in the same careful manner.
Decide in advance what you need that complies with your nutritional plan. In
Chapter 4, we give you a list of recommendations for the staples you should

have at home. You can use those suggestions to make a shopping list to make
sure that you purchase what you need. To that list, add the perishables that
you’ll use immediately, such as meat and poultry or fish, milk and other dairy
products, and, of course, fruits and vegetables.
Eat something before you go to the market so that you aren’t hungry as you
walk down the aisles.
A market is like a huge menu set up to entice you. Most markets are set up in
the same way. This setup is not by accident. It’s arranged to encourage you to
buy. What people buy on the impulse of the moment is often the most calorie-
concentrated and expensive food that is least appropriate for them. You’ll find
that all the perishable food is arranged around the perimeter of the market.
The high-calorie foods are in the aisles in the middle of the store. Unless you
want to take the long way around, you must go through those aisles to get to
the meat, milk, fruit, and vegetables. You pass the loose candies, the cookies,
the high-sugar cereals, and all the other no-nos. If you prepare a list and buy
only from the list, you won’t purchase any of those foods. Walking into the
market hungry and without a list is dangerous for your health.
Sometimes the market employs a person who is trained to help people with
medical conditions avoid bad choices. Check with your market to find out
whether such a person is on staff, and spend some time touring the aisles
with him or her. You’ll get some valuable insights that will make handling a
shopping trip easier.
Some keys to shopping the market most effectively include the following:
 Shop at the same market each time.
 Shop as seldom as you can.
 Go to the market when it is not crowded.
 Don’t walk every aisle.
 Don’t be tempted by free samples. They’re usually high in calories to
appeal to your taste buds.
 If you bring your kids (not advisable) to the store, make sure that they
aren’t hungry.
 Be especially careful in the checkout lane, where stores force you to run
through a gauntlet of goodies — none of which are good for you.
Most markets offer a variety of sections. Each one presents a different chal-
lenge and requires a different strategy. You should probably work your way
around the market from the bottom of the food pyramid to the top, choosing
lots of grains, fewer fruits, vegetables, and dairy and meat products, and fats
and sweets least of all. (Check out Chapter 2 for more about the food pyramid.)
70
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

The supermarket isn’t the only place where you can find good food. Check
out your local farmer’s market. Most areas have these markets, and many are
open all year. And be sure to look into specialty food stores where you can
find some of the more exotic ingredients.
The bakery
You can really make a dent in your diet in the bakery section, where all the
desserts are on display. These foods usually contain too much fat and carbo-
hydrate; however, you don’t have to give up all your “treats.” The key is to
figure a rich dessert into your meal plan, but only on an occasional basis.
Remember to keep the portion small, in any case.
Muffins and pastries are usually high in fat, but in deference to the popular
belief that fat makes us fat, stores now sell lowfat muffins and pastries. The
problem is that these still contain many calories, so don’t overdo it. Try a
smaller portion or share your muffin with a friend. A popular choice is angel
food cake, but watch out because, even though it’s totally fat-free, it’s filled
with calories. You can enjoy a small portion.
Select breads that have at least 2 grams of fiber per slice and whole-grain
breads. Bagels and English muffins should be whole-grain as well. Don’t forget
that they’re usually too large, so plan on eating a serving of half or less. (That
goes for any bread.) If you eat too much, you’ll consume too many calories.
Produce
Fruits and vegetables are in the produce section. Stores continue to offer the
usual apples, pears, and bananas, but today they stock more fruits and vegeta-
bles that you may never have seen before. Here is where you can add some
real variety to your diet. Try some of these new items, and you may discover
that you can substitute them for the cakes, pies, and other concentrated calo-
rie foods that you now eat. For example, you may find that you like some of
the new varieties of melons, which are sweet and have a great texture.
The other benefit to trying new fruits and vegetables is that you get a variety
of vitamins and minerals from the different sources. Each differently colored
vegetable provides different vitamins, so pick out a variety of colors.
To prolong their season, you can freeze some of the fruits, especially the
berries, and use them as you need them.
71
Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help

Remember that dried fruits have very concentrated carbohydrate and should
be used sparingly.
Root vegetables need no refrigeration but must be kept in a cool, dry place.
Most of the other vegetables must go in the refrigerator.
The dairy case
At the dairy case, you can make some very positive diet modifications. Go for
the lowest fat content you can eat, but don’t neglect the dairy part of the
food guide pyramid. That’s where you get calcium. Try to find lowfat cheeses,
yogurt, and cottage cheese. You can even buy cheeses that aren’t lowfat if
you use them sparingly. Go for 1 percent or even skim milk if possible.
The deli counter
A deli counter offers luncheon meats and prepared foods. These foods often
contain a lot of salt and fat. You probably want to avoid most of the foods in
this area (with the exception of prepared chicken, which is often spit-roasted
and very tasty). Even the lowfat meats in this section are rich in salt. The
pickled foods may also contain a great deal of salt, despite being low in calo-
ries and free of fat.
If you choose salads from this area, pick out those that contain oil instead of
cream. Don’t be afraid to ask a deli employee about the exact ingredients in
these prepared foods. In some cases, lower-fat versions are available. People
often prefer fatty foods — and the grocery obviously wants people to buy the
food — so the market caters to those preferences.
The fresh meat and fish counter
The fresh meat and fish counter provides some good choices for your protein
needs. At the meat counter, buy no more than a normal serving for each
member of the family. Just because the meat attendant has cut a 12-ounce
piece of swordfish doesn’t mean that you have to buy the whole thing. You
are entitled to get just the piece you want. For convenience, you can get two
servings at one time if you know you have the willpower to save the second
serving for another meal. Ask the attendant to cut the fish in half so you
aren’t tempted to eat the whole thing.
72
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

Don’t forget that lentils and other legumes can provide protein as well.
Look for lowfat cuts of meat. The best choices for you are top round, sirloin,
and flank steak. These tend to be the leanest cuts of meat and are also very
tasty. When buying chopped meat (for hamburgers, for example), consider
how you plan to cook it. If you like meat cooked well done, you don’t always
have to choose the package with the lowest fat content, because the fat may
be cooked out. Otherwise, look for lower-fat chopped meat.
Try to buy skinless poultry to eliminate a major source of the fat in chicken.
You may have to cook it a shorter time, or you can barbecue the chicken using
an indirect method (place the coals along the sides of the chicken rather than
underneath). The chicken will be much juicier and not dried out.
Try to eat fish at least twice a week because of the positive effect it has on
blood fats. Remember that a “fatty” fish such as salmon is good for you but
adds extra fat calories.
The fresh meat and fish counter usually offers breaded or battered fish to
make your life easier; you only have to put it in the oven. The problem is that
the breading or batter often contains too much butter, fat, and salt. Ask the
person serving you for a list of the ingredients in the breading or batter. Or
better yet, skip the prepared fish and head for the fresh. If you notice a very
fishy smell, then the fish is not very fresh.
Frozen foods and diet meals
When the season for your favorite fresh fruits and vegetables is over, the
frozen food section may stock these items. However, because markets now
often bring in more varieties of fresh food from all over the world year-round,
you may not need to turn to frozen products as much.
Food manufacturers are producing a variety of frozen foods, which you can
heat in the microwave oven. These meals are often high in fat and salt, how-
ever. Be sure to read the food label, which we explain later in this chapter.
Avoid frozen foods mixed with cream or cheese sauces.
Diet meals can be a good choice if you want to save time in preparation.
The frozen diet meals are low in calories and often low in salt and fat as well.
Most diet meals have no more than 350 kilocalories and usually taste good. If
you have type 1 diabetes and need to count carbohydrates, they’re listed on
the box.
73
Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help

Healthy Choice, Lean Cuisine, and Weight Watchers are the three main makers
of diet meals, all of which can be counted on for low calories and good taste.
Healthy Choice is the lowest in salt. Grocery stores usually have one brand or
another on sale, so you can choose the least expensive brand when you shop.
Are frozen diet foods a good choice for you? Many of our patients complain
that they lack time to prepare the “right” foods. For those people, prepared
diet meals work very well. For the person who likes to involve him or herself
in food preparation — for example, people who bought this book for the won-
derful recipes — this is not the way to go.
Low-carbohydrate foods are also being made by many of the food manufac-
turers. See our discussion of the various types of diets in Chapter 3 for ways
that these foods can fit in your nutrition plan.
Canned and bottled foods
Canned and bottled foods can be healthful and can help you quickly make
recipes calling for ingredients such as tomato sauce. Check the Nutrition
Facts label (covered later in this chapter) to determine what kind of liquid
a food is canned in. Oil adds a lot of fat calories, so look for the same food
canned in water.
Canned vegetables often contain too much salt, so look for low-salt varieties.
Canned fruits often contain too much sweetener, so you’re better off with
fresh if possible.
Watch for this marketing trick: Stores often display higher-priced canned
foods at eye level and lower priced-products on lower shelves. Also, store
brands are often less expensive and just as good as name brands.
Bottled foods include fruit juice drinks, which are high in sugar and low in
nutrition. You’re better off drinking pure fruit juice rather than a juice drink
diluted with other ingredients.
The same principle is true for bottled and canned soda, which has no nutri-
tional value and lots of calories. Substitute water for this expensive and basi-
cally worthless food that really doesn’t quench your thirst (soft drinks often
leave an aftertaste, especially the diet drinks). Try adding lemon or lime to
your water or use the flavored calorie-free water drinks.
74
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

You can find lowfat or fat-free salad dressing and mayonnaise in this area.
Better yet, try using mustard and some of the other condiments to spice up
your salads without adding many calories.
The best choices for snacks
You probably frequently feel like eating a little something between meals.
Your choice of foods may make the difference between weight gain and
weight control, between high blood glucose levels and normal levels.
Here are the best selections to choose as you make your way around the
supermarket:
 Baked chips: Avoid fried chips, which add lots of fat calories. An ounce
of baked chips amounts to 110 kilocalories.
 Flavored rice cakes: These items are filling without calories.
 Fruit and fig bars: These items can satisfy hunger without many kilo-
calories. A couple of Fig Newmans, for example, will set you back only
120 kilocalories.
 Lowfat granola: Watch out for regular granola, which is high in
calories. Depending on the brand, 1⁄2 cup of lowfat granola contains 
220 to 250 kilocalories.
 Plain popcorn: If you prepare it in an air-popping machine or a
microwave oven, it contains only 30 kilocalories per cup and is free
of salt and fat.
 Raisins and other dried fruit: Stick to small portions. A quarter of a cup
of raisins is only 130 kilocalories.
The preceding list should give you enough choices to satisfy your hunger
without wrecking your diabetic control.
Deciphering the Mysterious Food Label
Most packaged foods have a food label known as the Nutrition Facts label,
which isn’t really mysterious if you know how to interpret it. It was designed
to be understood. Figure 5-1 shows a typical food label. The contents of the
Nutrition Facts label are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
75
Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help

The label in Figure 5-1 is from a 1-pound container of cottage cheese with
fruit. You can find the following information on the label:
 Serving Size: Note the size because it may not be the same as an
exchange (see Chapter 2 for an explanation of exchanges, and check
out Appendix B for a comprehensive list). The serving size on this food
label is 1⁄2 cup, but an exchange of lowfat cottage cheese (which you
can find in the “Very lean meat and substitutes” list in Appendix B) is
1⁄4 cup. Therefore, one serving is two exchanges. In this case, one of the
exchanges is carbohydrate and one is protein, which you can tell from
the number of grams of carbohydrate and protein on the label.
 Servings Per Container: At 1⁄2 cup, this container holds 4 servings. If you
were to use the exchange list serving size of 1⁄4 cup, this container would
serve 8.
 Calories: The number of kilocalories in a serving — in this case, 
120 kilocalories.
 Calories from Fat: The number of fat kilocalories in each serving.
 % Daily Value: The nutrient amounts appear in grams or milligrams and
also as % Daily Value. The % Daily Value refers to the percentage of the
daily value for a person on a 2,000-kilocalorie-per-day diet.
 Total Fat: The total fat is 1.5 grams, of which 1.0 is saturated fat. The fact
that there’s less than 3 grams of fat allows the producer to refer to this
product as lowfat.
 Saturated Fat: The amount of the fat in each serving that is saturated.

Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 

 Cholesterol: This food provides little cholesterol. Therefore, the pro-
ducer could call it “low cholesterol” because that term applies if the
product provides less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol and 2 grams or
less of saturated fat per serving (see Chapter 2 for more information).
 Sodium: At 290 milligrams of sodium, this food provides 12% of the
sodium allowed in a 2,000-kilocalorie-a-day diet.
 Total Carbohydrate: As a person with diabetes, you need to know the
grams of carbohydrate in a serving, both to fit it into your nutritional
plan and to determine insulin needs if that is what you take.
 Dietary Fiber: This food provides no fiber, so all the carbohydrate is
digestible. If fiber were present, you could subtract the fiber grams from
the total grams of carbohydrate to get the actual grams from carbohy-
drate absorbed.
 Sugars: The fact that 14 of the 15 grams of carbohydrate come from
sugar means that the sugar will be absorbed rapidly.
 Protein: As a person with diabetes, you’re most concerned with the
grams of protein in a portion. The figure for % Daily Value doesn’t help
you in planning your diet.
 Vitamins and Minerals: Usually, the label provides the % Daily Value for
vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. Some food labels follow that
information with a list of ingredients, but this information isn’t required
as part of the Nutrition Facts label.
Calculating Exchanges 
from the Food Label
The Nutrition Facts label isn’t required to contain the exchanges that make
up the food, but this information would certainly be helpful to people with
diabetes or anyone trying to plan and maintain a good diet. If you need to
determine the exchange value of a food (see Chapter 2 for more details on
exchanges), follow these guidelines:
 If the food is mostly carbohydrate (cereals, grains, pasta, bread, dried
beans, peas, and lentils), divide the grams of carbohydrate by 15, because
each starch exchange contains 15 grams of carbohydrate. Remember that
starch exchanges also contain 3 grams of protein. A fruit exchange also
contains 15 grams of carbohydrate but no fat or protein.
77
Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help

 If the food is mostly protein (meat and meat substitutes), divide the
grams of protein by 7, because each meat exchange contains 7 grams of
protein. Remember that it is a lean-meat exchange if it contains 3 grams
or less of fat, a medium-fat meat exchange if it contains 4 to 5 grams of
fat, and a high-fat meat exchange if it contains 8 or more grams of fat.
 If the food is mostly fat (avocado, margarine, butter, nuts, and seeds),
divide the grams of fat by 5 to calculate the fat exchanges.
 Milk exchanges contain 12 grams of carbohydrate, 8 grams of protein,
and a variable number of grams of fat — 0 grams in the case of skim and
very lowfat milk (skim milk or nonfat yogurt, for example), 5 grams for
reduced fat milk (2 percent milk or plain lowfat yogurt), and 8 grams for
whole milk.
Calculating the exchanges in food with several energy sources can get
complicated, so get some help from your dietitian.
 Vegetable exchanges contain 5 grams of carbohydrate and 2 grams of
protein per exchange.
The best way to verify that your trip to the market has been successful is to
evaluate the contents of your grocery sacks. The division of the contents
should look similar to the food guide pyramid (see Chapter 2).

In this part . . .
W
hen you were told that you have diabetes, your
first impression probably was that you were
doomed to bland, uninteresting food for the rest of your
life. This part shows that impression could not be more
wrong. Starting with your breakfast and working through
the day with lunch, snacks, main courses, desserts, and
more, your food can be just as exciting, exotic, and full of
taste as it has always been, perhaps even more so.
We’ve gathered together the creativity of some of the best
chefs in the United States and put them at your disposal.
You can choose from simple recipes, requiring few ingredi-
ents, or take it to the next level by trying recipes with
more ingredients. We guarantee that all will be delicious,
because we’ve tested all of them to make sure that you
will enjoy them and can cook them yourself.

 Making the most of your egg choices
A
big part of keeping your blood sugar steady
is eating regularly. Typically, the longest
break without food during a day comes at night.
While your body rests and revitalizes itself, your
blood glucose level takes a nosedive. Start your
day the right way with a healthy balanced break-
fast each and every day.
Choose a quick scrambled egg and whole-wheat
toast if you’re in a hurry. But brush up on the recipes in this chapter for a
change of pace. By planning ahead, you can make a delicious breakfast that’s
anything but boring.
Understanding Diabetic Breakfasts
Breakfast is a critical meal for a diabetic. Getting your day off to a steady, bal-
anced start sets you up for success the rest of the day. Check out Chapter 4
if you need help planning your meals for the day based on your individual
needs. The following sections can help you make the right breakfast choices.
Figuring out which fruit is right for you
Fruit doesn’t have to be a dirty word for a diabetic. While it’s true that fruit is
full of natural sugars and your body processes them quickly, you don’t have
to (and shouldn’t) mark them off your list completely.

Whole fruit, rather than juice, is a better choice for diabetics. The fiber and
skin in whole fruit slow down the digestion of the fruit, resulting in a more
gradual rise in your blood sugar level.
Here’s a list of fruits with a lower glycemic index (which we discuss in more
detail in Chapter 2):
 Apples
 Apricots
 Blueberries
 Cherries
 Grapefruit
 Kiwis
 Strawberries
And just for balance, here are a few fruits with a higher glycemic index:
 Cantaloupe
 Dates
 Pineapple
 Raisins
 Watermelon
Just because a fruit has a higher glycemic index doesn’t mean you can’t eat it.
Just take it into consideration when you plan when you eat it and what you
eat with it.
Putting together protein-packed punches
Eggs aren’t the only breakfast protein. In fact, many diabetics must limit their
intake of cholesterol, and eggs are an easy target for removal. (Check out
“Enjoying Egg-ceptional Dishes,” later in this chapter, for smart ways to
include eggs at breakfast.) Consider other nontraditional choices when
you’re making your breakfast changes. Here’s a list of protein-rich foods that
might make a good addition to your breakfast table:
 1 turkey hot dog wrapped in a whole-wheat tortilla
 1 ounce boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce
 2 tablespoons of peanut butter on whole-wheat toast
 1 slice turkey wrapped around lowfat string cheese
 4-ounce grilled chicken breast
 1⁄4 cup cottage cheese with diced grape tomatoes

Starting with Familiar Favorites
When you received your diagnosis of diabetes, maybe you thought your days
of eating French toast and pancakes were over. Although starting the morning
off with pancakes dripping with butter and maple syrup is probably not in
your current eating plan, you can still enjoy variations on old familiar themes.
Skip the butter because these recipes are delicious without it. If you don’t feel
like you can go cold turkey, look for a spread, such as Brummel and Brown
Yogurt Spread or Smart Balance Buttery Spread, that contains no trans fat.
T Crunchy Granola Toast
Here’s the crunchy cousin to French toast (you can check out a photo in the color sec-
tion). The sweetness of the granola makes syrup totally unnecessary, so skip it and save
your blood sugar. If you really need the extra sweetness, try topping with perfectly ripe
sliced bananas.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Chapter 6: The Benefits of Breakfast
2 egg whites, lightly beaten
2⁄3 cup lowfat milk
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup lowfat granola, crushed
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 thin slices whole-wheat or multigrain bread
1 In a bowl, whisk the egg whites, milk, orange zest, and vanilla extract until blended.
2 Place the granola in another bowl. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture and then
into the granola.
3 Melt one-fourth of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place 2 coated bread
slices in the skillet; cook approximately 3 minutes. Turn and cook on the other side
until golden brown, approximately 3 minutes.
4 Prepare the remaining bread slices in the same manner.

T Whole-Wheat Waffles
This recipe is reason alone to invest in a waffle iron. Look for one with nonstick coating
for easy waffle removal. Make sure you let the batter rest for the full 11⁄2 hours before
making the waffles. You’ll get waffles with a much lighter texture and better flavor.

What’s so great about whole grains?
Refined grains are processed to remove the
bran and the hull, and along with them, up to 90
percent of the nutrients, including vitamins E
and B. Whole grains have a lower glycemic
index than refined grains. So whole grains are
less likely to send your blood glucose soaring
and then dipping. The protein, fat, and fiber in
whole grains slow their absorption into the
bloodstream. In addition, whole grains make
you feel fuller and stay fuller longer.
Read labels carefully to ensure that the food
you’re getting is made from whole grains. Don’t
just look for “wheat” bread; make sure it says
“whole wheat.” Some manufactures add
caramel color or molasses to refined flour and
sell the bread as “wheat bread,” potentially
confusing hopeful healthy eaters.
1 cup evaporated skim milk
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄2 teaspoon orange zest
1⁄8 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 packets Splenda
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Warm the milk and dissolve the yeast in it. In a bowl, mix the yeast mixture with the flour,
orange zest, vanilla, and Splenda. Let sit, covered, at room temperature for 11⁄2 hours.
2 Using a waffle maker coated with nonstick cooking spray, prepare the waffles, following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Tip: Instead of syrup, serve these beauties with Warm Pineapple Salsa. You can find the

T Warm Blueberry Oats
This recipe makes any morning special. It’s just as quick as “regular” oatmeal, but
adding fresh blueberries gives your antioxidant levels a boost and your taste buds a
treat. If fresh blueberries aren’t in season, you can substitute frozen. Choose blueber-
ries frozen without additional sugars and thaw them before adding them to your cereal.

Stocking Up on Baked Goods
Having diabetes doesn’t mean you have to deprive yourself of the ease (and
deliciousness!) of grabbing a muffin, biscuit, or slice of quick bread. Plan
ahead and keep some of these heart-healthy handfuls on hand for breakfast
on the go.
We help you ease into using whole grains in this section by using a blend of
all-purpose (white) flour and whole-wheat flour. You can find whole-wheat
flour in the baking aisle in just about any grocery store. For information on
the benefits of using whole grains in a diabetic diet, check the sidebar
“What’s so great about whole grains?” in this chapter.

T Carrot-Pineapple Muffins
The orange color of carrots means they’re rich in carotenoids. The body converts these
carotenoids into vitamin A, which is essential for skin and eye health. Many carotenoids,
like carrots, are also a great source of beta carotene, another powerful antioxidant. You
can check out these muffins in the color section.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 16 muffins

T Sweet Potato Biscuits
Here’s a great way to discover sweet potatoes, if you haven’t already. They impart a del-
icate sweetness to these biscuits. Plus, sweet potatoes are another one of those “good
for the eye” foods, being full of carotenoids and beta carotene. They also supply a full
day’s worth of vitamin C, a decent dose of dietary fiber, and delicious flavor to boot.
You can see these biscuits in the color section.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 12 minutes

1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1⁄2 cup buttermilk
2⁄3 cup mashed cooked sweet potatoes
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With a pastry blender or fork, work in the
butter until the mixture is coarse (see Figure 6-1).
2 In another bowl, combine the buttermilk and mashed sweet potatoes. Add to the flour
mixture and mix until just moistened.
3 Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead 2 or 3 times, until smooth (see
Figure 6-2). Roll out the dough 1⁄2-inch thick. Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, dipped in flour,
cut out 12 rounds.
4 Coat a baking sheet with the cooking spray. Arrange the rounds on the baking sheet.
Bake for 12 minutes, until golden brown.
Tip: Use White Lily brand flour and whole-wheat pastry flour for more-tender biscuits.

Enjoying Egg-ceptional Dishes
Choosing eggs gives you a protein power punch to start your day. This simple
food is an ideal source of protein, containing all essential amino acids. Eggs
are also a source of B complex vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, sele-
nium, and zinc. However, egg yolks also contain a significant amount of choles-
terol. Consequently, low-cholesterol diets restrict the number of eggs allowed
each week. People with diabetes should limit their eggs to a couple per week
for the same reason.
One great way to enjoy eggs but limit your cholesterol is to enjoy egg whites
or use a combination of whole eggs and egg whites. The egg yolk (the yellow
center) contains the dreaded cholesterol, so limiting your intake of yolks may
be enough to keep egg whites on your list.

Facing facts about feta cheese
If you haven’t tried this terrific Greek cheese,
here’s your chance. It’s a soft, salty cheese that
has a tangy bite. It crumbles very easily, and is
an easy addition to salads, eggs, or stuffed in
olives. The commercially available variety is
made from cow’s milk and sold in small squares,
usually in plastic tubs covered in plastic wrap.
You can find it in the gourmet or specialty
cheese section of your local grocery.
One of the best things about feta is its strong
flavor. A little can go a long way. So if you’re
looking for flavor but don’t want to weigh down
your food with lots of cheese and fat, feta’s a
good choice. Look for flavored feta cheese for
a change of pace. You can find it blended with
sun-dried tomatoes and basil, and peppercorns.
Nonstick cooking spray
4 whole-wheat pitas
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1⁄2 small onion, finely chopped
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh spinach
1⁄8 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 medium red potatoes, baked, small diced
4 whole eggs
8 egg whites
1⁄2 cup feta cheese, very small chunks
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a baking sheet with the cooking spray and place
the pitas on the baking sheet.
2 Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onions in the butter
until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the spinach, garlic powder, and pepper. Sauté for 3 min-
utes. Add the potatoes. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg whites. Add the egg
mixture to the skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are
cooked soft, 3 to 4 minutes.

3 Spoon the egg mixture into the pitas. Sprinkle the cheese on top. Bake for 5 to 7 min-
utes, until the cheese melts.
Tip: The next time you serve baked potatoes at dinner, make a couple of extra so you have
them handy to make this delicious breakfast even speedier.

T Artichoke Frittata
At Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California, Christopher Lee created the fluffiest egg
frittata you’ll ever have. The best part about it? It tastes great. Plus, it’s low in saturated
fat, high in protein, and great for your blood sugar. You read right — protein is essential
for blood sugar control, as you’ve heard before. This recipe provides a great way to
include it at breakfast without all the fat that comes with many high-protein meats.

5 large whole frozen artichoke hearts, thawed
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon plus a few pinches salt
5 eggs
7 egg whites
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
2 tablespoons finely chopped thyme
1 Slice the artichoke hearts into 1⁄2-inch pieces.
2 Heat a sauté pan over high heat. Lightly coat the bottom with the olive oil. When the oil
begins to shimmer, add the artichoke slices, reduce the heat to medium-low, and sauté
the artichokes until they’re tender, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season the
artichokes with salt as you sauté them. Remove them from the heat.
3 Crack the eggs into a medium bowl. Add the egg whites and season them with a few
pinches of salt. Whisk them until they’re well blended.
4 For a large frittata, heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat and then add
1⁄2 tablespoon of butter and allow it to coat the bottom of the pan. Place half of the
cooked artichoke slices in the pan and sprinkle them with parsley and thyme. Reduce
the heat to low and pour half of the egg mixture over the artichokes. Quickly stir every-
thing together so that the artichokes are evenly distributed. Cook the mixture, without
stirring, until the eggs are almost set, approximately 4 minutes, and then flip the frittata
over and let it cook for another minute or so. Slide out of the pan and onto a serving
plate.
5 Repeat Step 4 to make a second frittata. Cut each frittata into 3 pieces. Serve hot or cold
with bread.

Enjoying Simple Seafood Starters
Most people don’t get enough seafood in their diet. Rich in fish oil, omega-3
fatty acids, protein, calcium, and so many other nutrients, seafood is an
excellent part of any well-rounded diet. This delectable food is much lower
in cholesterol than beef and chicken and has so many varied flavors and tex-
tures that you can’t get bored with it.

If your experience with seafood until now has been fish sticks or broiled hal-
ibut, we’ve got some great ideas for getting you going with seafood appetiz-
ers. You can experiment with new flavors without committing yourself to a
full seafood entree. But be sure to take a look at Chapter 12 for more taste-
tempting seafood recipes.
Sizing up shellfish
Shellfish, such as scallops and shrimp, are sold by weight and size. When you
see shrimp labeled as “26/30,” you get between 26 and 30 shrimp per pound.
So the higher the number, the smaller the shrimp, and vice versa. You may
even see labels that say “U10,” which means “under 10,” or fewer than 10
shrimp per pound.
Always clean your shrimp properly before cooking them. If you buy your
shrimp in a grocery store, the head will most likely be removed. But the
shrimp may or may not be deveined, which means the dark “vein” that runs
down the back of the shrimp’s tail may still be present. Because this veinlike
object is actually the shrimp’s intestinal track, you should remove it before
cooking the shrimp. At your grocery or kitchen supply store (anywhere
kitchen gadgets are sold), pick up a tool called a shrimp deveiner and run it
along the back end of the shrimp. It cracks the shell and removes the vein in
one easy step. Then rinse the shrimp in cool water. Check out Figure 7-1 to
see the deveining process.
The following recipes are delicious ways to include shellfish in appetizers.

Crab Puffs
Crab puffs are the ideal finger food for parties. For this recipe, use the best quality
Parmesan cheese you can find — its strong flavor is a terrific complement to the deli-
cate crab and artichoke without adding many calories or much fat. If you’re a fan of
spicy food, feel free to bump up the horseradish in this recipe for a sinus-clearing 
experience.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 6 to 7 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (4 pieces each)
97
Chapter 7: Hors d’Oeuvres and First Courses: Off to a Good Start
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan
cheese
1 can (14 ounces) artichoke hearts, drained
and chopped
1⁄2 pound snow crabmeat
1 egg white
1⁄4 cup lowfat sour cream

Shrimp Quesadillas
This recipe puts a nice twist on the classic Mexican dish. Though shellfish is a signifi-
cant source of cholesterol, it’s very low in total and saturated fat — a great alternative
to high-fat meats. Just be sure to limit cholesterol intake from animal products the rest
of the day.

Putting a new twist on seafood favorites
If you love the taste of classic seafood appetizers, you’re in luck — updating
these dishes is a snap, as we show you in the following recipe.

Shrimp cocktail is an easy classic seafood appetizer. Don’t settle for the bland,
mushy, precooked cocktail shrimp at the seafood counter. Make your own
quickly and easily. Bring water to a gentle boil in a saucepan. Add generous
amounts of seasonings. (I often use a combination of Old Bay seasoning and
Zatarain’s liquid crab boil. Both are available in the spice aisle of the grocery
store.) Drop in your shrimp for just a few minutes, until the tails curl and the
shrimp become opaque. Take care not to overcook them. Serve them with
cocktail sauce.
If you want to pre-peel them for your guests, do so just after cooking them.
You can definitely wait until they cool a bit, to give your fingers a break. Make
sure you wash your hands well and then take your handy deveining tool (as
shown in Figure 7-1) and clean them.
Salmon Mousse
In this recipe, this old-school mousse gets a 21st-century update. Vary your spices to
change the flavor profile: Substitute cilantro and red pepper flakes for the paprika and
dill, or throw in a little prepared horseradish to kick up the spice quotient. Choose a fun
silicon mold (such as a rooster, fish, or shamrock) to make it festive. Or look for mini-
molds to make individual portions of this great starter. If you use a metal or glass mold,
dip it in warm water for a minute or so before removing the mousse from the mold so it
will come out easily.
Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus 3 to 4 hours chilling time

Savoring Salsas
We’ve fallen in love with the Mexican condiment, salsa. Most store-bought
versions, however, have too much sugar and vinegar, so they aren’t nearly as
good as the homemade variety. Why bother with those versions when it’s so
easy to create your own? Although salsa simply means “sauce,” we think
you’ll agree that these salsa recipes taste anything but simple.
Stocking essentials for scrumptious salsas
Add the standard salsa seasonings to any grain or legume for a tasty and
nutritious treat anytime. You can flavor cooked brown rice, quinoa, or any
cooked beans with any of these tasty additions:
 Cilantro
 Garlic
 Lime juice or lemon juice
 Onions
 Peppers (such as serranos and jalapeños)
 Tomatoes
Check out the following salsa recipes, which use these delicious ingredients.
Lentil Salsa
This recipe includes high-fiber lentils with such tasty ingredients that you hardly notice
you’re eating healthy. Serve this salsa with whole-grain crackers or thick slices of red
pepper.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 35 to 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
1 pound brown lentils
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 small red onion, chopped
1⁄2 green pepper, seeded and chopped
1 small carrot, peeled and chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped walnuts
1 In a medium saucepan, cook the lentils in the broth with the bay leaf, about 35 minutes.
When cooked, drain the lentils and remove the bay leaf.

2 Heat a small skillet over medium to high heat. Add the olive oil, onion, pepper, carrot, and
garlic and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes. Don’t allow the vegetables to cook until they’re tender.
3 Remove the vegetables from heat and mix them together with the lentils. Add the pars-
ley and walnuts. Serve the salsa chilled.

Use caution when slicing and dicing hot peppers such as jalapeños. Use your
knife, not your fingers or fingernails, to remove the super-spicy ribs and seeds,
and consider wearing gloves if you have sensitive skin. The pepper oil can get
stuck under your nails, making it painful to touch your eyes, nose, or any other
moist parts later. And if your skin is exposed to sunlight with residual pepper
oil, you can get a nasty burn.
T Mexican Salsa
Chowing down some Mexican salsa is a great way to get a good helping of lycopene,
because tomatoes happen to be one of the best sources. Lycopene, a great antioxidant
that helps fight heart disease, has also been shown to help prevent prostate cancer and
maintain eye health. If you’re a fan of cilantro like we are, toss in a bit more. Serve the
salsa (shown in the color section) with pitas or tortilla chips.

Adding citrus and other fruits to salsas
To give your salsa a fruity twist, don’t bother with bottled lemon or lime
juice. Fresh is definitely the way to go. Squeezing the juice out is easy to do,
and the flavor is far superior.
Here’s how to get the most out of your citrus fruit. Check out Figure 7-2 for
details.
1. Roll the fruit on a hard, flat surface, pressing down fairly hard to
break up the juice sacs.
2. Cut the citrus fruit in half width-wise.
3. Holding one half in one hand, stick the tines of a fork into the fruit
pulp and squeeze the fruit.
Twist the fork as needed to release as much juice as possible.
Juice your fruit over a separate bowl, not into other ingredients. Doing so
helps you catch any errant seeds that may try to sneak their way into your
delectable dishes.
Lemon and lime aren’t the only fruity flavors you can add to your salsas.
Check out the following yummy salsas featuring mango and pineapple.

T Warm Pineapple Salsa
Fruit salsa can be a terrific sauce for fish, veggies, or pita wedges. Or use it like a jam or
syrup to top biscuits, waffles, or pancakes. With cooked fruit salsa, you heat the ingredi-
ents until they almost become a glaze. Fruit salsa has a more syrupy consistency than a
tomato-based salsa. Experiment and enjoy.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
103
Chapter 7: Hors d’Oeuvres and First Courses: Off to a Good Start
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon slivered almonds
1 small onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons curry powder
16 ounces pineapple tidbits, drained
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon brown seedless raisins
1 In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the almonds and gently toss in
the oil.
2 Add the onion and cook until tender and until the almonds are golden brown.
3 Add the curry powder, pineapple, vinegar, salt, honey, and raisins. Bring the mixture to
a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the salsa from the heat and
serve warm.
Vary It! Try this recipe with canned mandarin oranges, apricots, or peaches instead of the
pineapple, depending on your accompaniments and your taste buds on a given day. But be
sure to avoid fruit packed in heavy syrup.

Discovering Delicious Dips
Dips don’t have to be fat-laden creamy concoctions that add inches to your
waistline and bags to your saddle. With a little creativity, you can create deli-
cious dips that keep you eating healthy and your glucose levels normal.

Whipping up dips with pantry staples
Dips are among the quickest and easiest (not to mention tastiest!) appetizers
around. Keep your pantry and fridge stocked with a few dip-making essen-
tials and you’ll never be stuck wondering what to whip up when unexpected
guests stop by.
Here are our best bets for quick dip-making essentials to keep on hand:
 Any of the ingredients listed under “Stocking essentials for scrump-
tious salsas,” earlier in this chapter: Adding any of the salsa ingredients
to any of the items in this list makes for a terrific dip. In fact, one of our
favorite quick dips blends a can of black beans (rinsed and drained, of
course) with 1⁄2 cup of salsa. Whip the mixture in a food processor, and
you have an instant party treat.
 Beans: Puréed beans make a great base for a dip, and they’re high in
fiber and low in fat. Blend them in a food processor and season them
with your favorite spices. Look for fat-free, low-sodium canned beans,
and try cannellini beans, black beans, pinto beans, black-eyed peas, gar-
banzo beans, great Northern beans, navy beans, and kidney beans.
Unless a recipe says otherwise, rinse and drain canned beans before
adding them to a dip. Often, the liquid they’re canned in is salty or fla-
vored in some way. Rinse and drain and season them your way.
 Fancy olives: Olives impart great flavor and texture to dips. Use some of
the olive juice to blend into the dip, too. If olives perk up a martini, just
think what they can do for some ho-hum dips!
 Fresh herbs: Fresh herbs make an instant impression on an otherwise
bland dip base. Dill, basil, and cilantro are excellent choices for keeping
on hand.
 Lowfat sour cream: Use sour cream to add a little body and creamy tex-
ture to your dips.
 Plain yogurt: This staple is a natural partner to fresh herbs and a touch
of lemon juice. Keep it handy to mix in a soon-to-be bean dip.
 Spice blends: Look for prepackaged, salt-free spice blends. These
healthy spices can take the guesswork out of seasoning.

Choosing healthy dippers
What’s a good dip without something to dip into it? Rather than ruining all
your hard work of choosing healthy dips by dipping fried chips into them, we
offer you the following alternatives to keep you moving in the right direction:
 Bagel chips: Look for these chips in the specialty bread section of your
grocery store, but read the label because some are high in fat and
sodium. You also can make your own by slicing off slivers of a bagel and
then baking them until they’re crisp.
 Fresh veggies: Choose broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, carrot sticks,
celery sticks, zucchini slices, red pepper spears, endive scoops, or any
of your favorites. Any veggie can be a dip delivery system.
 Pita wedges: Make your own by quartering pitas and then baking them
until they’re crisp.
 Whole-wheat crackers: Kashi makes a line called TLC, Tasty Little
Crackers, made with whole-grain flour from seven different grains. Ry-
Krisp is a filling and tasty choice as well.
 Yucca chips: This root vegetable has great health benefits. Check out
the following recipe.

T Yucca Chips
Yucca is a root vegetable very similar to the potato. It has lots of good fiber and can be
substituted for potatoes in soups and stews. Enjoy these chips as a healthy snack
instead of potato chips.

Is yucca for you?
Yucca, which is pronounced YOO-ka, not YUCK-
ka, is more commonly known in the United
States as cassava, the Spanish term for this root
vegetable. If you’ve ever eaten tapioca, you’ve
eaten yucca, the source of that thickener. The
taste can be sweet, buttery, and nicely bland.
The texture is waxy and sticky. Yucca may be an
acquired taste for most people in the United
States, but much of the world relishes it. The
vegetable finds a home in the native soups and
stews of a wide range of countries, including
Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, Puerto Rico,
and in East Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific.
Yucca are shaped like long, narrow sweet pota-
toes. The outside is rough and brown and looks
like bark. Inside, the flesh is dense, hard, and
white. Yucca is available year-round in Hispanic
markets and in supermarkets in cities that have
sizeable Hispanic populations. Look for yucca
that is as completely covered with bark as pos-
sible. Avoid those that have any sliminess or
mold or hairline cracks, which indicate dryness.
Yucca should smell clean and fresh. Ask the
produce person to cut open a yucca to check
for freshness. You shouldn’t see any darkening
near the skin.
Yucca spoils rapidly, so use up the amount
you’ve bought at one time. You can store it in the
refrigerator before peeling it, but for no more
than four days. Yucca also freezes well. Peeled
and cut into chunks, yucca can be kept frozen
for several months.
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 large yucca, peeled and cut into wedges
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 In a small bowl, combine the salt and pepper. In a large bowl, coat the yucca wedges
with the olive oil and then toss them with the salt and pepper.

3 Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray and arrange the wedges on the sheet. Bake
about 45 minutes, or until the yucca wedges are cooked through and lightly browned.

Soup, Beautiful Soup
In This Chapter
 Beginning with the basics of soup
 Putting stock and other essential supplies to good use
 Cutting out the cream, but keeping the flavor
 Using cold soups as great transitions and sweet endings
S
oups might be the ultimate comfort food. Who
doesn’t feel better (even with a cold) with a
bowl of warm chicken soup? And you can choose
a soup for every occasion. No matter what the
weather, the state of your health, or who’s coming
for dinner, we have a soup for you.
In this chapter, we get you started with the basics
of making soup, taking you through the steps to
make sure your soups turn out just right. We give
you the scoop on different types of stocks, provide tips on watching your salt
intake, and help you get your pantry stocked for soup making. We give you tips
on making healthful, creamy soups full of flavor, but low in fat. And finally, we
help you make delicious soups to serve cold on warm summer days.
Understanding Soup-Making Basics
In many soup recipes, the first few steps ask you to sauté some vegetables to
bring out their flavor and soften them. Typically, you start by cooking a com-
bination of vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and celery, along with herbs
and spices, in a small amount of fat.
You may sauté your veggies in a small amount of lowfat cooking spray oil or
butter, or even a bit of fatty smoked meat such as bacon. You may also brown
ground meats or cubed meats at this stage. As the ingredients cook, they
begin to turn brown and caramelize, developing a rich and complex flavor.

Next, you add liquid, perhaps some vegetable broth, chicken or beef broth,
milk, wine, or water. First, add just a half-cup or so of liquid to deglaze the
pot. During this procedure, you can use a wooden spoon and gently dislodge
any bits of caramelized vegetables stuck to the bottom of the pot. You want
these flavorful morsels to blend in with the other flavors of the soup. Pour in
the remaining liquid.
In the final, and longest, steps of cooking, you place all vegetable chunks,
beans, grains, or meats, in the simmering liquid and cook to perfection. But
not everything cooks at the same rate, so use Table 8-1 to help you decide
when to add ingredients.

Serving Up Soups with Stocks 
and Other Essentials
You can begin a soup using water, but making a soup with real depth of flavor
calls for stock. Basically, a stock is a liquid in which solid ingredients, such as
chicken meat and bones, vegetables, and spices, are cooked and then usually
strained out. The flavors of these ingredients end up in the final broth.
Look for stock bases, the secret ingredient of many a restaurant, near the
bouillon and broth in your grocery store. Usually sold in one-pound contain-
ers, you can make up to five gallons of stock from a single container. Keeping
a container of base in the fridge is more convenient than keeping five gallons
of canned broth in your pantry.
Watching out for salt in stock-based soups
Most markets carry various brands of chicken and beef broth that offer good
flavor. These products are adequate for making everyday soups and are well
worth keeping on hand. Always choose the low-sodium versions to use as
stock and then add more salt to your soup as necessary.
If your physician or dietitian has given you any instructions at all about watch-
ing your salt, you’ve probably been told about the high sodium content of
canned soup. You may be on a standard 3,000-milligrams-a-day regimen, rec-
ommended for most individuals, or a 2,000-milligrams-a-day sodium-restricted
diet. Table 8-2 shows some sample amounts of the milligrams of sodium in a
single serving of some common soups.

For another low-salt stock alternative, you can make a basic vegetable stock
by simmering together aromatic vegetables like onion and celery with carrots,
which add sweetness, plus some parsley and a bay leaf. You need to cook this
mixture for only about 20 minutes.
The classical combination of vegetables (onions, celery, and carrots) is called
mirepoix (pronounced meer-pwa). It’s a basic beginning for many soups and
stocks. When you’re chopping mirepoix for stocks, you can roughly chop the
vegetables and even skip the peeling if you prefer. But when getting the veg-
gies ready for soups, take the time to prep them as the recipe suggests.
Add strong-flavored vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, and asparagus, with
caution, or they’ll overpower the other ingredients. Instead, make a basic stock
and add strong-flavored vegetables as you need them for a certain soup.
The following recipe takes advantage of low-sodium chicken broth as stock
but is still full of great flavor.
Potato-Leek Soup
This soup is great basic comfort food. Leeks (which look sort of like overgrown green
onions) must be sliced and then soaked and washed thoroughly to remove dirt and
sand deep down in the bulb. Check out Figure 8-1 to see how to cut up leek. Swish sliced
leeks around in a bowl of cold water. Soak them for a few minutes until the dirt and grit
settle to the bottom of the bowl. Lift the leeks out of the water and drain on a paper
towel. Repeat the procedure again with fresh water.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes

1 Coat a large pot with cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Add the
leeks. Sauté until soft and translucent.
2 Add the potatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes,
until the potatoes are cooked. Add the pepper and salt. Continue to simmer for 2 min-
utes. Remove from the heat.
3 Place half of contents of the pot into a blender, cover, and process until smooth.
4 Carefully pour the blender mixture back into the pot with the remaining broth and pota-
toes. Stir together with a wire whisk. Bring back to a simmer.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans sug-
gest at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure ade-
quate intake of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Enjoying a bowl of vegetable
soup such as the following recipe is a delicious way to meet your quota.

Classic: Hearty Vegetable Soup
When you prepare vegetable soup, first add the items that require longer cooking (such
as beets and carrots) and later add quick-cooking ingredients (such as spinach and
tomatoes). You’ll have all your vegetables just where you want them, done to perfection
when your soup is finished. However, this procedure does require your time and atten-
tion. Another way to make sure that all the vegetables finish cooking about the same
time is to cut the longer-cooking ones (such as potatoes) into smaller pieces and the
faster-cooking types (such as squash) into larger chunks.

1 Choose a large pot with a tightly fitting lid. Coat the pot with the nonstick spray and cook,
stirring constantly, the onions, celery, and carrots until the onions are translucent —
about 5 to 7 minutes. You can spray the pot with additional cooking spray or add a little
stock or water if the vegetables begin to stick or burn. Add the yucca, tomatoes, zucchini,
bay leaf, thyme, oregano, chicken broth, and white pepper and stir to combine.
2 Bring the vegetable soup to a boil over high heat, uncovered, and then simmer, covered,
for 20 minutes.
3 Remove the bay leaf and serve immediately as a light lunch or mini meal.
Note: Adding salt is optional, but it does increase the sodium level.

Keeping soup supplies in your pantry
Different types of stocks aren’t the only items you need to have close by
when you’re craving soup. Keep the following ingredients in your pantry for
an impromptu soup-making session:
 Canned evaporated milk: Use this item in your creamy soup recipes,
such as the Creamy Veggie Lover’s Soup later in this chapter. Evaporated
milk is not the same as sweetened condensed milk (a syrupy milk-based
concoction with lots of sugar added.). Evaporated milk is milk from which
60 percent of the water has been removed. It’s concentrated, so it can
enhance the flavor of soups and other dishes.
Choose regular evaporated milk rather than evaporated skim milk for
soups and sauces. Evaporated skim milk has a tendency to curdle and
break when heated. If you still want to save the calories, purée the soup
with the skim milk before serving.
 Canned legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas: They’re a great
source of fiber and protein, but the dried variety can take some time to
prepare. So have the canned variety available, to toss in a soup pot in a
pinch. Get started using these hearty staples in the Indian-Inspired Lamb
and Legume Chili later in this chapter.
Always drain and rinse the liquid in canned beans and vegetables unless
the recipe specifies otherwise. This step removes excess sodium, allow-
ing you to season your soup to your preferred taste.
 Canned tomatoes: Diced, crushed, whole, or stewed, any of these toma-
toes products can make for a quick soup.
 Dried herbs and spices: Oregano, basil, pepper, salt, dill, and just about
anything in your spice cabinet can work into a soup recipe.
 Dried mushrooms: Rehydrate them in hot water, steep them for about
30 minutes, and then strain the liquid to remove any grit. Roughly chop
the mushrooms and add the strained liquid for an extra punch of flavor.
 Garlic: Garlic adds an amazing flavor to just about anything. You can
roast it, sauté it, and purée it, whatever works for your soup. It’s great in
creamy soups, tomato-based soups, or brothy soups. (Not intended for
any visiting vampires eating soup, and don’t forget the breath mints.)
 Grains: Rice, pasta, and barley are great choices to make a soup heartier.
Just make sure to count the right starch exchanges for the amount you
add to your soup. Check out Chapter 10 for the full story on cooking with
grains.
117
Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup

 Olive oil: This terrific monounsaturated fat can help make an already
nutritious soup heart healthy, too. Keep some on hand at all times.
 Onions: These fragrant bulbs add their terrific flavor and aroma to any-
thing you cook.
 Potatoes: These starchy veggies cook up quickly and can add body to
your soups. Choose them for puréed soups as they help thicken soups
almost instantly, like in the Potato-Leek Soup earlier in this chapter.
 Salt-free seasoning mixes: If you have trouble with high blood pressure,
you probably need to steer clear of salt as much as possible. Salt-free
seasoning blends can give you many delicious flavor combinations and
take the guesswork out of seasoning your soups.
The following recipe features both a low-sodium vegetable stock as its base
as well as several of these handy pantry essentials.
Pea Soup with Crabmeat 
and Truffle Oil
Chef Didier Labbe from the Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A)
contributed this delicious recipe. Pea soup is one of those comfort foods known well
and welcomed come wintertime. This one is different from the traditional version,
though, but just as good — and better for you! Virtually no fat is added to this soup
during the entire cooking process, so it remains healthy for your heart. The peas
increase the fiber to a good level, and the crabmeat rounds out this dish with some lean
protein, making it a complete meal. Remember that the crab already has a good amount
of salt, so you don’t need to add much more.
Preparation time: 21⁄2 hours
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
2 onions, diced
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 russet potatoes, peeled and diced
8 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
Salt and pepper
1 pound cooked peas
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pound fresh crabmeat, picked and cleaned
1 teaspoon truffle oil (optional)
1 In a large soup kettle, sauté the onion in the olive oil for 1 minute and add the potatoes.
Cover with the vegetable broth, add the salt and pepper to taste, and cook on low heat
for 30 minutes.

2 Remove the kettle from the heat and set it aside to cool, about 1 to 2 hours.
3 When the soup has cooled, add the cooked peas. Place the mixture in a food processor
or blender and pulse several times (can be done in batches). Strain the mixture through
a colander.
4 In the soup kettle over medium heat, reheat the thickened soup and add the nutmeg.
Ladle it into serving bowls. Heat the crabmeat in a warmed skillet, until you take the
chill off it, approximately 3 minutes. Drizzle some truffle oil over each dish (if desired)
and place 1⁄4 pound of crabmeat into each soup bowl.

Soups are part of every cuisine. And virtually any soup can get a little ethnic
flavor by changing the spices and seasonings (all of which are found in most
kitchens). In the next recipe, the garam masala, a traditional Indian spice
blend, gives this chili a taste of India. You can find this tasty spice blend in
the spice section of most grocery stores now. If you want to change the fla-
vors to match another culture’s cuisine, change the seasonings.
Try these few ideas to substitute for the garam masala, changing the flavor,
but keeping the basic recipe.
 Chinese five-spice powder, ground ginger, and a touch of sesame oil
stirred in at the end of cooking, for a Chinese-inspired chili
 Chili powder and cayenne, for a traditional Southwestern chili
 Cinnamon, for a Cincinnati-style chili
 Basil, marjoram, oregano, thyme, and rosemary, for a taste of Italy
 Thyme, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, garlic, and onions, for a little
Jamaican jerk flavor
 Cumin, coriander seed, and cloves, for a taste of North Africa

Indian-Inspired Lamb 
and Legume Chili
This recipe, from food writer Heather Dismore, is an easy one-pot meal that’s full of good
nutritional benefits. The beans are a wonderful source of dietary fiber, and in this recipe,
they meet about a third of your daily fiber needs. Increased fiber can help with blood sugar
control as well as enhance satiety, keeping you fuller for longer. Lamb is a good source of
iron and vitamin B12, which can both help prevent and improve anemia. Lamb tends to be
a high-fat meat, however, so be sure to drain the fat during the cooking process.

1 Combine the lamb, onion, and garlic in a large stockpot. Cook over medium heat until
the lamb is browned and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Stir as needed. Drain in a colander
to remove excess fat. Return drained meat mixture to the stockpot.
2 Stir in the tomatoes, wine, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, and chiles. Bring to a
boil. Cover, reduce heat, and cook 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
3 Stir in the black beans, lentils, and chickpeas. Simmer an additional 30 minutes. Serve
immediately.

Creating Creamy Concoctions
Who doesn’t love a delicious creamy soup? But as you probably know putting
cream in soups adds calories and saturated fat, neither of which are very
good for a diabetic diet. If you can’t get enough of creamy soups, we have
11⁄2 pounds lean ground lamb
1 cup chopped red onion
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 cans (141⁄2 ounces each) no-
salt-added diced tomatoes,
undrained
1 cup dry red wine
1 tablespoon chili powder
11⁄2 teaspoons ground
coriander
11⁄2 teaspoons garam masala
1⁄4 cup serrano chiles, seeded
and minced (about 2 chiles)
1 can (15 ounces) black
beans, drained and rinsed
1 can (15 ounces) lentils,
drained and rinsed
1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas,
drained and rinsed

some good news. You can have a great creamy texture — without the stuff
you don’t need.
One great way to get the creamy texture without the bad stuff is to substitute
2 percent milk for cream in your favorite soups. It gives you plenty of the
creaminess and mouth feel you expect because it does have some fat and
body, but it cuts the fat grams and calories. Try this great alternative in the
following soup recipe.
T Cauliflower-Parmesan Soup
This recipe comes from Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A). This soup is warm, hearty,
and perfect for a cool day. We substitute 2 percent milk, which has just enough fat to pre-
vent curdling, in place of cream. The 2 percent milk has reduced this soup’s fat content by
nearly 50 percent. Remember to always try to use a lowfat version of dairy products.
This dish is reminiscent of a creamy potato soup, with far fewer calories and starch.
Cauliflower, a cruciferous vegetable high in vitamin C and fiber, can be a great substi-
tute for potatoes in many traditional recipes. Try using cauliflower next time you are
about to whip up a batch of mashed potatoes. You may be pleasantly surprised not only
with the taste but also with the modest effect this dish has on your blood sugar.

1 In a large pot, place the cauliflower, shallots, and milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
to a simmer until the cauliflower is tender, about 35 minutes.
2 Transfer to a blender and purée until smooth (always be extra careful when blending
hot liquids), or use a rotary beater to achieve a smooth consistency. While the soup is
blending, add the cheese and process until smooth. Finish by adding the lemon juice,
honey, salt, and pepper.

Soups are a great way to work in your veggies. Use soups as a way to try out
a new veggie. The following list includes some terrific veggies that you may
not be familiar with that make excellent soup add-ins:
 Beets
 Celeriac (or celery root)
 Greens (spinach, cabbage, and bok choy among others)
 Herbs (chervil, dill, and cilantro, or whatever you want)
 Mushrooms (exotics, such as morels, chanterelle, and wild mushroom
blends)
 Parsnips
 Squash (chayote, acorn, or butternut)
 Sweet potatoes
 Turnips
Try sweet potatoes in the following creamy soup. If they’re not already in
your regular rotation, they soon will be.
T Corn and Sweet Potato Chowder
Chef Christopher Prosperi from Metro Bis in Simsbury, Connecticut (see Appendix A),
offers this dish. It’s a chowder perfect for the early days of fall when it’s just cool
enough for a little something warm. This chowder (shown in the color section) is a
nutritional powerhouse, rich in antioxidants, vitamin A, fiber, and protein. Enjoy it with
dinner or, better yet, as a meal in itself!

Creamy Veggie Lover’s Soup
How could you go wrong with veggies? Heather Dismore contributes this soup full of
nutritional benefits. And it’s super tasty too. One serving provides more than 100 per-
cent of your daily vitamin C needs, more than half of your vitamin A needs, and more
than 25 percent of your potassium, calcium, and vitamin D needs — also great for bone
health! It’s also a tremendous source of beta carotene and lycopene. Enjoy this dish by

Choosing Chilled Soups
Chilled soups are great appetizers, light lunches, or even desserts. You can
choose any taste (sweet, spicy, savory) or ethnic flavor profile (Latin, Polish,
French, you name it), and there’s probably a chilled soup to match. Because
you serve them cold, they’re great to serve all summer long.
Don’t feel like you need to wait for a special occasion to serve these chilled
soups. They’re so easy that you can serve them any time.
Cooling off with veggies
Get started with chilled soups by trying this easy Chilled Cucumber Soup.
Spice it up as you see fit. Substitute fresh mint or cilantro for the dill to
change the flavor.

T Classic: Chilled Cucumber Soup
Make cucumber soup even more refreshing by adding naturally tart yogurt. Yogurt, plus
the nonfat sour cream in this recipe, makes this soup a substantial and satisfying starter

Focusing on fruit
Fruit soups are among the most popular chilled soups, probably because
people often eat fruit cold. So puréeing it first and then eating it isn’t a
stretch. Fruit soup recipes aren’t always that simple, but they’re not much

tougher. Try cooking fruit soups with that classic blend of strawberries and
rhubarb in this next recipe. Watermelon is the star of the other recipe in this
section.
T Rhubarb Soup with 
Fresh Strawberries
When most people think of rhubarb, not much comes to mind, except for rhubarb pie —
and for most people, even that thought rarely occurs! Chef Didier Labbe from the
Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A) has offered a chilled rhubarb
soup recipe for your cooking pleasure. (See the soup in the color section.) This one is a
keeper — not only because it’s delicious, interesting, and different, but also because it
packs in more than 100 percent of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C in just
one serving! The original recipe calls for sugar to sweeten things up, but we substitute
Splenda, and you’d never know the difference.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
127
Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup
1 pound rhubarb, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch-
thick slices
1⁄4 cup Splenda
1 pound strawberries, cleaned and sliced
1 cup water
Juice of 1⁄2 lemon
6 mint leaves, julienned
1 In a large mixing bowl, combine the rhubarb and Splenda and mix well. Set the bowl aside.
2 In a saucepan, combine the strawberries, water, and lemon juice. Cover and boil for 5 to
6 minutes. Using a colander, strain the strawberries to obtain just the juice. Discard
the pulp.
3 Pour the strawberry juice back into the saucepan and add the rhubarb-and-Splenda
mixture. Boil for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and store the soup in the
refrigerator until it’s cold. Serve the soup chilled with the mint leaves as a garnish.
Tip: Because rhubarb is seasonal, you may need to use the frozen kind, which already
comes in pieces.

T Watermelon Gazpacho
Kyle Ketchum, from Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), delights with this warm
weather treat. Just when the dog days of summer really start getting to you, try this
refreshing gazpacho. (Gazpacho is a fancy word for a cold, uncooked soup.) This one
takes advantage of the watermelon, one of the season’s most popular fruits and a sur-
prising twist on the usual summertime snack. Not only is this soup cool and invigorating,
but it’s also full of good nutrition. Watermelons are a great source of the antioxidants
lycopene, beta carotene, and vitamin C, as well as vitamin A. This soup is quite low in
calories, a good thing for your waistline. But before you go for a second scoop, remem-
ber that fruit has sugar and should be eaten in moderate amounts.

1 cup thinly sliced cucumbers
1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt
6 cups cubed and seeded watermelon (from
about a 3-pound seedless watermelon)
1⁄2 cup cranberry juice
1⁄2 cup small diced red bell pepper
1⁄2 cup small diced red onion
1⁄2 cup small diced celery
1⁄4 cup finely chopped parsley
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
2 tablespoons lime juice
8 each fresh mint leaves, chiffonade (see
Chapter 9 for an explanation of chiffonade)
1 In a small bowl, toss the cucumbers with the salt.
2 In a blender, add the watermelon and cranberry juice. Pulse until just blended. (Over-

Picking fresh greens at the store
When you go shopping, consider picking up some of these types of greens:
 Arugula
 Boston butter lettuce
 Endive
 Escarole
 Frisée
 Radicchio
 Red leaf lettuce
 Romaine
 Spinach
 Swiss chard
 Watercress
Store your salad greens in the vegetable bin of your fridge. Store romaine and
radicchio with the head intact because the outer leaves keep the inner leaves
moist. However, loose-leaf lettuce, like arugula and spinach, has a shorter
shelf life. To store this type of lettuce, remove the leaves and wash and drain
them. Gather and wrap them in a clean, damp paper towel or two and then
store in a plastic bag. The leaves will stay fresh for a couple days, but not
much longer.

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously

T Panzanella
“Panzanella” is a traditional Italian bread salad. This version comes from Christopher
Prosperi from Metro Bis in Simsbury, Connecticut (see Appendix A). This dish offers
all the classic Mediterranean ingredients — and is a light and fresh dish perfect on a
summer day. Use vine-ripened tomatoes from your local farmers market or, better yet,
grow them in your own vegetable garden. Either way, this salad offers great nutrition,
from the antioxidant-rich tomatoes to the olive oil’s heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
132
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons capers
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
6 large basil leaves
1 cup olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
Salad:
2 cups chopped tomatoes (1-inch cubes)
2 cups croutons
1⁄2 cup thinly sliced red onion
12 large basil leaves, chopped
1⁄2 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 tablespoons capers (optional)
8 to 12 tablespoons dressing
1 head romaine heart, sliced thinly
Dressing:
1 To make the dressing, place the garlic, Dijon mustard, capers, Worcestershire sauce,
balsamic vinegar, and basil leaves in a blender.
2 While the blender is running, drizzle the oil in a slow steady stream. Season with pepper
and reserve. The dressing keeps for up to 1 week in the refrigerator.
3 In a large mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes, croutons, red onion, basil, feta cheese,
and capers, if desired. Toss with 4 tablespoons dressing and taste. Add more dressing if
necessary, up to 6 tablespoons.
4 Arrange the romaine lettuce on the bottom of a large platter. Top with tossed panzanella
and serve.

T Fresh Mushroom Salad
This dish from Barbetta in New York City (see Appendix A) truly glorifies the 
mushroom — and the praise is well-deserved. Mushrooms are a popular and versatile
vegetable with numerous health benefits. They’re a great source of dietary fiber as well
as many of the B vitamins, which can help support good energy levels.
Restaurant owner Laura Maioglio says that this salad, traditionally of Piemonte, Italy, is
made with wild porcini mushrooms and white truffles. If you can’t obtain fresh porcini,
cultivated cremini mushrooms still give you a delicious salad. During truffle season at
Barbetta, the salad is served with white truffles hunted by the restaurant’s own truffle
hounds! Drizzled on top of the mushrooms is the quite luxurious porcini olive oil in which
porcini mushrooms steep their flavor into the oil as they sit together. Making your own
olive oil can save you money because it costs a bundle in the specialty food stores!
Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus several days for steeping the olive oil
Yield: 4 servings
133
Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
1 quart extra-virgin olive oil
10 ounces fresh porcini mushrooms
1 bunch Lolla Rossa lettuce (or substitute red
leaf lettuce)
1 bunch oak leaf lettuce
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt and pepper
1 Prepare your own porcini olive oil by steeping the dried porcini mushrooms in the olive
oil. Let stand a few days for the oil to acquire the flavor of the mushrooms. Save the oil
you don’t need in this recipe for future use to give any number of dishes a fabulous taste.
2 Put 8 mushrooms aside and slice the remaining mushrooms very thin.
3 On 4 medium-size plates, place a few leaves of Lolla Rossa over a few oak leaf lettuce
leaves. Place 1 whole mushroom on either side of the lettuce leaves to look as if the
mushrooms are growing between the lettuce leaves. Place the sliced mushrooms in the
remaining space on the plate.
4 Drizzle the porcini olive oil and lemon juice over the mushrooms and lettuce, and salt
and pepper to taste.
Tip: Drizzle your extra porcini olive oil on steamed or roasted veggies, add a touch of it to
risotto during the final stages of cooking, or use it to give a punch of flavor to a marinade.

T Watercress Salad
During the summer months, take advantage of all the fresh, seasonal produce that is
available. Forget about using iceberg lettuce, which offers nearly nothing in the way of
good nutrition. Watercress, on the other hand, is a deep green leafy lettuce that has lots
of vitamin A and beta carotene, which is great for eye health. This green leafy vegetable
also happens to give you nearly one-fourth of your daily need of calcium, so eat ’em up
for your bones.
We limit the amount of Gorgonzola cheese in this dish, courtesy of Derek’s Bistro in
Pasadena, California (see Appendix A), in order to keep the calorie and fat levels at an
appropriate level. Gorgonzola, however is a great cheese to use because it lends lots of
good flavor in a small amount. Try sticking with sharper cheeses like this one, Parmesan,
or cheddar instead of the milder ones — you’ll need less and get more flavor!
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Vinaigrette dressing:
1⁄2 onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1⁄4 cup canola oil
1⁄4 cup sherry vinegar
Salt and pepper
Salad:
2 small Granny Smith apples
8 cups watercress, rinsed, destemmed and
patted dry (purchase ready-to-use
watercress if time is limited)
4 ounces Gorgonzola blue cheese, crumbled
1⁄2 cup roasted pecans (see the tip at the end
of the recipe)
1 To prepare the vinaigrette, place the onion, thyme, and oregano into a large bowl. Add
the canola oil and sherry vinegar. Whisk the mixture together until everything is well
combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.
2 Prepare the apples just before ready to serve to maintain their freshness and color.
Leaving the skin on, slice the apples in half and core them. Julienne (slice into long
strips) the cored apples.
3 Place the watercress in a large bowl and add the dressing. (You may not need all the
dressing, so add carefully to taste). Dish onto four plates and sprinkle the blue cheese
and pecans over the greens. Arrange the apples on top and serve.

Tip: To prepare the roasted pecans, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place a piece of
parchment paper on a baking sheet and spread out the pecans in one even layer. Sprinkle
with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake for 10 minutes and then remove from the baking sheet. Set
aside to cool.

Boning up on bagged salad blends
Fortunately, produce manufacturers are taking convenience foods to a
healthy level for a change. Look in your produce section for prewashed,
ready-to-use salad greens and blends. You can open a bag and have a deli-
cious meal in a matter of minutes. For super easy and quick salads, pick up
prewashed salad blends like these:
 American blend: This familiar blend usually includes iceberg lettuce,
carrot shreds, radish slices, and red cabbage.
 European blend: It’s a great mix to try if your salad experience stops at
iceberg lettuce. It includes mild green leaf lettuce, romaine, iceberg, curly
endive, and a bit of radicchio. It goes well with just about any dressing,
toasted nuts, and any kind of cheese, including blue cheese and goat
cheese.
 Italian blend: This blend is terrific for simple protein-based salads, light
Caesar dressing, or a traditional Italian vinaigrette. It usually consists of
a blend of romaine and radicchio.
 Spring mix: This tasty mixture is a staple at most fine restaurants. It’s
usually a blend of baby greens that include baby spinach, radicchio, and
frisée. It may also be called mesclun, spring greens, or field greens. It
makes a gorgeous garnish or bed for serving fresh fish or steak.
Different manufacturers call different mixes by different trademarked names.
Many blends also include other veggies, like radishes, carrots, and even snow
peas. All blends should include a description or listing of the greens (and
other tasty veggies) included in their package, so find what suits your fancy
and get munching!
135
Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously

Although these salad greens blends are great, many manufacturers also sell
salad kits, which include the salad greens, dressing, cheese, and croutons.
Watch the fat and unnecessary calories that these convenience kits can pro-
vide. And remember, you don’t have to eat it just because it comes in the kit.
Feel free to toss that full-fat Caesar dressing in the trash.
Growing your own greens
Growing fresh baby greens is incredibly simple, no matter where you live.
Their shallow root systems make them ideal for indoor gardening. All you
need is a shallow bowl or planter, high-quality potting soil, lettuce seeds, and
a nice sunny window.
Here’s how you do it:
1. Fill a shallow container that has good drainage with high-quality pot-
ting soil.
2. Gently press seeds into the soil.
Because you’ll be harvesting your baby greens when they’re, well, babies,
you don’t need to space out the seeds. Go ahead and just sprinkle them
around rather than make nice neat rows.
3. Water your seeds.
Keep the seeds moist but not soggy. Light but frequent watering produces
the best leafy greens.
4. Set the container in a sunny window.
Most greens germinate, or sprout seeds, within a few weeks. Feel free to
start harvesting when the greens are a few inches tall. Just trim off what
you need with kitchen shears.
To keep a constant supply of greens on hand, sow a second container two
weeks later. Use a mixture of different seeds to create your own spring mix.
For more information on growing lettuce or other vegetables in containers,
check out Container Gardening For Dummies, by Bill Marken and the editors
of the National Gardening Association, published by Wiley.
Creating sensational homemade dressings
Until very recently, bottled salad dressings didn’t offer much in the way of
flavor unless they were full of fat, salt, sugar, and other no-nos for a diabetic
diet. Some of the newer light dressings have improved flavor, are less detri-
mental to your health, and are convenient. But there’s really no substitute for
making dressings yourself. And believe it or not, the process is pretty simple.
136
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 

To make basic diabetic-friendly vinaigrette, follow these steps:
1. Measure equal parts oil (usually extra-virgin olive oil), acid (like bal-
samic vinegar or lemon juice), and stock (like low-sodium chicken
stock) and whisk them together.
2. Blend desired herbs and seasonings into the dressing and whisk some
more.
To add a truly professional touch, combine all your ingredients (except the oil)
in a food processor or blender. With the appliance running, slowly pour the oil
into the other ingredients. The dressing will emulsify, or blend, really well.
T Truffle Vinaigrette
Chef Vitaly Paley from Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A), uses truffles
in this vinaigrette to create a truly luxurious, distinct flavor. Truffles are similar to mush-
rooms in that they’re actually a fungus — but don’t let that fool you; they’re simply won-
derful. You can find truffles at most fine food stores — they’re worth searching for. You
can drizzle this vinaigrette atop steamed vegetables or mixed greens. It contains no cho-
lesterol and only a trace of saturated fat — olive oil is one of those heart-healthy sources
of monounsaturated fat and can be beneficial for lowering cholesterol levels.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 18 to 20 servings (2 tablespoons per serving)

Often, a simple dressing is best. Steeping herbs, garlic, and dried mushrooms
in oil gives you an excellent base to make your own tasty dressings. Add a
little acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, and you’re on your way.

Going Beyond Greens with 
Tomatoes and Nuts
For many people, salad and lettuce are synonymous. While salad greens are
amazingly nutritious, it’s fun to try your hand at other salads that highlight
other terrific vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers. Flavor them up with
other extras, such as toasted nuts and freshly made dressings, and you have
a great alternative to a traditional salad. For another great salad without
greens, check out the Olive and Lentil Salad in Chapter 10.
T Summer Tomato Salad
Although summertime is great for vibrantly red, juicy, sweet tomatoes, you can enjoy
them year-round — and should! Tomatoes are packed with lycopene and beta carotene,
two antioxidants known for their disease-fighting capabilities. This dish, courtesy of
Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A) and shown in the color section, is
low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol but still remains intense in flavor from
the fresh basil and garlic. In all your cooking, try using fresh herbs and spices for flavor-
ing instead of high-fat spreads and salt.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

Salt and pepper to taste
Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and serve the salad at room temperature.
Tip: Try a combination of tomatoes in this salad to add color and flavor. Look for Green
Zebras, yellow teardrops, pear tomatoes, grape tomatoes, and everyone’s first favorite
tomato, the cherry. So many choices, so little time!

Nuts have an undeserved reputation for being fattening. Not so! In modera-
tion, nuts are an excellent source of fiber and monounsaturated fat, the good
fat. Plus, they provide you with long-lasting protein that helps to stabilize
your blood sugar.
Here’s a list of seeds and nuts to try in your next salad:
 Almonds
 Cashews
 Pecans
 Pine nuts
 Sunflower seeds
 Walnuts

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously
Flavoring salads with fresh herbs
Fresh herbs are an excellent addition to almost
anything, especially salad. Their robust flavors
can help you cut down the need for adding fat
and salt to your foods. You can mince herbs, but
some recipes, such as the one for Summer
Tomato Salad later in this chapter, call for herbs
to be chiffonade. Chiffonade literally means
“made of rags,” and it pretty well describes
what the final product looks like. Leafy lettuce
or herbs are rolled together tightly and then
thinly sliced width-wise to form long, stringy
strips.
Here are a few descriptions of our favorite salad
herbs.
 Basil: Technically a member of the mint
family, this herb has a sweet peppery flavor
that’s the cornerstone of most pestos. Look
for basil varieties like lemon basil and cin-
namon basil to spice up your everyday
salads.
 Cilantro: Use the tender stems and leaves
of this herb to give a pungent push to any
Latin- or Asian-inspired dishes. It pairs
extremely well with citrus flavors.
 Dill: The feathery leaves of this pungent
herb are the main ingredient in many a
salad dressing and fish sauce. It’s great
paired with citrus.
 Mint: Sometimes thought of as only the
dessert garnish, mint is used worldwide in
both sweet and savory dishes. It’s an
incredibly aromatic herb that can lend its
fragrance and flavor to salad dressings,
dips, condiments, and beverages.
 Parsley: Whether you prefer flat-leaf or
curly parsley, this herb is recognizable to
most people. The best way to describe its
flavor is fresh. Some people use it as a nat-
ural breath freshener. Chop it up and throw
it into your salad along with your greens to
brighten your salad’s flavor.

Whenever possible, toast nuts before adding them to any dish. The toasting
process really brings out the flavor of the nuts, making it much more satisfy-
ing to eat. Simply place them in a sauté pan over medium-high heat, shaking
them occasionally to ensure they don’t burn. They’re done when they
become fragrant and slightly darker in color.

T Cucumber-Tomato Salad with 
Tahini and Toasted Pine Nuts
Enjoy a taste of the Middle East in your home with this easy-to-prepare fresh cucumber
tomato salad, courtesy of Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A). The pine nuts and
olive oil both offer beneficial monounsaturated fats, which are protective for your
heart. Add all the cucumbers and tomatoes you want — they are full of fiber and fill you
up on fewer calories. The fat and protein from the feta and pine nuts will keep you satis-
fied until your next meal, and your blood sugars will barely notice a thing!
Preparation time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Tahini dressing:
Salad:
1 To make the dressing, combine the tahini paste, water, and garlic in a blender and
process until smooth.
2 Add the lemon juice and blend again until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add a little
more hot water — up to 1⁄4 cup. (The dressing should be thick, but not the consistency of
peanut butter). Season with salt and pepper to taste and set the dressing aside.
1⁄2 cup Middle Eastern tahini paste
1⁄4 cup hot water
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1⁄3 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
Salt and pepper
4 vine-ripened tomatoes, quartered
2 seedless cucumbers, peeled and medium
diced
1 cup flat-leaf parsley, washed and leaves
picked
1⁄2 cup crumbled feta cheese
4 sprigs fresh mint, chiffonade (the sidebar
“Flavoring salads with fresh herbs,” earlier in
this chapter, explains chiffonade)
1⁄2 cup toasted pine nuts
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper

3 To make the salad, in a large bowl combine the tomatoes, cucumbers, and parsley and
toss. Add the feta cheese.
4 Add the mint and pine nuts, toss with the olive oil and tahini dressing, and season with
salt and pepper to taste. Serve on salad plates.

Adding Fresh Fruit to Your Salad
Everyone knows how refreshing fruit salad can taste, made with three or four
of the season’s best crops. But in a diabetic diet, fruit, which is full of natural
and easily absorbed sugars, needs to be counted in the meal plan. How can
you still include the juicy pleasures of fruit in a diabetic diet? By creating
meals with small amounts of fruit and combining it with other foods, as in the
following Blood Orange, Avocado, and Fennel Salad. Blood oranges are com-
bined with crunchy licorice-flavored fennel, and the avocados and olive oil
add fat to balance the carbohydrates in the fruit.

T Blood Orange, Avocado, and 
Fennel Salad
This recipe creates a delicate salad of contrasts, offered by Christopher Lee from the
Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see Appendix A). It makes for beautiful pre-
sentation with the contrasting blood red oranges, green avocados, and white fennel
(Figure 9-2 shows what a fennel bulb looks like). All at once, the taste is crunchy and
soft, sweet and savory. Another thing that makes this recipe a winner: Avocados are
rich in monounsaturated fats, which, in moderation, offer heart-healthy benefits. You
can see this salad in the color section.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
4 blood oranges
1 teaspoon salt (or more to taste)
3 ripe Hass avocados
2 fennel bulbs
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 With a sharp knife, cut 1⁄4 inch off the top and bottom of each orange. Set the oranges on
a flat surface and remove the skin and pith in strips, following the curvature of the fruit.
Slice the oranges into 1⁄4-inch pieces. Lay the slices in a single layer on a large platter and
sprinkle them with salt.
2 Halve the avocados and remove the pits with a knife. Spoon out chunks of avocado,
season them with salt, and place them over the orange slices.
3 Remove the outer layers of the fennel and slice the bulbs thinly. Place the slices in a
large bowl and season them with salt. Pour the lemon juice over the fennel and drizzle
with the olive oil. Toss the fennel and place it over the orange slices.
4 Drizzle the lemon juice and olive oil remaining at the bottom of the bowl over the whole
salad. Serve immediately.

The typical Asian diet is getting a lot of attention in the media as being a
healthy one. In general, Asian populations tend to have less incidence of
heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Their diets tend to focus on seafood as
the main protein; plant-based foods, like soy products and rice, rather than
dairy products; and tons of vegetables. The following recipe gives you a
chance to sample the flavors of this healthful cuisine.

Punching up your salad with protein
Pairing salads and protein is a natural fit for a diabetic diet. Most of the meal
is actually made up of the healthy veggies, accented by a small but satisfying
portion of protein, the ideal ratio in a diabetic diet.
Canned legumes, like chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and kidney
beans, are an excellent and inexpensive way to make sure you’re getting
enough protein. Plus these protein powerhouses are cholesterol free, making
them an all-around excellent choice.

Crunchy Chicken Stir-Fry Salad
Here’s a great way to enjoy a chicken salad that’s not the same old greens-topped-with-
grilled-chicken-breast thing. It’s loaded with interesting veggies (like bok choy and snap
peas) and other tasty tidbits (like almonds) that give a terrific flavor and texture.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 tablespoon sesame oil
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
sliced into strips
1⁄2 cup baby carrots
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄8 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon sesame seeds
1⁄2 cup broccoli florets
1⁄4 cup celery, small sliced diagonally
1⁄2 cup snap peas
1 tablespoon low-sodium teriyaki sauce
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
1⁄2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup blanched and roughly chopped Chinese
bok choy (see Chapter 11 for info about
blanching)
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
1 Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil. Add the chicken strips, carrots,
and garlic powder. Sauté until the chicken is lightly browned (about 7 minutes). Add the
onion powder, white pepper, sesame seeds, broccoli, and celery. Cook and continue stir-
ring until the vegetables are soft.
2 Lower the heat and add the snap peas, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and chicken broth.
Continue stirring. Simmer until the liquid has reduced slightly.
3 Divide the bok choy between two plates. Spoon the chicken mixture over the bok choy.
Sprinkle the almonds on top.

Using leftovers to your advantage
“Leftovers” doesn’t have to be a dirty word. In
fact, think of them as a life simplification strat-
egy. When you’re marinating and grilling
chicken for dinner, double your recipe and
reserve the extra for quick salads later in the
week. Stop by the grocery on your way home
and get a fresh bag of greens, and your health-
ful dinner is in the bag.
Here’s a list of great leftovers that can make an
excellent next-day salad:
 Broiled sirloin steak
 Grilled chicken breast
 Cocktail shrimp
 Roasted turkey breast
 Pan-seared beef tenderloin
 Roasted pork tenderloin
Classic: Oriental Beef and 
Noodle Salad
If you have a craving for Chinese take-out, satisfy your hunger with this healthy, lowfat
version, full of Asian flavor. Using a minimum of meat with lots of vegetables is typical
of Chinese cooking. Although this style of cooking evolved by necessity, due to a
scarcity of meat, the result of this hardship was the creation of an exceptionally healthy
cuisine. A good example is this beef and noodle salad, made with lean meat and a mini-
mum of cooking oil.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 ounces thin spaghetti
4 teaspoons sesame oil
Nonstick cooking spray
1 pound boneless top sirloin steak, trimmed of
fat, cut 1 inch thick, and cut into slices about
1⁄4-inch thick
2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 clove garlic, minced
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro

1 Bring a large pot of water to boil. Salt the boiling water and cook the spaghetti accord-
ing to package directions, typically 5 to 6 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold running
water, and drain again. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with the sesame oil and set
aside.
2 Coat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium-
high heat until hot. Add the steak slices and cook until medium rare, about 1 minute per
side. Add the steak to the bowl with the pasta.
3 In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, mustard, ginger, garlic, and white
pepper. Add the green onions and red pepper and toss well. Add to the bowl with the
spaghetti and steak and toss well.
4 Divide among four serving plates, sprinkle with the cilantro, and serve.

 Experimenting with rice and other grains
 Including pasta in a diabetic diet
 Exploring the role of legumes in healthy eating
D
iabetics must watch their intake of carbohy-
drates because they directly impact blood
sugar levels. One big source of carbohydrates is
grains, one of the major categories of starch
exchanges for the diabetic. Grains form a part of
the food guide pyramid, the guide to healthy
eating from the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA). (See Chapter 2 for more about
the pyramid.) Talk to your doctor and dietitian
about the best choice for your health situation.
In this chapter, we show you how to include rice
and other grains in recipes and dishes to brighten
up any meal. We provide recipes and information
on using pasta as part of your daily regimen. And
finally, we give you the inside scoop on using legumes in so many ways that
you’re bound to find something new and tasty.
Relishing Rice and Other Grains
Grains are truly the food that changed the world. Cultivated by early farmers,
they helped our ancestors become settled, non-nomadic peoples, building
stable civilizations the world over. We owe a lot to these little packets of
nutrition, like rice and quinoa.

Eating rice the right way
Rice is a worldwide staple, but it often gets a bad reputation because so
many people eat the bland, processed white rice slathered with fat-heavy
sauces. Instead, try less processed, flavored rice that can stand on its own or
can be enhanced by a few simple seasonings or cooking techniques. And
always remember to eat in moderation. A single serving of rice is 1⁄3 cup and
represents 1 starch exchange.
Here are a few rice varieties that might be new to you with ideas on how to
use them:
 Arborio: It’s an Italian short- to medium-grained rice used in making
risotto. The rice gives off starches as it cooks to add to the creaminess
of this popular Italian dish. Try it for yourself in the recipe for Risotto
alle Erbe Made with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil in this section.
 Basmati: Its name means “queen of fragrance” for its distinct nutty
aroma during cooking. Its fragrance is enhanced as it’s aged after har-
vesting. True basmati rice is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas, but
a few new basmati-like varieties are grown in the United States under the
names Texmati and Kasmati.
 Brown: This rice has the whole rice grain intact, with only the inedible
outer husk removed. Because it has the bran coating intact, it’s higher in
fiber but has a shorter shelf life (around 6 months). Use it in any recipe
that calls for white rice, but give it a bit more time to cook (about 45
minutes). To get started with it, try the Middle Eastern Brown Rice Pilaf
in this section.
 Jasmine: Aromatic long-grain rice from Thailand, this rice is highly
prized but less expensive than basmati. Try it out in the Black Bean Pie
recipe later in this chapter.
 Long-grain: A broad category of rice, long-grain rice has long, evenly
shaped pieces that tend to be drier and less starchy than short-grained
varieties. Long-grain rice separates easily after cooking. Basmati, jas-
mine, and wild rice are all long-grain rice.
 Medium-grain: As the name implies, medium-grain rice is longer that
short-grain rice and shorter than long-grain rice.
 Short-grain: This rice has short, almost round grains and a higher starch
content than long-grain rice, giving it a sticky, clumpy consistency after
cooking.
 Wild rice: This “rice” is actually the grain of a wild marsh grass. It has a
chewy texture and nutty flavor. It’s often combined with other rice.

Middle Eastern Brown Rice Pilaf
Sometimes people complain that brown rice never seems to taste right or it just 
never achieves a good consistency. Here is a dish, contributed by food writer and 
For Dummies author Heather Dismore, that uses this whole grain and incorporates
many other textures and flavors that will leave you loving brown rice forever! This is a
good lesson in creativity and risk taking! Seek out new and different recipes that change
the flavors until you find one you like. If you hesitate to try brown rice again, try this
recipe before you swear off this healthy food forever.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
11⁄2 cups chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
2 carrots, sliced
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
3⁄4 cup uncooked brown rice
2 cups chicken broth
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh green onions
Salt and pepper
1 Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Sauté the
onions, stirring frequently until they soften. Add the garlic and carrots and continue
stirring for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and rice and cook until the mushrooms
soften, about 7 to 8 minutes.
2 Add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat. Continue cooking
until all the liquid is absorbed, approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Toss
with the green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

T Risotto alle Erbe Made with 
Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
Here is a wonderful risotto dish offered to us from Barbetta Restaurant in New York (see
Appendix A). Important to note is the importance of stirring the risotto constantly! This
is not a moment for TV watching or telephone answering! The risotto at the end should
be smooth and flowing, and once done, you must eat it immediately. This saying in Italy
tells the story: “You must wait for risotto, but risotto cannot wait for you.”
Making risotto with olive oil was first introduced by Barbetta Restaurant and certainly
is a healthy change from the traditional method, which calls for butter. Essentially,
risotto is made from Italian rice, and for people with diabetes, rice has falsely been
accused of being “bad” food. Too many carbs, and for that matter, too much of anything
is “bad,” but this risotto dish, served in moderation, can certainly be part of a balanced,
healthy diet. It’s absolutely delicious and worth every bite. Pair the risotto with some
protein, such as fish or poultry and fiber, from nonstarchy veggies, to keep your blood
sugars on an even keel.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (1 cup each)
1 bunch fresh sage
1 bunch fresh rosemary
1 bunch fresh parsley
1 bunch fresh basil
11⁄2 quarts water
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1⁄2 medium onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon salt
Pinch of pepper
1 cup Italian rice, Carnaroti or arborio
1 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 cup grated Parmigiano cheese
Salt and pepper
1 From the fresh sage, rosemary, parsley, and basil, chop enough in equal parts (roughly 
3 tablespoons) of each type of herb to make 3⁄4 cup. Set aside.
2 Using butcher’s twine, tie together one stem each of sage, rosemary, parsley, and basil
(once tied together, the herbs resemble a bouquet of flowers). Place the bouquet in a
saucepan with the 11⁄2 quarts of water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Allow the bou-
quet to steep for 30 minutes. Strain and keep warm. This will serve as your herb stock.
Bring stock back to a low simmer before adding to risotto in Step 5.
3 In a 3-quart saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.
4 Add the chopped onions, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Add the rice, wine, and
chopped herbs. Immediately stir and continue to stir every 15 seconds until the risotto
absorbs the wine. Keep the heat medium to high.
5 When the wine has evaporated, begin to add simmering stock 1⁄2 cup at time, stirring
continuously. Add a bit of salt and pepper depending on your taste. Once 1⁄2 cup of the
stock is absorbed and the rice looks dry, add another 1⁄2 cup. Repeat until you’ve added

roughly 3 to 4 cups of the herb stock, and the rice is soft but al dente, or firm to the
bite. If the rice tastes hard and starchy, continue adding stock. This step takes about 
25 to 30 minutes total. Note: You must continue to stir the risotto during this stage of
cooking. Stirring helps to bring out the starchy creaminess in the rice and ensures the
proper texture and consistency.
6 Once the risotto is cooked, its consistency should resemble thick oatmeal. Remove the
pot from the heat. Add the grated Parmigiano cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons
of oil. Stir very well. Allow to rest 2 minutes. Stir once more before serving. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.

Kicking it up with quinoa
Quinoa (pronounced KEEN-wa) is considered by some to be the most nutri-
tious of all the whole grains (see Figure 10-1). It isn’t a popular food, simply
because few people know of it, but it should be! Quinoa is high in protein and
fiber, provides 25 percent of your daily iron needs, and is a tremendous
source of magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. It is more nutritious than
white rice and in most dishes can be substituted for the more popular grain.
For optimal results, prepare 2 parts of this grain with 1 part low-sodium
broth, such as vegetable or chicken, for added flavor or when using as a side
dish like a stir-fry. It can even be served as a hot cereal for breakfast with
fresh berries.

Moroccan Quinoa
Moroccan spices, like turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon, combine with almonds and dried
fruits to give this quinoa a delicious North African flavor. Heather Dismore contributed
this recipe to keep your taste buds perky and your blood sugar stable. It’s a great way
to get started with quinoa if you haven’t already discovered this amazing grain.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup quinoa
1 cup water
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup diced red onion
1⁄2 teaspoon cumin
1⁄4 teaspoon turmeric
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
1⁄4 cup slivered almonds, toasted
1⁄4 cup raisins
Salt to taste
Fresh mint (optional)
1 Rinse the quinoa. Place the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer. Run cold water through the
grains until the water runs clear. Drain the water off, stir the grains around a bit, and
then rerinse to ensure you’ve removed all the bitter outer coating. Don’t be tempted to
skip this step. Even if your quinoa is processed, which removes much of the saponin¸ or
protective outer covering, the dust still remains. It can add a nasty bitter flavor to your
finished dish. Don’t risk it.
2 Place the rinsed quinoa, water, and chicken broth in a 11⁄2-quart saucepan and bring to a
boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until all of the water is absorbed (about 
15 minutes). Fluff with a fork. Set aside.
3 While the quinoa is cooking, heat the oil in a nonstick skillet. Sauté the onions until 
they begin to caramelize. Add the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and ginger, cooking until
fragrant. Stir in the almonds and raisins until heated.
4 Add the hot quinoa to the skillet. Toss to combine. Heat until the mixture is heated
through. Adjust salt if needed. Serve garnished with fresh mint, if desired.

Trying out barley
Barley is a whole grain that is a delicious side dish to serve with meats and
poultry. Try the following recipe to include some barley in your diet.
157
Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes
Classic: Barley Pilaf
Barley that still retains the bran takes a long time to cook, so manufacturers pearl the
barley, which means they remove the bran. Pearled barley is the kind you usually find in
supermarkets. Look for barley with grains that are oval, not round, a sign that the bran
is mostly intact. In comparison with rice and wheat, barley has significantly less effect
on blood glucose. Barley is also tasty added to soups.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 piece smoked ham hock, 6 ounces
2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch lengths
2 bay leaves
1⁄2 teaspoon dried sage
Pepper
4 cups water
1 tablespoon safflower oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup pearled barley
1 In a large pot, put the ham hock, celery, bay leaves, sage, pepper to taste, and water.
Over high heat, bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, for 
20 minutes. Volume of the broth will reduce by about 1 cup.
2 In a medium pot, heat the safflower oil over medium heat. Cook the onion, stirring occa-
sionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the barley and cook, stirring for 1 minute.
3 When the ham hock stock is prepared, pour the broth through a sieve into the barley.
Bring to a boil.
4 Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook the barley until tender and all the liquid is
absorbed, about 30 minutes. If the barley is not quite done, add 1 or 2 tablespoons
water and continue to cook. If the barley is cooked but liquid remains, turn off heat and
let the barley rest in the covered pot while the grain continues to absorb the liquid.

Preparing Perfect Pasta
Pasta comes in many shapes and sizes (see Figure 10-2 for a sampling). Here
are some guidelines to help you decide what works for your recipe:
 For lighter, brothy sauces and pestos, choose delicate, long pasta, like
vermicelli, spaghetti, linguine, or angel hair.
 For meatier, chunkier sauces or pasta salads, choose shorter shapes
with ridges or holes, like cavatelli, penne, farfalle, and wagon wheels.
The smaller pieces make it easier to grab pasta and sauce with every
bite. And the ridges and holes in the pasta grab bits and chunks of your
sauce.
 For heavier and creamier sauces, choose flat, ribbonlike pasta, such as
fettuccine.
Most pasta is made from semolina flour, not refined white flour. It’s a complex
carbohydrate, rather than a simple carbohydrate, meaning that it gives your
body more lasting energy and a more gradual release of sugar. A 1⁄2 cup serv-
ing of cooked pasta contains 99 calories, less than half a gram of fat, and less
than 5 milligrams of sodium, and it costs you only 1 starch exchange.
Here are a few other benefits of choosing pasta.
 It has a relatively low glycemic index of 41. For more about the glycemic
index and how it can help you manage your blood glucose levels, check
out Chapter 2.
 It’s a quick food to prepare. You can get this filling side dish ready in
about 10 minutes.
 It goes with just about anything. Pasta is so versatile. You can toss it
with chicken broth and fresh herbs, or fresh veggies and a little bit of
olive oil. If you can cook it, you can serve it with pasta.
• Create Chinese flavored dishes with a splash of sesame oil,
crunchy water chestnuts, bok choy, and cilantro. Add thinly sliced
beef for a full meal.
• Mix up a Mediterranean delight by adding tomatoes, garlic, and
fresh basil. Throw in some pine nuts and seafood for a lowfat, tasty
weeknight supper.
• Invent your own Latin lunch, by including grilled onions, chicken
breast, chiles, and chayote squash.
• Introduce flavors from the Caribbean by tossing pasta with shrimp,
flaked coconut, jerk seasonings, and vegetable stock.
• Work in some Vietnamese inspired cuisine, by adding it to veg-
etable broth, chopped chiles, cilantro, and lean pork.

 It’s very filling. A 1⁄2 cup serving may not seem like much, but a little can
go a long way, especially if you bulk up the fiber content of your dish
with fresh veggies. Or opt for 2 starch servings, and have a full cup of
pasta and enjoy it as a main course.

Classic: Seafood Farfalle Salad
It’s no surprise that in Italy, a country with many port cities, many pasta dishes include
fish. The Italians have even figured out how to use the black ink of octopus in one spe-
cial pasta dish. This recipe is much tamer, however. It’s a low-calorie but quite satisfying
combination of seafood and pasta. Using farfalle, pasta shaped like a butterfly or a bow
tie, adds eye appeal. If you have access to a specialty Italian food market, you may even
be able to find farfallini, the smallest butterflies, or farfallone, the largest.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 ounces farfalle pasta
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 pound bay scallops
1⁄2 pound cooked baby shrimp
11⁄2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1⁄8 teaspoon black pepper
1⁄2 cup plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and
diced
1 small cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
2 tablespoons seeded and finely chopped
green bell pepper
1 Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the boiling water and cook the farfalle according
to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again. Set aside.
2 Meanwhile, coat a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray or 2 teaspoons of canola
oil and place over medium heat until hot. Add the scallops and shrimp, a few at a time,
and sauté, turning them as they brown, allowing 11⁄2 to 2 minutes per side; remove them
to a bowl as they finish.
3 In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, thyme, garlic, parsley,
and pepper. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, and green pepper and mix thoroughly.
Combine the pasta, scallops (and their released juices), and shrimp. Toss the pasta mix-
ture with the dressing mixture.

Although most of the pasta you’ll find in your local grocery is made from
semolina flour, you can find pasta made from a variety of different flours,
including these:
 Brown rice: This pasta is a great alternative for people allergic to wheat.
Check the label, but most brown rice pasta is both wheat and gluten
free. They may also be dairy-free and organic. Try this delicious pasta in
the following recipe.
 Soy: Pasta made with soy flour tends to be higher in protein and lower
in carbohydrate than semolina pasta, but always read the label to make
sure you’re making the right choice for your needs.
 Whole wheat: If you’re looking for a higher fiber pasta, whole-wheat
pasta may be what you’re looking for. It’s characterized by a more
robust flavor than its semolina counterpart.

T Classic: Kasha and 
Brown Rice Pasta
Sometimes simple food, such as this delicious combination of kasha and pasta, tastes
the best. Kasha is buckwheat groats (hulled and crushed buckwheat). The flavors are
mellow and nutty with just a hint of mushroom, a step beyond blandness but still quiet
comfort food. This mixture is meant to be a background dish, served with savory foods
such as a chicken roasted with herbs or slow-cooked flank steak prepared with onion
and dried fruits. This merger of whole grains and pasta is especially favored in Eastern
European and Russian cooking.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 teaspoons safflower oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 cup kasha (buckwheat groats)
1⁄2 cup sliced button mushrooms
2 cups boiling vegetable broth or water
Pepper
Sea salt (optional)
4 cups water
11⁄2 cups brown rice rotini (Lundberg brand)
1 In a heavy medium saucepan, heat the oil and sauté the onion until translucent, 
5 to 7 minutes.
2 Beat the egg in a small bowl. Add the kasha and mix together, coating each grain with
the egg. Add to the onions. Cook the kasha while stirring until the grains are dry and
separated.

3 Add the mushrooms, broth, pepper, and sea salt, if desired. Cover the skillet and
simmer until all the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
4 In the meantime, bring the 4 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Add the rotini and cook
for 6 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Drain and, if necessary, keep warm while the
kasha finishes cooking.
5 When the kasha is fully cooked, fluff with a fork and stir in the rotini.

Letting Legumes into Your Diet
Legumes (pronounced LAY-gooms) are the protein-packed staple of a vegetar-
ian diet, but you don’t have to swear off meat to enjoy them. The family of
grains includes thousands of plant species, including beans, soybeans,
lentils, peas, and the beloved peanut.
It’s tough to find a more perfect all-round food than legumes. They’re rich in
protein, low in fat (what fat they do have is the good fat), high in dietary fiber,
and rich in complex carbohydrates and vitamins. Besides being healthy,
they’re inexpensive, very versatile, and easy to use. They store well when
dried, and have a shelf life of a full year.
Because legumes are also high in carbohydrate, a person with diabetes still
needs to be mindful of portion sizes here. The benefits that the fiber and pro-
tein provide, however, make them a more optimal choice than the usual
carbs like bread, pasta, or rice.

Red-Wine-Braised Lentils
This recipe, courtesy of Poggio in Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), is an easy
accompaniment to any poultry or meat dish. The hearty lentils are flavored by the slow-
cooked method of braising in which they begin to achieve the flavor of the red wine.
Lentils are a complex carbohydrate full of fiber, as well as a good source of protein.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour and 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 In a medium saucepan, heat the butter and olive oil. Sauté the onions, celery, and car-
rots, until they begin to sweat, or give off a bit of liquid. Season the vegetables with salt
and pepper to taste and cover the pot. Cook until the vegetables are soft, approximately
10 minutes.
2 Add the thyme, prosciutto, and dried porcini mushrooms. Add the wine and reduce by
one-third. Add the lentils, bay leaf, and chicken broth and simmer for about 1 hour, until
the lentils are soft.
3 Remove the bay leaf. Adjust the salt and pepper if needed. This dish may be refriger-
ated for up to 3 days, until ready to use.
Tip: To reconstitute the dried porcini mushrooms, place them in 1⁄4 cup hot water for 30 min-
utes, chop them, and strain the liquid. If you want, you can use the liquid as part of the
cooking liquid. Just substitute the mushroom broth for 1⁄4 cup of the chicken broth in Step 2.

Lentils are quick cooking legumes, so you don’t need to soak them before
cooking like you do with dried beans. If you’re extra conscious, feel free to
pick over the lentils, as you would with dried beans. Rinse them well to
remove any dirt or other debris. Then sort through them a handful at a time,
looking for dirt clods, stones, and other foreign particles. Try them in soups,
saucy Indian curries, or this terrific “salad.”

T Olive and Lentil Salad
This dish, from Heather Dismore, is considered a “salad,” but don’t let that word fool
you! This dish is unlike many salads — it’s hearty and will keep you full and satisfied for
a long time. This olive and lentil mix has a ton of fiber and protein (from the lentils) and
enough heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (from the olives) that will digest slowly and
therefore keep you feeling full for longer. It has only a moderate amount of carbohy-
drates, so your blood sugars won’t be hugely affected here. This one-pot meal offers
you a significant amount of iron, calcium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and B6.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Salad:
1 In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the lentils, bay leaves, thyme, carrots, celery, shallots,
and garlic. Cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a low boil and cook until the lentils are
just tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
2 After the lentils have cooled, add the tomatoes, peppers, olives, and oregano. Mix thor-
oughly. Salt and pepper to taste. Gently stir in the goat cheese.
3 In a blender, combine the vinegar, olive juice, shallot, mustard, salt, and pepper.
Remove the knob from the lid of the blender. With the blender running, slowly pour in
the olive oil to emulsify the dressing. Adjust seasonings as necessary. Pour over the
salad and toss gently to coat.

“Beans, beans, they’re good for your heart.” Well, this in fact is very true.
Beans offer a tremendous amount of fiber, more specifically soluble fiber —
the type that can lower your LDL, or “bad” cholesterol. Because they’re plant
based, they have no cholesterol.
You can find many canned legumes in your grocery store. They’re a bit more
expensive than the dried variety, but they can help you create a well-balanced
nutritious meal quickly. Keep a few cans in your cupboard, for quick and satis-
fying meals, like this Black Bean Pie, that will keep you full and keep your
blood sugar stable.
When using canned anything, like beans or veggies, whenever possible, drain
and rinse the food before cooking to get rid of excess sodium. But before you
toss out the liquid, remember to double-check the recipe. Some recipes, like
the one for Black Bean Pie here, use the liquid in the recipe.

T White Beans and Spinach
Beans are part of the standard diet of almost every culture, and the Italians are no
exception. Heather Dismore contributed this recipe that uses the cannellini beans, an
Italian staple, paired with nutritious vitamin-A-rich spinach. Use canned beans and pre-
washed spinach to make this nutritious powerhouse as easy to make as it is to enjoy.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 cup diced onions
3 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thinly
1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms
1⁄4 cup white wine
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
Half a 10-ounce bag of triple-washed spinach
1 can (15 ounces) white beans (like navy,
cannellini, or great Northern), rinsed and
drained
2 tablespoons fresh minced oregano
Salt and pepper
1 Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sauté until
translucent. Add the garlic and mushrooms. Cook until just fragrant. Add the white wine
and mustard. Scrape up any browned bits that may be stuck to the skillet.
2 Add the spinach and cover. Steam the spinach for 3 to 4 minutes, or until wilted but still
bright green. Add the white beans. Continue to cook until heated through. Add the
oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Adjust seasonings as necessary.

T Southwestern Hummus
Hummus is a classic Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dish, but this rendition, from
Heather Dismore (and shown in the color section), is spicy and Southwestern. This
creamy spread (with little fat!) makes for a surprisingly healthy appetizer — great
served with whole-wheat pita bread wedges, baked tortilla chips, or raw vegetables. 
(If you’re looking for other delicious dipper ideas to pair with this tasty spread, check
out Chapter 7.) The main ingredients here are garbanzo beans, or chickpeas, which are
an excellent vegetarian source of protein, as well as dietary fiber —two great reasons
why hummus makes for a perfect snack also. Protein and fiber are essential for good
blood sugar control, so keep a bowl of hummus on hand when you’re looking for some-
thing light, quick, and easy.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Garnishes (optional):
11⁄2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cans (15 ounces each) garbanzo beans,
drained and rinsed
1⁄4 cup salsa
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cayenne (more or less as you
prefer)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄3 cup roughly chopped cilantro
Salt and pepper
1 tablespoon light sour cream
2 tablespoons diced avocado
1 tablespoon minced cilantro
1 tablespoon minced black olives
1 Place the garlic, beans, salsa, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, olive oil,
cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor. Process until smooth. Adjust
seasonings to taste. Place in a covered bowl. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours to
allow flavors to meld, or blend thoroughly.
2 When ready to serve, spread the hummus in the bottom of a medium sized serving
bowl, and top with the garnishes in the following order: light sour cream, avocado,
cilantro, and black olives.

O
ur bodies thrive on the fantastic phytochemi-
cals, must-have vitamins and nutrients, and
fabulous fiber found in vegetables, but most
people don’t eat enough of them. Yet there are so
many ways you can eat them: in soups, in salads,
puréed in sauces, on the side, or as the main
event. Whether you eat them cooked or raw, using
fresh or frozen products, you can improve your
health today by increasing the amount of vegeta-
bles you eat.
In this chapter, we show you how to translate veg-
etables into food exchanges. We help you update
common vegetables in exciting new ways. And
finally, we help you create some special-occasion recipes to impress 
your guests.
Translating Vegetable Servings 
into Exchanges
For people with diabetes, not all vegetables are created equal.
 The starchy vegetables, such as corn and potatoes, are so high in carbo-
hydrates that they count as a starch, not a vegetable, in the American
Diabetes Association Food Exchange Lists (see Appendix B for all the
lists).

 Then there are the many common vegetables that actually count as 
vegetables — the string beans and tomatoes of everyday eating.
 Finally, a few vegetables, which typically have a high water content,
don’t count at all! They contain so little fat, protein, or carbohydrates
that you can consider them freebies. You can have up to two cupfuls of
these with little effect on your blood glucose.
Following are lists of vegetables to help you keep straight the different cate-
gories of vegetables:
 Starchy vegetables: Corn; potatoes; sweet potatoes; winter squash,
including acorn, butternut, buttercup, and Hubbard; parsnips; pumpkin;
plantains; and legumes, including beans, lima beans, peas, and lentils
 Vegetables that count as a single vegetable exchange: Artichokes,
asparagus, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, beets, beet greens, broccoli,
Brussels sprouts, cooked cabbage, carrots, chard greens, dandelion
greens, eggplant, green pepper, jicama, kale, kohlrabi, leeks, mustard
greens, okra, onions, pea pods, rutabaga, sauerkraut, cooked spinach,
string beans, tomatoes, turnips, turnip greens, and water chestnuts
 Free vegetables: Alfalfa sprouts, raw cabbage, celery, chicory, Chinese
cabbage, cucumber, endive, escarole, green onions, fresh spinach, hot
peppers, lettuce, mushrooms, radishes, rhubarb, fresh salad greens,
summer squash such as zucchini, and watercress
Adding a New Twist to Old Favorites
(and Not-So-Favorites)
Most people have a vegetable that has haunted them since childhood.
Whether you had the misfortune to taste Aunt Betty’s Brussels sprout casse-
role at a family reunion when you were 9 or were forced to sit in front of a
plate of lukewarm boiled carrots you just couldn’t choke down, you probably
have one you just don’t like. Well, hopefully, we’re about to change that.
In this section, we give you delicious recipes using traditional vegetables 
that you can find in the kitchens of most people but that you may not be fond
of — yet. But never fear — after trying a few, you’ll have a whole new appreci-
ation for them.

T Brussels Sprouts Roasted 
with Lemon and Capers
These Brussels sprouts, from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), are
simple to prepare and so good! Lucky for you that they’re also full of wonderful nutri-
tion. Just one serving gets you 25 percent of your daily vitamin A requirement, 25 per-
cent of your goal in dietary fiber, and more than 100 percent of your daily need of
vitamin C. These sprouts also are a great source of the antioxidant beta carotene and
contain lutein, an important nutrient for eye health. No need to add any large amounts
of salt here. Just a small touch of capers (which contain sodium) will do the job.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
11⁄2 pounds Brussels sprouts
Juice from 2 lemons
2 tablespoons capers
3 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and pepper
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Trim bottoms from the Brussels sprouts, cut them in
half, and place in a pot of salted boiling water. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fork-
tender.
2 Remove them from the water and drain. Toss the sprouts with the lemon juice, capers,
and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste and place on a roasting pan.

Broccoli is one of the most nutritious veggies out there. If you still can’t 
seem to acquire a liking for it though, look no further. Prepare the following
elegant recipe for your family or guests, and everyone will be so pleasantly
surprised — especially when you tell them the rich, savory sauce has barely
any fat.
T Broccoli with Creamy 
Lemon Sauce
Who doesn’t love broccoli and cheese? And for most of us, the more cheese the better!
And what’s even better, you can enjoy this one (courtesy of food writer Heather
Dismore) guilt-free. This creamy sauce is made with mainly lowfat ingredients instead of
the full-fat dairy products that usually go into rich sauces. Just be sure not to add any
more salt. The cottage cheese and Parmesan already contribute enough for flavor.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2⁄3 cup lowfat cottage cheese
1⁄4 cup evaporated skim milk
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄8 teaspoon ground turmeric
White pepper
3 cups hot cooked broccoli florets
1 In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, milk, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, turmeric,
and white pepper to taste and purée until the mixture achieves a thin consistency,
about 30 seconds.
2 Heat the sauce in a skillet, stirring occasionally, until heated through, but do not boil.
3 Serve the sauce over the warm broccoli.

T Zucchini and Parmigiano-Reggiano 
Salad
This recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household. Chef Kevin Rathbun of
Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A) uses simple, quality ingredients like Parmigiano-
Reggiano (the original and best Parmesan cheese in the world), extra-virgin olive oil,
and fresh lemon juice to give this dish rich flavors with very little effort.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 medium zucchini, peeled and sliced
1⁄2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, shaved thin
1 tablespoon lemon juice
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons chopped lemon verbena
Place the zucchini in a bowl and shave the Parmigiano-Reggiano in the bowl. Add the
lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and verbena. Toss to incorporate the ingredients and
serve.
Tip: Lemon verbena is a potent herb, with a strong lemon flavor. Look for it in specialty
food markets. Alternatively, look for it at your local nursery and grow your own. If you can’t
find it, you can always pick another herb (like tarragon or basil). The substitution will
change the flavor but will still be delicious.

T Chunky Zucchini-Tomato Curry
This veggie dish is delicious, perfect as a side or as a dip or on top of crisp bruschetta.
It’s full of Indian-inspired spices and remains modestly low in calories and fat. No added
salt is needed as the spices already offer plenty of flavor. Heather Dismore offers this
unique way to serve up simple veggies like zucchini and tomatoes. Be creative with
spices like the ones used here to make vegetables that you and your guests will love.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet. Sauté the onion, ginger, and garlic for about
5 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Add the coriander and curry powder.
Continue cooking 1 minute.
2 Stir in the tomatoes and zucchini. Simmer approximately 10 minutes, or until the zuc-
chini is tender.

Enhancing natural flavors 
with dry steaming
Dry steaming refers to cooking vegetables in their own natural juices rather
than adding additional moisture. In the case of carrots, they have a medium
to high moisture content, so when you heat them in a closed environment
(like in a pot with a tight-fitting lid), they use the liquid that they give off
during the cooking process to create steam and facilitate the cooking
process. So the food is essentially steamed without adding any water. You get
a similar effect when you microwave vegetables without adding water.
Don’t microwave vegetables, or anything else, in a completely closed 
container. Always provide a vent of some sort for steam to escape.
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium red onion, finely
diced
2 teaspoons grated fresh
ginger
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 cup canned crushed
tomatoes
1 pound zucchini, quartered
lengthwise and large diced

T Dry-Steamed Dill Carrots
Here’s a tasty twist on a veggie favorite. Heather Dismore uses fresh herbs here to give
these carrots a new and interesting flavor. Carrots are one of the best sources of vitamin
A, antioxidants, lutein, and beta carotene. These are the nutrients best known for eye
health. The orange fruits and vegetables are all good sources of these antioxidants, so
get them in whenever you can!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 to 40 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound baby carrots
1⁄4 cup minced fresh dill
Salt and pepper
1 Melt the butter in a deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add the carrots. Cook over
medium to medium-low heat for approximately 35 to 40 minutes. Shake the skillet occa-
sionally during cooking, without removing the lid.
2 Remove the lid after 35 to 40 minutes and check to confirm that carrots are tender.
Allow any excess moisture to evaporate from the skillet. Toss the carrots with the dill.
Salt and pepper to taste.

Blanching vegetables for optimum
taste and nutrition
Blanching is a terrific technique for cooking vegetables without losing many
of the vitamins that make them so healthy for you. It’s also surprisingly
simple. You immerse vegetables in boiling water, leave them in the water for a
short period of time, and then shock them, or immerse them in ice-cold water
to stop the cooking. This technique helps to prevent the vegetables from get-
ting mushy. Check out Figure 11-1 to see the basic steps.

Here are the detailed steps to follow for blanching vegetables.
1. Bring salted water to vigorous boil in a 2-quart saucepan.
2. While the water is working up to a boil, prepare the ice bath.
Fill a medium-sized mixing bowl one-half to three-fourths full with ice.
Add water to just cover the ice.
3. Blanch the vegetables.
Place the trimmed vegetables, in batches if necessary, in the boiling
water. Cook the vegetables until they’re crisp tender.
You want to keep a constant boil, but adding too many veggies at a time
can slow down the process.
4. Shock the vegetables.
Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and immediately place
them in the ice bath. Remove them from the ice bath after the vegeta-
bles are completely cooled, usually 1 to 2 minutes.
To check for doneness, remove a single vegetable piece with a slotted
spoon; submerge it in the ice bath until it’s cool enough to place in your
mouth. Then actually taste it to check the texture. Do this step quickly
so that if the veggies are ready, the rest of them in the boiling water
won’t overcook while you’re testing.
5. Reheat the vegetables and season as desired.
Blanching times vary based on the vegetable and the size of the pieces, but
check out Table 11-1 for approximate times for reference.

T Haricot Vert
Haricot vert (pronounced ah-ree-co VEHR) is a fancy French word that literally means
“green beans” and refers to (surprise!) green beans, or what we sometimes call string
beans. If you find true French haricot vert in a gourmet market, use them in this recipe.
They’re a bit smaller and thinner than common string beans, but the flavor is very simi-
lar. But if you can’t find them, feel free to substitute fresh string beans. Canned beans
won’t work because they’re already cooked beyond tender. The Baricelli Inn in
Cleveland (see Appendix A) contributed this classic and simple recipe. Enjoy this 
elegant vegetable with any hearty entree.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 cups string beans
2 tablespoons butter
Salt and pepper
Cut off the ends of the beans and blanch in boiling water for 1 minute (see the instruc-
tions earlier in this section); remove and place them in a cold water bath with ice. Drain
and reheat in a skillet with the butter and salt and pepper to taste.
Tip: Serve these tasty veggies with Veal Tenderloin with Chanterelle Mushrooms in Chap-
ter 14, also from the Baricelli Inn.

Serving Up Starchy Vegetables
Two of the most commonly eaten starchy vegetables, potatoes and corn, rank
among the foods with the highest glycemic index (see Chapter 2). Processed
versions of these foods, such as instant mashed potatoes and cornflakes,
which enter the bloodstream more quickly than foods in their natural state,
rank even higher on the scale. Believe it or not, these convenience foods
have an effect on your bloodstream similar to lowfat ice cream.
Potatoes and corn can have a place in a diabetic diet, but you need to eat
these in smaller portions and balance their carbohydrate content with pro-
tein and fat in other foods at the same meal. But with all the great recipes in
this chapter, there’s no need to default to those high-starch foods regularly.
Try out this excellent substitute for mashed potatoes the next time you’re
looking for a nutritious side dish.

T Mashed Sweet Potatoes
Here is a perfect example of a great substitution for a traditional food from Heather
Dismore — a substitution that adds lots more color on your plate and, therefore, many
more key nutrients. Instead of the usual white potatoes, try yams or sweet potatoes
instead. The orange variety has more than 4 times your daily need of vitamin A as well
as lutein and beta carotene, cancer-fighting antioxidants and key nutrients for eye
health. This recipe calls for just a bit of lowfat evaporated milk, providing a more con-
centrated flavor without the extra calories and fat. Because sweet potatoes already
have a natural sweet flavor, little added butter and salt are needed here.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 pounds sweet potatoes (roughly 4 large
sweet potatoes), peeled and cubed
1 tablespoon butter
Kosher salt and pepper
1⁄3 cup evaporated lowfat milk
Boil the sweet potatoes in a pot until fork tender. Drain. Place the drained potatoes in a
bowl. Using an electric mixer, whip the sweet potatoes. Add the butter, the salt and
pepper to taste, and the milk.

Using Vegetables in Place of Pasta
Pasta gets a lot of bad press these days, but the biggest problem with it is the
portion size that most people typically eat. For healthy ways to include pasta
and other grains in your diabetic diet, check out Chapter 10.
When you’re craving the rich delicious Italian sauces but have run out of
starch exchanges for the day, substitute veggies for a terrific substitute. Make
“noodles” from slices of eggplant, strings of cucumber, or slices of zucchini.
Get started with this great Eggplant Lasagna.

A mandoline is a handy tool to have around your kitchen. Take a look at it in
Figure 11-2. It’s a manual slicing device that quickly makes consistently sized
cuts of foods. You can use it to julienne or make even 1⁄4-inch slices of eggplant
(as in the next recipe). You can make paper-thin strips of sweet potatoes for
making your own baked chips or thick lemon wheels for water. Consider get-
ting one to ease the prep work of making your own veggie noodles. Look for a
mandoline at your local cooking supply store or gourmet shop.

T Eggplant Lasagna
This recipe uses slices of eggplant in place of traditional lasagna noodles. It takes some
time to get these “noodles” ready to layer, but it’s definitely worth the effort. When you
slice into this cheesy, layered, flavorful dish, you won’t even miss the pasta.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 large eggplant, unpeeled, halved
lengthwise, and sliced 1⁄4-inch thick
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cans (8 ounces each) low-sodium tomato
sauce
1 can (14 ounces) low-sodium diced tomatoes,
drained
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1⁄4 teaspoon dried oregano
1⁄4 teaspoon dried basil
1⁄8 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and pepper
1⁄2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1⁄2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

1 Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil. Coat the foil with the
cooking spray and arrange the eggplant in a single layer on the foil-lined baking sheet.
Lightly coat the eggplant with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Bake for 5 minutes, turn the egg-
plant, bake for an additional 5 minutes, and set aside to cool.
2 Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Make the tomato sauce: Place a medium
saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the
garlic, and the onions. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until the onions are tender. Add the
tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, and thyme. Lower
the heat to medium-low heat and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes. Season with salt and
pepper to taste.
3 In an 8-x-8-inch ovenproof lasagna pan, spoon enough sauce to coat the bottom and
then cover with a layer of eggplant. Spread the ricotta cheese over the eggplant and
then cover with sauce. Continue to layer two more times in the same manner (so you
have three layers total), ending with the sauce. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the
top and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the entire dish. Place in the oven and bake
for 35 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden.

Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine 
with Clams
David Burke, executive chef at DavidBurke and Donatella in New York City (see Appen-
dix A), offers this shellfish lover’s delight. After steeping in the delicious wine and clam
sauce, the zucchini and cucumbers actually begin to taste much like linguine, without
the calories and carbohydrate. You’re sure to impress your guests when you serve this
light appetizer at your next dinner party. Because this dish is low in calories, they’ll
even have plenty of room left for the main course.
Clams are chock-full of vitamin B12 and iron. If you’re cutting back on fat by avoiding
red meat, you can feel confident that you won’t be missing out on these essential nutri-
ents, which are abundant in carnivorous diets. By the way, when purchasing clams and
other shellfish, be sure the shells are closed. The open ones can be contaminated and
cause severe foodborne illness.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 tablespoons chopped
shallots
1⁄4 cup minced red peppers
18 to 24 Manila or littleneck
clams
11⁄2 cups white wine
2 lemons (juice and zest)
1 tablespoon butter
Salt and pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 large seedless cucumber,
cut into long, julienne strips 
to resemble noodles (use a
mandoline or a sharp knife)
1 large zucchini, julienned
1⁄4 cup chopped parsley
1 Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan. Add the garlic, shallots, and red peppers and sauté until
golden, approximately 10 minutes. Add the clams, white wine, and lemon juice. Cover
and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until the clams open, approximately 5 minutes.
2 When the clams open, add the butter, salt and pepper to taste, and the red pepper
flakes. Remove the clams. Toss in the cucumber and zucchini noodles and heat until
they are warm and wilted, approximately 7 minutes.
3 Divide among 4 bowls and top each with the clams and the remaining juice. Garnish
with the chopped parsley and lemon zest.

Giving Veggies the Gourmet Treatment
Vegetables are ripe for dressing up with the full gourmet treatment. They’re
flavorful on their own, but they take most seasonings, spices, and cooking
techniques very well. You really can’t mess them up unless you overcook
them. Experiment with your favorite recipes by using the techniques in this
chapter. Also, try a few that you haven’t tried before just to broaden your
vegetable horizon.

T Pickled Vegetables
Have your favorite veggies, but pickle them. Be creative! Try this with any vegetables
you like. Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see Appendix A), serves these pick-
led vegetables as a side to many dishes. It’s a tasty way to satisfy hunger pains without
sending those blood sugars through the roof. You can see this dish in the color section.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 20 servings, or 3 pounds of pickles
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
seed
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 teaspoon black
peppercorns
4 dried pepperoncini
2 bay leaves
3 cups water
1 cup white wine vinegar
3 sprigs thyme
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons salt
3 pounds vegetables (such as
carrots, cauliflower, cherry
peppers, fennel, onions, or
turnips), cleaned and cut into
bite-sized pieces
1 Combine the mustard seed, fennel seed, peppercorns, pepperoncini, bay leaves, water,
vinegar, thyme, sugar, and salt in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the vegetables and
simmer for about 3 minutes.
2 Turn off the heat, but leave the vegetables in the pickling solution. The residual heat
will cook them through.
3 Discard the pickling juice and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Tip: Serve these pickles with sandwiches or fried fish or just snack on them on their own.

Zucchini is a terrific all-around vegetable. You can eat it raw, stew it, bake it in
muffins, grill it, steam it, blanch it, or melt cheese on it. It makes excellent
“noodles” (check out the Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine with Clams recipe
earlier in this chapter). To get an idea of just how versatile this veggie is (and
how much you can dress it up), check out the following recipe.

T Goat-Cheese-Stuffed Zucchini 
with Yellow Tomato Sauce
Kyle Ketchum, from Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), has prepared this dish,
which can make for a lovely appetizer, a side entree, or even a small meal. The distinct
flavors of garlic, lemon, tomato, and savory goat cheese meld into one phenomenal
flavor. They each stand strong alone, however, and are sure to come alive with every
moment in your mouth. This vibrant dish is high in protein and quite low in carbohy-
drate, making it suitable for people managing their blood sugars. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that goat cheese is quite rich and high in saturated fat. Be sure to enjoy these
zucchinis in moderation.
Try this yellow tomato sauce as indicated here or atop any favorite vegetable.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 25 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Wash the zucchini and pat dry. Cut the ends off the
zucchini and then cut each zucchini in half to create 2 pieces of equal length. Use a
paring knife or melon baller to core out the center of the zucchini.
2 Put the goat cheese in a bowl and add the bread crumbs, lemon zest, and basil. Season
with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and taste for seasoning. Spoon the cheese mix-
ture into the zucchini shells.
3 Drizzle the olive oil on the zucchini, season with salt and pepper to taste, and place on
a baking sheet. Bake until the cheese begins to bubble and the bread crumbs start to
brown, about 30 minutes.
6 medium green zucchini
1 pound chèvre goat cheese (room
temperature)
1⁄4 cup bread crumbs
Zest of 1 lemon
1⁄4 cup basil chiffonade (see the tip at the end
of this recipe)
Salt and pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil

4 Remove the zucchini from the oven, drizzle the Yellow Tomato Sauce (see the next
recipe) on top of them, and return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes.
Tip: Chiffonade literally means “made of rags,” and it pretty well describes what the final
product looks like. Leafy lettuce or herbs are rolled together tightly and then thinly sliced
width-wise to form long, stringy strips.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
1 Core the tomatoes, blanch in salted water for 10 seconds, and then shock in an ice
water bath. Take a look at Figure 11-1, earlier in this chapter, to see how this technique
works. Allow the tomatoes to chill for a few minutes and then remove from the water
and peel the skin. Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out the pulp and seeds.
2 Place the tomatoes in a blender, add the garlic, and blend. With the blender on high,
drizzle in the olive oil until the sauce achieves a smooth, even consistency, approxi-
mately 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

T Asian Vegetable Stir-Fry
With this stir-fry, be creative and use any vegetables that you like. The health benefits
here don’t get any better! All of these vegetables in combination are rich in countless
vitamin and minerals, notably vitamins A, C, B6, folate, calcium, and potassium. This
stir-fry from Heather Dismore is prepared with minimal oil, so it remains quite low in
total fat and calories. It’s also rich in fiber, which makes it great for weight management,
heart health, and especially blood sugar control. If you like, round out this dish with
some tofu or chicken to get a bit of lean protein, and serve over a bed of brown rice for
some more fiber, as well.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 ounces dehydrated wild mushrooms
1⁄4 cup boiling water
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
11⁄2 teaspoons grated fresh gingerroot
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 cups baby bok choy, sliced in half
1 red bell pepper, seeded and julienned
1⁄2 carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup snow peas, trimmed
1 Place the mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and cover them with the boiling water. Allow
them to reconstitute for 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water. Chop
them and reserve. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter to remove the grit. Combine
the mushroom liquid, soy sauce, garlic, and gingerroot. Set aside.
2 Heat the oil in a wok or nonstick skillet. Stir-fry the mushrooms, bok choy, red pepper,
carrots, and broccoli for 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce mixture and snow peas. Reduce
the heat and continue cooking until the veggies are crisp tender and the sauce thickens.

Moderation is the key when enjoying any fried foods. Many diabetics are
encouraged to stay away fried food entirely. In general, it’s good advice
because so many foods are heavily battered with starchy concoctions that no
one needs to eat. But on occasion, you can enjoy fried foods that are lightly
dredged, or lightly coated, in flour, as in the Vegetable Fritto Misto.

187
Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
T Vegetable Fritto Misto
This dish from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), calls for signifi-
cant amounts of milk and white flour, but not to worry. Because they’re used only to
coat the vegetables, neither provides a significant amount of calories or carbohydrates.
The flour and milk help create a thick, crispy coating on the veggies when they’re
sautéed. Though canola oil is a wonderful source of monounsaturated, heart-healthy
fat, it’s still very dense in calories, so be thrifty here! When the veggies are finished,
drain them well on paper towels to get rid of some of the excess oil. You may also want
to pair these veggies with a light entrée, such as fish or chicken, both low-calorie, lean
sources of protein.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 tablespoons canola oil
1⁄2 cup artichoke hearts
1⁄2 head cauliflower, chopped into florets
10 pitted green olives
1 large portobello mushroom, large dice
2 cups lowfat milk
2 cups flour
Salt and pepper
Lemon wedges (optional)
1 Heat the oil in a deep skillet until it starts smoking. While you’re waiting for the oil to
heat, place the artichoke hearts, cauliflower, olives, and mushrooms in the milk in a
shallow bowl and soak. Place the soaked veggies in a resealable plastic bag with the
flour. Shake to coat the veggies with flour. Put the floured vegetables into a strainer and
shake off the excess flour.
2 Carefully place the vegetables in batches into the hot oil. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
golden brown.
3 Remove the vegetables from the oil onto paper towels and season lightly with salt and
pepper. Place them in a bowl and serve with a wedge or two of lemon, if desired.
Tip: To ensure that your food absorbs the least amount of oil possible, make sure the oil is
very hot before you begin frying it. This step ensures that your food gets a quick, crispy
outer coating without getting saturated in oil.

S
eafood is a great protein source, especially for
diabetics. It has lower saturated fat, choles-
terol, and carbohydrates than any other protein
source. Much of it has a mild flavor that takes on
the flavor of its accompanying ingredients and
preparation methods, so you can have an almost
endless variety of flavors and dishes. It cooks up
quickly, so it can be ready when you are.
In this chapter, we convince you (in case you need
it) that seafood is an excellent food choice to
include in a diabetic diet. We give you plenty of
recipes and fun new ways to prepare all kinds of
fish dishes. And finally, we give you tips for prepar-
ing shellfish.
Identifying Good Reasons
to Serve Seafood
Like meat and poultry, seafood supplies high-quality protein, balancing the
fats and carbohydrates in the meal and providing calories that have little
effect on blood glucose. But the benefits of eating fish extend beyond this:
 The oceans are a rich reservoir of minerals, and all creatures that live in
the sea are in part made of these minerals. When you eat fish, you are
likely also to be consuming iodine, selenium, phosphorus, potassium,
iron, and calcium.

 Eating seafood regularly may help improve kidney function in patients
with severe diabetes.
 Seafood is a good source of B vitamins, especially niacin, and also con-
tains fat-soluble vitamin A. In addition, fatty fish are one of the few food
sources of vitamin D.
 The most important nutrient in fish may well be the omega-3 fatty acids.
These polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially high in the fat and oils
of fish that live in cold water. (Because these oils stay liquid at room
temperature, they may help insulate the fish against the cold.) The
omega-3 fatty acids appear to lower the undesirable form of cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, and to raise the desirable form, HDL cholesterol. These
fats also have an anti-inflammatory effect. The fish with the highest per-
centage of these healthy oils are salmon, sardines, tuna, and mackerel.
Healthy Americans are encouraged to eat two seafood servings per week on a
regular basis.
Preparing Fish in Healthy Ways
You don’t need to deep-fry your catch of the day or order deep-fried fish
when you eat out in order to get fish that tastes good. Not only is this type of
fish loaded with fat, but the type of fat is usually unhealthy. When fats heat to
high temperatures, such as in deep-frying, toxic by-products are formed. It is
far better to eat seafood prepared by methods such as poaching, baking, or
grilling — all delicious and healthy ways of cooking fish. The following sec-
tions cover a variety of methods you can use to cook fish the healthy way.
Baking your way to fish bliss
Baking is one of the first techniques most people learn when they’re learning
to cook. In fact, many people don’t “learn” to bake; they simply seem to know
how to bake. Technically speaking, baking means to cook something by sur-
rounding it with dry heat. In most cases, you bake in an oven, a closed envi-
ronment where you control the temperature.
Baking doesn’t mean boring. Try out this flavorful baked cod to see how
baking can be both easy and delicious.

Horseradish-Crusted Cod with Lentils
This recipe, from Derek Dickerson, owner of Derek’s Bistro in Pasadena, California (see
Appendix A), shows that you can develop a great-tasting meal for a person with dia-
betes. The cod is a lean source of protein and prepared simply by baking, a great lowfat
cooking technique. The fillets are topped with a touch of horseradish, which lends a ton
of flavor but very little added fat and calories. The lentils are full of fiber and complex
carbohydrate, making them a perfect choice. They are combined with crème fraîche, a
heavy cream with a nutty flavor. This ingredient is included in such a modest amount,
however, that it contributes very little fat and calories. The lentils, however, are left
creamy and decadent.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
191
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
1 pound Puy lentils (or substitute the lentils of
your choice)
2 sprigs fresh parsley
4 tablespoons crème fraîche (or substitute 3
tablespoons heavy cream and 1 tablespoon
sour cream)
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper
4 teaspoons horseradish sauce
4 cod fillets, 6 ounces each
4 tablespoons panko bread crumbs (substitute
crushed cornflakes if you can’t find these
Japanese bread crumbs in the Asian section
of your market)
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the lentils in a large saucepan with enough cold
water to cover them, plus an extra couple of inches. Add the whole sprigs of the parsley
and bring to a boil. Simmer for 25 minutes, or until tender. Discard the parsley sprigs.
Drain the lentils and toss with the crème fraîche and chopped parsley. Season to taste.
Set aside and keep warm.
2 Spread the horseradish sauce over each fish fillet and then press in the bread crumbs
to coat. Grease a nonstick baking sheet with the olive oil. Place the fish fillets on the
baking sheet and bake for 14 to 17 minutes, until the fish is just cooked and the bread
crumbs are golden.
3 Place one-fourth of the lentils on each of four plates. Top each with one piece of baked
fish.

Poaching to perfection
Poaching is a method of cooking that gently cooks the food in a small amount
of liquid, just below the boiling point. In the case of seafood, this liquid is
often highly flavored with herbs, wine, stock, and other seasonings. Give
poaching a shot with this terrific salmon recipe.
Poached King Salmon with Steamed 
Asparagus and Tapenade Salsa
This recipe comes to your kitchen from that of Chef Didier Labbe of the Clementine
restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A). The salmon is poached, which is the
lightest method of cooking, requiring only water. Adding wine and other herbs to the
cooking liquid, however, is a great way to infuse good flavor into poached poultry or
fish, as this recipe calls for. This dish is a wonderful source of omega-3 fatty acids as
well as other beneficial heart-healthy fats.
Combined with asparagus, the vitamin A content of this dish is off the chart, so eat up
for eye health! Asparagus also lends a significant source of fiber, some good protein,
and a bunch of folate. For women of childbearing age, folate is essential for the preven-
tion of birth defects and has even healthier outcomes in diabetic patients as well. For
everyone else, adequate folate intakes can also lower something called homocysteine,
high levels of which are linked to heart disease.
By the way, if you don’t have the time or energy to prepare your own fish stock, you can
find the prepared version at many grocery stores and specialty food stores. Just remem-
ber, homemade always tastes better and is better for you, too!

Pan roasting seafood sensations
In the strictest culinary terms pan roasting is a two-step process that first
sears and seals a thicker piece of meat or chicken in a pan on the stovetop
and then finishes that piece in the oven, in the same pan you started in. So
when we’re talking about seafood, the term pan roasting is probably not
exactly accurate. Because seafood cooks so fast, there’s usually not a need to
finish it in the oven. But you can make a terrific sauce in the same pan you
seared your fish in.
Whatever you call it, pan-roasted food is downright good, as these next three
recipes prove. Use a quality sauté pan that heats evenly. And make sure to
heat it up well before you place your fish in to ensure an even, quick crust.
Tilapia Franchaise
If you’re new to the world of seafood, tilapia is a good place to start. It’s a mild-flavored
white fish that really takes on the flavors of the food it’s cooked with. This dish is
simple to make, but very impressive for guests, because you cook the whole thing in a
single pan. Sear the fish and then create the rich sauce — all without changing pans or
washing a single dish. What could be simpler?

Nonstick cooking spray
2 pieces (6 ounces each) tilapia (or other flat
white fish)
1 egg
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 cup white cooking wine
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1⁄2 cup low-salt chicken broth
1 Coat a medium skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium heat.
2 Rinse and dry the tilapia. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg. Place the flour in a flat
plate. Lightly coat both sides of the fish with the flour, coat the fish with the egg, and
place directly in the hot skillet.
3 When the fish is golden brown on the first side (approximately 4 minutes), flip it over to
brown the other side.
4 When the fish is golden brown (roughly after 2 to 3 minutes), reduce the heat to low.
Add the wine and let it reduce to half the amount. Add the lemon juice and broth and let
the liquid reduce as it cooks the fish.
5 When the liquid has reduced to approximately one quarter and appears to have slightly
thickened, remove from the heat and serve.
Tip: Serve with fresh vegetables, salad, whole-wheat couscous, or brown rice for some
extra fiber.

Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillet 
with Lemon-Dill Butter Sauce
Lewis Rossman, from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), offers an
excellent pan-roasted recipe. The sauce is fantastic, the butter adds the right creaminess,
the lemon juice provides the perfect acidity, and the pungent dill ties them together. Look
for baby leeks because they’re more tender and subtle flavored for a great addition to the
salad. And be sure to check out the instructions for the right way to wash and slice leeks
in Chapter 8.

1 Prepare the cucumber salad first. Chop the cucumber into half moons and place in a
bowl with the arugula and the baby leeks. Season with salt and pepper to taste and 1
tablespoon of the olive oil.
2 To cook the fish, heat a sauté pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season the
fish with salt and pepper and, when the pan is hot, add the fillets. Cook for 31⁄2 minutes
on each side (medium-rare to medium). Place the salad in the center of the plate and
put the fish on top.
3 To make the sauce, wipe clean the same sauté pan and add the lemon juice. Allow the
juice to reduce by half and add the butter. Swirl the butter vigorously into the lemon
juice and season with salt and pepper to taste and the chopped dill. Pour over the fish.

A fumet (pronounced foo-MAY) is a heavily concentrated stock. In the case of
the next recipe, it’s a stock made from shrimp shells. You can make a fumet
by boiling fish heads, bones, shellfish shells, or whole fish with wine, aro-
matic herbs, and vegetables and then reducing it to concentrate the flavor.
Use a fumet to season sauces and soups or to braise or poach fish or vegeta-
bles. Its subtle flavor imparts the delicate essence of seafood with a slight
acidity (thanks to the wine), but it doesn’t overpower the main event.
If you’d rather not make your own fumet, look for fish stock or fish stock
glace or base (an even more concentrated product that must be reconsti-
tuted with water before using) at your local fish or gourmet market.
Pan-Roasted Cod with 
Shrimp and Mirliton Squash
Here is a wonderful contribution from Chef Kevin Rathbun, of Rathbun’s in Atlanta,
Georgia (see Appendix A). If you’re keeping in mind blood sugar control and heart
health, fish is always a great choice — and this recipe makes use of two. The cod and
shrimp come together well with the squash ragout.
Mirliton squash, also known as chayote squash, is similar to other squash varieties,
and it makes for a wonderful addition to soups, stews, and casseroles. Look for a small,
avocado-sized squash with a firm pale green skin. It has a white mild-flavored flesh that
takes on the subtle flavors of the shrimp fumet very well. Its peak season runs from
December to March, so if you can’t find it, zucchini works well too. This dish is rich in
lean protein, low in carbs and saturated fat, and full of vitamins A and C.

1 cup peeled, cubed tomato
1⁄2 cup Shrimp Fumet
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons parsley (whole leaves)

Cod:
197
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
4 cod fillets (6 ounces each)
Salt and pepper
2 teaspoons flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the shrimp shells, shallot, bay leaf, thyme,
chardonnay, and enough water to cover the ingredients in a small saucepot. Slowly
bring to a boil and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes to extract some flavor from the shells.
After the flavor has been extracted, strain the liquid. Discard the shells and other solids
and reserve the liquid.
2 Make the ragout: In a medium saucepan, place the shrimp, squash, tomato, fumet,
butter, lemon juice, salt, and parsley. Simmer until the shrimp is done, approximately
5 to 7 minutes, and hold until ready to serve. Adjust seasoning as needed.
3 Lightly season the cod fillets with salt and pepper to taste and dust one side with flour.
4 Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan and place the cod fillets flour side down in the oil. Sauté
to a golden brown, approximately 4 minutes, and then turn and transfer to the oven for
4 to 6 minutes.
5 When the cod is finished baking in the oven, place each fillet in a bowl and pour the
ragout on top.
Note: Shrimp fall into various size categories, and 26/30 means you get 26 to 30 shrimp in
each pound. For more information, see Chapter 7.

Broiling your seafood bounty
You may find that many recipes call for broiling. Basically, you broil food by
cooking it using a heat source from above, usually called (you guessed it) a
broiler. Typically, food is heated for relatively short periods of time at a high
heat, which usually creates a crispy coating. In most cases, broiling is a lowfat
cooking technique requiring little additional fat and allowing the natural fats
present in the food to drip away. All in all, a pretty healthy combination!

Broiled Salmon with Herb 
Sauce and Cucumbers
As if there weren’t already a bunch of reasons to include salmon in your diet, here’s one
more. Salmon is a wonderful source of selenium, which happens to be another disease-
fighting antioxidant. Add that to the long list of this seafood’s many health benefits!
This salmon recipe, coming to us from Barbetta Restaurant in New York (see Appendix A),
is broiled and paired with a sauce flavored with a variety of herbs. Although most creamy
sauces are usually quite high in fat and calories, this one remains extremely light. The
recipe takes advantage of lowfat yogurt instead of its full-fat counterpart. You can make
simple substitutions like this with most dairy products, thus sacrificing a lot of fat and
calories with barely noticeable change in taste.

1⁄4 cup finely chopped fresh chives
21⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley, divided
1⁄2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
10 ounces plain lowfat yogurt
Juice of 1 lemon
1 medium cucumber, unpeeled, thinly sliced
4 fresh salmon fillets; 6 ounces each
Salt and pepper
1 Place an oven-safe grill pan (or broiler pan) in the oven. Preheat the broiler (on low set-
ting if possible).
2 Place the chives in a blender with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Blend for approximately
1 minute, until well combined. Place the chives mixture in a small bowl. Add half of
the chopped parsley and all of the cilantro, the yogurt, and lemon juice. Set aside.
3 Mix the cucumber slices with remaining chopped parsley.
4 Prepare 4 dinner plates by spreading the herb sauce in each one. Arrange the cucumber
slices over the sauce. Put aside.
5 Brush the salmon fillets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper
to taste.
6 Remove the grill pan from the oven. Brush it with the remaining olive oil. Place the
salmon fillets in the heated, oiled pan.

7 Place the grill pan under the broiler, about 5 inches from the heating element.
8 Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the top of the salmon acquires a golden to light brown
color. Flip the fish to the other side. Allow the fillets to remain in the oven an additional
2 to 3 minutes.
9 Place one salmon fillet in the center of each dinner plate, over the cucumber slices and
sauce.

Getting your grill on
Grilling is similar to broiling, but the heat comes from a different direction. In
grilling, the heat source is under the food. In broiling, the heat source is above
the food.
Tuna is an excellent fish for grilling. Its meat is firm, not flaky like white fish.
It stands up nicely to spices and flavorings. And because it’s usually served
extremely rare, it takes very little time to cook. Try grilled tuna in the follow-
ing recipe.
In recent years, there has been a growing concern regarding the methyl mer-
cury content of some fish. Water pollution may increase the level of this metal
to toxic amounts in certain areas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) cautions pregnant and nursing women, as well as women of childbear-
ing age, to limit consumption of swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tile fish
to less than 7 ounces per week. These fish are shown to have the greatest mer-
cury levels compared with other fish species. Ahi tuna is generally considered
to be safe. However if you’re concerned about the mercury content of fish,
visit the FDA Web site, www.fda.gov, to find out more.

Grilled Ahi Tuna with Asian Slaw
If you’re in the mood for something that’s light yet delicious and satisfying, this dish
from food writer Heather Dismore is perfect. It’s full of protein yet low in total calories
and fat. The slaw provides a good source of vegetables, and the dressing helps to round
out the dish with few added calories.
Fresh tuna is best when prepared very rare in the middle — nearly raw. For this reason,
be sure to purchase sushi-grade tuna at the fish market. It’s safer, less likely to be conta-
minated, and therefore less likely to cause foodborne illness. Pregnant and nursing
women should always avoid all raw fish, including rare tuna. Otherwise, be sure to meet
the American Heart Association’s recommendation to consume 2 servings of fish per
week.

4 ahi tuna steaks, about 2 pounds (be sure
they’re sushi grade)
Marinade:
1⁄4 cup light soy sauce
1⁄4 cup mirin (sweet rice wine)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons minced fresh gingerroot
21⁄2 tablespoons minced green onions
3 tablespoons minced garlic
Dressing:
2⁄3 cup rice wine vinegar
1⁄2 tablespoon Splenda (or to taste)
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon finely grated gingerroot
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Slaw:
201
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
1 small head napa cabbage, shredded
1⁄2 cup shredded carrot
1⁄4 cup chopped green onion
1⁄4 cup julienned red pepper
1⁄4 cup julienned yellow pepper
1⁄2 cup julienned daikon radish
1 Make the marinade by combining the soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger, green
onions, and garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Place the ahi steaks in the bag. Gently coat
the steaks in the marinade. Place in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning occasionally.
2 About a half hour before the ahi has finished marinating, prepare the slaw: First mix
the dressing ingredients (vinegar, Splenda, honey, soy sauce, cilantro, gingerroot, and
sesame seeds) in a large bowl. In another large bowl, mix the slaw ingredients (cabbage,
carrots, onion, red and yellow peppers, and radish). Toss the cabbage mixture with
most of the dressing. Reserve a small amount of dressing for later.
3 Let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature. If you’d prefer to refrigerate the slaw,
extend standing time to 1 hour (and start preparing it about 40 minutes after you start
marinating the tuna). Preheat the grill.
4 Grill the ahi tuna 2 to 3 minutes per side. (Broil about 5 inches from the heating element,
if you prefer.) The outside should be gray brown; however, the inside will remain red. Be
sure not to overcook the steaks, as they will quickly dry out and lose flavor.
5 Slice the tuna thinly and serve with the slaw. Drizzle the reserved dressing on top.

B.B.Q. Cedar-Planked Salmon
Chef Vitaly Paley of Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A), has created a
sumptuous feast of salmon with this cedar barbecue. You can prepare it in the oven or
on an outdoor grill. As the planks roast on the fire, the salmon retains the aromas and
begins to employ the earthy cedar flavor of the wooden planks. Note: You can find
cedar planks at a lumber store — specifically look for untreated cedar shingles — or in
kitchen supply stores or gourmet shops that sell lots of knickknacks.
Wild salmon is preferred — it contains more beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and far less
saturated fat than its farmed counterpart. Salmon is a gift of nature and a gift to your
health as well. Enjoy this fatty fish and reap its medicinal benefits.
Special tool: 1 cedar plank, 1 to 2 inches larger than salmon fillet all the way around,
soaked in water for at least 2 hours
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus optional marinating time of 1 to 2 hours
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
202
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
1⁄2 tablespoon salt
1⁄2 cup brown sugar
Zest from 1 orange
1 salmon fillet (2 pounds), pin bone removed
(ask the person at the seafood counter to do
this step for you)
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1⁄2 cup chiffonade basil (roll the basil together
tightly and then thinly slice width-wise to form
long, stringy strips)
1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2 Mix up the dry marinade. In a small bowl mix the salt, brown sugar, and orange zest and
spread it generously on both sides of the salmon fillet. (You can marinate the fish 1 to 2
hours in advance, if you prefer. Refrigerate the fish while it’s marinating if you marinate
it in advance.)
3 Brush one side of the cedar plank with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and place it in the
oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
4 Spread the garlic on the olive-oil-coated side of the plank and then place the salmon
fillet on top. Sprinkle the salmon fillet with the basil. Cover the fish generously with the
sliced onions and then drizzle it with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.

5 Place the planked fish in the preheated oven. Cook the salmon for approximately 10 to
15 minutes, or until the fish is medium-rare and a probe thermometer reads 120 degrees.
The cooking time will vary with the thickness of your fish. Allow approximately 10 min-
utes per inch of thickness.
If you prefer to cook the salmon on a grill, follow these instructions: Preheat the grill to
medium-high heat. Place the oiled plank directly on the grill. Let the plank smoke a bit
before adding the fish. If the plank catches on fire, spritz it with water. Close the grill
and cook the salmon for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fish is medium-
rare and a probe thermometer reads 120 degrees. The cooking time will vary with the
thickness of your fish. Allow approximately 10 minutes per inch of thickness.

Surveying Superior Shellfish
The term shellfish includes seafood such as shrimp, lobster, oysters, clams,
mussels, and scallops, which all have a shell instead of fins and gills. It also
includes some seafood that have a not-so-obvious shell, like octopus and
squid.
Shellfish are sold by their size and weight. For tips on how to pick the right
shellfish for your recipe, check out Chapter 7.
The texture of these tasty tidbits ranges from exceptionally tender, in the case
of lobster and some shrimp, to a bit chewy, in the case of octopus. It’s proba-
bly not a surprise that the tenderness of these delicate creatures depends, in
part, on how well you cook them.
Avoid overcooking shellfish. Doing so causes the texture to become rubbery
and unpleasant.

Mussels with Pastis
This dish comes from Lewis Rossman, from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see
Appendix A). The mussels are a wonderful source of lean protein, as is true of most fish.
Pastis (pronounced pas TEES) is a French licorice-flavored liqueur. Enjoy these shellfish
atop a small bed of pasta or along with any steamed vegetables of your choice. You can
see this dish in the color section.
You don’t need any additional salt here. You’ll notice the sodium content of this dish is
already mildly high, due mainly to the naturally high sodium levels of saltwater shell-
fish. Just be sure to limit or avoid any added salt for the remainder of the meal.
Choose mussels that are closed with their shells intact. Discard any with open, chipped,
or broken shells. Soak your raw mussels for about 20 minutes in cool, clean water before
cooking. They’ll take in water and expel excess salt and sand. Scrub the soaked mussels
with a stiff brush. Remove the beard (or hairlike thread) by pulling toward the mussel’s
hinge. Rinse again in cool, clean water before using them.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
204
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄2 white onion, diced
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 tablespoon chopped anchovy
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
2 pounds mussels, raw, scrubbed, and
debearded
6 tablespoons pastis
Splash white wine
1⁄4 cup tomato sauce
1 Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan. Add the onion and sauté until tender. Add the garlic,
anchovy, parsley, and mussels. Continue to cook until the mussels start to open, about
2 to 3 minutes.
2 Add the pastis. (If you’re cooking on a gas range, remove the sauté pan from the burner
before adding the pastis. Because it contains quite a bit of alcohol, it can easily catch
fire, so you don’t want it near an open flame. Return your pan to the burner after you’ve
added the pastis). Add the white wine and tomato sauce. Cover and simmer another
2 to 3 minutes, until most of the shells are open.

If most but not all of the shells are open, you can cover the dish and cook another minute
or two. But if they don’t open after these additional minutes, discard any unopened mus-
sels. It’s not safe to eat closed mussels because they can contain harmful bacteria. And
don’t waste your time continuing to cook them, hoping they’ll open. You end up over-
cooking the good ones. Cut your losses with a few that don’t open, and savor the ones
that do!
3 Scoop the mussels, along with tomato broth, into a large serving dish.
Tip: Serve alone, with crusty bread, or on top of pasta. Add a green salad for a great meal
in minutes.
Tip: If you can’t find pastis in your local spirits shop, substitute Sambuca, Ouzo, or Pernod
instead. You’ll get a similar anise or licorice flavor.

Ceviche (pronounced se-VEECH or se-vee-CHEE) is an amazing food. Born
out of the necessity of using acid to retard food spoilage, it’s a delicious and
healthy cooking technique. In a nutshell, raw seafood, usually whitefish or
shrimp, is placed in an acid, most often lime juice, which in essence “cooks”
the fish. Feel free to add chiles, onions, and tomatoes to your ceviche for a
full-flavored experience.
Use only very fresh (or freshly frozen and then very recently thawed) seafood
in ceviche because it never reaches temperatures high enough to kill strong
bacteria.

Rock Shrimp Ceviche
With this ceviche dish from Lewis Rossman at Cetrella Bistro and Café in Half Moon Bay,
California (see Appendix A), you and your company are in for a treat. It’s even simple to
prepare. Rock shrimp is a sweet shrimp with an almost lobsterlike flavor and texture.
It’s an extremely succulent shrimp that cooks quickly, so it’s a natural choice for this
no-heat cooking method. The acidic nature of the lime juice actually cooks the fish —
without any stove, pots, or pans. Leave it to marinate for an hour, and it’s ready to
serve. Ceviche makes for a great first course, especially in the hot summer months, as it
is quite light and refreshing and contains almost no fat. Enjoy!

Seared Diver Scallops with Bacon 
and Shallot Reduction
If you’re looking to show off some cooking skills, this scallop dish from Chef Kyle
Ketchum at Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), is sure to impress. Just a small
amount of bacon as a condiment helps to achieve some big flavor — even without
breaking the day’s saturated fat and cholesterol limit. Scallops are great sources of pro-
tein while remaining low in total and saturated fat, so they’re a healthier alternative to
red meats. Serve this dish atop a bed of whole-wheat couscous to complete the meal.
Diver scallops are sea scallops that are harvested by, well, divers. They can be a bit more
expensive than standard sea scallops since they’re harvested by people rather than by
boats dragging chains along the ocean floor, but typically they’re less gritty and have a
better texture. Plus, they’re more environmentally friendly because divers generally take

only the larger mature scallops, leaving the smaller younger scallops to grow for future
scallop eaters.
U10 refers to the size of the scallops used in this recipe and means that one pound of
these scallops contains less than 10 (or Under 10) scallops per pound.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 2 servings

tinue cooking for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and butter and bring
to a simmer until the stock has reduced by half and the onions are tender, approxi-
mately 20 minutes. Add the chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.
2 Preheat a medium sauté pan over high heat. Season the scallops evenly on both sides
with salt and pepper. Add the oil to the hot pan and sauté the scallops approximately
2 minutes per side. Remove the scallops from the pan and place 3 scallops in the center
of each plate. Reheat the asparagus in the skillet you used to cook the scallops. Put the
bacon and shallot reduction (from Step 1) around the scallops. Arrange the asparagus
around the scallops. Drizzle the Balsamic Syrup over the scallops and asparagus.

Flocking to Poultry
In This Chapter
 Understanding poultry basics
 Keeping chicken breasts moist and tasty
 Utilizing different pieces of the bird
 Including turkey in your diet
W
hen you first received your diagnosis of
diabetes, you may have assumed that your
culinary life would include nothing more than
broiled chicken breasts and steamed vegetables.
Hopefully, if you’ve read any of this book at this
point, you realize this assumption couldn’t be fur-
ther from reality.
In this chapter, we show you how to safely use
poultry in your diet. We give you tips to keep the
most popular piece of chicken — the breast —
tasty, moist, and downright exciting. We give you
recipes and ideas for using other cuts of the bird,
such as legs and thighs. And finally, we give you
some great ways to include turkey in your regimen.
Including Poultry in Your Diet
Poultry fits into the Food Exchange Lists for diabetes (see Appendix B) into
the categories of very lean meat (0 to 1 gram of fat per ounce), lean meat 
(3 grams of fat per ounce), and medium-fat meat (5 grams of fat per ounce):
 Very lean-meat poultry: White-meat chicken or turkey without the skin
 Lean-meat poultry: Dark-meat chicken or turkey without the skin, white-
meat chicken with the skin, domestic duck or goose well drained of fat
and without skin
 Medium-fat poultry: Dark-meat chicken with the skin, ground turkey or
chicken, fried chicken with the skin

Nutritionists define a portion as 3.5 ounces. What this serving size looks like
on your dinner plate, with chicken for instance, is typically either a half
chicken breast or a chicken drumstick and thigh. To reduce the fat content,
eat the meat but don’t eat the skin.
Maintaining good sanitary practices in your kitchen is important when you’re
working with poultry, no matter how much poultry you’re cooking. Keep the
following hints in mind to minimize bacterial contamination from poultry:
 Rinse any poultry pieces and pat them dry before using them. This step
helps remove bacteria that are often present in poultry.
 Don’t place raw poultry near, over, or in any foods that won’t be cooked
before they’re eaten. Proper cooking kills most bacteria found in poultry,
but never let the liquid in raw poultry drip onto salads, sauces, condi-
ments, and the like.
 Keep a separate color cutting board only used for raw poultry. You can
significantly reduce the chances that you cut lettuce on the same board
you sliced chicken on if they’re different colors.
 Clean your knife after cutting raw poultry. Wash it thoroughly in hot,
soapy water.
 Thoroughly sanitize any surfaces that come into contact with any raw
poultry or its juices. Use an antibacterial cleaner that’s specifically made
for this purpose.
 Always cook poultry to the appropriate food-safe temperature, as listed
in Table 13-1.

Chicken Breasts with 
Lemon and Garlic
This dish, by Christopher Lee from the Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see
Appendix A), takes full advantage of a chicken breast’s white, lean meat. Just remember
to remove the skin after the chicken has cooked.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
1 A few hours before cooking, season the chicken breasts with salt. Refrigerate the
chicken and bring to room temperature when ready to use.
2 In a small sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and add the garlic. Cook it over
medium-low heat, allowing it to brown but not burn. Shake the pan occasionally or stir
the garlic with a spoon to keep it from burning. Add a little water if the garlic starts to
brown too much. Cook the garlic until it is soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.
3 Once the garlic is soft, in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, heat the remaining olive
oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and slowly brown the chicken, skin side down, until the
skin is golden and crisp. Turn the breasts over and reduce the heat to medium-low.
4 Once you flip the breasts, add the garlic and olive oil sauce to the chicken pan. Add half
the lemon juice, the white wine, the chicken stock, the thyme, and half the lemon zest.
Bring the sauce to a simmer and cover. Continue cooking for approximately 5 to 7 min-
utes, or until the breasts are cooked through and tender, but not dried out. Check the
chicken and sauce occasionally, stirring as needed. If the pan begins to dry, add a little
water to maintain about a half inch of liquid in the pan.
5 When the chicken is cooked and its juices run clear, remove it from the pan to a warm
serving platter. Keep warm. Increase the heat in the skillet until the sauce begins to boil,
and then shut off the heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Adjust the sea-
sonings with salt, pepper, and the remaining lemon juice, if desired. Pour the sauce over
the chicken.
6 Garnish with the remaining lemon zest. Remove the chicken skin before eating.

Chicken Scampi
When we say you can enjoy good food that is good for you, this dish is an example of
exactly what we mean. Food writer Heather Dismore created this dish that’s delicious
and lowfat. The total fat and saturated fat content are low simply because you’re using
skinless chicken breast — the leanest part of the chicken. The recipe calls for some
butter, but just enough to enrich the flavor without significantly raising the fat content.
The chicken is full of wonderful flavor from fresh herbs, lemon juice, wine, and a sprin-
kle of Parmesan cheese. The longer you can marinate the chicken, the more flavor it will
have when done.
Preparation time: 6 to 7 hours (mostly marinating time)
Cooking time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced, divided
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh oregano
1⁄4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1⁄4 cup white wine, divided
5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves,
4 ounces each, cut into 1-inch strips
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄4 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄2 cup Roma tomatoes, diced
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 Combine the pepper, half the garlic, the salt, oregano, parsley, lemon juice, and half of
the wine in a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken. Mix gently to coat the chicken
with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for several hours (overnight is best).
2 When ready to cook the chicken, preheat the broiler, on low if your range has this set-
ting. Remove the chicken from the marinade (save the remaining marinade) and place
in a shallow pan. Broil 8 inches from the heat, turning once, until the chicken is no
longer pink inside (about 15 minutes).
3 While the chicken is broiling, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan. Sauté the remaining garlic,
until fragrant, but not browned. Add the remaining white wine to the sauté pan and
scrape to remove any bits on the pan. Add the remaining marinade and chicken stock.
Bring to a boil. Reduce the sauce by half. Stir in the butter and tomatoes. Season with salt
and pepper, as needed. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Top with the Parmesan cheese.

Many markets, grocery stores, and even warehouse clubs carry cooked 
rotisserie-roasted chickens. They’re a great choice for a quick shortcut to a
homemade meal. Pick one up to shave time off your prep work for this next
recipe, featuring oven-roasted chicken breast.
Barbecue Chicken Potato Hash 
with Oven-Dried Tomatoes
You may be surprised, but this dish (shown in the color section) is a nutritional power-
house! Not so surprising is that coming from Tom Wolfe of Peristyle in New Orleans
(see Appendix A), it’s delicious, as well. The oven-dried tomatoes and barbecue sauce
(find the sauce recipe in Chapter 15) contribute a ton of vitamin C, lycopene, and beta
carotene, all important antioxidants, as well as plenty of vitamin A, which plays a key
role in eye health. Enjoy this one and all its benefits — with little fat and few carbohy-
drates, but lots of great flavor.

A paillard (pronounced pie-yarhd) is a fancy French word that basically means
a cutlet, or a slice of meat that’s been pounded to a thin, even thickness (or
thinness depending on your viewpoint). Some people call it a medallion (when
they’re small) or scaloppine. This process has two benefits.
 The meat cooks evenly, because there are no thicker or thinner sections.
 The meat cooks fairly quickly because it’s thin.
Try this handy technique for yourself by taking a look at Figure 13-1 and fol-
lowing the next recipe.
Paillard of Chicken Breast 
with Fennel and Parmigiano
Laura Maioglio, owner of Barbetta Restaurant in New York City (see Appendix A), has
provided this wonderful dish, to be enjoyed any time of the year. However, it’s perfect for
the summer months, because it’s a light dish with fresh ingredients, and can be cooked
on the barbecue, as well. The fennel and Parmigiano cheese offer two very opposing

flavors but come together with the chive and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. The ingredi-
ents create deep layers of flavor, requiring very little added salt.
Notice that the skin has been removed prior to cooking the chicken. By searing the
breasts in a hot pan, the juices become locked within the chicken’s crisp coat, keeping
the breast from drying out.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
215
Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
1 bunch fresh chives
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Pinch of salt
1 bulb fennel
4 cups baby arugula
4 ounces Parmigiano, sliced paper thin
11⁄4 pounds cherry tomatoes
Salt and pepper
4 full boneless skinless chicken breasts,
6 ounces each, pounded flat
3 ounces sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, puréed
2 lemons, halved
1 Chop the chives. In a blender, blend the chives with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the
pinch of salt.
2 Slice the fennel into paper-thin slices.
3 Arrange four dinner plates with baby arugula on one side and fennel slices layered with
Parmigiano slices over arugula. Halve the cherry tomatoes and place on either side of
the salad.
4 Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken breasts.
5 Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan. When the pan is very
hot, place the 4 chicken breasts in the pan. Cook the breasts until they’ve acquired a
golden color. Flip the breasts over and do the same to the other side. The breasts
shouldn’t cook more than 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Don’t let the breasts become dry.
6 Place 1 chicken breast paillard on each plate next to the salad. Season with salt and
pepper. With a spoon or squirt bottle, dribble the chive sauce and the tomatoes over
and around the chicken breast paillards to create a colorful design.
7 Dress the salad plate with a drizzle of olive oil and a lemon half.
Tip: Fennel is a terrific herb you may not be familiar with. The thick bulb (sometimes
called the “head”) has a thick, cabbagelike texture and the rich flavor and aroma of
licorice. (You can see what fennel looks like in Chapter 9.) Save the stringy tops, which
resemble dill weed, for a fun and unusual garnish.

Marinating chicken for hours or even overnight is a great way to maximize
flavor and add moisture to chicken breasts. Make up your own marinades
based on what you’re in the mood for. Here are some ideas to get you started.
 Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and oregano
 Light soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and minced ginger
 Lowfat salad dressing, like Italian or Greek vinaigrette
Include an acid of some sort in your marinade to help break down some con-
nective tissue in the meat, making it more tender and helping it to absorb the
marinade flavor more completely. Good acid choices include citrus juice and
vinegar. The marinade in the following recipe features lemon juice.
Roast Free-Range Chicken Breast 
Stuffed with Porcini Mushrooms, 
Caramelized Leeks, and Pancetta
This dish is fantastic (courtesy of the Baricelli Inn in Cleveland — see Appendix A) and
surprisingly simple. Although you want to keep the skin on while cooking the chicken,
be sure to remove it after you sit down to eat. The skin is full of artery-clogging satu-
rated fat. You won’t even need the skin when you taste the pancetta. Pancetta is essen-
tially Italian bacon, although it has a higher fat content and slightly saltier flavor than
traditional bacon. For this reason, use it in moderation, as more of a condiment, than a
main ingredient in dishes. Just a small amount can impart a delicious smoky flavor.
To create the delightful sauce, you need to rehydrate dried mushrooms. Rehydrating
is easy, but remember: Always strain the liquid used to rehydrate mushrooms before
adding it to any recipe. Gently pour it through a coffee filter to remove any dirt or grit.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
216
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
1⁄2 cup dried porcini mushrooms
2 cups warm water, divided
3 sun-dried tomatoes
4 ounces lean pancetta (approximately 8 thin
slices), diced
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium leek, tough greens removed, rinsed
well, diced small
4 chicken breasts, skin on, boned and tenders
removed, about 6 ounces each
Salt and pepper
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme
4 cups watercress, washed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 cups low-sodium chicken stock

1 Place the oven rack in the lower area of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Set
aside a large roasting pan.
2 Place the porcini mushrooms in 1 cup of warm water. Let rest for 15 minutes. Repeat the
process in a separate cup of water with the sun-dried tomatoes. Strain the porcini from
the water and reserve the water. Cut the mushrooms into fine juliennes. Strain the sun-
dried tomatoes from the water and discard the water. Cut the tomatoes into fine juliennes.
3 Sauté the pancetta in a pan until fat is rendered out, but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
4 Heat the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat. When hot, add the leeks and
cook until lightly browned, about 41⁄2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, tomatoes, and
pancetta to the sauté pan.
5 To assemble the chicken breasts, pull the skin back and season both sides with salt and
pepper. Sprinkle with thyme on both sides. Spread about 1⁄2 cup of the mushroom mix-
ture over each chicken breast. Cover with skin. Place in the reserved roasting pan. Top
the chicken breasts with any additional stuffing mixture that is remaining.
6 Place in the oven and roast until browned, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the
chicken to a warm platter.
7 Toss the watercress with the olive oil and vinegar.
8 Deglaze the pan. Combine the porcini mushroom water and chicken stock in the pan
used for the chicken. Simmer until reduced to 1⁄3 cup, about 6 to 8 minutes.
9 Serve the chicken breasts over the watercress and pour the sauce on top.

Sampling Different Bits of the Bird
Although chicken breasts are a heart healthy choice, they can become boring,
even with our great sampling of recipes in the previous section. If you’re look-
ing to maximize your enjoyment of poultry and try some different pieces of
chicken, this section is for you.
Loving chicken legs
Chicken legs are fun to eat at any age, because they come with their own
handle. They cook fairly quickly because they have a large bone running right
through the center. If you think legs are just for kids, give this sophisticated

recipe a try. The recipe also features a variety of mushrooms, some of which
you can check out in Figure 13-2.
Braised Chicken Legs with Mushrooms
This recipe is a great one-pot dish from Chris Prosperi of Metro Bis in Simsbury,
Connecticut (see Appendix A). It has everything you need: the meat, the starch, and the
veggie. With the good however, comes the chicken skin. Feel free to keep the skin on the
chicken while cooking. Just be sure to take it off before your first bite. Eat the good stuff
and leave the saturated fat behind.

1 cup warm water
6 chicken legs
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 cup chopped onion
10 cloves garlic
1 cup chopped carrots, 1-inch dice

1 Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1 cup warm water for about 10 minutes prior to use.
2 Rinse the chicken well and spot dry with paper towels. Then season with salt and heat a
heavy-bottomed roasting pan large enough to hold all 6 legs and vegetables over medium-
high heat. Add the oil and sear the legs for 7 to 10 minutes, browning the chicken on all
sides.
3 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Remove the legs from the pan and add the onion and
garlic. Cook for 2 minutes over medium heat. Add the carrots and potatoes and cook for
2 minutes more. Add the mushrooms. Return the chicken legs to the pan and add the
red wine. Bring to a simmer for 2 minutes and then add the chicken stock.
4 Cover with aluminum foil, place in the oven, and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove
from the oven and add the parsley and pepper. Check the seasoning and adjust with salt
and pepper if necessary. Serve with good crusty bread and a glass of dry red wine.

Tasting flavorful thighs
Chicken thighs are full of flavor. If you’ve sworn off dark meat in favor of the
standard boneless, skinless chicken breast, this next recipe may make you
change your mind.
Look in the frozen food section of your grocery store for IQF (individually
quick frozen) boneless, skinless chicken thighs to make this (and any other
chicken dish) quick and easy.

Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
1 cup red potatoes, 1 inch dice
11⁄2 cups assorted mushrooms (button,
portobello, shiitake)
1 cup dry red wine
1⁄2 cup chicken stock (low sodium if possible)
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper

Cilantro-Lime Chicken Thighs
Eliminating the skin from the chicken thighs reduces the fat content of this dish by
more than half. Heather Dismore provides this great marinade. The wonderful sauce in
which the chicken is marinated and cooked offers much good flavor — you won’t even
miss the skin! Broil or serve them at your next barbecue.
Yogurt is a great ingredient to use as a marinade when baking chicken. As the thighs
cook, the yogurt hardens and creates a nice thick crust, similar to fried chicken but
without all the added fat.

Talking Turkey to Liven Up Your Meals
A standard 31⁄2-ounce serving of white meat turkey, without the skin, has only
a gram of saturated fat, which is even less than the same size serving of a

chicken breast. Turkey is also a good source of B vitamins and many miner-
als, including iron, potassium, selenium, and zinc, especially in the dark meat.
If you buy a whole turkey, you tend to get more meat for your money by
buying a larger bird. With a small bird, in the 12- to 15-pound range, much of
what you get is bones, so you may be disappointed with the meager meat
that results from all your hard work. If you have more leftovers than you can
(or want to) eat in a couple of days, freeze the extra with a touch of chicken
broth to help keep it moist.
“Rotisserie”-Roasted Turkey Breast
Rotisserie chicken is available in just about every grocery store in the country. It’s a great
convenience food, and a relatively healthy one as well. But if you’re watching your salt
intake, you may not be able to enjoy this tasty food regularly. Heather Dismore created
this low-sodium version of the perennial favorite with turkey. Roast the turkey up out of
its own fat (either on a rack or on foil balls) for a true “rotisserie” experience at home.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours and 15 minutes
Yield: Varies based on weight of turkey, 6-ounce serving size
221
Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 turkey breast, 6 to 7 pounds, with skin
4 tablespoons lemon pepper
1 tablespoon ground sage
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Rub the olive oil into the turkey breast. Place the
turkey breast in a roasting pan with a rack. (If you don’t have a rack, roll up 6 balls of
foil and then place under the turkey in the roasting pan to elevate the turkey breast.) To
get a rotisserie-like final product, you need to make sure the turkey doesn’t sit in any fat
as it cooks. Set aside.
2 In a small bowl, combine the lemon pepper and ground sage. Sprinkle the combined
seasonings evenly over oiled turkey breast. Place the roasting pan in the oven. Cook for
45 minutes at 400 degrees. Then reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees to finish
cooking, approximately 11⁄2 hours, depending on the size of your bird. Cook the turkey
until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees with a meat thermometer.
Tip: Use this easy dry rub on any poultry you like. It’s great with chicken, Cornish game
hens, capons, and game birds.

Classic: Turkey Loaf with 
Portobello Sauce
Meatloaf is a homey food that became chic in recent years. You’ll find it served in
trendy gourmet restaurants, a witty addition to elaborate menus. This recipe is a
dressed-up version that calls for ground turkey and is topped with fancy portobello
mushrooms, those meaty giants you can find in the produce section of most supermar-
kets. Have this meatloaf for dinner and then in a sandwich the next day for lunch.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
222
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
The meatloaf:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 medium onion, minced
1 stalk celery, minced
1 pound lean ground turkey
1⁄4 cup chopped parsley
1⁄4 cup fine bread crumbs
1⁄4 cup skim milk
1 egg white, lightly beaten
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
The sauce:
2 teaspoons unsalted margarine (see the tip
at the end of the recipe)
1 large portobello mushroom, cleaned and cut
into small pieces (about 1 cup)
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1⁄8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 For the meatloaf, coat a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat
until hot. Add the onion and celery. Sauté, stirring often, until translucent, about 
5 minutes.
3 Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the turkey, parsley, bread crumbs, milk, egg white,
garlic, thyme, nutmeg, and pepper. Add the onion and celery and mix well.
4 Form into a loaf and place in a well-coated loaf pan. Bake 50 minutes or until the inter-
nal temperature is 165 degrees.
5 For the sauce, melt the margarine in a saucepan placed over medium heat. Add the
mushrooms. Sauté, stirring, until tender.

6 Remove from the heat. Add the chicken broth, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Return to heat.
Cook until fragrant and slightly thickened, 5 minutes.
7 When the meatloaf is cooked, unmold, slice, and place portions on warmed dinner
plates.
8 Ladle mushroom sauce over sliced turkey loaf.
Tip: Look for brands of margarine that aren’t made with hydrogenated oils, which contain
trans fatty acids.
Tip: Ground turkey is a great substitute for ground beef. Choose ground turkey without skin,
for the greatest savings in the saturated fat department. Use ground turkey anywhere you’d
use beef, such as pasta sauce, burgers, or casseroles.

P
rotein is an ideal food for people with dia-
betes because it contains only minimal carbo-
hydrate and, consequently, it doesn’t raise blood
glucose levels significantly under normal circum-
stances. Every time you eat, you need to be sure
to include some protein to balance the fat and car-
bohydrate in your diet. Meals that contain protein,
as well as fat and starch, help stabilize blood glu-
cose and can give you a more consistent supply of
energy.
Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues.
Meat is an excellent source of protein for this pur-
pose because it contains all nine essential amino
acids, those that must be obtained through diet.
Meat is also a source of B vitamins and many min-
erals needed for good health. In particular, it is
an excellent source of vitamin B12, essential for
normal functioning of the nervous system, and iron for transporting oxygen
to the cells.
In this chapter, we show you three great techniques for cooking meats to fit
in with a diabetic diet: searing, braising, and roasting. We give you great
recipes for each technique and other tips along the way.

Searing Meats for Culinary Success
A cooking technique called searing is particularly helpful for keeping meat
as lowfat and delicious as possible. Searing subjects meat to extremely high
heat on the stovetop for a short period of time. Usually you sear one side and
then the other. The technique produces a beautifully caramelized skin on the
meat and essentially seals in its juices. This process helps to retain the mois-
ture content of the meat and therefore much of the flavor.
Searing can be a great way to avoid the use of rich sauces and salt.

Thai Rare Beef with Red 
Onion and Kaffir Lime
Try this dish from Chef Kevin Rathbun of Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A) the next
time you have a craving for some Thai food. Purchase a lean beef cut, such as the top sir-
loin used here. Beef is a wonderful source of protein, but it can be excessive in saturated
fat and cholesterol. Always be sure to trim all excess fat from the meat, as the white mar-
bling in meat products is the stuff that clogs arteries and raises cholesterol levels.
Be sure not to add any extra salt here. The thai fish sauce and light soy sauce already
contribute plenty! In fact, ordinarily, we wouldn’t suggest a dish with this much sodium,
but every now and then, splurge a little — just don’t make it a habit! To round out the
meal a bit, serve over a bed of brown rice or quinoa (a grain high in protein and fiber.)
Check out Chapter 10 for great grain recipes.

Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
1 pound beef top sirloin (fat removed)
1⁄2 cup light soy sauce
1⁄4 cup chopped cilantro stems
1 cup lime juice (freshly squeezed)
1⁄3 cup palm sugar (if not available, use
granulated)
1 tablespoon nam pla (thai fish sauce)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large red onion, thinly sliced
1⁄4 cup scallions, 1⁄2-inch diagonally sliced
1⁄4 cup cilantro leaves
3 kaffir lime leaves, chiffonade (optional)
1 In a bowl, marinate the beef with the soy sauce and the cilantro stems for 1 to 3 hours.
2 In a small pot, place the lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce. Heat over medium-low to low
heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar melts. Set aside and chill.
3 Heat a sauté pan over high heat, at least 5 minutes. Remove the sirloin from the mari-
nade and discard the marinade. Add the olive oil and sear the top sirloin on both sides,
approximately 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and thinly slice.
4 In a large bowl, add the red onion, scallions, cilantro leaves, and, if desired, the kaffir
lime leaves. (See Chapter 9 for info on how to get lime leaves chiffonade.) Place the
sliced beef on top and pour the chilled sauce over all.

Veal tenderloin is a healthy option compared with many other cuts of meat
that can be quite high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Because it’s naturally
low in fat, cook veal quickly at high temperatures to keep as many of the nat-
ural juices as possible. Searing veal is a great choice.
Veal Tenderloin with Chanterelle 
Mushrooms in a Muscat 
Veal Reduction Sauce
A medallion is a small, coin-shaped piece of meat. Medallions are very thin, so once you
sear them, you don’t need to finish them in the oven. With just a short searing time,
you’ll create perfectly tender slices of veal. Serve this terrific recipe, from Baricelli Inn in
Cleveland (see Appendix A), with cavatelli pasta and the Haricot Vert from Chapter 11,
also contributed by the Baricelli Inn.

4 veal tenderloin medallions, approximately
6 ounces each (silver skin removed), pounded
thin (check out Chapter 13 for details on
pounding meat into cutlets)
1⁄2 cup flour
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 ounces wild mushrooms (chanterelle if

If you sear a thicker piece of meat like a chop or even a roast, quickly sear
the outside and then finish the meat in the oven. Searing seals in the natural
juices, and roasting finishes the cooking process to desired perfection. Check
out Table 14-1, earlier in this chapter, for tips on choosing the right tempera-
ture for your taste and your cut of meat.
Pan-Roasted Veal Chops with 
Corn and Gouda Ragout
Chef Kevin Rathbun of Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A) offers another dish burst-
ing with flavor that won’t break the day’s calorie bank. The original recipe contains a bit
more salt than we can recommend, so we made some minor modifications. But don’t
worry. You won’t miss a thing — the dish remains full of other herbs and ingredients
that offer intense flavors and great taste.
A ragout (pronounced ra-goo) is a thick, flavorful stewlike concoction that usually fea-
tures meat and sometimes features vegetables. In this recipe, pan-roasted corn is paired
with creamy Gouda cheese. It’s great with the delicate veal medallions.
Preparation time: 1 hour and 15 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
229
Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
Steak seasoning:
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
Corn ragout:
2 cups yellow corn kernels, fresh or frozen
1⁄2 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon chopped scallions
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
Salt and pepper
1⁄4 cup grated Gouda cheese
Veal chops:
4 veal chops, 7 ounces each
2 tablespoons steak seasoning (see Step 1)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 To prepare the steak seasoning, preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Place the salt, pepper,
garlic, and sage into a food processor and process 15 seconds. Transfer to an oven-safe
dish and place in the oven for 30 minutes. After the garlic dries out, transfer back to the
food processor and process 15 seconds. Set the seasoning aside. Increase the oven tem-
perature to 400 degrees.
(continued)

2 To make the ragout: Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat, at least 5 to 6 minutes. Add
the corn and continue to cook until it becomes charred, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.
Add the garlic, milk, scallions, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.
Reserve.
3 Heat a large ovenproof sauté pan over high heat. Season the veal chops with the pre-
pared steak seasoning. Add the olive oil to the heated skillet. Sear the chops in the olive
oil until golden brown on both sides, approximately 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the
400-degree oven and roast until desired doneness. Check out Table 14-1 to find the right
temperature for you and test your chops with a meat thermometer.
4 When ready to serve, place the corn ragout on plates and sprinkle the Gouda cheese
over the corn. Place the veal chops on top of the corn and serve.

Understanding the Basics of Braising
Braising is a terrific cooking method for meats, vegetables, and anything else
you want to make tender and tasty. Basically, braising involves cooking a cut
of meat in a small amount of liquid. The meat gently cooks and steams, or
braises, at the same time. Braising is particularly effective for less expensive
cuts of meat, because you cook it slowly and break down the tougher muscle
over time.
Braising is also a great cooking method because it requires very little use of
added fats, such as butter and oil. You can braise foods either in the oven or
in a pot on the stove. Try it out with the following great recipe.
Beer-Braised Pork and Crisp-Herb 
Cabbage with Apple-Tarragon 
Dipping Sauce
Chef Tom Wolfe, from Peristyle in New Orleans (see Appendix A), has developed this
diabetic-friendly dish (shown in the color section). Pork comes from a pig, so it must be
high in fat, right? Well actually, that’s only half true. In recent years, pork has gained
attention as “the other white meat.” As it turns out, the fat content of pork depends on
the cut of the meat. The rump and rib roast, for example, are much higher in fat and
cholesterol than the pork tenderloin, boneless sirloin chops, or boneless loin roasts.

In this dish, try to use a lean cut of pork, such as the tenderloin, which is a naturally
tender cut of meat and will remain moist from the slow-cook method of braising.

Recommending Roasting
Roasting is a simple technique that requires little effort. Season meat with
herbs and spices and cook it in the oven until it reaches a desired degree of
doneness. You just need to ensure that the meat doesn’t dry out, a possibility
with this dry-heat method of cooking. Here are some suggestions:
 Slow-roast meat at a low temperature, 350 degrees and below.
 Wrap meat in foil for most of the cooking time and remove only for the
last half hour of cooking — to allow the meat to brown.
 Cook roasts with the bone still attached, when possible, because the
meat cooks faster and has more flavor that way.
Putting roasted pork on your table
Try the recipes in this section the next time you have a taste for pork — a
great source of lean meat.

Spit-Roasted Pork Loin with 
White Beans all’ Uccelletto
This is fine dining and comfort food at its best. From Chef Chris Fernandez at Poggio in
Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), this dish will leave you satisfied in more ways
than one. The pork loin remains tender and delicious all the way through, with notice-
able hints of rosemary and thyme. The pork is delicious, and yet with little trace of fat,
while the White Beans all’ Uccelletto are a wonderful complement to the meat, (as well
as a great source of fiber!) This is purely guilt-free dining, so enjoy!
Uccelletto is the general Italian term for small game birds. So to cook something all’
uccelletto means to cook it like you would a small game bird. No need to pluck feathers,
truss your beans, or even stuff them. Here we mean to season the beans as you would
(or actually as Italians would) small game birds, specifically with tomatoes, garlic, and
sage. You can definitely add other spices, but these three are almost always present.
This dish is old school Italian comfort food, so enjoy.
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 1 to 2 hours
Yield: 6 servings
233
Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
1 pork loin, 3 to 4 pounds, bone in
1 bunch sage (approximately 7 or 8 picked
leaves)
1 bunch rosemary (leaves picked)
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper
1 To prepare the pork loin, cut down the back of the loin along the rib bones to separate
the meat from the bones. Do not completely remove the bones. Place the sage leaves,
rosemary leaves, chili flakes, and salt and pepper to taste between the loin and the
bones. Bring the bones and the loin back together and tie the roast with butcher’s
twine. Season the outside of the roast with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to
roast. This may be done up to 2 days prior to roasting, and it’s best to do it at least one
day ahead so that the herbs can flavor the meat.
2 To prepare the pork loin by using a rotisserie: Place the pork on the spit and roast over a
high flame for 30 to 40 minutes or until the roast reaches 145 degrees. Remove from the
spit, cover loosely with foil and let rest approximately 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.
To prepare the pork loin by roasting in an oven: Place the roast on a roasting pan and
roast at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 degrees. Continue
to cook, approximately 40 to 45 minutes, until the internal temperature of the roast
reaches 145 degrees. Remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil, and let rest approx-
imately 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.
3 To serve, place the warm beans (see the accompanying recipe) on a platter. Remove the
butcher’s twine from the pork roast. Slice the roast into 6 equal chops and place the
chops next to the beans.

1⁄4 pound prosciutto, diced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
Salt
In a medium saucepan add the olive oil. Over low heat cook the onion, garlic, rosemary,
and sage until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the beans and some of the juice
(roughly 3 to 4 tablespoons), reserving the rest in case you want the beans moist later.
Add the prosciutto and the tomato paste. Combine thoroughly to achieve a dark orange
color. Season with salt to taste and simmer for up to 2 hours to fully flavor the beans.

Classic: Loin of Pork Glazed 
with Roasted Vegetable Salsa
Loin of pork is preferred for oven roasting because slicing it for serving is so easy.
However, loin of pork can easily become dry. This recipe specifies loin of pork with the
bone left in, which yields moister, more flavorful meat and gives you more flexibility in
timing.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 11⁄2 to 2 hours
Yield: 6 servings or more
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh sage leaves or 1
teaspoon dried sage
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
Pepper
2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch
cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed
1⁄3 cup Roasted Vegetable Salsa (see the
following recipe)
1⁄3 cup Dijon-style mustard
1 pork loin roast, 3 to 4 pounds, bone-in
1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2 In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, sage, salt, and pepper to taste.

3 Arrange the potatoes in a roasting pan that is also large enough to hold the pork. Toss
the potatoes with 1 teaspoon of the garlic-sage mixture and the olive oil. Place the pan
in the heated oven while you prepare the pork.
4 In a bowl, combine the Roasted Vegetable Salsa and mustard. Spread the mixture over
the pork.
5 Take the potatoes out of the oven, place the pork loin on top of the potatoes or along-
side them, and put the pan back in the oven. Roast undisturbed for 30 minutes.
6 Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Stir the potatoes, using a spatula to scrape them
off the bottom of the pan if necessary. Lower the heat to 325 degrees and continue to
cook, stirring the potatoes every 15 minutes or so.
7 After 11⁄4 hours total cooking time, check the pork for doneness by inserting an instant-
read thermometer into several places in the meat. When the thermometer reads 145
degrees, remove the roasting pan from the oven. Transfer the pork to a platter and let it
rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. During the resting time, the temperature should
continue to rise to 155 degrees, leaving only a trace of rosiness in the center of the meat.
(Cook pork to an internal temperature of 150 degrees and a resting temperature of 160
degrees if you prefer pork well done.)
8 Return the potatoes to the oven to keep warm, lowering the heat to 325 degrees.
9 Carve the meat and serve the potatoes. Enjoy with a green vegetable such as sautéed
zucchini. Savor the pork the next day in a sandwich, along with sautéed onions and
more salsa.
Roasted Vegetable Salsa
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours for salsa to stand
Cooking time: 20 minutes

Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
1 pound ripe tomatoes
2 medium poblano chiles
2 red onions, sliced 1⁄4-inch thick
4 garlic cloves, peeled
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄2 cup tomato purée
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 Place the tomatoes and chiles over the hot fire of a grill or in a broiler pan and grill or
broil on all sides until they are charred and blackened. Remove from the grill or broiler
and transfer to a large bowl. Loosely cover and set aside.
2 Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
(continued)

3 Drizzle the onions and garlic with the olive oil. Toss them together to coat and then
spread them in one layer on a baking sheet. Roast them, stirring occasionally, until the
onions are soft and brown and the garlic is soft and lightly browned in spots, about
15 minutes. Remove and cool at room temperature.
4 Peel the charred tomatoes and remove cores, catching any juice in a bowl, and add the
peeled, cored tomatoes to the juice. Set aside. Peel the chiles, remove the seeds and
stems, and cut into 1⁄4-inch dice. Place the chiles in a medium-size bowl.
5 Place the roasted onion and garlic in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and
process until moderately finely chopped. Add to the bowl with the diced chiles and stir.
Put the grilled tomatoes in the processor and process coarsely. Add the chopped toma-
toes, tomato purée, cilantro, and thyme to the bowl.
6 Season the tomato salsa with the salt. Stir in the vinegar. Cover and refrigerate for a
couple of hours to allow flavors to develop. Taste again before using and adjust the sea-
soning if necessary.

Looking at roasted lamb dishes
Try roasting lamb with the following recipes. Leave the bones on the chops in
the first recipe for quicker cooking and a beautiful presentation.
Roasted Lamb Sirloin with Herbes 
de Provence, Spinach, and Onion 
Ragout with Lamb Au Jus
Herbes de Provence is simply a mix of herbs commonly used in southern French cook-
ing. They happen to go wonderfully well with this lamb dish, by Chef Didier Labbe from
the Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A). Lamb is typically one of
those meats with more fat, so do your best to choose a leaner cut, like the sirloin.
Choose cuts with the least amount of white marbling, (or fat) within the meat and, as
with all meat dishes, remember to trim excess fat whenever possible!

Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 

The ragout contributes a wonderful flavor to the lamb and spinach, and the only ingre-
dient is onion! Be creative with your blender — you can make many wonderful, flavorful
sauces and spreads by using just a single fruit or vegetable.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
237
Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
4 lamb sirloin chops, 6 ounces each
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1⁄4 cup herbes de Provence
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 white onions, sliced
2 cups of water
1 bunch spinach
1⁄2 cup port wine
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
2 tablespoons butter
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2 Place the lamb sirloin chops in a roasting pan. Spread the Dijon mustard evenly over
the lamb chops. Sprinkle on herbes de Provence and lightly salt and pepper. Drizzle
lightly with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and roast 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to
325 degrees and continue roasting until the chops are medium rare (light pink inside),
or when a meat thermometer inserted in the center of a chop reaches 145 degrees.
3 While the chops are cooking, combine the onions and water in a large sauté pan or 
3-quart saucepan. Cover and simmer until the onions become soft. Remove the onions
from the pan and process them in a food processor until they’re smooth.
4 In the same sauté pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the spinach. Cover and cook
the spinach for about 3 to 4 minutes. Fold the onion purée into the spinach, season it
lightly with salt and pepper, and set it aside, but keep warm.
5 Remove the chops from the roasting pan to another dish and cover them with foil to
keep them warm.
6 Place the baking pan on the stove. On low heat, deglaze the pan by adding the port
wine, garlic, and butter. Reduce the mixture by one-fourth.
7 To serve, place the spinach mixture in the middle of each plate. Place one lamb chop on
top of the spinach and pour the port wine sauce over it.

2 tablespoons coriander seeds
1 large clove garlic, minced
1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 leg of lamb, about 5 to 7 pounds, with as
much surface fat removed as possible and
preferably at room temperature
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2 Put the coriander seeds in a plastic bag and crush the seeds with a rolling pin.
3 In a small bowl, mix the crushed coriander with the garlic, salt, and pepper.
4 Using a thin-bladed knife, cut several small slits in the lamb. Press the spice mix into
these cuts and rub the remaining spices all over the outer surface of the meat. Set aside
in the refrigerator for an hour or more to blend flavors.
5 Spray a large nonstick roasting pan with cooking spray. Put the pan on the stove and
place the lamb in the pan. Cook the lamb over medium-high heat, turning to sear and
brown all sides.
6 Move the lamb in the pan to the oven, roast the lamb for 30 minutes, and then lower the
heat to 350 degrees. Cook another half hour and check the internal temperature of the
lamb with a meat thermometer. Continue to check every 10 minutes until the desired
temperature is reached. (An internal temperature of 130 degrees indicates medium-rare,
and 135 degrees indicates medium. It is also a good idea to check in several places for
doneness. Total cooking time will be less than 11⁄2 hours.)
7 Before carving the lamb roast, let it rest for a few minutes. Serve with the pan juices.

In this chapter, we show you how to stock up on handy snacks, supplement
snacks with dips and sauces, and whip up light and easy mini-meals.
Keeping Healthy Snacks at the Ready
Many people grab whatever they can find for a quick snack because they’re
incredibly hungry. It’s easy to reach for a bag of chips, a candy bar, or a soda
if they’re handy. Instead of keeping these convenient, high-fat, high-sodium,
high-sugar foods handy, stock your fridge, freezer, and pantry with healthy
snacks that can satisfy you and keep you eating on your plan. For example,
you can make snack-size servings of cut-up fresh veggies, ready and waiting

Mixing it up with whole grains
Stock your pantry today with healthy whole-grain snacks like GORP. Here we
include whole grains, nuts, and dried fruit for a good all-around snack choice.
Feel free to substitute your favorite fruits and nuts as you experiment with
this tasty treat.

Why should you choose whole-grain snacks?
If you can have 6 saltines or 4 whole-wheat
crackers and you’re really hungry, which should
you choose? At first glance, the answer may
seem obvious. Choose the saltines because you
get 6 (compared to the 4 whole-wheat crack-
ers). But believe it or not, 4 whole-wheat crack-
ers will keep you fuller, longer. The whole grain
is the key. Your body works harder and longer to
digest the whole-wheat crackers. With saltine
crackers, the flour manufacturer has done
much of the work for you by refining the flour,
removing most of the fiber and nutrients. By
making your body work for its nutrition, you help
it work more efficiently, in turn helping you to
stabilize your blood glucose levels. For more
about adding grains to your diet, check out
Chapter 10.

Filling your freezer with treats
Some people just can’t seem to stay away from the snacks after dinner, espe-
cially the sweet ones. Maybe you just want something simple like a bowl of
ice cream or a more elegant chocolate mousse or cheesecake. Instead, con-
sider stocking your freezer with the following healthy, quick-grab snacks.
 Flavored ice cubes: Fill ice cube trays with your favorite sugar-free drinks,
like any flavor of Crystal Light. Freeze until frozen and then transfer the
individual ice cubes to a resealable plastic bag. Add a few lemonade ice
cubes to your next glass of strawberry kiwi beverage. Experiment with fla-
vors you like.

T Whole-Grain GORP
Good Old Raisins and Peanuts (known by generations of kids and hikers as GORP) gets
an update with delicious whole-grain cereal choices and readily available dried fruits.
Use golden raisins, diced dried apricots, or any other fruit that appeals to you. It’s a
great anytime snack to keep ready and waiting in resealable plastic bags in your pantry.
GORP makes for a mighty healthy treat too, as long as portions are well controlled. A
good source of protein and fiber makes GORP a good glucose-controlling snack. Dried
fruit is a great way to get in your fruit servings, but it’s still a concentrated form of
sugar and if eaten excessively can send blood sugars to the moon. Nuts are an excellent
source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, but still a quarter cup packs about 200
kcalories. Enjoy this tasty treat (courtesy of food writer Heather Dismore) and its nutri-
tional benefits, in moderation, as always.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

 Grapes: Clean the grapes and remove them from their stems. Place indi-
vidual grapes on a clean baking sheet in the freezer. When the grapes are
frozen, transfer them to a resealable plastic bag. Grab a few when your
sweet tooth attacks.
 Sugar-free frozen pops: Many manufacturers are making freezer pops
from 100 percent juice or sweetening them with sugar substitutes.
 Yogurt tubes: Squeezable yogurt tubes can make a terrific quick snack.
Toss a few in the freezer for an extra creamy frozen treat.
This type of yogurt can have added sugar, so read your labels carefully
to make sure you know what you’re eating, and confirm that it fits with
your eating goals.
If you love frozen desserts, consider opting for a low-sugar, preportioned
frozen concoction, like these Orange Cream Pops.
T Orange Cream Pops
Just when you feel a sugar craving coming on after dinner, think twice about that dish of
ice cream. Finish off a great meal with one of these low-sugar orange cream treats, cour-
tesy of Heather Dismore. They’re cool, refreshing and just sweet enough to quench a
sugar craving.

Adding Dips and Sauces to Snacks
Condiments are typically used to flavor or complement other foods. But
some condiments are so delicious and craveable that you may want to eat
them all by themselves. Condiment may be a bit of an understatement for the
tasty recipes in this section. They can both be terrific spreads for sandwiches
or lettuce wraps. Use them as sauces to top grilled chicken or firm fish.
Dips are a creative way to get in lots of vegetables. Unfortunately, most dips
tend to be very high in calories and fat. What is considered a light snack can
quickly turn into a full meal’s worth of calories and fat. So skip the fat and
keep the flavor with this excellent vegetable dip. (Check out Chapter 7 for
more dips to try.)

Choosing kid-friendly snacks
Many children are afflicted by diabetes. Often,
their parents and other caregivers need to learn
about the disease from scratch. Check out
Chapter 22 for more tips on helping kids cope
with diabetes. Also, check out Diabetes For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by Alan Rubin,
MD, and published by Wiley, for more great kid-
friendly tips.
Here’s a list of snacks designed with diabetic
kids in mind. Teach kids how to snack well early
in life, and they’ll be better equipped to deal with
diabetes as they grow.
 Snack-sized bag of light microwave 
popcorn
 Whole-wheat pretzels with mustard
 Cup of lowfat yogurt
 Sugar-free gelatin cup
 Lunchmeat rollup
 An apple with a small dollop of peanut
butter
 Celery sticks dipped in lowfat ranch 
dressing
 Turkey hot dog

1⁄2 cup cottage cheese
 1 ounce part-skim string cheese

1⁄4 cup roasted peanuts

T Roasted Veggie Dip
This dip from Heather Dismore is an excellent appetizer, food topper, condiment, or
omelet filling — you name it, it can work. The roasting of the vegetables brings out their
natural sugars, and the spices give it a kick. Snack on this no-fat dip with whole-wheat
crackers or check out our list of approved dippers in Chapter 7.

1 yellow squash, thick sliced
1⁄2 red onion, thick sliced
4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon seasoning salt

Salt and pepper
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray the eggplant, zucchini, squash, onion, and garlic
with the cooking spray, coating well.
2 In a small bowl, combine the cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, and chili powder. Add one-
fourth of the seasoning to the vegetables. Toss well to combine. Add another one-fourth
of the seasoning and toss well. Repeat until the vegetables are evenly coated and all the
seasoning is added. Adding the seasonings in stages helps combine the seasonings
evenly.
3 Spray a baking pan with the cooking spray. Add the vegetables in a single layer. Cook
vegetables in the oven, until browned, stirring occasionally, roughly 35 minutes.
4 Place the roasted veggies in the bowl of a food processor. Process to desired consis-
tency. Season with salt and pepper as necessary.

T Wolfe’s BBQ Sauce
Chef Tom Wolfe, from Peristyle in New Orleans (see Appendix A), has let you in on the
secret of his famous barbecue sauce — and it is good! You might have perused the
nutrition labels of some of your favorite sauces before and noticed just how high the
sugar content can really be. A great substitution that Chef Tom made here was to use
sugar-free syrup instead of the usual version, which, you may have guessed, is entirely
sugar. This is a good reminder to make substitutions like this whenever you can. Save
your blood sugars without sacrificing your favorite foods. This sauce (in the color sec-
tion) is approved for dipping grilled chicken and veggies, slathering on a hunk of firm
fish, or topping a pita for an impromptu barbecue chicken pizza. But definitely try it
with the Barbecue Chicken Potato Hash in Chapter 13.

Preparing Mini-Meals
Eating small portions of well-balanced meals can be a great way to fit a nutri-
tious and filling snack into your day. Maybe you ate a light brunch and are
waiting for a late dinner. Maybe you had a really early breakfast and can’t fit a
full lunch in until late in the day. Or maybe you just find it easier to maintain
even blood sugar levels by eating five or six small meals each day. Whatever
the reason, mini-meals can help you eat right.

Choosing chicken
For diabetics, chicken is a great basis for a mini-meal because it provides pro-
tein that is slowly changed to sugar in your body. Try the following two recipes
to enjoy a taste of chicken.
Greek-Style Chicken Wraps
These wraps are quick and easy. They might remind you of a Greek gyro sandwich, but
they’re lower in fat because we use boneless skinless chicken breast in our version.
Experiment with different herbs, like basil, and cheeses, like feta, to find the flavor com-
binations you like. Also, keep this chicken ready and in the freezer for emergency snack-
ing. It’s great to toss with salad greens, chop into a quick casserole, or make these wraps
in minutes.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 2 servings

Nonstick cooking spray
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 4 ounces
each, pounded thin
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon oregano, crushed and dried
2 thin slices Vidalia onion
2 whole-wheat tortillas, 10-inch variety
1⁄4 cup lowfat plain yogurt
1⁄4 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped cucumber
1⁄4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat an 8 x 8 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking
spray. Brush the chicken breast on both sides with lemon juice and oregano. Place the
chicken breast and onion in the baking dish. Bake for approximately 25 minutes.
2 When the chicken is done, transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1⁄2-inch strips.
3 Spread out the tortillas on a flat surface. Spread equal parts of yogurt on top of the tor-
tillas. Top with equal parts chicken, onion, cucumber, cheese, and mint.
4 Roll up the wraps and serve warm.

Quick Chicken Tostadas
Mexican food is often considered to be pretty high in fat and cholesterol, but it doesn’t
have to be. In fact, common ingredients in Mexican cooking, such as beans, chicken,
olives, and tomatoes, are very healthy. Not so good, on the other hand, are fried tor-
tillas, extra cheese, and high-fat sour cream. If you have a craving for nachos or que-
sadillas, traditionally very high in calories and saturated fat, try these light tostadas
instead, courtesy of Heather Dismore. They’re full of flavor and incorporate traditional
Mexican ingredients but have half the calories and fat. When preparing tacos or other
Mexican-style dishes at home, be sparing with the toppings, which contribute the most
significant amount of calories and fat.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

Chapter 15: Having a Little Bite with Snacks
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray each tortilla lightly with cooking spray. Place
prepared tortillas on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Toast the tortillas until crisp,
approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven
temperature to 375 degrees.
2 Mix the chicken, salsa, cayenne pepper, chili powder, red pepper, and salt and pepper to
taste together in a mixing bowl. Top each tostada with one-sixth of the chicken mixture.
3 For each tostada, top the chicken mixture with one-sixth of the cheddar cheese. Return
the tostadas to the oven. Cook until the chicken is heated through and the cheese is
melted, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.
4 If desired, top each tostada with 1⁄2 teaspoon cilantro or green onions, 1 tablespoon sour
cream, and 1 teaspoon black olives.
Tip: For this recipe, you can purchase roasted chicken breast, or you can cook the chicken
breast yourself by poaching it, which means cooking it in water just below the boiling point
until it is cooked through (no longer pink inside).

Selecting seafood
Seafood, tuna in particular, is a great item for a diabetic to choose as a mini-
meal because, like chicken, it’s mostly protein and does not raise your sugar
rapidly. The following dish is easy to reduce to a snack size portion: Eat only
one skewer full of tasty goodness, and you cut the kilocalories (and the other
nutritional analysis) in half. Enjoy!
Tuna Dijon Brochettes
Tuna isn’t just for salad anymore. Fresh tuna has a beautiful ruby red color, a firm tex-
ture, and a meaty flavor. It goes well with spicy sauces and spices, like Dijon mustard.
With sweet pineapple and mild veggies, you get a full flavor experience.
Special tools: 2 metal skewers, 8 inches long
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 6 to 8 minutes

8 ounces tuna, fresh, cut into 6 equal chunks
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
4 mushrooms
4 squares red pepper, 1 inch each
4 slices zucchini, 1⁄4-inch thick
4 chunks fresh, peeled pineapple, 1 inch each
4 medium cherry tomatoes
Salt and pepper
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the broiler. In a bowl, coat the tuna chunks with the mustard.
2 Skewer the tuna, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, pineapple, and cherry tomatoes, alter-
nating each item twice, beginning and ending with a tuna chunk.
3 Sprinkle each skewer with salt and pepper to taste. Coat a baking sheet with the cook-
ing spray and place the skewers on the baking sheet. Broil for 6 to 8 minutes.

Picking pasta
Indulge in your cravings for Italian food with this version of the traditional
potato pasta, gnocchi. If you love Italian food, but can’t work in the right
starch exchanges, check out the eggplant lasagna and zucchini and cucumber
linguine with clams, both found in Chapter 11. You get all the Italian flavor
without any traditional pasta and the costly starch exchanges.

Chapter 15: Having a Little Bite with Snacks
Stocking your snack drawer at work
Getting through the workday and avoiding food
pitfalls can be challenging for anyone, particu-
larly so for the diabetic. The best defense
against the shared snacks of coffeecakes,
muffins, bagels, and doughnuts near the coffee
station is a good offense. Keep a healthy snack
drawer at work for snacking emergencies, and
you’re sure to save yourself some calories and
blood sugar spikes and dips. And remember: A
well-stocked snack drawer can be a lifesaver
on early days when you don’t have time to eat
breakfast before heading for work.
Here are some ideas for a diabetic’s snack
drawer:
 Light popcorn in snack-sized microwave-
able bags
 Individual servings of nuts
 Lowfat and low-sodium canned soups
 Fat-free, sugar-free gelatin and pudding
 Low-sugar protein bars
 Canned nutritional supplement drinks, like
Glucerna or Ensure
 Individual servings of sugar-free drink
mixes
 Individual cans of low-sodium vegetable
juice
 No-sugar-added juice boxes or bottles
When possible, choose individual serving sizes.
They’re proportioned to take the brainwork out
of grabbing a quick snack when you’re starved.
Plus, keeping track of how much you eat is
much easier when the nutritional information is
on each snack.

T Spinach-Ricotta Gnocchi
Here’s a great twist on the traditional gnocchi, or potato pasta. Chef Christopher
Fernandez at Poggio in Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), has creatively substituted
the white flour base to this usually high-carbohydrate food for ricotta cheese, a signifi-
cant source of protein. In doing so, the gnocchi will have far less of an effect on your
blood sugars and allow you to once again eat what you might have once considered
sinful! Enjoy this with your favorite red Italian pasta sauce.
Special tools: Cheesecloth, pastry bag
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 4 to 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
250
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
1⁄2 pound part-skim ricotta cheese
1 gallon water
1⁄4 pound fresh spinach
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
Pinch ground nutmeg
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons potato starch
1 tablespoon dehydrated potato flakes
2 tablespoons plus 2 cups flour
1 Place the ricotta in a strainer lined with cheesecloth and let sit overnight in the refriger-
ator to remove excess liquid.
2 Bring the 1 gallon of water to a boil, add the spinach, and boil for 30 seconds. Strain the
spinach and place the spinach on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the
spinach in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, squeeze out all the excess water from
the spinach. Chop the spinach as fine as you can on a cutting board. This may take
some time, but the finer the better.
3 To make the gnocchi, place the chopped spinach, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, nutmeg,
and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Mix until the spinach has been evenly distrib-
uted, and add the potato starch, dehydrated potato, and 2 tablespoons of the flour to
bind the mixture. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and drop a spoon-sized piece of
gnocchi to test the consistency and flavor. If the gnocchi is too wet and falls apart, add
another egg and some flour. The key to this gnocchi is to add the minimum amount of
binder so that the gnocchi are as light as possible.
4 Place a 6-quart pot on the stove with plenty of salted water to boil the gnocchi. Bring
the water to a boil and turn down until you’re ready to cook the gnocchi.
5 Place the remaining 2 cups of flour in a long baking pan. Shake the flour evenly around
in the pan. Place the gnocchi mixture into a pastry bag with a large straight tip about 1⁄2
inch in diameter. Pipe the gnocchi mixture in a long line directly into the flour, as if you
were making a long snakelike piece. You can make a couple of lines like this in the flour.

6 With a knife, cut the snakelike pieces into 1-inch pieces. With your hands, gently cover
the gnocchi lightly with flour, shake off any excess flour, and place directly into boiling
salt water. Cook the gnocchi for at least 5 minutes or until they float for 2 minutes.
Remove from the water.
Tip: You can serve these immediately or hold them for later use. If you plan to hold the
gnocchi, place the cooked gnocchi onto a lightly oiled sheet pan and place in the refrigera-
tor. Once cooled, you can place the gnocchi in an airtight container until ready to use. You
can reheat the gnocchi in boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes.

In This Chapter
 Filling out your meal plans with fruits
 Using juices the right way
 Enjoying chocolate treats
“S
ugar” is not a dirty word, even for a dia-
betic. But it’s no secret that the amount
of sugar consumed by Americans today is out of
control. Manufacturers sneak it into all kinds of
products, including prepackaged rice pilaf mix,
ketchup, and, of course, baked goods, under the
names high-fructose corn syrup and malt syrup.
Even though diabetes is a disease that involves
impaired metabolism of carbohydrates, you can
still enjoy desserts that contain starches and
sugar. You just need to select your ingredients
wisely and eat reasonably modest portions. But don’t waste time feeling
guilty because you can’t stay away from sweets. Sweet is one of the basic
tastes, just like sour and salty, and craving sweet foods is normal.
Of course, people crave sweets such as cookies, jelly doughnuts, pies, and
candy made with refined white flour and white sugar, which provide little
nutrition. Enriched white flour has had a significant portion of the nutrients
in the original whole grain removed, and white sugar contains no vitamins or
minerals at all.
In this chapter, we show you how to create appealing desserts that feature
nutritious ingredients. We help you satisfy your cravings for sweet foods,
including chocolate. And we give you a host of different presentations to
impress your guests.

Finding a New Take on Fruit
Diabetic desserts have long consisted of sugar-free gelatin and fruit. There’s
certainly nothing wrong with that, but if you’re bored with the standard take
on fruit, we have several recipes that help you improve upon that old stan-
dard, fruit, and give it an update you’d be proud to serve to anyone.
Baking with berries
Berries are like nature’s little juice boxes. They give a burst of juice, flavor,
and fiber, all in a tiny bite. Adding them to muffins, pancakes, and cakes can
add important antioxidants, fiber, and flavor that can improve the balance of
just about any recipe. So add a few to your next treat.
T Summer Berry-Olive Oil 
Polenta Cake
This recipe is offered by Vitaly Paley, from Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see
Appendix A). Polenta is similar to cornmeal and can be found in most supermarkets.
Have this as a light breakfast bread or as a dessert. Either way, you’ll certainly enjoy it.
Keep in mind that you can use any kind of berries you want — and if your favorite isn’t
in season, many grocery stores carry frozen berries year-round. Just defrost ’em before
you use ’em. Blueberries are one of the best sources of antioxidants, making them a
great choice.
This polenta cake is different from many other cakes you may be used to. Instead of
high-cholesterol, high-saturated-fat butter, this recipe calls for cholesterol-free, low-
saturated-fat olive oil. Olive oil is always the healthier choice. And although the original
recipe calls for sugar, we make one very important substitution, making it a bit more
suitable for a person with diabetes. To maintain some of that sweetness everyone
knows and loves, we recommend Splenda for Baking. It now contains only 3 grams of
sugar, compared to 30 grams in the original recipe!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 10 to 12 servings
254
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
3 eggs
13⁄4 cups Splenda for Baking
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1⁄4 cup olive oil
Zest and juice of 1 lemon
2 cups flour
3⁄4 teaspoon baking soda
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄3 cup dried polenta
2 cups fresh berries (or fruit such as peaches
or plums)

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Beat the eggs and Splenda on medium speed for about 30 seconds, until the mixture is
light in color.
3 Add the vanilla extract, olive oil, and lemon zest and juice; beat until combined.
4 Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add the flour mixture and the
polenta to the egg mixture and mix until combined.
5 Pour half of the batter into a greased Bundt cake pan.
6 Arrange the berries to cover the batter and then pour the remaining batter over the
berries.
7 Bake for about 50 minutes, or until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean.

Creating luscious fruit desserts 
with different flavorings
Even if you don’t have time to prepare a full-blown fruit recipe, you can still
concoct wonderful desserts and mouthwatering nibbles simply by using lus-
cious fruit and adding a special ingredient or two. You can use all sorts of
herbs, spices, and nuts to enhance the flavor of fruit. Some examples include:
 Peel a banana, freeze it, and then purée it in a food processor, along with
almond or peanut butter, and you’ll have a fruit version of ice cream.
 Purée ripe melon with lowfat vanilla yogurt, a dash of nutmeg and cinna-
mon, and a squirt of lemon for a refreshing fruit soup.
 Combine brown sugar substitute and lowfat vanilla yogurt. Layer the
yogurt with fresh fruit to create a parfait.
 Grill pineapple slices and then lightly coat with lemon juice, a dash of
honey, and cinnamon.
 Create fruit kabobs from your fresh favorites and marinate them in
lemon juice, nutmeg, and crushed mint.

Ginger and lemon brighten the sweet flavors of the cantaloupe and papaya in
the following recipe. Choose cantaloupes that are heavy for their size and
have a lightly sweet melon fragrance. A cantaloupe should be firm but give
slightly when pressed. Avoid melons with mushy spots or discolorations.
The papaya is a large pear-shaped tropical fruit. It contains a bed of large
peppery seeds in the center of the fruit. If you’re looking for a ripe papaya to
use immediately or refrigerate, choose richly colored papayas, with
splotches of bright yellow, green, and some orange. Green papayas will ripen
in a few days if left at room temperature and placed in a brown paper bag.

T Cantaloupe-Papaya Salad 
with Ginger Simple Syrup
Chef Kyle Ketchum of The Lark in West Bloomfield, Michigan (see Appendix A), offers
this fruity dessert sure to please the taste buds. It’s a simple recipe, using simple syrup.
Simple syrup is made from sugar and water; here, however, we substitute Splenda —
the non-sugar sweetener — for the same amount of sugar. Enjoy the natural fruit flavors
of these antioxidant-packed fruits with a little something extra drizzled lightly on top.
Preparation time: 20 minutes

Syrup:
1⁄4 cup (18 packets) Splenda
1⁄2 cup water
2 inches fresh gingerroot, peeled
1 tablespoon lemon zest
Fruit salad:
1 cantaloupe
2 papayas
4 mint sprigs
1 Bring the Splenda and water to a boil in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the
ginger and reduce the heat, allowing the liquid to simmer.
2 Stir until the Splenda dissolves and the ginger infuses the syrup, about 2 minutes.
Remove the pan from heat and take out the ginger. Allow the syrup to cool at room tem-
perature. Add the lemon zest.
3 Scoop out the meat of the fruits with a melon baller and then toss it with the simple
syrup and mint when you’re ready to serve it.

T Pears Baked in Red 
Wine alla Piemontese
This recipe, courtesy of Barbetta in New York City (see Appendix A), is a classic way
of preparing pears in Piemonte, Italy’s northwesternmost region. The pears should be
baked until the skins turn brown and crinkly — strafugna as they would say in the
Piemontese dialect. Here, we substitute Splenda for sugar, which causes the pears to
lack the almost candied taste of the traditional preparation. Splenda, however, is a 
natural-tasting artificial sweetener, so you’ll still be satisfied with the pear’s flavor.
Keep in mind, however, that since fruit and wine have natural sugars, we can’t com-
pletely discount the carbohydrate content of this dish, which (per serving) is equiva-
lent to almost 3 starch servings. Consider enjoying this delightful dessert after a meal
low in starch and only on occasion.

Juicing Your Way to Tasty 
and Healthy Treats
Fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so all the natural sugars can really
affect your blood sugar without all the fiber to slow it down. But with a little
diligence you can use fruit juice to flavor your desserts and still maintain
your blood sugar levels.
T Cranberry-Raspberry Granita
This refreshing treat, courtesy of Heather Dismore (and shown in the color section),
makes for a sweet dessert — except it doesn’t have any added sugar. Raspberries and
cranberries are some of the best sources of antioxidants, and you don’t even have to
wait for summer to take advantage of these nutritional powerhouses. Most berries are
available in frozen food sections of supermarkets and have all the great nutrition as
their fresh versions.
Preparation time: 6 hours and 30 minutes, mostly unattended

2 cups 100% juice cranberry-raspberry juice
blend
1 1⁄2 cups raspberries (fresh or previously
frozen, thawed, and drained)
1⁄2 cup Splenda sugar substitute
1 In a blender, combine the juice and raspberries. Mix well. Pour the mixture through a
fine-mesh sieve placed over a mixing bowl. Press the mixture gently through the sieve,
as necessary, to extract as much juice as possible. Discard the mixture in the sieve or
reserve for another use.
2 Add the Splenda to the strained juice mixture and stir to mix well. Cover and freeze. Stir
thoroughly with a fork about every 30 minutes, for 6 hours or so, or until the granita is
frozen in a crumbly, grainy texture.

Citrus fruits in particular make great juice choices for adding to desserts.
Their strong flavors mean a little can go a long way. And many are tart rather
than sweet, so they naturally have few sugars. For the scoop on how to juice
your own citrus, check out Chapter 7.
T Lemon Soufflé Tart
Tarts always make for a great dessert. We love the sweet, fruity filling and the savory,
crisp crust. The only problem is all the butter needed to produce that perfect crisp
crust. Pie and tart crusts, prepared traditionally with butter, are extremely high in calo-
ries and fat. Unfortunately, margarine is probably worse, because this butter alternative
is high in artery-clogging trans fats. The good news is that “lite” butters are becoming
more mainstream and available in most supermarkets. Many can be used in place of
butter, as spreads and even in cooking and baking. They’re lower in total calories and
cholesterol free and, most importantly, contain no trans fat. Be sure the ingredients
don’t contain “partially hydrogenated oils” to be sure the product has no trans fats.
Also choose a brand that can be used in both cooking and baking. Try a lite butter in
this soufflé tart, courtesy of Heather Dismore, and the next time you make a pie crust.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 8 servings
260
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
Crust:
3⁄4 cup all-purpose flour
3⁄4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
1 tablespoon Splenda
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup lite, trans-fat-free butter spread, chilled,
cut into pieces
2 tablespoons cold water
Filling:
2⁄3 cup Splenda
4 large eggs, yolk and whites separated
1⁄2 cup fresh lemon juice (approximately 2
lemons)
Zest from 1 lemon, finely minced
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 Make the crust: Combine the all-purpose and whole-wheat flours, the 1 tablespoon
Splenda, and the salt in the bowl of a food processor. Add the butter spread. Process
by using quick pulses to create a coarse mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of the water and
process for 5 seconds. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon water and process another few
seconds. The dough should begin to form a mass. Add a few more drops of water, if nec-
essary, to create a ball of dough.

2 Place the dough ball between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap. Roll the dough (still inside
the plastic wrap) into a disk, roughly 6 inches in diameter. Refrigerate the wrapped disk
for an hour.
3 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Roll the chilled dough to a 1⁄8-inch thickness. Remove
the top layer of plastic wrap. Place the tart pan face down on the dough. Holding the
bottom layer of plastic wrap and the tart pan, flip them over, so the pan is resting on
its bottom, the dough is in the pan, and the plastic wrap is on top. Remove the plastic
wrap. Press the dough into the fluted edge of the tart pan, allowing it to overhang
slightly. Trim off any excess edges.
4 Bake the crust until it begins to brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove the crust from
the oven and allow it to cool while you make the filling.
5 Make the filling: Beat 1⁄3 cup Splenda and egg yolks with an electric mixer on medium-low
for approximately 5 minutes, until the yolks turn a creamy pale yellow. Add the lemon
juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch. Beat until smooth and fully combined. Place the egg
yolk mixture in the top of a double boiler, over simmering water. Stir constantly until
the mixture thickens, approximately 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir for
another 2 minutes to help the mixture cool.
6 With clean beaters in a clean bowl, whip the egg whites until frothy. Gradually beat in
the remaining 1⁄3 cup Splenda. Continue to beat until the egg whites form stiff peaks.
Gently but thoroughly fold the egg whites into the warm egg yolk mixture. Spread the
filling evenly over the baked crust.
7 Bake the tart in the center of the oven until the filling is puffy and lightly browned,
approximately 27 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool
slightly. The filling will sink a bit as it cools. Cut into wedges and serve.

Choosing Chocolate for Dessert
What would life be without chocolate? Fortunately, you won’t have to specu-
late or even discover the situation for yourself. Mix up your own tasty choco-
late concoctions by substituting your favorite no-calorie sweetener for the
regular sugar.
And whenever possible, choose the highest-quality cocoa powder you can
afford. The flavor is much better, and since you’re only having a small portion
anyway, you definitely want the best-tasting bite you can get!

Mixing up some meringues
Meringue, essentially egg whites flavored and whipped to foamy peaks, is an
extremely versatile food. You can create little clouds to hold fresh fruit, top a
fruit pie, or even use it to cover a pound cake and ice cream (to create baked
Alaska). Meringue is naturally lowfat and takes on the flavor of any extracts,
like almond, mint, or chocolate, so experiment and enjoy!
T Chocolate Meringue Bits with 
Strawberries and Cream
These little meringues, courtesy of Heather Dismore, are a surefire way to satisfy your
chocolate cravings without all the calories and fat. We flavor them with cocoa powder
and Splenda to give fantastic flavor. And the texture of these “lite bites” is outstanding.
Top with fresh strawberries for a dash of fiber and vitamin C.
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus standing time of 8 hours or overnight
Cooking time: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Yield: Forty 11⁄2-inch meringues

Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
4 egg whites
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2⁄3 cup Splenda
1⁄3 cup cocoa powder
1 cup reduced-fat tub-style whipped topping
40 strawberries
1 Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2 Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and vanilla at high speed with an electric mixer
until frothy. Add the Splenda, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form,
roughly 5 to 7 minutes. Gently fold in the cocoa powder until completely incorporated.
3 Spoon heaping tablespoons of the mixture onto the baking sheets. Bake for 1 hour and
30 minutes; turn the oven off. Let the meringues stand in the closed oven for 8 hours or
overnight. Store in an airtight container.
4 Just before serving, top each meringue with 1 scant teaspoon of whipped topping and a
strawberry.

Enjoying a coffee break
Coffee is one of the most available beverages in our society these days. You
can’t even take a stroll through your local grocery store or mall without being
assaulted by the aromas of your local coffee roaster. And fortunately, most of
them offer delicious decaffeinated versions of these aromatic beverages. Steam
up a little nonfat milk to go with it, and you’re ready to relax for a few minutes.
For a decadent but diabetic-friendly coffee break, make your own decaf,
nonfat coffee drink (sweetened with sugar-free sweeteners, of course) and
pair it with our delicious, crunchy biscotti.
Chocolate-Almond Biscotti
Biscotti are a great treat, and now you can enjoy them homemade, and without all the
calories and sugar. This rendition of the Italian “biscuit” (courtesy of Heather Dismore)
is easy to make and takes no time. It’s also half the calories and carbohydrates of the
usual crusty cookie. See these treats in the color section.
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 20 servings

Chapter 16: Smart Ways to Include Dessert in a Diabetic Diet
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup almonds, toasted and roughly chopped
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄3 whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons instant coffee crystals
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup Splenda for Baking
1 egg
1 egg white
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray the
foil with nonstick cooking spray.
2 In a food processor, combine 1⁄4 cup of the almonds and the all-purpose flour, whole-
wheat flour, cocoa powder, coffee crystals, baking soda, and salt. Process until the nuts
are finely ground, approximately 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.
3 In the food processor, combine the Splenda, egg, egg white, vanilla extract, and almond
extract. Mix until the mixture is slightly thickened, roughly 2 minutes. Add the egg mix-
ture to the flour mixture in the mixing bowl. Stir in the remaining 1⁄4 cup almonds.
(continued)

4 Use half the batter to form a log (approximately 5 to 7 inches long) on one-half of the
foil-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough on other half of the baking
sheet. Bake until firm, approximately 15 minutes. Cool approximately 10 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.
5 Place the logs on a cutting board. Using a serrated bread knife, cut each log into approx-
imately 10 1⁄2-inch diagonal slices. Return the slices to the baking sheets. Bake until the
cut sides feel dry to the touch, approximately 20 minutes. Cool completely and store in
an airtight container.

Eating Away
from Home

In this part . . .
You may believe that — because you have diabetes —
you can no longer enjoy the creative cuisines and the
wonderful atmospheres and service of great restaurants.
This part puts that misinformation to rest with a resound-
ing bon appétit, French for “You are about to be treated to
a great restaurant meal.” The chefs and restaurant owners
in this book are interested in good nutrition as well as
delicious food. They agreed to work with us for that very
reason. They also want their customers to come back.
Unfortunately, we can’t guarantee that the recipes will
always be exactly as you find them in this book if you
order them in the restaurant that provided them. Chefs
change often in restaurants, and ingredients aren’t always
exactly the same. The chef may use regular-salt chicken
stock instead of low-salt chicken stock, for example. The
best you can do is ask that the food be prepared in the
way that you expect.
This part shows you the right way to eat away from home
by giving you tips for great restaurant dining experiences
and showing you how to choose the best possible fast
food when you’re on the go.

Chapter 17
Making Eating Out a Nourishing
Experience
In This Chapter
 Preparing to go to a restaurant
 Taking your seat
 Checking the menu
 Managing your eating at each meal and in different kinds of restaurants
 Finding ways to enjoy your food
 Considering dessert
P
eople eat many of their meals in restaurants these days, so integrating
restaurant eating into a nutritional plan is essential for a person with
diabetes. The restaurant business is booming, and creative chefs have the
same celebrity status as famous sports stars. And they deserve it. They use
fresh ingredients to produce some of the most delicious and unique tastes
imaginable. Unfortunately, nutrition isn’t always uppermost in their minds.
Our experience with the many chefs in this book proves that interest in good
nutrition is increasing, but you’re still on your own most of the time when
selecting healthy foods. This chapter helps you ensure that your restaurant
eating fits well into your nutritional plan.
Your situation may be much like the plight of the customer who called the
waiter over and said, “Waiter, taste this soup.” The waiter replied, “Is there
something wrong with it?” “Never mind,” said the customer, “just taste the
soup.” “But it smells and looks okay,” said the waiter. “That’s all right, just
taste the soup,” replied the customer. “But sir, there’s no spoon,” said the
waiter. “Aha,” said the customer. Or you may be like the diner who complains
to the waiter, “Waiter, I can’t find any steak in this steak pie.” The waiter
replies, “Well, there’s no horse in the horseradish either.” And if you find a fly
in your soup, thank the waiter for the extra protein but ask him to serve it
separately. The point is that you are ultimately responsible to ensure that
you know what is in the food you order and make healthy choices.

Preparing for Restaurant Dining
If you live in (or are visiting) one of the cities that contains a restaurant we
reference in this book (see Appendix A), the task of finding a restaurant that
is appropriate for a person with diabetes is much easier for you. The chefs
who have contributed to this book are health-conscious. They make an effort
to keep the fat and the sugar low. But they have to respond to what they per-
ceive to be their customer’s needs. They think that one of the main “needs” is
for a lot of food, so your portions will almost always be larger than necessary.
You have to evaluate the food you order by questioning your waitperson care-
fully. Even if the balance of energy sources is right, you will probably receive
too much food and should take some home or leave some on your plate.
Because this book is limited to 12 cities and 13 restaurants, you may often
find yourself having to choose a restaurant where you don’t know the ingredi-
ents in the food or whether the menu items are healthy or not. How do you
go about choosing a restaurant in this situation? Here are a few suggestions:
 No particular kind of food is better or worse than any other, with the
exception of fast food (we discuss this issue in Chapter 18). You may
think that vegetarian food is better than animal sources, but a dish of
pasta in a creamy sauce is no better than a piece of fatty steak. Often,
restaurants have several menu items that fit into your nutrition plan.
 Consider choosing a restaurant that you can walk to and from. The exer-
cise you get will offset the extra calories you may consume.
 Many restaurants now publish their menus on the Internet. Before decid-
ing to visit a particular restaurant, go to the establishment’s Web site
and make sure that it serves food you can eat.
 Don’t go to the restaurant if the catch of the day is fish sticks.
 Call ahead and find out whether you can substitute items on the menu.
Nonfranchise and non-fast-food restaurants are much more likely to let
you substitute menu items. Fast-food restaurants are able to serve large
numbers of people at lower prices by making the food entirely uniform.
On the other hand, as Chapter 18 explains, this uniformity makes it
easier to know the exact ingredients and methods of preparation. You
need to ask only a few questions to know whether a restaurant will be
accommodating. Ask whether the staff will
• Substitute skim milk for whole milk.
• Reduce the amount of butter and sugar in a dish.
• Serve gravies, salad dressings, and sauces on the side.
• Bake, broil, and poach instead of frying or sautéing.
268
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

 An older restaurant has the advantage of having experienced and well-
trained waitstaff who know what the kitchen staff are willing to do for
you, based on what has been done before.
 Find out whether the restaurant already has special meals or entrées for
people with chronic diseases such as heart disease. They’re much more
likely to be health conscious in their cooking.
 When you choose a restaurant, consider what you’ve already eaten that
day. For example, if you’ve already eaten your daily limit of carbohydrate,
then the choice of a restaurant where pasta or rice is the major ingredient
may not be a good one. People often choose a restaurant days in advance,
so if you know ahead where you’ll be dining, you can plan to modify your
eating accordingly earlier in the day, especially if the restaurant special-
izes in foods you should eat in small quantities.
 Drink water or have a vegetable snack before you go to the restaurant so
that hunger won’t drive you to make bad choices.
 If you know that the restaurant serves huge portions of everything,
don’t go there unless you plan to share your meal or take part of your
meal home.
Mrs. Wilson, who has type 2 diabetes, decided to go to a well-known deli-
catessen before she attended a musical play. She knew that they served huge
portions, but she also knew that she could order a mini-version of many of
the items. At the restaurant, she ordered a mini-Reuben sandwich, expecting
to get half or less of the usual entrée. What arrived was the entire Reuben
sandwich without the usual potato salad and coleslaw. She couldn’t take half
of it home because she was going directly to the show. She knew that she’d
feel bad leaving part of such a delicious sandwich, so she ended up eating
most of it. Her blood glucose level later that night reflected the huge excess
in calories that she had consumed.
You can see from the information in this section that you can do plenty, even
before you reach the restaurant, to prepare for dining out. Your preparation
may make the whole experience much more satisfying and less frustrating.
Beginning the Dining Experience
As you sit down to enjoy your meal, you can take many steps to make the
experience of eating out the pleasure that it ought to be. A few simple consid-
erations at this point allow you to enjoy the meal free of the concern that you
are wrecking your nutritional program. Among the steps that you can take
are the following:
269
Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience

 If you arrive early, avoid sitting in the bar with cocktails before you
move to your table to eat your meal.
 Ask the hostess to seat you promptly so you don’t have to wait and get
too hungry or even hypoglycemic.
 Ask your waiter not to bring bread or to take it off the table if it is there
already. That goes for chips and crackers as well.
 Ask for raw vegetables without a dip, what the restaurant menus call 
crudités, so you can munch on something before you order.
 Check your blood glucose before you order so you’ll know how much
carbohydrate is appropriate at that time.
 Wait to administer your short-acting insulin until you can be sure of the
food delivery time.
Mr. Phillips, a 63-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, was trying to understand,
with the help of his dietitian, why his blood glucose had risen to 386 mg/dl
after a meal at a local Mexican restaurant. “I knew the portions were large, so
I ordered a bean tortilla, and I didn’t even eat the whole thing. I left half of it
on my plate. I ate very little of the rice as well.” The dietitian asked him if he
had arrived early at the restaurant. “Oh yes, I forgot. We had to wait in the
bar, and I had a virgin margarita.” “That,” said the dietitian, “explains your
high blood glucose. The margarita is all carbohydrate.”
Ordering from the Menu
The regular menu and the specials of the day or season are arranged to
encourage you to order a big meal. One of the more interesting things that we
learned as a result of working with the chefs whose recipes are found in this
book, especially the European chefs now cooking in the United States, is the
expectation of large portions on the part of U.S. restaurant-goers, compared
to Europeans. The chefs were amazed at how much food they had to put on
each plate to satisfy U.S. tastes. When you order meat, fish, or poultry, you
often get at least twice as much as the serving in the diabetic exchange lists.
Considering how frequently people eat out in the United States, it’s no
wonder the population is getting fatter.
Your strategy for ordering from the menu should include the following:
 Plan to leave some food or take home half your order, because the por-
tions are always too large. You can also order a dish to share with
another person.
 If you decide to have wine, order it by the glass. Diners almost always
finish a bottle of wine, and unless eight of you share the bottle, you’ll
drink too much.
270
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

 Consider using an appetizer as your entrée.
 Feel free to get a complete description, including portion size, of an
appetizer or entree from the waitperson so that you aren’t surprised
when the food arrives. Pay particular attention to how the food is
cooked — in fat or butter, for example.
 Consider a meal of soup and salad. This combination can be delicious,
filling, low in calories, and low in carbohydrates.
 Order clear soups rather than cream soups.
 Ask for salad dressings and sauces on the side if possible. This way, you
are in control of the amount you consume.
 You’re probably wise to choose fish more often than meat, both to avoid
fat and to take advantage of the cholesterol-lowering properties of fish.
Remember, however, that fried fish can be as fat-laden as a steak.
 Watch out for vegetarian dishes. They’re often high in carbohydrates
and made with a lot of dairy products that contain saturated fats.
 Let your server know that you need to eat soon. If your food will be
delayed because the kitchen is slow or busy, insist that vegetable snacks
be brought to the table.
The description of an entree usually offers clues that tell you whether it’s a
good choice for you. These words, in particular, indicate that the preparation
keeps fat to a minimum:
 Baked
 Blackened
 Broiled
 Cooked in its own juice
 Grilled
 Poached
On the other hand, the following words point to a less desirable high-fat entree:
 Battered
 Buttered or in butter sauce
 Creamed or in cream sauce
 Deep-fried
 Escalloped
 Fried
271
Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience

 Golden brown
 In a plum sauce
 In cheese sauce
 Sautéed
 Sweet-and-sour
 With peanuts or cashews
Does it really matter if you order one kind of sauce versus another? Here are
the calorie counts per tablespoon for various salad dressings. Remember
that the energy in food is properly expressed in kilocalories, not calories,
which are a thousand times smaller:
 Blue cheese: 82 kilocalories
 Creamy Italian dressing: 52 kilocalories
 Lowfat French dressing: 22 kilocalories
 Red-wine vinegar: 2 kilocalories
Planning at Each Meal and in Specific
Kinds of Restaurants
You can make good choices at every meal, whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or
dinner. Every kind of food offers you the opportunity to select a lowfat, low-
salt alternative. You just need to think about it and be aware of the possibili-
ties. Helping you choose healthy meals is the purpose of this section.
When you go to any one of the ethnic restaurants discussed here, take a look
at the waiters and waitresses. Are they overweight or obese? Usually they’re
not, yet they eat the food you’re about to eat on a regular basis. This means
you can order food in this restaurant and know that you have plenty of good
healthy choices. (Check out Chapter 4 for an introduction to ethnic foods and
how to prepare them yourself.)
Breakfast
The good choices at breakfast are fresh foods, which usually contain plenty of
fiber. Fresh fruit and juice are good ways to start the meal, followed by hot
272
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

cereals such as oatmeal or Wheatena, or high-fiber cold cereals such as shred-
ded wheat or bran cereals. Always add skim milk instead of whole milk. Enjoy
egg whites but not yolks, or make an omelet with two whites for every yolk.
Less desirable choices are foods such as quiche, bacon, fried or hash brown
potatoes, croissants, pastries, and doughnuts.
Appetizers, salads, and soups
Raw and plain food beats those cooked and covered with butter or sour
cream, and that rule applies to appetizers, salads, and soups, too. Raw car-
rots and celery can be enjoyed at any time and to almost any extent. Clear
soups are always healthier. Salsa has become a popular accompaniment for
crackers and chips instead of a high-fat dip. A delicious green salad is nutri-
tious and filling.
By contrast, olives, nachos, and avocados have lots of fat. Nuts, chips, and
cheese before dinner add lots of calories. Fried onion appetizers are cur-
rently very popular, and they’re often dripping with fat. Watch out for the
sour cream dips and the mayonnaise dips, since they, too, are full of fat.
Seafood
Most fish are relatively low in fat and can be a healthy choice. But even the
best fish can compromise your nutrition plan when they’re fried. Fish that
stand out in the lowfat category are cod, bass, halibut, swordfish, and tuna in
water. Most of the shellfish varieties are also lowfat. Stay away from herring,
tuna in oil, and fried anything.
Chinese food
You can eat some great Chinese food and not have to worry about upsetting
your diet plan. Any of the soups on the menu will be delicious and fill you up.
Stick to vegetable dishes with small amounts of meat in them. Avoid fried
dishes, whether they’re meats, tofu, or rice and noodles. Steamed dishes are
a much better choice. Potstickers, an appetizer often found on the menu, and
sweet-and-sour pork will really throw off your calorie count and your fat
intake. Stay away from the almond cookies that often follow Chinese meals.
273
Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience

French food
While the old style of preparing French food promotes a lot of cream and
gravy, a new style, called the new cuisine, emphasizes the freshest ingredi-
ents, usually cooked in their own sauce. This style has revolutionized the
French restaurants. Still, some French chefs cling to the old ways, and their
food is not for you, unless you’re prepared to share your meal.
Most desserts in French restaurants are high in carbohydrate. Limit yourself
to a taste or, better yet, don’t tempt yourself by ordering the cake or custard
in the first place. See if the pastry chef has a fruit dish, like a poached pear,
that is both delicious and good for you.
Indian food
Rice and pita bread are good carbohydrate choices, but avoid foods made
with coconut milk because of its fat content. Meat, fish, and poultry cooked
in the tandoori manner (baked in an oven) are fine, but Indian chefs like to
fry many foods; keep those to a minimum. Curries are fine as long as they’re
not made with coconut milk. Avoid ghee, which is clarified butter. Fried appe-
tizers like samosas and creamy dishes will not help your blood glucose.
Chicken tikka and chapatti are fine — they’re made with delicious spices (for
taste) but little fat.
Italian food
Stick to tomato-based sauces and avoid the creamy, buttery, cheesy sauces.
Minestrone soup is a hearty vegetable soup that is low in fat. Pasta in general
is fine as long as the sauce isn’t fatty. The problem with the pasta, however,
is that the quantity is almost always too great. Share it or take half home.
Sausage, because of all the added fats, is a poor choice, whether served with
pasta or placed on pizza. Pesto sauce can be made with little fat. If you love
the taste of basil, as Dr. Rubin does, ask for a lowfat version of this classic
sauce. Ask whether the kitchen staff will make garlic bread with roasted
garlic alone, without the butter that often accompanies it. You’ll be delighted
with the delicious taste. Avoid Caesar salad and dishes made with a lot of
cheese, such as cheese-filled ravioli.

Japanese food
Japanese food is generally fine to eat, particularly sushi, miso soup, and
broiled fish. Stay away from the tempura, which is deep-fried. Limit your rice
intake to a maximum of 2⁄3 cup at a meal.
Mexican food
Mexican food has become increasingly popular, but Mexican restaurants offer
you many temptations to slip from your healthy eating plan. They often start
with chips, nachos and cheese. Tell your waiter to keep them off the table.
Have salsa, not guacamole, as an appetizer. Stay away from anything refried;
it means just what the word says. Avoid all dishes laden with cheese, as well
as dishes heavy in sausage. Chicken with rice, grilled fish, and grilled chicken
are excellent choices. Tortillas, burritos, and tostadas are delicious and good
for you as long as you avoid the addition of a lot of cheese, sour cream, or
guacamole. And keep in mind the importance of moderation. Mexican restau-
rants are known for large servings, so take some home.
Russian food
As discussed in Chapter 4, the basis of Russian food is often ingredients that
are high in fat since the climate and work schedule required those calories. In
a Russian restaurant, you’ll do better to avoid anything fried. Keep the bread
eating to a slice or less and don’t add butter. Ask your waiter if the chef could
keep the salt to a minimum. And even after all that, you still have to eat a half
or a third of a portion in order to stay in your nutritional plan.
Soul food
Seek out African American restaurants that keep the use of fat, sugar, and salt
to a minimum, and avoid restaurants where you can only get the traditional
fare. Call in advance and find out how a restaurant does most of its cooking. If
frying is at the top of the list, you may want to consider a different place. The
use of greens and beans is healthy for you. Creative cooking of fruits and veg-
etables, use of lean cuts or meat, and removal of excess fat are the things you
should look for in soul food. Large quantities of food are a special danger in
an African American restaurant.
275
Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience

Thai food
Other than the tendency to provide larger-than-needed portions, there is
little that Thai restaurants do that is not good for the person with diabetes.
The creative use of spices, emphasis on fish, and use of fresh vegetables
make this cuisine a good choice for you. Just watch out for the spices.
Enjoying Your Food
If you’ve been conscientious in planning a delicious restaurant meal ahead of
time, you deserve to really enjoy the food. But you need to continue thinking
about healthy eating (and drinking) habits even as you sit down to the meal.
All the great planning can come undone if you’re careless at this point. Think
about the following advice as you eat:
 If you have a glass of wine, consider the number of calories.
 Try using some behavior modification to prolong the meal and give your
brain a chance to know that you’ve eaten: Eat slowly, chew each bite
thoroughly, and put your fork down between each bite.
 Remember that the meal is a social occasion. Spend more time talking to
your companions and less time concentrating on the food.
 Remove the skin if you’re eating poultry, and allow the sauce to drip off
the morsel of food on your fork if you’re eating a dish cooked in a sauce.
 After you’ve carefully controlled the intake of food on your plate, don’t
add significant calories by tasting or finishing the food on your compan-
ion’s plate.
Finishing with Dessert
For many people, the early parts of a meal are just a prelude to their favorite
part, which is dessert. Most people have a sweet tooth, and dessert is often
the way that they satisfy that need. The Italians don’t call the part of the
menu that features the desserts the dulci (which means “sweets”) without
reason. Dessert, in many restaurants, has become a showpiece. The pastry
chef tries to show how sweet he or she can make the dessert while creating a
culinary work of art. The term decadent is often used in describing the rich-
ness of these desserts.
276
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

Does this mean that you can’t have any dessert at all? No. Making a wise
choice simply requires a certain amount of awareness on your part. You need
to ask yourself the question, “Is the taste of this dessert worth the potential
damage it will do to my blood glucose and calorie intake?” If you can answer
this question with a “yes,” then have the dessert, but check your blood glu-
cose and adjust your medications as needed after eating it. Then return to
your nutritional plan without spending a lot of time regretting your lapse. You
might even do a little extra exercise to counteract the calories.
On the other hand, if you want to answer the question with a “no,” ask your-
self these questions to help you avoid temptation:
 Do you really need or want the dessert?
 Will you remember it 10 minutes later when you’re at the theater?
 Could you share the dessert or just taste it?
 Is a fruit dessert available that you could enjoy instead?
To help you avoid that high-calorie dessert even further, think in terms of the
number of minutes of active aerobic exercise you must do to account for the
calories you consume in a dessert. If your exercise is walking, double these
times. Here are some examples:
 Boston cream pie: 32 minutes
 Brownie: 32 minutes
 Apple pie: 34 minutes
 Hot fudge sundae: 38 minutes
 Cheesecake: 40 minutes
 Ice cream cone: 44 minutes
 Strawberry milkshake: 47 minutes
You may conclude that dessert is worth your time, but we’ll leave that deci-
sion up to you.

W
ould you like to take a ride with Dr. Rubin and Alison? Here’s your
chance. You’re invited to travel with them on the highways and
byways of some of the most scenic areas of the country with the best desti-
nations. You can stop along the way at some of the best-known fast-food
restaurants. Luckily, you are with Alison, who knows the contents of all the
foods in these restaurants, and Dr. Rubin, who is there to make sure that you
enjoy yourself while staying on your eating program. If you want to get the
details on these trips, you can refer to Frommer’s very popular travel guides
(published by Wiley). We give you just the bare essentials here.
We selected these specific restaurants because they’re usually the most
common examples of a particular class of fast-food restaurants. In no way do
we mean to recommend them above others in their class.
In this chapter, we hit the high spots, the most commonly visited fast-food
places. Keep in mind that one chapter isn’t enough space to cover the hun-
dreds of different fast-food franchises all over the country. In general, a
burger in McDonald’s looks like a burger at Burger King, but there are major
variations.
Touring the Fast-Food Landscape
Is it even important to discuss fast-food restaurants? McDonald’s claims that
it serves 26 million customers every day in the United States. That’s almost
one in ten of all Americans. It has 13,700 restaurants, compared with 7,600 for

Burger King; 5,900 for Wendy’s; and 3,300 for Arby’s. You bet they have a huge
impact on eating in America.
People used to say that at fast-food restaurants you could get more nourish-
ment from biting your lip than eating the food. This is definitely no longer the
case. Because everyone is conscious of good nutrition these days, you can
now find something healthful to eat in any fast-food restaurant.
Watch for a few key words that warn you not to order a particular item in
these restaurants. If the food is called a double, big, jumbo, monster, or the
ultimate, stay away from that selection. Also avoid any menu item with bacon
or sausage.
The reason these establishments are called fast-food restaurants is that they
have food preparation, ordering, and serving down to the least amount of
time possible. Because we’re in a hurry on our trips in this chapter and don’t
want to stop for a long time, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying that conve-
nience, but we want to make sure that the food is right for you.
Of course, some of these places aren’t meant to rush into and out of. They
are sit-down places, but the food is standardized and is prepared pretty fast,
so the result is about the same. This chapter discusses those kinds of restau-
rants, too.
One advantage of franchise restaurants is that a hamburger in a Denny’s in
California is almost exactly the same as a hamburger in a Denny’s in New
Mexico or Oregon. You know exactly what you’re getting, which makes the
meal easier to fit into your diet. On the other hand, the quick serving and
eating often doesn’t allow your brain enough time to recognize that your body
has eaten enough calories, and you may be tempted to order more food. Don’t.
A study published in The Lancet in December 2004 that followed 3,000 people
over 15 years showed that those who ate at fast-food restaurants regularly
gained 10 pounds more than those who did not and were much more likely to
develop diabetes. They did not have Alison and Dr. Rubin along to help them
as you do.
Whenever food is fried in a fast-food restaurant, with rare exceptions, the
food is fried in trans fats. These fats, also called hydrogenated or partially
hydrogenated oils, not only increase hardening of the arteries like saturated
fats and cholesterol do, but they also reduce the levels of good cholesterol. In
2006, food labels will have to list the amount of trans fats, and the better fast-
food places are trying to eliminate them from their cooking. They’re still pre-
sent in large amounts, however, especially in foods like french-fried potatoes,
batter-dipped fried onions, fried mozzarella sticks, and buffalo wings. The
best way to avoid trans fats is to order food that is low in all fats.
280
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

No one should say that a person with diabetes can’t go to a fast-food restau-
rant and remain on his or her nutritional plan. But these places do offer many
seductive and unhealthy choices. You need to plan in advance what you’re
going to choose. You can’t go wrong if you stick to the selections that we talk
about in this chapter.
If you want to be sure of the nutritional content of various fast foods, refer to
Guide to Healthy Restaurant Eating (written by Hope S. Warshaw, MMSc, RD,
CDE, and published by the American Diabetes Association; to order, call
800-232-6733 or check a bookstore), which covers a lot more, but definitely
not all, of the available restaurant chains. You can find a great deal of infor-
mation about fast-food restaurants on the Web. Visit your favorite search
engine and enter the name of a specific franchise.
Driving to the Ashland
Shakespeare Festival
In Ashland, Oregon, you’ll find one of the largest residential theater companies
in the world. With its three theaters, you can always find a good play to see,
and it’s not only Shakespeare, if that doesn’t happen to float your boat. Staying
in a bed-and-breakfast in the town is a key part of the whole experience.
The trip up to Ashland from San Francisco takes you past some wonderful
scenery (see Figure 18-1). You’ll see Mount Shasta, one of the tallest moun-
tains in California at 14,200 feet. You pass the huge Shasta Lake, created by
the Shasta Dam. Be sure to stop in Redding to see the gorgeous new Sundial
Bridge at Turtle Bay.
If you start in San Francisco, the drive will take you about 5 hours and 15 min-
utes. The most direct route takes you up Interstate 5, and there are plenty of
places to stop for a quick lunch. (Plan on having a delicious dinner when you
get to Ashland.) You’ll get to Red Bluff around noon if you leave at 9 a.m. Go
slightly past Red Bluff to exit 649, where you’ll find plenty of choices, includ-
ing the following:
 Burger King
 Carl’s Jr
 Denny’s
 KFC
 McDonald’s
281
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

We’ve selected Burger King. Because this restaurant is all about hamburgers,
we look at that item first. A hamburger at Burger King isn’t a bad choice for
lunch. It contains 330 kcalories (kilocalories is the correct measurement, not
calories, which is a much smaller number) and about 30 grams of carbohy-
drate, 20 grams of protein, and 12 grams of fat. One of the problems is the
amount of salt in these foods. The Burger King hamburger contains 530 mil-
ligrams of sodium. But if you go up to the bacon double cheeseburger, you
consume 640 kcalories with 1,240 milligrams of sodium, so don’t order one
of those. The hamburger consists of 2 medium-fat exchanges and 2 starch
exchanges.
A side of salad without dressing adds only 60 kilocalories. Put on the ranch
dressing, and you multiply that by four, to 240 kcalories, with that 180 extra
all being fat. Instead, try squeezing lemon on the salad or use vinegar with a
small amount of oil.
Another possibility is the Chicken Tenders, 8 pieces of chicken containing
310 kcalories with only 15 grams of carbohydrate. Although the tenders have
710 milligrams of sodium, you could choose this item and not feel that you’d
overdone it. Stay away from the french fries, 370 extra kcalories with too
much fat, but you could enjoy the Croissan’wich with Egg and Cheese, with
only 304 kcalories and 637 milligrams of sodium, not a bad choice either at

12 grams of protein, 24 grams of carbohydrate and 19 grams of fat. This adds
up to 2 high-fat meat exchanges and 2 starch exchanges. The Chicken Tenders,
with 13 grams of protein, 15 grams of carbohydrate, and 12 grams of fat, pro-
vide a starch exchange, a medium-fat meat exchange, and a fat exchange.
Burger King lists the energy contents of all its food at its Web site, www.bk.
com, but you have to figure out the exchanges for yourself.
Don’t drink soda or a shake. Stick to water with a squeeze of lemon.
Stopping on the Way to Yosemite
Yosemite National Park is the crown jewel of the national park system, and
a trip there is a must. It’s a ride of about 214 miles from San Francisco (see
Figure 18-2). We’re leaving about 11:30 a.m., so we won’t be driving long before
stopping for lunch. You’re driving, and Alison and Dr. Rubin are sitting back
relaxing. You checked your blood glucose before we started, and it was fine.
Sitting down to lunch
Just after noon, you decide that you’re hungry. The insulin that you took before
breakfast has lowered your blood glucose. We are on I-580 (“I” for interstate
highway), and your GPS system tells you that you can choose from a lot of
restaurants at the next exit, which is Exit 27, Hopyard Road, Pleasanton. So you
pull off the interstate.
In front of us, we have numerous choices. Among them are the following:
 Arby’s
 Bamboo Island Restaurant and Bar
 Burger King
 Buttercup Pantry Restaurant
 Denny’s
 El Molino
 Hungry Hunter
 In-N-Out Hamburgers
 Nations Hamburgers
 Taco Bell
283
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

How do we choose from such a full plate? Fortunately, Alison knows the
menu at Denny’s and can help you make good choices, so we pull into
Denny’s. Denny’s is a good representative of the sit-down restaurant group,
which also includes Applebee’s, Bennigan’s, Big Boy restaurants, Bob Evans
Farms, Coco’s, Fresh Choice, Hometown Buffet, Perkins’ Family Restaurants,
Ruby Tuesday, and on and on. You can find the nutritional content of Denny’s
food at its Web site, www.dennys.com/en/. It even provides the exchanges.
We sit down after a bathroom stop and look at the menu. The first thing
Alison points out is that the menu offers some healthy choices. For example,
the Grilled Chicken Dinner has about 200 kilocalories, 25 percent of which are
fat calories, 25 percent carbohydrate calories, and 50 percent protein calo-
ries, which is not a good balance because there is so much protein. But you
can have some carrots and a baked potato to add carbohydrates. It contains
about 824 milligrams of sodium, so the dish is not ideal since the total daily
recommendation for sodium is 920 milligrams. This choice has 2 starch and
2.5 very lean-meat exchanges. It contains 30 grams of carbohydrate.
Looking further down the menu, Alison points to the Pot Roast Dinner. At 292
kcalories, it’s a good choice despite the 11 grams of fat, half of which are sat-
urated. You can add some carbohydrate in the form of a small potato or a

slice of bread. This addition would add 15 grams of carbohydrate and 3 grams
of protein. Now you have 364 kilocalories with 17 percent fat, 33 percent car-
bohydrate, and 50 percent protein. Again, you’ll need to balance the high pro-
tein by taking less at other meals. The meal has 6 very lean meat exchanges
plus a starch, or a total of 15 grams of carbohydrate if you have the bread.
Alison wants to offer you a few more choices, so she is looking for the Grilled
Alaskan Salmon Dinner. This selection, a good choice found in the first edi-
tion of this book, has been removed from the menu. Too bad!
Finally, you might like a side dish. Denny’s offers green beans in sauce, car-
rots in sauce, sliced tomatoes, and a baked potato. Any of them will be okay
and help to fill you up. They’re low in calories and fat, and they don’t even
have much salt. Give them a try. But hold the butter on that potato!
You decide on the Pot Roast Dinner. Alison and Dr. Rubin both order the
Grilled Chicken Dinner. As we eat, Alison points out some of the really bad
choices on the menu (see Table 18-1).

What the choices in Table 18-1 all have in common is the high calorie, fat, and
salt content. But you can’t say that you have no choices. The menu contains
plenty of choices, but you have to choose wisely. You won’t usually travel
with your dietitian, but bring along this book. It’s the next best thing.
Deciding on dinner
It’s time to get back on the road. Yosemite awaits. But we’re taking in the
sights along the way, so a few hours go by, and we find ourselves only 60 miles
285
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

farther when it’s time for dinner. You pull off at Exit 241 on CA 99, Manteca,
and we’re again confronted with many choices, including the following:
 Albertos Molcasalsa
 Bakers Square Restaurant
 Black Angus
 Burger King
 China Pavilion
 Del Taco
 Denny’s
 Domino’s Pizza
 Fresh Choice
 IHOP
 Jack in the Box
 McDonald’s
 Olive Garden
 Outback Steakhouse
 Panama Bay Coffee House
 Rick S Donuts
 Subway
 Taco Bell
 Taqueria La Estrella
 Taqueria Yvette
You can even find a Wendy’s if you want to cross under the highway to the
other side.
Everyone is in the mood for pizza, so Domino’s Pizza wins out. We agree to
share a 12-inch (eight slices), medium cheese, deep-dish pizza with peppers
and mushrooms as the toppings. Peppers and mushrooms add very little to
the calorie count, and you don’t need to consider them in your food plan.
Two slices of the pizza provides about 480 kilocalories, with 20 grams of fat
and about 1 gram of sodium. The pizza provides a bit too much fat and too
little protein, while the amount of carbohydrate is okay, but your choice at
lunch balances out your fat, carbohydrate, and protein intake. The exchanges
work out to 3 starches, 1 medium-fat meat, and 1 nonstarchy vegetable. The
carbohydrate consists of 45 grams. A small green salad with a fat-free dress-
ing provides a satisfying, low-calorie addition.
286
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

Domino’s Web site, http://public.dominos.com/, has nutritional informa-
tion, but you have to figure out exchanges for yourself.
If you take insulin, you have to balance your short-acting insulin dose with
the number of grams of carbohydrate in your meal. See Chapter 2 for help in
doing this.
Don’t forget that you need to leave two slices of the pizza on the table when
you depart.
Most of the vegetable toppings can be added without adding calories, but we
recommend that you avoid the following toppings because they contain too
much fat:
 Bacon
 Cheddar cheese
 Pepperoni
 Sausage
It’s nice to know that you can enjoy pizza if you have a little advance knowl-
edge about what goes into it. The preceding information holds true for most
of the fast-food pizza places along the road.
We continue on to Yosemite and enjoy the magnificent valley, including Half
Dome, El Capitan, the waterfalls, and the rest of the beautiful park.
Following the Santa Fe Trail in Kansas
The ride from Edgerton near Kansas City to the Cimarron National Grassland
near the Kansas-Oklahoma border is the same one that hundreds of thou-
sands of pioneers took to go West in the early 1800s. You can actually see the
ruts of the wagons that they rode. The history of this mass migration along
the Santa Fe Trail is found all along the route.
The trip is 467 miles long and basically follows U.S. 56. Alison is doing the dri-
ving. She is a bit more conservative behind the wheel, so it takes a little
longer, but we pull into Council Grove, where we stop for supper and for the
night (see Figure 18-3). We can choose from any of the following restaurants:
 Hays House Restaurant and Tavern
 Rosie’s Barn and Grill
 Saddlerock Café
 Sonic Drive-In
287
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

We select the Sonic Drive-In, a chain that still delivers food to your car. This
part of the country has many of these restaurants, which are very popular
and have an extensive menu. You can find a guide to the nutritional contents
of its foods at www.sonicdrivein.com.
Most of the burgers on the menu are high in calories, with the exception of
the Jr. Burger at 353 kcalories, but it is high in fat at 21 grams. A better choice
is the Chicken Strip Snack at 272 kcalories and 22 grams of carbohydrate, 19
grams of protein, and 13 grams of fat, equal to 2 medium-fat meat exchanges
and 11⁄2 starch exchanges, or the Grilled Chicken Sandwich at 343 kcalories, 31
grams of carbohydrate, 21 grams of protein, and the same amount of fat. That
gives the Grilled Chicken Sandwich another 1⁄2 starch exchange over the
Chicken Strip Snack.
When you buy food at chicken restaurants, stay away from large fried chicken
pieces that are high in calories, fat, and sodium. Make sure that gravies and
dressings are served on the side. One chicken should yield four servings.
Sonic Drive-In offers salads such as the Grilled Chicken Salad and the Santa
Fe Chicken Salad that will provide fairly good nutrition at reasonable calories
and not a lot of fat. The Grilled Chicken Salad has 355 kcalories divided

among 20 grams of carbohydrate, 33 grams of protein, and 17 grams of fat.
That works out to 2 very lean and 2 high-fat meat exchanges along with 1
starch change. The Santa Fe Chicken Salad, at 426 kcalories, has 33 grams of
carbohydrate, 36 grams of protein, and 18 grams of fat. That adds 1 more
starch exchange to the previous salad. The kids’ meals are all good choices,
but the wraps have too many kcalories.
Avoid Sonic’s side orders, called Faves and Craves. They’re high in calories,
fat, and sodium. Stick to the diet drinks if you need a beverage, although
water is always the best drink. Diet Sprite gives you fluid without caffeine.
Unfortunately, Sonic’s desserts are not for the person with diabetes unless
you share one among two or three people, and then you still get lots of fat
and carbs.
From Council Grove we go on to Lyons, which has a museum that describes
life on the trail. At Great Bend, the trail goes south. Stop here and see the
Barton County Historical Society Museum and Village. Continuing on to
Larned, stop at the Santa Fe Trail Center, where you’ll find out more about
the trail than you may want to know. Stop next at Dodge City to see the old
West, and end at the Cimarron National Grassland, filled with information
about the pioneers and their travails.
Enjoying Civil War Sights 
with a Stop for Breakfast
This ride from Vicksburg to Natchez takes us past some of the battlefields of
the Civil War. We’ll also see many plantations and other buildings as they
existed at that time. Vicksburg, Mississippi, was besieged by the Union Army
and Navy for 47 days. From there we head to the beautiful town of Port
Gibson on the way to Natchez, where we’ll see the Grand Gulf Military
Monument Park overlooking the Mississippi River, the site of a major naval
battle. Natchez is also full of interesting houses. We head north again by way
of the Natchez Trace Parkway, a very scenic road, with stops for interesting
homes. We pass Rocky Springs, which consists of only a church, and head
north to Clinton and east back to Vicksburg. (See Figure 18-4.)
The distance is 198 miles, and we’ll take three days to do it because there is
so much to see. Because we leave Vicksburg at 8 a.m. to get an early start,
we’re looking for a place to have breakfast. You’re waiting to take your short-
acting insulin shot until we get to a restaurant. Fortunately, there is a
McDonald’s in Vicksburg, so we head there.
289
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

McDonald’s has all kinds of choices for breakfast, some good and some not so
good. Alison points to the Egg McMuffin, a good choice at only 290 kcalories
with 30 grams of carbohydrate, 14 grams of protein, 15 grams of fat, and 840
milligrams of sodium. That provides 2 high-fat meat exchanges and 2 starch
exchanges. If you order the scrambled eggs, you still get eggs, but without the
carbs and with much less sodium.
You want to avoid the hotcakes at 600 kcalories; the biscuit with sausage,
mostly made of fat and a gram of salt, which is 410 kilocalories; and particu-
larly the biscuit with bacon, egg, and cheese. This latter concoction is 480
kcalories and 1.4 grams of salt, with too much fat.
While we’re in McDonald’s, we want to mention that the restaurant is trying
to respond to criticism of its high-fat, high-calorie meals. It now offers salads
such as the Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken, the California Cobb Salad with
Grilled Chicken, and the Bacon Ranch Salad with Grilled Chicken, all contain-
ing around 200 kcalories with little fat. Select the Newman’s Own Low Fat
Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing, and you add just 40 kcalories more. Even
better than that, it will replace the high-fat, high-trans-fat french fries with its
new Apple Dippers with Low Fat Caramel Dip in your child’s Happy Meal or
your meal. That substitution immediately eliminates the trans fats and 200

kcalories. If you can get your child or yourself to forgo the caramel dip, you
have an excellent dessert or snack. McDonald’s Web site has nutritional infor-
mation on its food, but you have to figure the exchanges for yourself.
On the other hand, if we had spotted a Manhattan Bagel Company place (not
easy to find in the South), you could have had almost any bagel except the
Everything (which has too much salt) and the Salt bagel (which gives you a
jolt of up to 7,000 milligrams of sodium). The rest of the bagels generally pro-
vide about 260 kilocalories. Adding 2 tablespoons of cream cheese, you have
to count an additional 100 kilocalories unless the cheese is lowfat. The cream
cheese has 100 kilocalories, of which 80 to 90 percent is fat, so you end up
with a total of 360 kilocalories. The breakdown is 28 percent fat, 59 percent
carbohydrate, and 13 percent protein, not a bad division. This bagel with
cream cheese has 31⁄2 starch exchanges and 2 fats. The carbohydrate count is
53 grams.
Well, we’ve had breakfast and are eager to drive. It’s a beautiful day, and the
battlefields await us.
Cruising Down the South Jersey Shore
The South Jersey shore between Atlantic City and Cape May features casinos,
boardwalks, wildlife refuges, bird sanctuaries, lighthouses, and many historic
houses, especially in Historic Cold Spring Village and Cape May. It’s a short
trip of less than 60 miles, but there is so much to see that we could easily
spend two days (see Figure 18-5). We’ll leave the car for a boat trip or two
and maybe gamble a dollar or two in one of the Atlantic City casinos. Most of
the way we’ll be riding on the Garden State Parkway.
Selecting sandwiches
Dr. Rubin, who is doing the driving today, drives a little fast but safely. When
lunchtime arrives, we’re at the town of Cape May Court House, New Jersey.
We can see several restaurants, including the following:
 Arby’s
 Coffee Court
 Court House Family Diner
 McDonald’s
291
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

Arby’s looks like a good bet, so Dr. Rubin pulls in. Arby’s is a good representa-
tive of the sandwich group, which includes Au Bon Pain, Blimpie, and Subway.
These places have the advantage that you get to choose exactly what to put
into your sandwich. They often have light menus that contain your best
choices and offer clear soups as well as salads with lowfat dressing. The Arby’s
Web site at www.arby.com contains nutritional information, but you have to
figure out the exchanges.
Everyone is hungry, and the roast beef looks good. But should we get the
junior, the regular, or the super roast beef? It’s not that hard a choice. The
Junior has 324 kcalories broken down into 11⁄2 starch and 11⁄2 medium-fat meat
exchanges. That’s about 22 grams of carbohydrate, 16 grams of protein, and 9
grams of fat, not too bad. But the Regular goes up to 388 kcalories, and the
Super tops off at 523 kcalories. The sodium content likewise climbs from 779
to 1009 to 1189 milligrams of salt. The Junior is clearly the best choice.
The ham and cheese sandwich has a lot of fat and 1.3 grams of salt. The beef
and cheddar sandwich, likewise, has too much fat and too much sodium.
However, we can all enjoy a tossed salad, which goes from 23 milligrams of
salt without dressing to 465 milligrams with, a better than 20-fold increase. If
you go with the light buttermilk ranch dressing, the dressing adds few calo-
ries. The other dressings add too many fat calories.

Surveying supper choices
We spend the whole day in Cape May, enjoying the lighthouse and the
Historic Cold Spring Village a few miles away. The Emlen Physick Estate in
Cape May is especially interesting. We even have time for a short boat trip.
We decide to return to Atlantic City and take a short trip to Mays Landing,
New Jersey, where we find a Chick-fil-A restaurant.
Chick-fil-A is representative of the chicken group of fast-food restaurants. The
other popular restaurants in this group include KFC, Boston Market, Church’s
Chicken, Kenny Rogers Roasters, and Popeye’s Chicken and Biscuits. They all
feature chicken that is often coated with batter and fried, which isn’t good for
you. Some restaurants now sell roast chicken, which is much better for your
health, especially if you remove the skin of the chicken (which gets rid of a
lot of fat).
The difference in calories when the skin is removed is dramatic. A roasted
chicken breast with skin is 251 kilocalories, and skinless it is 169 kilocalories.
A roasted chicken drumstick without skin is only 67 kilocalories. A roasted
thigh without skin is only 106 kilocalories. Practically every calorie is protein.
The carbohydrate is negligible. Therefore, a breast without skin provides 5
very lean-meat exchanges, a drumstick supplies 2 very lean meats, and a
thigh has 2 lean-meat exchanges.
This chain is one of the most progressive of the chicken restaurants. If you go
to its Web site at www.chick-fil-a.com, you find all the nutrition informa-
tion you need to make excellent choices. The site has extensive lists of nutri-
tional analyses of its food and also the diabetic exchanges. This restaurant
uses practically no trans fats in any of its foods. The only problem seems to
be too much salt. Chick-fil-A should serve as an example to all the fast-food
establishments of the kind of information that people with diabetes or
anyone else can really use.
Having nutritional info makes it very easy for Alison to help us to choose our
supper. She recommends the Chicken Sandwich without butter at 380 kcalo-
ries and 1.3 grams of sodium, representing 21⁄2 starch, 3 lean meat, and 1 fat
exchange. That’s 38 grams of carbohydrate, 28 grams of protein, and 16
grams of fat. Or if you want to reduce your carbs, just have the Chicken Filet,
and the carbs drop from 38 grams to 10 grams, the protein drops to 23 grams,
and the fat to 11 grams, while the kcalories fall to 230. If the chicken is char-
grilled, you reduce the fat and calorie count even more, and you get the char-
coal-grilled taste. Another advantage of the charcoal method of preparation
is the reduction in sodium.
293
Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary

Alison tells us that the Chargrilled Chicken Cool Wrap and the Spicy Chicken
Cool Wrap are other good choices but suggests we skip the Chicken Caesar
Cool Wrap because it adds all the fat calories in Caesar Salad dressing. The
first two have around 380 kcalories with 3 carbohydrate, 1 vegetable, and 3
very lean-meat exchanges.
Chick-fil-A offers side salads with low-calorie and lowfat dressing, such as its
light Italian dressing, as well as a fresh fruit cup, both of which add just 60
kcalories to our total. You can even enjoy a small cup of the Icedream for
dessert and know that you’re adding only 160 kcalories, of which 5 grams are
fat. This place is worth going out of your way for.
So you see that you can eat at Chick-fil-A and stay within your nutritional
guidelines. What if we don’t feel like driving any more today? We find a Taco
Bell right in Atlantic City, so we check it out before deciding where we’re
going to eat.
Taco Bell is a prime representative of the Mexican group of fast-food restau-
rants. They’re particularly popular in California and the southwestern United
States but are found everywhere. Taco Bell and the other Mexican restau-
rants offer some advantages:
 They feature many varieties of dishes with beans that add fiber and pro-
vide spicy sauces that add flavor without calories.
 You can keep the high-fat items, such as sour cream and cheese, off your
dishes.
 They tend to have less protein and more carbohydrates in their food.
 They fry in vegetable oil and not lard.
On the other side are the disadvantages:
 They refry their beans, adding more fat.
 They add a lot of cheese.
 Many items contain a high salt content.
 Fruits and vegetables are rarely seen in a Mexican fast-food meal.
You can make some good choices at Taco Bell, and Alison will help us pick
them out. She points to the Chili Cheese Burrito, containing 330 kilocalories,
made up of 13 grams of fat, 37 grams of carbohydrate, and 14 grams of pro-
tein. The energy breakdown is 36 percent fat, 46 percent carbohydrate, and
18 percent protein — not too bad. It is relatively high in sodium at 870 mil-
ligrams. The exchanges are 21⁄2 starch, 1 medium-fat meat, and 11⁄2 fat.
294
Part III: Eating Away from Home 

Moving along on the menu, we come to a Tostada. Its 300 kilocalories come
from 15 grams of fat, 31 grams of carbohydrate, and 10 grams of protein. The
sources of energy are 45 percent fat, 41 percent carbohydrate, and 14 percent
protein. It has less than a gram of salt, an accomplishment for this group. The
exchanges work out to 2 starch, 1 medium-fat meat, and 2 fat exchanges.
A Taco and Taco Supreme, as well as a Soft Taco and Soft Taco Supreme,
round out this restaurant’s good choices. Their kilocalories are between 200
and 260, with 50 percent of them coming from fat, 30 percent from carbohy-
drates, and 20 percent from protein. The carbohydrate count is between
14 and 23 grams. There are 1 to 11⁄2 starch exchanges, 1 medium-fat meat
exchange, and 1 or 2 fat exchanges. They don’t contain a lot of salt.
Taco Bell is another forward-looking restaurant. Its Web site at www.taco
bell.com allows you to make up a tray of food exactly the way you would
order it and calculates the nutritional analysis and the exchanges for you.
Taco Bell offers some good choices, but we’re in the mood for chicken, so
would you mind getting behind the wheel and taking us to Chick-fil-A? Then
we’ll return to Atlantic City for a walk on the boardwalk as the night lights
begin to come on.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part shows you that major improvements can
arise from minor changes. It takes you through some
basic steps to improve your eating habits, none especially
difficult by themselves. You’ll realize the tremendous
impact that substituting more-healthful ingredients can
have on your overall nutrition.
You can also find some essential techniques to normalize
your blood glucose and thus prevent complications of 
diabetes. Many of these tips don’t relate to diet but
approach blood glucose normalization from a general
lifestyle perspective.
This part also offers information on managing the special
problems of healthy eating for a child with diabetes. In this
situation, you’re trying not only to keep the blood glucose
normal but also to allow for normal growth and maturation.
This balance requires some special considerations, and we
try to offer them.

Ten (or So) Simple Steps to
Change Your Eating Habits
In This Chapter
 Keeping a food diary and discovering the reasons behind your behavior
 Making time and sitting down for all meals
 Using water and vegetables for many purposes
 Cooking with half the fat (and stripping it away)
 Flavoring with condiments, herbs, and spices instead of salt
 Sticking to the b’s — braising, broiling, boiling, and barbecuing
F
ollowing a nutritional plan sometimes seems so complicated. But really,
if you follow the few simple rules outlined in this chapter, you can make
the process much easier. This chapter provides you with ten (or so) simple
things you can do today. None of them cost anything other than time. Doing
them one at a time makes a big difference in your calorie and fat intake.
Adding one after another makes the results huge. Your weight, blood pres-
sure, and blood glucose all fall. Who could ask for anything more?
Maintaining a Food Diary
Try this little diversion: For the next two days, write down everything you eat
and drink. Before you go to bed on the evening of the second day, take a sep-
arate piece of paper and try to reconstruct what you have eaten for the past
two days without looking at your original list. Then compare the two lists.
The differences in the lists will startle you. The point of this exercise is to
show you that you’re doing a lot of mindless eating. Trying to follow a nutri-
tional plan from memory doesn’t work.

A food diary not only shows you what you’re eating all the time but also makes
it easy to select items to reduce in portion size or eliminate altogether. When
you go to your doctor, the fact that your diary lists birdseed for every meal
helps confirm your statement that you eat like a bird.
You might even want to include something in your diary about how you’re
feeling and what you’re doing. This information, besides turning your diary
into a more personal statement, allows you to see the associations between
your mood and your food. Keeping your exercise record in the diary makes it
even more useful, reminding you of when you did (or did not) exercise.
Finally, your dietitian can easily plug your food intake into a computer pro-
gram to analyze such valuable information as calorie breakdown, amount of
salt, levels of saturated fat, and amount of cholesterol.
Figuring Out Why You 
Eat the Way You Do
You may recognize that you do a lot of your eating for emotional reasons. Try
to remember how you ate in your family as you were growing up. What did
eating mean to you and your family? Was it a way of connecting with others
in the family, or was it used in some other way? Does eating trigger feelings
that you want to have again and that make you feel happy or good in some
other way? Or do you associate eating with negative emotions? Do you eat
the way you do out of loneliness, boredom, depression, happiness, or anger;
as a reward; or as a way to save time? You may come up with several reasons,
but you need to understand them and begin to respond to those triggers with
other actions besides eating.
After you begin to clarify the emotional aspect of your eating, you can look
for ways to have the same emotions without the eating part of it. What are
other things you can do to feel happy or connected? Do you eat out of bore-
dom? What can you do to keep yourself from being bored?
This sounds like psychology, and it is. You may have to seek the help of a
psychologist to find out exactly what eating means to you. Meanwhile,
because that type of counseling is often a long process, try doing the other
things recommended in this chapter to gain control of your eating.
All habits, including eating habits, come from repetition. Every time you do
something the same way, it encourages you to do it the same way the next
time. By breaking the chain, you can make healthful changes. Here are some
things you can do right now until you figure out why you eat:
300
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Never eat and do something else at the same time, such as watch TV.
 Eat in only one place in your home, preferably at the table, your desig-
nated eating place.
 Eat on smaller plates.
 Never eat from the bag, the container, or the carton.
 Chew your food slowly and pick up all food with utensils, not fingers,
after you’ve swallowed the previous bite.
 Always leave food on your plate to develop the habit of stopping eating
when you’re full.
 Keep food only in the kitchen and out of sight, not on counters.
 Avoid junk food that has no nutritional value but only calories.
 Eat three meals and even a couple of healthy snacks every day.
 Select a healthy alternative to eating, such as exercise, a creative hobby,
or even conversations with your spouse.
 Choose non-food rewards, such as new clothes for your new shape.
Perform one of these actions at a time. When you’ve made that action a part
of your behavior, try a second action. Build up to many changes. You’ll be
delighted with the results.
Eating Every Meal
When you miss meals, you become hungry. If you have type 1 diabetes, you
can’t safely miss meals, especially if you give yourself regular or lispro insulin.
Instead of letting yourself become hungry, eat your meals at regular times so
that you don’t overcompensate at the next meal (or at a snack shortly after
the meal you missed) when you’re suffering from low blood glucose. Many
people overtreat low blood glucose by eating too many sugar calories, result-
ing in high blood glucose later on.
You should not miss meals as a weight-loss method, particularly if you take a
drug that lowers blood glucose into hypoglycemic levels. A pregnant woman
with diabetes especially should not miss meals. She must make up for the
fact that her baby extracts large amounts of glucose from her blood. Both
mother and growing fetus are adversely affected if the mother’s body must
turn to stored fat for energy.
301
Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits

Eating smaller meals and having snacks in between is probably the best way
to eat because doing so raises blood glucose the least, provides a constant
source of energy, and allows control of the blood glucose using the least
amount of external or internal insulin.
The fact is, following your complete nutritional plan in fewer than three
meals is extremely difficult.
Sitting Down for Meals
Eating food with others is one of the pleasures of life. As an added advantage,
it also slows the pace of your eating, which allows your brain to recognize
when you’re full so you stop eating at the appropriate time. By sitting down
and eating more slowly, you slow the absorption of carbohydrates, thus slow-
ing the rise in your blood glucose.
Another advantage of sitting down and eating with others is that they serve
as a brake on how much you eat. When people eat alone, they tend to eat
more. In the company of others, you’re restrained by social controls. By
eating while sitting at the table, you see only the food on the table. When you
stand and eat, you can easily walk to the kitchen, where all the rest of the
food is (if you’re not there already).
You usually limit the food served at the table to what is on your plate, so you
aren’t exposed to excessive food. You can make sure that the only foods
brought to the table are acceptable food choices, especially if they’re pre-
pared as attractively as possible. A lot of your eating is done because the
food looks so good, so make the right foods the best-looking foods.
Drinking Water throughout the Day
Seventy percent of your body is water, and all your many organs and cells
require water to function properly. Most people, especially older people,
don’t get enough water. Older people often have the additional disadvantage
of losing their ability to sense when they’re thirsty. The consequences may
include weakness and fatigue, not to mention constipation.
Water can replace all the sodas and juice drinks that add unwanted calories to
your day. You soon lose your taste for those drinks and discover that you don’t
need (or miss) the aftertaste of soda and juice that you took for granted. Those
drinks also raise the blood glucose very rapidly and are often used to treat low
blood glucose.
302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

One of our patients admitted to drinking 10 to 12 cans of cola drinks daily. He
had a high blood glucose that returned to normal when he broke his cola habit.
Make drinking water a part of your daily habits. Drink some when you brush
your teeth. Drink more with meals and snacks. Many people don’t want to
drink much water close to bedtime because if they do, they’ll have to get up
during the night to go to the bathroom — all the more reason to make sure
you get your daily water ration, which should be at least eight 8-ounce
glasses, early in the day.
Consuming Vegetables 
throughout the Day
What makes you think that you can use broccoli only as a side dish with your
dinner meat or fish? How can you possibly get in your daily three to five serv-
ings of vegetables if you think like this? What would happen if you drank veg-
etable juice for breakfast? Suppose you added vegetables to an omelet? How
about a salad at lunch instead of that large sandwich containing way too
much carbohydrate?
You can find so many different kinds of vegetables in the grocery, yet most
people limit themselves to very few of them. Your whole meal can consist of
vegetables with a small amount of protein thrown in just as a garnish. Try a
vegetarian restaurant to see for yourself how delicious freshly prepared veg-
etables can be.
We’re not talking about the starchy vegetables, such as beans, peas, and
lentils that really belong in the starch list of exchanges, but rather the vegeta-
bles that contain much less carbohydrate. These vegetables include aspara-
gus, bok choy, green beans, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, collards,
onions, summer squash, turnips, and water chestnuts.
Use these vegetables in meals and for snacks. They fill you up but add very
few calories. Some are just as good when frozen and defrosted (because they
are flash frozen immediately after picking) as they are when fresh. Especially
good snack vegetables include baby carrots, cucumbers, and pieces of sweet
pepper.
303
Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits

Reducing Added Fat
If you use recipes that have been handed down in your family, they often con-
tain much unnecessary added fat. The same can be said for recipes created
by chefs who aren’t conscious of the harmful effects of high fat intake. We
carefully selected the recipes in this book to minimize added fat. You should
try to do the same thing when you cook.
Cooking food doesn’t generally require the extra fat. We can remember when a
pancake recipe required a cup of vegetable oil, but we now know that you can
make delicious pancakes without all that oil. Although vegetable oil is better
for you than animal fats like lard and butter, it still has plenty of calories — in
fact, as many as animal fats. A gram of fat contains 9 kilocalories, no matter
the source.
Try reducing the suggested fat by 50 percent. See whether the taste suffers or
if preparing the food is more difficult.
How much difference does reducing the fat make in terms of kilocalories? A
cup of oil is 8 ounces, and each ounce is 28.35 grams. Because each gram has
9 kilocalories, a cup of oil contains about 2,000 kilocalories. You get rid of
1,000 kcalories by reducing the fat in half. If your recipe serves four people,
each person is getting 250 kilocalories less fat. Is that a worthwhile reduc-
tion? You bet!
Chapter 20 is full of great substitutions.
Removing the Attached Fat
Many foods, such as sausage and luncheon meats, contain so much fat that
lowering their fat content isn’t possible. You should mostly avoid these foods.
But other protein sources, such as chicken, steak, roast beef, and pork, have
large amounts of visible fat attached to them, so you can remove this fat
before you prepare the food. In the case of poultry, removing the skin removes
most of the fat. Selecting white meat rather than dark further reduces the fat
in poultry.
As fat cooks on a grill, it often flames, which causes the meat to burn.
Removing the fat before you cook it makes the cooking process safer
(because the burning fat won’t spray around), and the resulting meat is
much lower in calories.
304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Leaving Out the Salt
For reasons that are unclear to us, most Americans like a lot of salt in their
food. Consequently, these people taste mostly salt and not much of the food.
Try getting rid of the salt in your recipes. You can always add it later if you
miss the flavor that salt adds. At first, you may think that the food tastes
bland. Then you’ll begin to discover the subtle tastes that were in the food all
along but were overpowered by the salt.
Why do we emphasize cutting salt levels? We know that salt raises blood
pressure. Recent studies, particularly the United Kingdom Prospective
Diabetes Study, which was a major breakthrough published in 1998, have
shown that you can slow or prevent diabetic complications by reducing
blood pressure.
You can try the approach of slowly removing salt from the recipe. If it calls
for a teaspoon of salt, add only 3⁄4 teaspoon. You won’t notice the difference.
Next time, try 1⁄2 teaspoon. And so on. In the recipes in this book, we have
tried to use less salt wherever possible, with the permission of the chefs who
created the recipes. Most chefs have been very open to eliminating salt.
Adding Taste with Condiments,
Herbs, and Spices
This section explores a case of getting something for almost nothing. If you
like a lot of distinctive flavors in your food, try using various condiments,
herbs, and spices to replace the flavors of fat and salt. Experimenting with
these flavors can bring entirely new tastes to old favorite recipes. Surely, the
new millennium is all about breaking free from old habits of eating, which
may not be so good for you, and replacing them with new tastes.
Many of the chefs in this book — who are some of the most renowned chefs
in the world — have achieved their fame by virtue of their willingness to go
in new taste directions. They have combined foods that no one put together
before and used spices not traditionally used in foods from their particular
ethnic origin. The result has been an explosion of new tastes combined with
better nutrition.
305
Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits

Foods that you associate with bland taste, such as some fish, come alive
when you add the right herbs and spices. You may never have liked those
foods before, but you will now. Not only do they taste different, but they
smell wonderful and exotic. They have the additional advantage of being very
good for you.
Examples of condiments that add great taste and few calories are salsa, hot
sauce, mustard, and horseradish. Herbs that add flavor include rosemary,
thyme, and basil. They are best added toward the end of cooking to preserve
their flavor if fresh, or at the beginning of cooking to bring out their flavor if
dried.
Cooking by the B’s
The best methods of cooking all begin with a b, such as braising, broiling,
boiling, and barbecuing. These methods of preparation don’t add fat and
often remove of a lot of the fat within the food. Broiling a hamburger, for
example, often eliminates as much fat from a moderate-fat hamburger as
buying a reduced-fat hamburger to begin with. Frying, sautéing, and other
methods that depend on butter or fat add exactly the things that you want
to remove.
If you must use fat, use a cooking spray that reduces the amount of added fat.

Chapter 20
Ten Easy Substitutions 
in Your Eating Plan
In This Chapter
 Making better choices with fish, beans, meats, and sweets
 Replacing “bad” fats with “good” fats
 Switching from larger to smaller portions
O
ne of your major weapons in your lifelong battle against complications
of diabetes is your ability to choose. You can choose to exercise every
day. You can choose to take your medications. Perhaps your most effective
resource is your skill at making the right food choices. The consequences of
choosing the right foods are immediate and enormous.
 First, when you eat right, you feel better in general. Your body, like any
complicated machine, prefers the correct fuel.
 Next, you notice more normal levels when you test your blood glucose.
As a consequence of those more normal levels, you sleep better, you don’t
have to go to the bathroom as often, and your sexual activity benefits
because you feel better. If you’re a woman, your vaginal infections come to
an end, which benefits both your general health and your sexual activity.
 In the long run, people of both sexes avoid the complications of dia-
betes, such as eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease.
You can achieve all these benefits by making the correct food choices, if you
have type 2 diabetes (see Chapter 1). With type 1 diabetes, you have other
considerations, but good food choices are just as important. Take a look at
the suggestions in this chapter. None of them is especially difficult to follow.
With these suggestions, you generally save money. You usually lose weight.
Do you need any further incentives?

Catching Fresh Fish
You’ve had a long day, and you want to pick up something to make for dinner.
You stop in front of the frozen foods and find a breaded frozen fish fillet. The
instructions to prepare it are simple, so you put the box in your basket.
Don’t! Put the package back neatly on its shelf and head over to the fresh fish
department.
You can purchase a nice 4-ounce piece of swordfish, tuna, salmon, or mahi
mahi, broil it with herbs for ten minutes or less, and end up with the right
amount of protein and far less fat and carbohydrate calories. The breaded
frozen fish is much too large for a single meal and has excess calories that
you simply don’t need.
Your broiled fish will taste better, too. Frozen fish just can’t duplicate the
taste of fresh fish.
Spilling the Beans
You know that your muscles are made of protein, so naturally when you think
of protein, you think of meat. The time has come to recognize that protein
comes from many sources, however. Vegetables have proteins, too, and they
don’t have the fat that meats provide.
People have suggested that you can’t eat only vegetable protein sources
because they lack some of the building blocks required for muscle growth,
and that you can find those building blocks only in animal protein. As always,
an exception breaks that rule: the soybean. Soybeans contain all the different
building blocks you need to build your own protein.
Even without soybeans, you can get all the building blocks you need by eating
several different vegetable protein sources together, such as rice and beans or
yogurt with chopped nuts.
The best nonmeat sources of protein are legumes like dried beans and peas.
Other protein sources include nuts and seeds, but they contain quite a bit of
fat, so the calorie count swells. The following vegetable protein sources pro-
vide the equivalent of an ounce of animal protein:
 1⁄4 cup of seeds (like sunflower seeds)
 1⁄3 cup of nuts (like pecans and peanuts)
 1⁄2 cup of cooked dry beans
308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 1⁄2 cup of baked beans
 1⁄2 cup of tofu
Choosing the Least Fatty Meats
You’re sick of beans, and your spouse spends more time finding new air fresh-
eners for the house than showering you with affection. You need real meat. At
this point, you can make some good choices that save you plenty of fat and
calories.
If the cut of beef’s name contains the word “round” or “loin,” you’re choosing
a lower fat selection. Cuts from the leg also tend to have lower fat content.
Examples are top sirloin, ground round, or top round and leg of lamb. For
help in selecting lowfat meats, ask your butcher.
The difference between lean cuts and fatty cuts can be as much as 70 kilo-
calories per ounce. If you eat the higher fat meat, you get an extra 200 kilo-
calories or more, almost all in the form of saturated fat — the equivalent of 
40 minutes of walking exercise.
Poultry and wild game, such as pheasant, goose, and duck, can also be lowfat
meat alternatives, if you remove the skin. The way you cook it also makes a
big difference in the fat count; broiling and braising are always preferred to
frying and sautéing.
Choosing Fruits to Replace Sweets
Trading fruits for sweets may seem difficult if you frequently eat in restau-
rants, but it doesn’t have to be. In Chapter 16, you find several delicious
recipes created by chefs who understand the importance of offering a lower-
calorie, lower-fat choice for dessert. These recipes usually consist of unique
ways to prepare fruits or mix fruits together for a delicious new taste. Look
for similar offerings on the menus of the restaurants you visit, and try the
recipes from this book at home.
At home, of course, you’re in charge. The tradition of offering a bowl of fresh
fruit at the end of a meal seems to have disappeared in the United States, but
you can revive it for your family and guests. You can find fresh fruit 12 months
a year, although the choices are fewer in the winter months compared to the
summer. You don’t have to limit fruit to the role of replacing dessert at the end
309
Chapter 20: Ten Easy Substitutions in Your Eating Plan

of a meal, either. Starting a meal with grapefruit or melon is a delicious substi-
tute for a plate of pasta or some other higher calorie appetizer. Ending the
meal with a delicious peach or some grapes or plums can be just as satisfying
as that sugary, fatty pie, cake, or ice cream.
How do you benefit from this change? If you end your meal with a typical
piece of carrot cake, you take in 339 kilocalories, consisting of 11 grams of fat
and 56 grams of carbohydrate. A dessert you sometimes find in restaurants
called Chocolate Decadence has 340 kilocalories with 15 grams of fat and
51 grams of carbohydrate. Choose a sweet peach instead, and you get only
60 kilocalories, consisting of 15 grams of carbohydrate and no fat.
We don’t want to put the dessert chefs out of business. They’re some of the
most creative people in the culinary arts. But just as the chefs who create the
entrees have switched to much more nutritious main dishes, as shown in this
book, dessert chefs should be able to use the abundance of fresh fruits to
prepare wonderful desserts.
Adding Fiber to Your Diet
Choosing fruits as described in the preceding section has another benefit:
Fruits contain fiber. Why is fiber so desirable, especially for the person with
diabetes? Although fiber is a carbohydrate, you can’t break it down into
nutrients that add calories. Fiber has many benefits, but the most important
are the following:
 Soluble fiber can dissolve in water and lower blood glucose and fat
levels.
 Insoluble fiber stays in the intestine where it helps to prevent constipa-
tion and probably cancer of the colon.
The next question is, how do you get more fiber? Breakfast is the easiest
place to make a change:
 Eat whole-grain bread in place of refined breads like white bread.
 Eat unrefined cereals like oats in place of processed cereal.
 Eat muffins made with fruit and whole grains.
You can add more fiber at other meals by choosing pasta instead of potatoes
and higher fiber rice like basmati instead of white rice. Even among fruits,
those from temperate climates, such as apples and plums, provide more fiber
than hot-climate fruits like bananas.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Making the Right Fat Selections
Vegetable sources of fat are always more healthful than animal fats. However,
even among the vegetable fats, some are better and some are worse. The
better ones (like olive oil and canola oil) don’t raise cholesterol, while the
worse ones (like corn oil, cottonseed oil, palm oil, coconut oil, and margarine)
lower the good cholesterol. You don’t want to lower the good cholesterol.
Animal fats belong to a group called saturated fats, which raise cholesterol.
You don’t want to raise cholesterol. Some animal fats are actually cholesterol
itself, such as the fat in an egg yolk. You rarely want these fats to appear in
your diet.
And don’t forget the trans fats, those evil fats that currently hide in food labels
under the term “partially hydrogenated corn or vegetable oils.” The govern-
ment has mandated that they be listed as “trans fats” in the future, but avoid
them at all costs. You can find them in french fries and in most store-bought
cookies. Read the food label! (See Chapter 5 to find out how to decipher food
labels.)
Whether you eat animal fat or vegetable fat, all fats contain an enormous
9 kilocalories per gram. Although fat is an efficient way for your body to store
excess energy, you want to limit your daily fat intake to 30 percent or less of
your total calories.
Finding a Cow That Makes Lowfat Milk
You’d think that if scientists can clone sheep and send a man to the moon
that they could produce a cow that can make lowfat milk. Unfortunately, as
far as anyone knows, getting cows to produce lowfat milk can’t be done yet,
so scientists have to continue extracting the fat after milking. In any case, you
benefit from the lower fat. If you drink regular milk now, start withdrawing
yourself from the fat by changing to 2 percent for a while, then to 1 percent,
and maybe even as low as skim milk.
You may think that you could never stand to drink skim milk. After you’ve
used it for a while, however, you’ll find that regular milk tastes too creamy.
Does drinking skim milk or regular milk really make a difference? Do bees like
nectar? If you lower your milk fat from regular to 2 percent, you go from 72
kilocalories of fat to 45. Moving down to skim milk, of course, eliminates even
those 45 kilocalories of fat.
311
Chapter 20: Ten Easy Substitutions in Your Eating Plan

When ordering your morning caffé latte, specify lowfat milk; if you don’t, the
server makes it with regular milk.
Other dairy products that you can eat in a lowfat form include hard cheeses
like cheddar, as well as softer cheeses like cream cheese. Yogurt is another
popular food that you can purchase in a lowfat version.
Lowfat doesn’t necessarily mean low calorie. Ingenious food manufacturers
have found ways to entice you to buy their lowfat foods by adding lots of car-
bohydrate (sweetener), so the calorie count may still be major. Read the label!
Snacking on Lowfat Foods
We encourage you to eat snacks during the day to smooth out your glucose
control and prevent coming to meals in a hungry state. Your choice of snacks
can add a lot of calories, especially fat calories, or it can satisfy you without
damaging your nutritional plan.
Instead of high-fat potato chips, choose air-popped popcorn. Instead of a
glass of apple juice, choose an apple. Other satisfying snacks that don’t mess
up your plan include three breadsticks, one matzo, three rice cakes, or five
saltines. (Check out Chapter 15 for more great snack ideas.)
You can really improve your snack satisfaction by using the microwave oven
to warm or cook the snack. An apple in the microwave becomes a baked
apple — somehow more delicious than a raw apple but no more caloric. Just
make sure you don’t also have a baked worm.
Finding Free Foods
When we talk about “free foods,” we aren’t referring to foods that you can
tuck into your shopping basket and not pay for when you leave the market.
We mean foods that have so few calories that you can eat them and not have
to list them in the food diary we propose in Chapter 19.
A long list of free foods exists, including the following:
 Black coffee, tea, club soda, sugar-free drinks, and bouillon
 Salad greens
 Sugar-free varieties of candy, gum, and jam instead of regular candy,
gum, and jam, which are full of sugar
 Cranberries and rhubarb
312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Cabbage, celery, cucumber, green onions, and mushrooms
 Seasonings and condiments (see Chapter 19)
Enjoy these foods with meals, as snacks, or any way you want.
These free foods have so few calories that they’re useless as a treatment for
low blood glucose.
Playing with Portions
Many restaurants offer the same food items as appetizers and main dishes.
The fact is, the quantity served as an appetizer is generally the right amount
of food for your nutritional plan, while the main dish may be twice as much
or more. In addition, the main dish costs at least three times as much as the
appetizer. So we heartily recommend that you order the appetizer for your
main dish.
Some restaurants have a children’s menu containing the same food as the
main menu but in smaller portions. We know of no federal law that prohibits
an adult from ordering off the children’s menu. Never mind the annoyed facial
expression of your server, who rapidly calculates the loss in tip.
If you’ve ever ordered a tasting menu in a restaurant, you know that you get a
large number of different foods but very little of any of them. The chefs know
that you don’t need enormous quantities, but you do want the feeling that
you’re getting a lot. Your appetizer–main dish comes on a small plate and
psychologically satisfies you.
Unless you’re in a restaurant that you know gives appropriate portions, use
Dr. Rubin’s “half portion plan” to save yourself a lot of calories. The plan
works as follows: As soon as your food arrives, cut the food into two por-
tions. Push one portion to the side. You can take the amount home or leave
it. Eat the other portion, knowing you’re tasting the delicious food without
ruining your nutrition program. If you try to decrease your portion by eating
until you’ve finished about half without cutting in advance, you’ll end up
either eating too much or eating the whole thing.
One of our patients had dinner in a restaurant known for its large portions.
Wisely, she shared a meal with her spouse. Unwisely, she felt that she could
order a dessert because she had eaten so little of her main dish. She ordered
a piece of pumpkin pie that was served, for some reason, on a large plate.
Although the piece was enormous, she had the feeling that she had received
only a small portion and went ahead and ate it all. Needless to say, her blood
glucose suffered.

Ten Strategies to Normalize
Your Blood Glucose
In This Chapter
 Knowing your blood glucose level

 Staying aware of new developments and using expert help

I
n Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition, Dr. Rubin describes the management
of diabetes in detail. In this chapter, you find the highlights of that exten-
sive discussion. Although this book is about eating, controlling your blood
glucose requires much more from you. Everything we suggest is directed
toward normalizing your blood glucose.
Doctors consider your blood glucose normal when it’s less than 100 mg/dl
(5.5 mmol/L) if you’ve eaten nothing for 8 to 12 hours. If you’ve eaten, your
blood glucose is normal if it’s less than 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L) two hours
after eating. If you never see a blood glucose level higher than 140, you’re
doing very well, indeed. See Chapter 1 for a full explanation of mg/dl (milli-
grams per deciliter) and mmol/L (millimoles per liter).
You can use many tricks to achieve this level of control. In this chapter, you
find the best of the lot. All of our patients can remember receiving and using
some advice that made a huge difference in their life with diabetes. If you have
a tip that you want to share, please send an e-mail to drrubin@drrubin.com.
We’ll try to get it into the next edition of this book.

Knowing Your Blood Glucose
No excuse is adequate for you to not know your blood glucose at all times,
although we’ve heard some pretty far-out excuses over the years — close to
“The dog ate my glucose meter.” The ability to measure blood glucose accu-
rately and rapidly is the greatest advance in diabetes care since the discov-
ery of insulin. Yet many people don’t track their blood glucose.
Sure, sticking your finger hurts, but laser devices now make it painless, and
even the needles are so fine that you barely feel them. How can you know
what to do about your blood glucose if you don’t know what it is in the first
place?
The number of glucose meters you can choose is vast, and they’re all good.
Your insurance company may prefer one type of meter, or your doctor may
have computer hardware and software for only one type. Other than those
limitations, the choice is yours.
If you have very stable blood glucose levels, test once a day — some days in
the morning before breakfast, other days in the evening before supper. Vary-
ing the time of day you test your blood glucose gives you and your doctor a
clearer picture of your control under different circumstances. If your diabetes
requires insulin or is unstable, you need to test at least before meals and at
bedtime in order to select your insulin dose.
Painless devices for measuring blood glucose are right around the corner.
The closeness of this great advance is a particularly good reason to keep
aware of new developments (see “Becoming Aware of New Developments”
later in this chapter about tracking advancements).
Using Exercise to Control Your Glucose
When people are asked how much exercise they do, about a third say that
they do nothing at all. If you’re a person with diabetes and consider yourself a
part of that group that doesn’t exercise, then you aren’t taking advantage of a
major tool — not just for controlling your blood glucose but also for improv-
ing your physical and mental state in general. When a large group of people
who were expected to develop diabetes because both parents had diabetes
participated in a regular exercise program in one recent study, 80 percent who
stayed on the program didn’t develop diabetes.
316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Don’t think that exercise means hours of exhaustion followed by a period of
recovery. We’re talking about a brisk walk, lasting no more than 60 minutes,
every day and not necessarily all at once. If you want to do more, that’s fine,
but just about anyone can do this much. People who can’t walk for some
reason can get their exercise by moving their arms. To lose weight as a result
of exercise, you need to do 90 minutes a day, every day.
Exercise can provide several benefits to your overall health. Exercise does
the following:
 Lowers the blood glucose by using it for energy
 Helps with weight loss
 Lowers bad cholesterol and triglyceride fats and raises good cholesterol
 Lowers blood pressure
 Reduces stress levels
 Reduces the need for drugs and insulin shots
When we see a new person with diabetes, we give him or her a bottle of pills.
These pills aren’t to be taken by mouth; they’re to be spilled on the floor and
picked up every day. It’s our way of making sure that a new patient gets at
least a little exercise every day.
Taking Your Medications
You have the advantage of having some of the best drugs for diabetes avail-
able to you, which wasn’t true as recently as ten years ago. A few years ago,
as specialists in diabetes, we struggled to keep our patients in good control
to avoid complications of diabetes. Now, with the right combination of med-
ications (and by using some of the other tools in this chapter), just about any
patient can achieve excellent control. But no medication works if you don’t
take it.
The word compliance applies here. Compliance refers to the willingness of
people to follow instructions — specifically, taking their medications. People
tend to be very compliant at the beginning of treatment, but as they improve,
compliance falls off. Diabetic control falls off along with it.
The fact is, as you get older, the forces that contribute to a worsening of your
blood glucose tend to get stronger. You want to do all you can to reverse that
tendency. Taking your medications is an essential part of your overall program.
317
Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose

If you’re confused by all the medications you take, get yourself a medication
box that holds each day’s medications in separate compartments so you make
sure the compartment for each day is empty by the next day. Any doctor who
prescribes more than two medicines to you should be able to get one for you,
and you can definitely get them in drugstores.
Seeking Immediate Help 
for Foot Problems
One error that leads to a lot of grief in diabetes is failure to seek immediate
help for any foot problems. Your doctor may see you and examine your feet
only once in two or three months. You need to look at your feet every day. At
the first sign of any skin breakdown or other abnormality (such as discol-
oration), you must see your doctor. In diabetes, foot problems can go from
minor to major in a very brief time. We don’t pull punches in this area,
because seeing your doctor is so important — major problems may mean
amputation of toes or more. (See Chapter 1 for more information about foot
problems as they relate to diabetes.)
You can reverse most foot problems, if you catch and treat them early. You
may require a different shoe or need to keep weight off the foot for a time —
minor inconveniences compared to an amputation.
Besides inspecting your feet daily, here are some other actions you can take:
 Testing bath water with your hands to check its temperature, because
numb feet can’t sense if the water is scalding hot
 Ensuring that nothing is inside your shoe before you put it on
 Wearing new shoes only a short time before checking for damage
Taking immediate action goes for any infection you develop as a diabetic.
Infections raise the blood glucose while you’re sick. Try to avoid taking
steroids for anything if you possibly can. Steroids really make the glucose
shoot up.
Brushing Off Dental Problems
Keeping your teeth in excellent condition is important, but especially if you
have diabetes. “Excellent condition” means brushing them twice a day and
using dental floss at the end of the day to reach where the toothbrush never
goes. It also means visits to the dentist on a regular basis for cleaning and
examination.
318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

We have seen many people with diabetes have dental problems as a result of
poor dental hygiene. As a side effect, controlling the blood glucose is much
harder. After patients cure their teeth, they require much less medication.
People with diabetes don’t have more cavities than non-diabetics, but they
do have more gum disease if their glucose isn’t under control. Gum disease
results from the high glucose that bathes the mouth — a perfect medium for
bacteria. Keeping your glucose under control helps you avoid losing teeth as a
result of gum disease, as well as the further deterioration in glucose control.
Maintaining a Positive Attitude
Your mental approach to your diabetes plays a major role in determining
your success in controlling the disease. Think of diabetes as a challenge —
like high school math or asking out your first date. As you overcome chal-
lenges in one area of your life, the skills you master help you in other areas.
Looking at something as a challenge allows you to use all your creativity.
When you approach something with pessimism and negativity, you tend to
not see all the possible ways you can succeed. You may take the attitude that
“It doesn’t matter what I do.” That attitude leads to failure to take medica-
tions, failure to eat properly, failure to exercise, and so forth.
Simply understanding the workings of your body, which comes with treating
your diabetes, probably makes you healthier than the couch potato who
understands little more than the most recent sitcom.
Some people do get depressed when they find out they have diabetes. If
you’re depressed and your depression isn’t improving after several weeks,
consider seeking professional help.
Planning for the Unexpected
Life is full of surprises — like when you were told you have diabetes. You
probably weren’t ready to hear that news. But you can make yourself ready
to deal with surprises that may damage your glucose control.
Most of those surprises have to do with food. You may be offered the wrong
kind of food, too much food, or too little food, or the timing of food doesn’t
correspond to the requirements of your medication. You need to have plans
for all these situations before they occur.
319
Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose

You can always reduce your portions when the food is the wrong kind or
excessive, and you can carry portable calories (like glucose tablets) when
food is insufficient or delayed.
Other surprises have to do with your medication, like leaving it in your 
luggage — which is on its way to Europe while you’re headed to Hawaii.
Keep your important medications with you in your carry-on luggage, not in
checked luggage. Again, your ability to think ahead can prevent you from
ever being separated from your medication.
Not everything is going to go right all the time. However, you can minimize
the damage by planning ahead.
Becoming Aware of New Developments
The pace of new discoveries in diabetes is so rapid that keeping on top of the
field is difficult even for us, the experts. How much more difficult must it be
for you? You don’t have access to all the publications, the drug company rep-
resentatives, and the medical journals that we see every day.
However, you can keep current in a number of ways. The following tips can
help you stay up-to-date on all the advances:
 Begin by taking a course in diabetes from a certified diabetes educator.
Such a course gives you a basis for a future understanding of advances
in diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org)
provides the names of certified diabetes educators.
 Get a copy of Dr. Rubin’s book Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley),
which explains every aspect of diabetes for the nonprofessional.
 Join a diabetes organization, particularly the American Diabetes
Association. You’ll start to receive the association’s excellent publica-
tion, Diabetes Forecast, in the mail, which often contains the cutting edge
of diabetes research as well as available treatments.
 Go to Dr. Rubin’s Web site (www.drrubin.com) where you can find link-
able addresses for the best and latest information about diabetes on
the Net.
 Finally, don’t hesitate to question your doctor or ask to see a diabetes
specialist if your doctor’s answers don’t satisfy you.
The cure for diabetes may be in next week’s newspaper. Give yourself every
opportunity to find and understand it.
320
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Utilizing the Experts
The available knowledge about diabetes is huge and growing rapidly.
Fortunately, you can turn to multiple people for help. Take advantage of
them all at one time or another, including the following people:
 Your primary physician, who takes care of diabetes and all your other
medical concerns
 A diabetes specialist, who is aware of the latest and greatest in diabetes
treatment
 An eye doctor, who must examine you at least once a year
 A foot doctor, to trim your toenails and treat foot problems
 A dietitian, to help you plan your nutritional program
 A diabetes educator, to teach you a basic understanding of this disease
 A pharmacist, who can help you understand your medications
 A mental health worker, if you run into adjustment problems
Take advantage of any or all of these people when you need them. Most insur-
ance companies are enlightened enough to pay for them if you use them.
Avoiding What Doesn’t Work
Not wasting your time and money on worthless treatments is important. When
you consider the almost 20 million people with diabetes in the United States
alone, they provide a huge potential market for people with “the latest wonder
cure for diabetes.” Before you waste your money, check out the claims of
these crooks with your diabetes experts.
You can find plenty of treatments for diabetes on the Internet. One way you
can be sure that the claims are based on science is to look for verification
from the Health on the Net Foundation, which you can find at www.hon.ch/
HomePage/Home-Page.html. Its stamp of approval means the site adheres to
principles that every legitimate scientist agrees with.
Don’t make any substantial changes in your diabetes management without
first discussing them with your physician.

Ten Tactics for Teaching
Children with Diabetes
Healthy Eating Habits
In This Chapter
 Being a role model
 Teaching eating skills
 Using outside resources
A
n epidemic of excessive weight and obesity has taken hold among chil-
dren, resulting in more type 2 diabetes in children than ever before.
Several factors are responsible for this epidemic, including the following:
 Consumption of high-fat foods
 Large amounts of high-calorie fruit drinks and other caloric beverages
 More time spent in front of the television and the computer and not
exercising
Children pay a high price for their overweight condition in the form of low
self-esteem and less acceptance by their peers, not to mention the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes.
For overweight children, the old joke about being too short for your weight
really is true. Children often grow out of their overweight condition. As a
parent, your job is to help them maintain their weight until they grow older
and taller, not necessarily to help them lose weight.
This chapter describes how you can help your diabetic child achieve healthy
eating habits. You’re an enormous force in your child’s life, and you can do a
great deal, as he or she grows up, to create a person with a life of quality as
well as quantity.

Setting an Example
Children resemble their parents not just because of the physical resemblance
but also because children pick up their parents’ mannerisms. Your children are
constantly studying you. They follow the example you set with your eating. If
they observe you overeating and dieting, they assume that is the appropriate
way to eat.
You set a dietary example by eating the same foods that you want your child to
eat. You set an example by keeping the quantities of food you eat moderate and
by choosing food that is low in fat and salt and high in fiber. You set an example
when your child observes that exercise is a part of your daily routine.
If your child needs to lose weight, chances are you do too. Continue to set a
good example by
 Avoiding fatty snacks, such as cookies and cakes
 Keeping dairy products lowfat
 Reducing your use of butter and margarine
 Serving seafood and skinless poultry instead of meat
 Substituting low-sugar jam, salsa, or mustard for butter
 Using meat for taste instead of as a main dish
Engaging Children in Shopping
Taking your child to the market is a great opportunity to teach good food-
buying habits. Let your child read the nutrition labels (see Chapter 5 for a full
explanation of nutrition labels) and explain to him or her what each type of
nutrient means. When reading the labels, do the following:
 Point out that you’re looking for foods low in total fat, saturated fat, cho-
lesterol, and salt.
 Look for words like “partially hydrogenated canola or palm oil.” These
words refer to trans fats, which not only raise bad cholesterol, but lower
good cholesterol at the same time.
 Have your child compare the carbohydrate and protein content of foods
as well as the other substances named on the label, especially fiber, but
324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

also calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Explain how each of these
substances plays a part in your child’s nutrition. (See Chapter 2 as well
as Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition, for an explanation of the purpose
of these nutrients.)
 Let your child look at labels side by side, like those on a bottle of fruit
drink compared with a container of lowfat milk. Or compare regular and
lowfat milk.
If you purchase foods without labels (such as fresh fruits and vegetables), be
prepared to explain the contents of those foods. Create a food basket that
mirrors the food guide pyramid (see Chapter 2) so your child can see the
amounts of each food group that should make up a diet.
Teach your child how the market entices you to buy high-calorie, low-nutrition
food, especially at the checkout counter where you don’t have time to change
your mind and put it back. (Look for more information on this topic in Chap-
ter 5.)
Involving Children in Food Preparation
When you ask children to describe their earliest memories, they often talk
happily about helping their grandmother make some kind of food. Many of
the chefs in this book began cooking by their grandmother’s or mother’s side.
Preparing food together can be a great bonding experience between you and
your child, and it also provides you with the opportunity to teach good nutri-
tion. If you follow a recipe and tell your child to measure half the fat listed in
the recipe or to leave out the salt altogether, that lesson stays with the child
for life.
Have your child create his or her own nutrition plan for a day and discuss
every part of it, pointing out what is carbohydrate, protein, fat, the balance
among those foods, and how they affect his or her diabetes. Use the food
guide pyramid (see Chapter 2 for details) or the child’s nutrition plan as a
guide for planning.
Never prepare one meal for your diabetic child and another for the rest of
the family. Everyone can benefit from the better choices you make with your
child’s nutritious food. The child also realizes that eating isn’t punishment for
a person with diabetes because the whole family eats the same way.
325
Chapter 22: Ten Tactics for Teaching Children Healthy Eating Habits

Keeping Problem Foods Out of Sight
and Good Foods in Easy View
If potato chips or creamy cookies sit on the kitchen counter, can you blame
your child (or yourself) for grabbing a handful every time he or she goes by?
Don’t buy these foods in the first place. If you do, keep them out of sight. You
know what happens when you walk up to a buffet table. You can more easily
avoid what you don’t see.
On the other hand, keep fruits and vegetables in plain sight, along with other
acceptable snacks, like air-popped popcorn. Having a special device for
drinking water is a good idea, too, because it makes water into something
special and, therefore, more desirable. Even having a pitcher of water in the
refrigerator beats going to the sink, where the association is with washing
hands and dishes rather than nutrition.
Again, your child follows your example. If you raid the freezer for ice cream,
don’t be surprised to see your child do the same thing. The great benefit to
you when you set an example for your child is the excellent nutrition that
you get.
Teaching the Meaning of Portions
Your child has no more idea of the meaning of portions than you did before
you started reading this book. In Chapter 1, we show you how to recognize a
portion of various kinds of foods. Teach this information to your child so that
he or she can readily select the amount of food that corresponds with a por-
tion. Thinking in terms of a tennis ball representing a medium fruit or a domino
representing an ounce of cheese is much easier for a child than thinking in
terms of measurements. These terms also introduce a certain amount of fun in
the process of selecting how much to eat.
Missing No Meals
Your child must know that missing meals isn’t appropriate for the following
reasons:
 If he has type 1 diabetes, a missed meal is a fairly certain prelude to a
hypoglycemic (low blood glucose) reaction. Breakfast is especially
important because he or she is going from the fasting (sleeping) state,
when energy needs are minimal, to the state of activity, when calories
326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

are essential. Your school-age child will have trouble with morning classes
when no food energy is available.
 A second problem associated with a missed meal is the extreme feeling of
hunger that leads to overcompensating during the next meal. Overeating
at that meal can make your child go from low to very high blood glucose
very rapidly.
 Finally, the lesson that your child receives when he or she misses meals
is that irregular eating is acceptable. The best way to encourage weight
control is to teach regular eating of smaller meals and snacks, which is
a program that anyone can follow for life and be fairly certain of getting
good, balanced nutrition. After the initial weight loss, people rarely con-
tinue to succeed when their weight loss program calls for missing meals.
Try to standardize the child’s eating to the extent possible by
 Encouraging three moderate-sized meals and two low-sugar snacks daily.
 Offering water or lowfat milk for a beverage, not soda or other beverages
with a lot of sugar. Diet drinks that emphasize sweetness just make the
child believe that sweetness is essential in a liquid.
 Offering food about the same time each day and in the same quantities.
Ensuring Good Restaurant Eating
A high-calorie, high-fat diet isn’t good for you no matter where you eat it.
Certain places, such as fast-food restaurants, promote these types of diets
most of the time. If your child is permitted to choose, he or she will make
choices that promote unhealthy weight gain. A film producer who ate only
McDonald’s food for one month developed serious abnormalities of his liver,
a very high cholesterol level, and other unhealthy changes (see the movie
Super Size Me). He developed these health problems mainly because he made
the poor choices of eating the large portions of burgers, soft drinks, and fries.
If you eat at fast-food places with your kids, review Chapter 18 so that you’re
prepared to point out the best menu selections. If the foods for the restaurant
you frequent aren’t in the chapter, find out where you can get nutritional
information. To find this information, you can visit the fast-food company’s
Web site or you can write to the company if you get the address. Alternately,
publications exist that list the food in these restaurants with their nutrient
content. One example is The Get With The Program! Guide to Fast Food and
Family Restaurants by Bob Greene (Simon & Schuster). Another is The
NutriBase Guide to Fast-Food Nutrition by NutriBase (Avery Publishing Group).

Chapter 22: Ten Tactics for Teaching Children Healthy Eating Habits

If you go to restaurants other than fast-food places, encourage your child to
find out what’s in the food he or she orders. Considering what you pay for the
food, you’re entitled to know what you’re getting. Point out the fact that por-
tions, even children’s portions, are usually too large. Set an example in the
restaurant by ordering appetizers rather than main dishes or taking half of
your food home.
Don’t tell your child how much time to take to eat; let your child decide what’s
best because your child knows when he or she is full. If your child leaves food
on the plate, don’t point out that starving people in some remote country
would love to get their hands on the leftovers. Don’t try to regulate your child’s
food intake by telling him or her to stop eating or to keep eating. Rather, set an
example by stopping when you know you’ve had enough. If your child has type
1 diabetes, discuss the need for enough carbohydrate at each meal.
In addition, avoid buffets. You and your child are bound to overeat when the
food is unlimited. You’ll want to get your “money’s worth,” and you’ll proba-
bly end up with large portions and no idea what is in them.
Monitoring TV Food Ads with Your Child
Like it or not, your child spends a certain amount of time in front of the tele-
vision every day. The ads that he or she views are most likely for high-calorie,
high-sugar, high-fat snack foods. Sitting with your child for some of the view-
ing time and discussing the nutritional content of the food is important and
valuable. Even if you keep that kind of food out of your grocery cart and your
house, your child will eventually go to a friend’s home and find that food.
If you’ve discussed the food in advance, your child is in a position to turn it
down or at least to know how eating it affects his or her nutritional plan. Don’t
expect your child to be perfect with food at home or away. Are you? We con-
fess that we sometimes stray from perfect eating ourselves.
Your child needs to see how poor food choices affect his or her blood glucose.
Such an observation may be enough to prevent your child from making that
particular choice again. On the other hand, you never want to nag your child
about eating off the nutritional plan. Rather, accept the misstep and tell the
child to move back to appropriate eating with the next meal.
328
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Involving the Child with the Dietitian
The dietary needs of growing children are complicated enough, but when you
factor in diabetes as well, the situation may be beyond the knowledge of a
parent. Start your child’s nutritional plan by working with a pediatric dietit-
ian from the very beginning. Involve the child, if he or she is old enough; any
child of ten or older can be involved with his or her food choices. A nutri-
tional plan for diabetes isn’t something you impose upon your child, but
something you work out together with your child.
You and the dietitian must take your child’s food preferences into considera-
tion. If you don’t, your child won’t likely follow any plan that you devise with
the dietitian. Work out a diet with the dietitian that is about 50 to 60 percent
carbohydrate, 20 percent protein, and 30 percent fat with less than 10 per-
cent saturated fat.
Ask the dietitian to teach you and your child how to count the carbohydrates
in a meal. Knowing the carbohydrate count is the easiest way to determine
how much insulin to take.
Utilizing the Experts
You can make use of expert advice to help with your child’s nutrition. The
American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) and the Juvenile
Diabetes Research Foundation (www.jdrf.org) both offer plenty of food-
related materials, as do many other organizations. You can find more info on
both organizations through Dr. Rubin’s Web page at www.drrubin.com.
Probably one of the most valuable resources is the American Dietetic
Association, which also has a Web site (www.eatright.org — a link is avail-
able through Dr. Rubin’s site). The association can provide nutrition plans,
recipes, nutritional analysis of foods, and other useful information.

id you think that you were finished with this book?
Not so fast! We couldn’t leave you without adding a
few helpful appendixes chock-full of extra information on
diabetes.
In Appendix A, you can read about the great restaurants
that contributed recipes to this cookbook. Appendix B
shows you how to use diabetic exchanges to figure out a
proper diabetic diet. The exchanges help you know what
and how much food should be eaten to maintain normal
weight and normal blood glucose levels, the key to pre-
vention of diabetes complications.
Appendix C is a cooking glossary that defines terms that
you find in this book. Appendix D offers a handy list of
weights and measures so you can convert any quantity
in a recipe to another system of measurement.
Appendix E shows you where you can find more great
recipes for a person with diabetes, both in books and
on the Web.

Restaurant Descriptions

fter you have had a chance to look over and try some of the wonderful
dishes in this book, you’ll never again think that people with diabetes
can’t enjoy terrific meals. The chefs who contributed these recipes are
health- and nutrition-conscious, and you’ll probably be able to find other
choices on their menus that also fit your nutritional plan very well. However,
note that we have tried to reduce kilocalories by reducing fat and sugar
intake as much as possible — with the agreement of the chefs — as well as
keeping salt intake on the low side.
The meal you receive in the restaurant may not be exactly what you find here,
especially because chefs change often; also, chefs sometimes cook for 100 or
more people, and their measurements may not be exact every time. Most food
must be prepared rapidly in a restaurant and not the same way. You’ll also
receive a portion that is generally too large, so be prepared to take some home.
The restaurants that contributed recipes for this book are all fine restaurants
that have been given the stamp of approval by various testing organizations.
You will not be disappointed no matter what you eat in these establishments,
but the kilocalories and the distribution of carbohydrates, protein, and fat
may not fit your nutritional plan perfectly. You need to adjust other meals
and snacks to get your overall nutrition plan to conform to the guidelines for
a full day (see Chapter 2).
The difficulty of preparation for the recipes in this book varies greatly. For a
few reasons, we include some recipes that are more labor-intensive and time-
intensive than usual.
 First, many of you are excellent cooks and will try these recipes despite
the difficulties because they’re delicious and worth the time.
 Second, even if you choose not to try specific recipes, you’ll find won-
derful tips about foods and techniques to incorporate into whatever you
cook.
 Third, you’ll get an idea of what goes into the magical foods that our fine
restaurants are turning out, and you can choose to order that dish if you
go to that restaurant.
Whatever your pleasure, bon appétit!

Metro Bis
928 Hopmeadow St., Simsbury, Connecticut; 860-651-1908
Chef/owner Chris Prosperi has created a small masterpiece at his tiny restau-
rant that the New York Times has declared is “worth a detour.” He calls the
restaurant an American bistro. This style of cooking creatively combines fla-
vors, herbs, and spices from around the world while maintaining the integrity
of their original cuisines. Items like spring rolls, smoked salmon, goat cheese
tarts, and Maryland lump crab “cocktail” are comfortably situated on the
Metro Bis menu with traditional favorites like grilled Gorgonzola-crusted New
York strip steak and potato-and-chive gnocchi with wild mushrooms.
Chef Prosperi’s French father is a pastry chef who teaches at the Culinary
Institute of America, and his Austrian mother was a restaurant manager. This
was the foundation upon which an education at the Culinary Institute was
built. Apprenticeships at several fine restaurants followed, and Chris now
teaches cooking at several schools and writes a weekly cooking column.
Chris Prosperi has given us the following innovative recipes:
 Corn and Sweet Potato Chowder (Chapter 8)
 Panzanella (Chapter 9)
 Braised Chicken Legs with Mushrooms (Chapter 13)

Paley’s Place
1204 NW 21st Ave., Portland, Oregon; 503-243-2403
Vitaly Paley, chef of Paley’s Place, was born near Kiev in the former Soviet
Union. He was groomed to be a concert pianist and came to America to study
at Juilliard. However, he was lured by the excitement of the restaurant busi-
ness and the creative challenges of cooking. He studied at the French Culinary
Institute in New York and fine-tuned his skills at fine restaurants in New York
and France. Vitaly came to Portland and opened Paley’s Place with his wife,
Kimberly, in 1995. Kimberly has as much experience running the front of a
restaurant as Vitaly has in the kitchen.
The setting is an old home. The cuisine is French bistro fare. The ingredients
are from the Pacific Northwest from local farmers and ranches. Vitaly uses
them to produce classic food similar to the classic music he once performed.
Paley’s Place contributed the following recipes to this book:
 Truffle Vinaigrette (Chapter 9)
 Summer Tomato Salad (Chapter 9)
 B.B.Q. Cedar-Planked Salmon (Chapter 12)

Peristyle
1041 Dumaine St., New Orleans, Louisiana; 504-593-0935
Peristyle in New Orleans has gone through a number of ownership changes in
the last few years but has now settled in the very capable hands of chef/owner
Tom Wolfe. Wolfe won numerous awards in his first restaurant, Wolfe’s of New
Orleans, including important awards from Bon Appétit, Esquire, and Wine
Spectator. The tradition continues at Peristyle. He produces French-influenced
cooking, to be expected since he grew up in New Orleans and most of his culi-
nary experience is there, including at the famous Emeril’s, where he worked
for eight years.
The dining room is inviting, with its mauve tones and numerous styles of mir-
rors adorning the walls. This upscale bistro restaurant comfortably seats
65 guests. Peristyle radiates the elegance of a New Orleans French Quarter
restaurant. The restaurant lives up to its name with its dark wood columns
and spacious dining room.

Sauce (Chapter 14)
 Wolfe’s BBQ Sauce (Chapter 15)
Poggio
777 Bridgeway, Sausalito, California; 415-332-7771
One of the newest kids on the block, Poggio has already made a major name
for itself in the San Francisco Bay area. This is hardly a surprise given the
people who own and cook for this restaurant. It is the dream of famed restau-
rateur Larry Mindel, who has been creating great restaurants for 30 years.
Past creations include Ciao and Prego in San Francisco; Guaymas in Tiburon,
California; and MacArthur Park in San Francisco and Palo Alto. He also pio-
neered the concept of the Italian bakery and restaurant at Il Forniao. He has
been recognized by the Italian government for his contribution to preserving
the Italian heritage outside of Italy.
Larry is joined in the kitchen by chef and partner Chris Fernandez. Chris
worked at several top restaurants, including River Place Alexis Hotel in
Portland, Oregon, and Oliveto in Oakland, California, after graduating from
the Western Culinary Institute. He has honed his skills at many other fine
restaurants, including Delfina in Tuscany. At Poggio he uses the best of the
local ingredients to make classic Italian food with care and respect.
Poggio provided these recipes for this book:
 Red-Wine-Braised Lentils (Chapter 10)
 Spit-Roasted Pork Loin with White Beans all’ Uccelletto (Chapter 14)
 Spinach-Ricotta Gnocchi (Chapter 15)
Rathbun’s
112 Krog St., Suite R, Atlanta, Georgia; 404-524-8280
Rathbun’s is the dream of executive chef Kevin Rathbun, who developed his
great love for extraordinary food at a very young age. He developed an appre-
ciation for the freshest of foods in his mother’s and grandmother’s gardens,
where the fruits and vegetables came directly from vine to table. His father, a
musician, loved to cook great barbecue for his musician friends.
340
Part V: Appendixes 

Kevin began in restaurants as an apprentice at age 14. Soon he was working
for such famous chefs as Bradley Ogden and Emeril Lagasse at Commander’s
Palace in New Orleans. Kevin worked at several other restaurants, which he
helped to become award winners. He came to Atlanta as executive chef at
NAVA. This establishment, too, quickly rose to the top rung of restaurants in
Atlanta.
In 2004, Kevin opened Rathbun’s, where he features a Modern American menu.
Aware of the problems of obesity, Kevin offers small plates for those who limit
their portions. Rathbun’s contributed the following recipes for this book:
 Cauliflower-Parmesan Soup (Chapter 8)
 Zucchini and Parmigiano-Reggiano Salad (Chapter 11)
 Pan-Roasted Cod with Shrimp and Mirliton Squash (Chapter 12)

Appendix B
Exchange Lists
I
n this appendix, you can find the Food Exchange Lists for Diabetes that
are the basis of a popular meal-planning approach to help you eat the
right number of calories from the correct energy sources. Dietitians recom-
mend certain foods, but the patient has the choice to use whatever foods he
or she wants. For more information on how to use the exchange method of
balancing your diet, see Chapter 2.
Listing the Foods
Thousands of different foods are available, and each one can be grouped on
the basis of the energy source (carbohydrate, protein, or fat) that is most
prevalent in the food. Fortunately, the food content of one type of fish —
salmon, for example — is just about the same as another type of fish, such as
halibut. Therefore, a diet that calls for one meat exchange can use any one of
a number of choices or exchanges. You can exchange one for the other, so
your diet is never boring.
Listing all food sources in this space isn’t possible. But for a list of just about
all available foods, purchase The Official Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges
from the American Diabetes Association at 800-232-6733 or through the ADA
Web site listed in Appendix E.
Starch list
Tables B-1 and B-2 list starch exchanges. Each exchange contains 15 grams of
carbohydrate plus 3 grams of protein and 0 to 1 grams of fat, which amounts
to 80 kilocalories per exchange. Foods containing whole grains have about 
2 grams of fiber.

Using Exchanges to Create a Diet
Foods in exchange lists make it easy to create a diet with great variation.
You can find typical diets in The Official Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges
from the American Diabetes Association, but remember that they generally
permit more carbohydrate than we do. The menus in this section have been
adjusted to reflect the lower carbohydrate and higher protein that we recom-
mend. Table B-5 shows our exchange amounts for diets of 1,500 kilocalories.
Table B-6 offers a sample menu.
This diet provides 150 grams of carbohydrate, 125 grams of protein, and 45
grams of fat, keeping it in line with the 40-percent carbohydrate, 30-percent
protein, and 30-percent fat program.
You can have the total menu in Table B-6 on one day.

Conversions of Weights, Measures,
and Sugar Substitutes

o you know how many tablespoons are in a cup? How many grams are
in a pound? And how do you choose between all those sugar substi-
tutes on the market? What if you need to convert an oven temperature from
Celsius to Fahrenheit? This appendix offers some information to help you
answer those questions.
Conversions
The following list provides some common measurement conversions.
1 teaspoon = 1⁄3 tablespoon
1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons
2 tablespoons = 1⁄8 cup (1 ounce)
4 tablespoons = 1⁄4 cup
51⁄3 tablespoons = 1⁄3 cup
8 tablespoons = 1⁄2 cup
16 tablespoons = 1 cup
1 cup = 1⁄2 pint
2 cups = 1 pint
2 pints = 1 quart
4 quarts = 1 gallon
1 pound = 16 ounces
1 fluid ounce = 2 tablespoons
16 fluid ounces = 1 pint

Table D-1 explains how to convert specific measurements. For example, if you
have 3 ounces of mushrooms, how many grams of mushrooms do you have?
To find out, multiply 3 by 28.35 (you have 85.05 grams).

Sugar Substitutes
The new approach to nutrition for people with diabetes doesn’t emphasize
the elimination of sugar from your diet entirely as long as you count the kilo-
calories that you consume. When a recipe calls for only a few teaspoons of
sugar, you may want to use table sugar (also known as sucrose). When the
recipe calls for 1⁄4 cup of sugar or more, then substitution with a noncaloric
sweetener of your choice will definitely save you kilocalories. There are also
sweeteners besides glucose that do contain kilocalories but offer other
advantages, such as not raising the blood glucose as fast. (We discuss your
sweet options in more detail in Chapter 2.)
The following sweeteners contain kilocalories that are added into the total
kilocalorie count. They’re absorbed differently than glucose, so they affect
the blood glucose differently.
 Fructose, found in fruits and berries
 Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries
 Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants
Non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners are often much sweeter than table sugar.
Therefore, much less of this type of sweetener is required to accomplish the
same level of sweetness as sugar. The current artificial sweeteners (from oldest
to newest) include the following:
 Saccharin
 Aspartame
 Acesulfame-K
 Sucralose
If you plan to substitute another sweetener for sugar, check out Table D-3 to
find the measurements needed to achieve equal sweetness.
