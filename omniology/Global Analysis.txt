Metric Spaces
Example 1.1 Let (X, dX) and (Y, dY ) be metric spaces. Deﬁne
dX×Y : (X × Y ) × (X × Y ) →R+
0
by
dX×Y ((x1, y1) , (x2, y2)) = max (dX(x1, x2), dY (y1, y2)) .
1. Show that dX×Y is a metric on X × Y .
2. Show that the projections
pX : X × Y →X,
pX(x, y) = x,
pY : X × Y →Y,
pY (x, y) = y,
are continuous mappings.
The geometric interpretation is that dX×Y compares the distances of the coordinates and then chooses
the largest of them.

Figure 1: The points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and their projections onto the two coordinate axes.
1. MET 1. We have assumed that dX and dY are metrics, hence
dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = max (dX(x1, x2), dY (y1, y2)) ≥max(0, 0) = 0.
If
dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = max (dX(x1, x2), dY (y1, y2)) = 0,
then
dX(x1, y1) = 0
and
dY (y1, y2) = 0.
Using that dX and dY are metrics, this implies by MET 1 for dX and dY that x1 = x2
and y1 = y2, thus
(x1, y1) = (x2, y2),
and MET 1 is proved for dX×Y .
MET 2. From dX and dY being symmetric it follows that
dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))
=
max (dX(x1, x2), dY (y1, y2))
=
max (dX(x2, x1), dY (y2, y1))
=
dX×Y ((x2, y2), (x1, y1)) ,
and we have proved MET 2 for dX×Y .

1. Metric Spaces
MET 3. The triangle inequality. If we put in (x, y), we get
dX(x1, x2)
≤
dX(x1, x) + dX(x, x2)
≤
dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x, y)) + dX×Y ((x, y), (x2, y2)) ,
and analogously,
dY (y1, y2) ≤dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x, y)) + dX×Y ((x, y), (x2, y2)) .
Hence the largest of the numbers
dX(x1, x2)
and
dY (y1, y2)
must be smaller than or equal to the common right hand side, thus
dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = max (dX(x1, x2), dY (y1, y2))
≤dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x, y)) + dX×Y ((x, y), (x2, y2)) ,
and MET 3 is proved.
Summing up, we have proved that dX×Y is a metric on X × Y .
2. Since pX : X × Y →X fulﬁls
dX (pX((x, y)), pX ((x0, y0))) = dX(x, x0) ≤dX×Y ((x, y), (x0, y0)) ,
we can to every ε > 0 choose δ = ε. Then it follows from dX×Y ((x, y), (x0, y0)) < ε that
dX (pX((x, y)), pX ((x0, y0))) ≤dX×Y ((x, y), (x0, y0)) < ε,
and we have proved that pX is continuous.
The proof of pY : X × Y →Y also being continuous, is analogous.
Example 1.2 Let (S, d) be a metric space. For every pair of points x, y ∈S, we set
d(x, y) =
d(x, y)
1 + d(x, y).
Show that d is a metric on S with the property
0 ≤d(x, y) < 1
for all x, y ∈S.
Hint: You may in suitable way use that the function ϕ : R+
0 →R+
0 deﬁned by
ϕ(t) =
t
1 + t,
t ∈R+
0 ,
is increasing.
MET 1. Obviously,
d(x, y) =
d(x, y)
1 + d(x, y) ≥0,
and if d(x, y) = 0, then d(x, y) = 0, hence x = y.
MET 2. From d(x, y) = d(y, x) follows that
d(x, y) =
d(x, y)
1 + d(x, y) =
d(y, x)
1 + d(y, x) = d(y, x).

Figure 2: The graph of ϕ(t) and its horizontal asymptote.
MET 3. We shall now turn to the triangle inequality,
d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, x).
Now,
d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, y),
and
ϕ(t) =
t
1 + t = 1 −
1
1 + t ∈[0, 1[
for t ≥0,
is increasing.
Since a positive fraction is increased, if its positive denominator is decreased
(though still positive), it follows that
d(x, y)
=
d(x, y)
1 + d(x, y) = ϕ(d(x, y))
≤
ϕ(d(x, z) + d(z, x)) =
d(x, z) + d(z, y)
1 + d(x, z) + d(z, y)
=
d(x, z)
1 + d(x, z) + d(z, y) +
d(z, y)
1 + d(x, z) + d(z, y)
=
d(x, z)
1 + d(x, z) +
d(z, y)
1 + d(z, y)
=
d(x, z) + d(z, y),
and we have proved that d is a metric.
Now, ϕ(t) ∈[0, 1] for t ∈R+
0 , thus
d(x, y) = ϕ(d(x, y)) ∈[0, 1[
for all x, y ∈S,
hence
0 ≤d(x, y) < 1
for all x, y ∈S.
Remark 1.1 Let ϕ : R+
0 →R+
0 satisfy the following three conditions:
1. ϕ(0) = 0, and ϕ(t) > 0 for t > 0,
2. ϕ is increasing
3. 0 ≤ϕ(t + u) ≤ϕ(t) + ϕ(u) for all t, u ∈R+
0 .
If d is a metric on S, then ϕ ◦d is also a metric on S.
The proof which follows the above, is left to the reader. ♦

1. Metric Spaces
Example 1.3 Let K be an arbitrary set, and let (S, d) be a metric space, in which 0 ≤d(x, y) ≤1
for all x, y ∈S.
Let F(K, S) denote the set of mappings f : K →S.
Deﬁne D : F(K, S) × F(K, S) →R+
0 by
D(f, g) = sup
t∈K
d(f(t), g(t)).
1. Show that D is a metric on F(K, S).
2. Let t0 ∈K be a ﬁxed point in K and deﬁne
Evt0 : F(K, S) →S
by
Evt0(f) = f(t0).
Show that Evt0 is continuous.
(Evt0 is called an evolution map.)

Figure 3: The metric D measures the largest point-wise distance d between the graphs of two functions
over each point in the domain t ∈K.
First notice that since 0 ≤d(x, y) ≤1, we have
D(f, g) = sup
t∈K
d(f(t), g(t)) ≤1
for all f, g ∈F(K, S).
Without a condition of boundedness the supremum could give us +∞, and D would not be deﬁned
on all of F(K, S) × F(K, S).
1. MET 1. Clearly, D(f, g) ≥0. Assume now that
D(f, g) = sup
t∈K
d(f(t), g(t)) = 0.
Then
d(f(t), g(t)) = 0
for all t ∈K,
thus f(t) = g(t) for all t ∈K. This means that f = g, and MET 1 is proved.
MET 2. is obvious, because
D(f, g) = sup
t∈K
d(f(t), g(t)) = sup
t∈K
d(g(t), f(t)) = D(g, f).
MET 3. It follows from
d(f(t), g(t)) ≤d(f(t), h(t)) + d(h(t), g(t))
for all t ∈K,
that
D(f, g) = sup
t∈K
d(f(t), g(t)) ≤sup
t∈K
{d(f(t), h(t)) + d(h(t), g(t))}.

1. Metric Spaces
The maximum/supremum of a sum is of course at most equal to the sum of each of the
maxima/suprema, so we continue the estimate by
D(f, g) ≤sup
t∈K
d(f(t), h(t)) + sup
t∈K
d(h(t), g(t)) = D(f, h) + D(g, h),
and MET 3 is proved.
Summing up, we have proved that D is a metric on F(K, S).
2. Since
d (Evt0(f), Evt0(g)) = d (f(t0), g(t0)) ≤sup
t∈K
d(f(t), g(t)) = D(f, g),
we can to every ε > 0 choose δ = ε, such that if
D(f, g) < δ = ε,
then
d (Evt0(f), Evt0(g)) ≤D(f, g) < ε,
and the map Evt0 : F(K, S) →D is continuous.

1. Metric Spaces
Example 1.4 Example 1.1 (2) and Example 1.3 (2) are both special cases of a general result. Try to
formulate such a general result.
Let (X, dX) and (T, dY ) be two metric spaces, and let ϕ : R+
0 →R+
0 be a continuous and strictly
increasing map (at least in a non-empty interval of the form [0, a]) with ϕ(0) = 0. Then the inverse
map ϕ−1 : [0, ϕ(a)] →[0, a] exists, and is continuous and strictly increasing with ϕ−1(0) = 0.
Theorem 1.1 Let f : X →Y be a map. If
dY (f(x), f(y)) ≤ϕ (dX(x, y))
for all x, y ∈X,
then f is continuous.
Proof. We may without loss of generality assume that 0 < ε < a. Choose δ = ϕ−1(ε). If x, y ∈X
satisfy
dX(x, y) < δ = ϕ−1(ε),
then we have for the image points that
dY (f(x), f(y)) ≤ϕ (dX(x, y)) < ϕ

ϕ−1(ε)

= ε,
and it follows that f is continuous.
Examples.
1. In the previous two examples, ϕ(t) = t, t ∈R+
0 . Clearly, ϕ is continuous and strictly increasing,
and ϕ(0) = 0.
2. Another example is given by ϕ(t) = c · t, t ∈R+
0 , where c > 0 is a constant.
3. Of more sophisticated examples we choose
ϕ(1) =
√
t,
ϕ(t) = exp(t) −1,
ϕ(t) = ln(t + 1),
ϕ(t) = sinh(t),
ϕ(t) = tanh t,
ϕ(t) = Arctan t,
etc. etc..

Topology 1
Example 2.1 Let (S, d) be a metric space. For x ∈S and r ∈R+ let Br(x) denote the open ball in
S with centre x and radius r. Show that the system of open balls in S has the following properties:
1. If y ∈Br(x) then x ∈Br(y).
2. If y ∈Br(x) and 0 < s ≤r −d(x, y), then Bs(y) ⫅Br(x).
3. If d(x, y) ≥r + s, where x, y ∈S, and r, s ∈R+, then Br(x) and Bs(y) are mutually disjoint.
We deﬁne as usual
Br(x) = {y ∈S | d(x, y) < r}.
Figure 4: The two balls Br(x) and Br(y) and the line between the centres x and y. Notice that this
line lies in both balls.
1. If y ∈Br(x), then it follows from the above that d(x, y) < r. Then also d(y, x) < r, which we
interpret as x ∈Br(y).
Figure 5: The larger ball Br(x) contains the smaller ball Bs(y), if only 0 < s ≤r −d(x, y).
2. If z ∈Bs(y), then it follows from the triangle inequality that
d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z) < d(x, y) + s ≤d(x, y) + {r −d(x, y)} = r,
which shows that z ∈Br(x). This is true for every z ∈Bs(y), hence
Bs(y) ⫅Br(x).

Figure 6: Two balls of radii r and s resp., where d(x, y) ≥r + s.
3. Indirect proof. Assume that the two balls are not disjoint. Then there exists a z ∈Br(x)∩Bs(y).
We infer from the assumption d(x, y) ≥r + s and the triangle inequality that
r + s ≤d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(x, y) < r + s,
thus r + r < r + s, which is a contradiction. Hence our assumption is false, and we conclude
that Br(x), and Bs(y) are disjoint.

2. Topology 1
Example 2.2 Let (S, d) be a metric space. A subset K in S is called bounded in (S, d), if there
exists a point x ∈S and an r ∈R+ such that K ⫅Br(x).
Examine the truth of each of the following three statements:
1. If two subsets K1 and K2 in S are bounded in (S, d), then their union K1 ∪K2 is also bounded
in (S, d).
2. If K ⫅S is bounded in (S, d) then
K′ =

x∈K
{y ∈S | d(x, y) ≤1}
is also bounded in (S, d).
3. If K ⊆S is bounded in (S, d) then
K′′ =

x∈K
{y ∈S | d(x, y) > 1}
is also bounded in (S, d).
Figure 7: The smaller disc is caught by the larger disc of centre x0, if only its radius is suﬃciently
large.
Here there are several possibilities of solution. The elegant solution applies that a set K is bounded,
if there exists an R ∈R+, such that K ⫅BR(x0), where x0 ∈S is a ﬁxed point, which can be used
for every bounded subset. In fact, if K ⫅Br(x), then d(y, x) < r for all y ∈K. Then by the triangle
inequality
d(y, x0) ≤d(y, x) + d(x, x0) < d(x, x0) + r = R(x),
thus K ⫅BR(x0) = BR(x)(x0).
1. First solution. If K1 and K2 are bounded subsets, then we get with the same reference point
x0 ∈S,
K1 ⫅BR1(x0)
and
K2 ⫅BR2(x0),
hence
K1 ∪K2 ⫅BR1(x0) ∪BR2(x0) = Bmax{R1,R2}(x0) = BR(x0).
Now R = max{R1, R2} < +∞, so it follows that the union K1 ∪K2 is bounded, when both
K1 and K2 are bounded.

2. Topology 1
Figure 8: A graphic description of the second solution.
Second solution. Here we give a proof which is closer to the deﬁnition. First note that there
are x, y ∈S and r, s > 0, such that
K1 ⫅Br(x)
and
K2 ⫅Bs(y).
Choosing R = r + d(x, y) + s > r, it is obvious that since the radius is increased and the
centre is the same
K1 ⫅Br(x) ⫅BR(x).
Then apply a result from Example 2.1 (2),
K2 ⫅Bs(y) ⫅Br+d(x,y)+s(x) = BR(x),
and we see that K1 ∪K2 ⫅BR(x) ∪BR(x) = BR(x) is bounded.
Alternatively, it follows for every z ∈Bs(y) that
d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z) < d(x, y) + s < R,
s˚a K2 ⫅Bs(y) ⫅BR(x).
2. Now K is bounded, so K ⫅BR(x0), and
K′ ⫅BR+1(x0).
In fact, if y ∈K′, then we can ﬁnd an x ∈K, such that d(x, y) ≤1. Since x ∈K ⫅BR(x0), we
have d(x, x0) < R. Thus
d(y, x0) ≤d(y, x) + d(x, x0) < R + 1,
and therefore y ∈BR+1(x0). This holds for every y ∈K′, so K′ ⫅BR+1(x0), and K′ is bounded.
3. First possibility; the metric d is bounded. In this case there is a constant c > 0, such that
d(x, y) ≤c < +∞
for all x, y ∈S.
In particular, S is itself bounded,
S = Bc(x),
for every x ∈S.
Every subset of S is bounded.
Second possibility; the metric d is unbounded. In this case the claim is not true. In fact,
the complementary set of K′′
(1)
S \ K′′ =

x∈K
{y ∈S | d(x, y) ≤1} = K′
is bounded according to the second question.
Then S = K′ ∪K′′ is a disjoint union,
and since K′ is bounded, while S is unbounded, we conclude that K′′ is also unbounded.
(Otherwise K′ ∪K′′ would be bounded by the ﬁrst question).

Remark 2.1 Proof of (1). If

is replaced by the negation d(x, y) ≤1, and (1) follows. ♦

2. Topology 1
Example 2.3 List all topologies that can be deﬁned on a set S = {a, b} containing only two elements
a and b.
Every topology must contain at least the empty set ∅and the total space S = {a, b}.
The only
possibilities are
T1 = {∅, S},
T2 = {∅, {a}, S},
T3 = {∅, {b}, S},
T4 = D(S) = {∅, {a}, {b}, S},
where D(S) denotes the set of all subsets of S. It is well-known that T1 and T4 are topologies, called
the coarsest and the ﬁnest topology on S).
Since any union and even any intersection of sets from T2 again belong to T2, it follows that T2 is a
topology.
Analogously for T3 (exchange a by b).
The four possibilities above are therefore all possible topologies on S = {a, b}.
Example 2.4 Let T be the system of subsets U in R which is one of the following types:
Either
(i) U does not contain 0,
or
(ii) U does contain 0, and the complementary set R \ U is ﬁnite.
1. Show that T is a topology on R.
2. Show that R with the topology T is a Hausdorﬀspace.
(A topological space (S, T ) is called a Hausdorﬀspace, if one to any pair of points x, y ∈S,
where x ̸= y, can ﬁnd a corresponding pair of disjoint open sets U, V ∈T , such that x ∈U and
y ∈V )
3. Prove that the topology T on R is not generated by a metric on R, because there does not exist
any countable system of open neighbourhoods of 0 ∈R in the topology T with the property that
any arbitrary open set of 0 ∈R contains a neighbourhood from this system.

2. We shall now prove that the space (R, T ) is a Hausdorﬀspace.
(i) If x, y ∈R \ {0}, then {x}, {y} ∈T by deﬁnition (i). Furthermore, if x ̸= y, then clearly
{x} ∩{y} = ∅.
(ii) If x ∈R \ {0} and y = 0, then {x}, R \ {x} ∈T by (i) and (ii), resp., and 0 ∈R \ {x}, and
{x} ∩(R \ {x}) = ∅.
We have proved that the space is a Hausdorﬀspace.
3. Assume that {Un | n ∈N} is a countable system of open neighbourhoods of 0, thus 0 ∈Un, and
R \ Un is ﬁnite. Then the “exceptional set”

is at most countable. In particular, A ̸= R.
Choose any point a ∈R \ (A ∪{0}). Then U = R \ {a} ∈T is a neighbourhood of 0, and none
of the Un is contained in U.
In fact, if Un ⫅U, then
{a} = R \ U ⫅R \ Un ⫅

Continuous mappings
Example 3.1 Let S be a topological space with topology T , and let π : S →˜S be a mapping into a
set ˜S. Let ˜T be the quotient topology induced from the topology T on S by the mapping π.
1. Let T ′ be a topology on ˜S, such that π : S →˜S is continuous when S is considered with the
topology T and ˜S with the topology T ′.
Show that T ′ ⫅˜T.
(The quotient topology ˜T on ˜S is in other words the ‘largest’ topology on ˜S for which π : S →˜S
is continuous.)
2. Show that when ˜S has the quotient topology determined by the mapping π : S →˜S, then the
following holds:
• A mapping f : ˜S →T into a topological space T is continuous if and only if the composite
mapping f ◦π : S →T is continuous.

Figure 9: The topology T is deﬁned on S, and the quotient topology ˜T , or T ′, is deﬁned on ˜S.
We recall that the quotient topology is deﬁned by
˜T = {V ⫅˜S | U = π−1(V ) ∈T }.
1. If π : S →˜S is continuous in the topology T ′ on ˜S and T on S, then
π−1(V ) ∈T
for ehvery V ∈T ′,
hence V ∈˜T for every V ∈T ′. This means precisely that
T ′ ⫅˜T .
2. Assume that f : ˜S →T is continuous, where ˜S has the quotient topology ˜T determined by
π : S →˜S, and where T has the topology T ⋆. This means that
f −1(V ) ∈˜T = {W ⫅˜S | π−1(W) ∈T }
for every V ∈T ⋆.
Then it follows that
π−1(W) = π−1

= (f ◦π)−1(V ) ∈T
for every V ∈T ⋆. This is precisely the condition that the composite mapping f ◦π : S →T is

3. Continuous mappings
Example 3.2 Let S be a topological space. For every pair of real-valued functions f, g : S →R, we
can in the usual way deﬁne the functions f + g, f −g, f · g, and (if g(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈S) f/g.
1. Show that if f and g are continuous at a point x0 ∈S, then also f + g, f −g, f · g, and (when
it is deﬁned) f/g are continuous at x0 ∈S.
(Carry through the argument in at least one case.)
2. Assume that f, g : S →R are continuous. Show that
U = {x ∈S | f(x) < g(x)}
is an open set in S.
3. Let f1, . . . , fk : S →R be continuous real-valued functions. Show that
U = {x ∈S | fi(x) < ai, i = 1, . . . , k}
is an open set in S, where a1, . . . , ak ∈R are real numbers.

[a + b −ε, a + b + ε].
1. In reality, this example is concerned with the continuity of the basic four arithmetical operations
+, −, · : R × R →R

/ : R × (R \ {0}) →R.
The remaining part follows easily by composition of continuous mappings.
(a) Addition + : R × R →R is continuous.
Let (a, b) ∈R × R be given. To every ε > 0 choose δ = ε
2. If
|x −a| < ε
2
and
|y −b| < ε
2,
then
|(x + y) −(a + b)| ≤|x −a| + |y −b| < ε,
which is precisely the classical proof of continuity.
(b) Subtraction −: R × R →R follows the same pattern: If
|x −a| < ε
2
and
|y −b| < ε
2,
then
|(x −y) −(a −b)| ≤|x −a| + |y −b| < ε.

3. Continuous mappings
(c) Multiplication · : R × R →R is continuous.
We ﬁrst assume that |x−a| < δ and |y −b| < δ in order to derive the right relation between
δ and ε. From f(x, y) = x · y, we get by the triangle inequality by inserting −ay + av = 0
that
|f(x, y) −f(a, b)|
=
|xy −an| = |xy −ay + au −ab|
≤
|x −a| · |y| + |a| · |y −b| ≤δ · |y| + |a| · δ
≤
δ(|b| + δ + |a|).
Since ϕ(δ) = δ(|a| + |b| + δ) is continuous and strictly increasing for δ ∈R+
0 of the value
ϕ(0) = 0, the mapping ϕ has a (continuous) inverse ϕ−1. By choosing δ = ϕ−1(ε), we get
precisely
|f(x, y) −f(a, b)| ≤ϕ(δ) = ε,
and the multiplication is continuous.
(d) The mapping y →1
y is continuous for y ∈R \ {0}.
Let b ̸= 0, and choose y and δ ∈]0, |b|[, such that
|y −b| < δ < |b|.
Then

and the mapping is continuous.
(e) If the denominator is ̸= 0, then the division is continuous.
This is obvious, because division is composed of the continuous mappings

thus it is itself continuous.
Summing up we have proved that if ϕ : R×R →R is one of the four basic arithmetical operations
+, −, ·, / (provided the denominator is ̸= 0), then ϕ is continuous. Then the mapping
∆

because f × f is continuous at (x0, x0) ∈S × S.
We have now proved 1).
2. If f, g : S →R are both continuous, then f −g : S →R is also continuous according to 1).
Then
U = {x ∈S | f(x) < g(x)} = {x ∈S | (f −g)(x) < 0} = (f −g)◦−1(] −∞, 0[)

The induced topology TA is deﬁned by

1. Assume that B′ ⫅A is closed in TA, thus A \ B′ is open in TA. By the above there is an U ∈T ,
such that
U ∩A = A \ B′.
Then B = S \ U is closed, and
B ∩A = A ∩(S \ U) = A \ U = A \ (A \ B′) = B′.
2. Assume conversely that B′ = A ∩B, where B is closed in S, thus U = S \ B ∈T is open. Then
U ∩A = A ∩(S \ B) = A \ B ∈TA
is open in A, hence
A \ (U ∩A) = A \ (A \ B) = A ∩B = B′

Example 3.4 Let f : X →Y be a mapping between topological spaces X and Y .

Since f is continuous and U ∈TY , we have f ◦−1(U) ∈TX, hence
(f ′)◦−1(U ′) = (f ′)◦−1(U ∩Y ′) = f ◦−1(U) ∩X′ ∈TX′,
proving that f ′ is continuous.

Topology 2
Example 4.1 Let W1 and W2 be arbitrary subsets in the topological space S. Show that
1. int(W1 ∩W2) = int W1∩int W2.
2. int(W1 ∪W2) ⫆int W1∪int W2.
Give an example that the equality sign in (2) does not apply in general.
1. If x ∈int(W1 ∩W2), then there is an open set U in S, such that
x ∈U ⫅W1 ∩W2,
and since W1 ∩W2 ⫅Wi, i = 1, 2, we get in particular that
x ∈U ⫅W1
and
x ∈U ⫅W2,
so x ∈int W1 ∩int W2.
This shows that
int(W1 ∩W2) ⫅int W2 ∩int W2.
Conversely, if x ∈int W1∩int W2, then there exist open sets U1 and U2, such that
x ∈U1 ⫅W1
and
x ∈U2 ⫅W2.
Then U = U1 ∩U2 is open, and
x ∈U = U1 ∩U2 ⫅W1 ∩W2,
thus x ∈int(W1 ∩W2).
It follows that int(W1 ∩W2) ⫆int W1∩int W2, and we have proved that
int(W1 ∩W2) = int W1 ∩int W2.
2. We get from W1 ⫅W1 ∪W2 and W2 ⫅W1 ∪W2 that
int W1 ⫅int(W1 ∪W2)
og
int W2 ⫅int(W1 ∪W2),
hence by taking the union,
int W1 ∪int W2 ⫅int(W1 ∪W2).
3. We do not always have equality here. An extreme example is
W1 = Q ⊂R
and
W2 = R \ Q ⊂R,
i.e. the rational numbers and the irrational numbers. Then int Q = ∅and int(R \ Q) = ∅, hence
∅= int(W1) ∪int(W2) ⊂int(Q ∪(R \ Q)) = int(R) = R,
and we do not have equality.
Example 4.2 Show that a topological space S is a T1-space if and only if every subset in S containing
exactly one point is a closed subset.
Recall that S is a T1-rum, if to any pair x, y ∈S of diﬀerent points, x ̸= y, there exists an open
neighbourhood V of y, such that x /∈V .
1. Assume that all singletons {x}, x ∈S, are closed. Then S \ {x} is open.
If x, y ∈S and x ̸= y, choose U = S \ {y} as an open neighbourhood of x, and V = S \ {x} as
an open neighbourhood of y. Then clearly, y /∈U and x /∈V , and S is a T1-space.

2. Conversely, assume that e.g. {x} is not closed. Then the closure {x} contains a point
y ∈{x} \ {x} ̸= ∅, and {x} is the smallest closed set which contains x.
If S were a T1-rum, then there would be an open neighbourhood V of y, which does not contain
x. Then {x}∩(S\V ) would be closed (as an intersection of two closed sets), non-empty (because
x lies in both sets), and certainly contained in {x}, i.e.
∅̸= {x} ∩(S \ V ) ⫅{x} \ {y}



⊂{x},
̸= {x}.
This is not possible because {x} is deﬁned as the smallest closed set containing {x}.
Hence, if S is a T1-space, then every point {x} is closed.

4. Topology 2
Example 4.3 Let S be a Hausdorﬀspace, and let W be an arbitrary subset of S. (It is suﬃcient that
S satisﬁes the separation property T1).
Prove that if x ∈S is an accumulation point of W, then every neighbourhod of x in S contains
inﬁnitely many diﬀerent points of W.
An accumulation point x ∈S of W is a point for which every neighbourhood U of x (in S) contains
at least one point y ∈W, where y ̸= x.
Let U1 be any open neighbourhood of x, and choose y1 ∈W ∩U1, such that y1 ̸= x. It follows
from Example 4.2 that {y1} is closed, if S is just a T1-space. Then U2 = U1 \ {y1} is an open
neighbourhood of x, and we can choose y2 ∈W ∩U2 \ {x}, i.e. y2 ̸= x and y2 ̸= y1.
Then consider the open set U3 = U1 \ {y1, y2}, etc.
In the n-th step we have an open neighbourhood
Un = Un−1 \ {y1, y2, . . . , yn−1}
of x, where y1, y2, . . . , yn−1 ∈W are mutually diﬀerent, and where each of them is diﬀerent from x.
Then choose yn ∈Un ∩W, such that yn ̸= x, and yn diﬀerent from all the previous chosen elements
{y1, y2, . . . , y2}.

4. Topology 2
Since
Un+1 = U1 \ {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is open and x ∈Un+1 ̸= ∅,
the process never stops, and we have proved that any open neighbourhood of x contains inﬁnitely
many diﬀerent elements from W.
If U is any neighbourhood of x, then it contains an open neighbourhood U1 of x, thus x ∈U1 ⫅U.
Since already U1 has the wanted property, the larger set U will also have it.
Example 4.4 Let (S, d) be a metric space. For an arbitrary non-empty subset W in S, we deﬁne a
function ϕ : S →R by
ϕ(x) = inf{d(x, y) | y ∈W}
for x ∈S.
We call ϕ(x) the distance from x to W, and write, accordingly,
ϕ(x) = d(x, W).
1. Let x1, x2 ∈S be arbitrary points in S.
First show that for an arbitrary point y ∈W it holds that
ϕ(x1) ≤d(x1, x2) + d(x2, y).
Next show that
|ϕ(x1) −ϕ(x2)| ≤d(x1, x2),
and conclude from this fact that ϕ is (uniformly) continuous on S.
2. Show that
d(x, W) = ϕ(x)
⇐⇒
x ∈W,
where W as usual denotes the closure of W.
3. Let A1 and A2 be disjoint, non-empty closed subsets in the metric space (S, d). Show that there
exist disjoint, open sets U1 and U2 in S, such that A1 ⫅U1 and A2 ⫅U2.
Hint: Consider the distance functions ϕ1(x) = d(x, A1) and ϕ2(x) = d(x, A2).

1. This example is an exercise in the triangle inequality. Let y ∈W and x1, x2 ∈S. Then
ϕ(x1) = inf{d(x1, ˜y) | ˜y ∈W} ≤d(x1, y) ≤d(x1, x2) + d(x2, y).
It follows from
ϕ(x1) ≤d(x1, x2) + d(x2, y)
for every y ∈W,
that
ϕ(x1) ≤d(x1, x2) + inf{d(x2, y) | y ∈W} = d(x1, x2) + ϕ(x2),
hence
ϕ(x1) −ϕ(x2) ≤d(x1, x2).
An interchange of x1 and x2 gives
ϕ(x2) −ϕ(x1) ≤d(x2, x1) = d(x1, x2),
hence
|ϕ(x1) −ϕ(x2)| ≤d(x1, x2).
Now we can independently of the points x1 and x2 ∈S to every ε > 0 choose δ = ε > 0, such
that
d(x1, x2) < ε
implies that
|ϕ(x1) −ϕ(x2)| < ε,
hence ϕ is uniformly continuous.
2. Assume that ϕ(x) = 0, i.e.
ϕ(x) = inf{d(x, y) | y ∈W} = 0.
Then there exists a sequence {yn} ⫅W, such that d(x, yn) < 1
n, and every open ball B1/n(x)
of centre x and radius 1
n contains points from W,
W ∩B1/n(x) ̸= ∅
for every n ∈N.
Then x ∈W.
Conversely, if x ∈W, then there exists a sequence {yn} ⫅W, such that
d(x, yn) < 1
n.
Then
0 ≤ϕ(x) = inf{d(x, y) | y ∈W} ≤inf{d(x, yn) | y ∈W} = 0,
and hence ϕ(x) = 0.
3. Let ϕ1(x) = d(x, A1) and ϕ2(x) = d(x, A2). If x1 ∈A1 and x2 ∈A2, then clearly
ϕ2(x2) ≤d(x1, x2)
and
ϕ1(x1) ≤d(x1, x2).

We shall prove that U1 ∩U2 = ∅.
Indirect proof. Assume that there exists z ∈U1∩U2. Then there are an x1 ∈A1 and an x2 ∈A2,
such that also
z ∈U1(x1) ∩U2(x2).
Then we get the following contradiction,
0 < d(x1, x2) ≤d(x1, z) + d(z, x2) ≤1
3 ϕ1(x2) + 1
3 ϕ2(x1) ≤2
3 d(x1, x2).
This cannot be true, so our assumption must be wrong. We therefore conclude that U1 ∩U2 = ∅,
and the claim is proved.

2. Let x ∈[0, 1[. Then any open neighbourhood of x is of the form
U = {y ∈R | 0 ≤y < k},
where x < k.
It follows from xn =

n + 1 < k for n > 1
k −1 = n0 that xn →x for n →∞. Since x ∈S is
chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that xn →x for n →∞for every x ∈S in T .
3. The topology can never be generated of a metric. In fact, a metric space is automatically a
Hausdorﬀspace, and in a Hausdorﬀspace S any sequence (xn) has at most one limit point. In
the present example every point of S is a limit point.

Furthermore, an ↗x0 and bn ↘x0. Since the construction secures that every bn is an upper bound
of A, thus
x ≤bn

we conclude that x0 is also an upper bound of A.
Since none of the an is an upper bound of A, because we by the construction always can ﬁnd an
xn ∈A, such that an < xn, and since an ↗x0, we infer that x0 is the smallest upper bound of A,
hence x0 = sup A.
Example 5.2 Let S be a topological space, and let (fn), or in more detail f1, f2, . . . , fn, . . . , be a
sequence of continuous functions fn : S →R, such that for all x ∈S it holds that
(i) fn(x) ≥0,
(ii) f1(x) ≥f2(x) ≥· · · ≥fn(x) ≥· · · ,
(iii) limn→∞fn(x) = 0.
In other words: The decreasing sequence of functions (fn) converges pointwise to the 0-function.
For ε > 0 and n ∈N we set
Un(ε) = {x ∈S | 0 ≤fn(x) < ε}.
1. Show that Un(ε) is an open set in S.
2. Show that for ﬁxed ε > 0, the collection of sets {Un(ε) | n ∈N} deﬁnes an open covering of S.
3. Now assume that S is compact. Show then that for every ε > 0 there is an n0 ∈N, such that
for all n ≥n0 it holds that
0 ≤fn(x) < ε
for all x ∈S;
or written with quantiﬁers,
∀ε > 0∃n0 ∈N∀n ∈N : n ≥n0
=⇒
∀x ∈S : 0 ≤fn(x) < ε.
We conclude that under the given assumptions, the sequence of functions (fn) converges uni-
formly to the 0-function.
This result is due to the Italian mathematician Ulisse Dini (1845 – 1918) and is known as Dini’s
Theorem.
4. Is it of importance that S is compact in (3)?
1. Since every fn ≥0, and each fn is continuous, we get
Un(ε) = {x ∈S | 0 ≤fn(x) < ε} = f ◦−1
n

2. Since
f1(x) ≥f2(x) ≥· · · ≥fn(x) ≥· · · →0,
there is to every ε > 0 and every x ∈S an n ∈N, such that 0 ≤fn(x) < ε, i.e. x ∈Un(ε). Since
this holds for every x ∈S, we have
S ⫅

so {Un(ε) | n ∈N} is an open covering of S, because every Un(ε) is an open set.

3. If S is compact, then the open covering {Un(ε) | n ∈N} of S can be thinned out to a ﬁnite
covering,
S ⫅Un1(ε) ∪Un2(ε) ∪· · · ∪Unk(ε).
It remains to notice that if x ∈Un0(ε), then x ∈Un(ε) for every n ≥n0, hence
Un0(ε) ⫅Un0+1(ε) ⫅· · · .
This follows from fn+1(x) ≤fn(x) < ε. Then we get for n1 < n2 < · · · < nk,
S = Un1(ε) ∪Un2 ∪· · · ∪Unk(ε) = Unk(ε),
hence
S = {x ∈S | fnk(x) < ε}.
If n ≥nk, then it follows that
0 ≤fn(x) ≤fnk(x) < ε,
hence
0 ≤fn(x) < ε
for n ≥nk,
and we have proved Dini’s theorem.

Figure 15: A principal sketch of the graph of fn.
4. The assumption of compactness is of course important. In order to see this, we must construct
an example, in which S is not compact, where the fn ≥0 are all continuous and tend pointwise
and decreasingly towards 0, and where the convergence is not uniform.
Consider S = [0, ∞[, which clearly is not compact. We put
fn(x) =



0,
for x ∈[0, n −1[,
x −n + 1,
for x ∈[n −1, n[,
1,
for x ∈[n, ∞[,
n ∈N.
Then every fn ≥0 is continuous and fn(x) ↘0 for n →∞for every x ∈S, so the convergence
is decreasing. Also, to every n0 ∈N there exist an n ≥n0 and an x ∈S, such that fn(x) = 1.
This holds for all n ≥n0 and all x ≥n, and the convergence is not uniform.
Remark 5.1 The example above illustrates the common observation in Mathematics, that if
something can go wrong, it can go really wrong!. ♦

Since [a, b] is compact, and f and g are continuous, f has a minimum, f(x1) = A, and g a maximum
g(x2) = B, and we infer that
K = {(x, y) ∈R2 | a ≤x ≤b, f(x) ≤y ≤g(x)} ⫅[a, b] × [A, B],
proving that K is bounded.
Furthermore, K is closed. This is proved by showing that the complementary set is open.
There is nothing to prove if (x, y) ∈R2 \ K satisﬁes one of the following conditions,
i) x < a,
ii) x > b,
iii) y < A,
iv) y > B.
Let
(x0, y0) ∈([a, b] × [A, B]) \ K.
We may assume that y0 < f(x0), because the other cases are treated analogously. Using that f is
continuous we can to
ε = 1
3 {f(x0) −y0} > 0
ﬁnd a δ > 0, such that
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ε
for |x −x0| < δ and x ∈[a, b].
Then ]x0 −δ, x0 + δ[ × ]y0 −ε, y0 + ε[ and K are disjoint sets, hence the complementary set of K is
open. This implies that K is closed.
We have proved that K is closed and bounded inR2, so K is compact.

Example 5.5 Let S = N ∪{0} be the set of non-negative integers. For every natural number n ∈N
we deﬁne a subset Un in S by
Un = {n · p ∈S | p = 0, 1, 2, . . . }.
1. Show that for all n, m ∈N, the intersection Un ∩Um has the form Uk for a suitable k ∈N.
Consider the family T of subsets in S which consists of the empty set ∅and all subsets U in S that

2. Show that T is a topology on S.
(The system of subsets {Un | n ∈N} in S is called a basis for the topology T .)
3. Show that the sequence (xn = n!) will converge to every point in the topological space (S, T ).
1. Let k ∈N be the smallest number which can be divided by both m and n. Then we get
Un ∩Um = Uk.
2. The result of 1. implies that ﬁnite intersections of sets of the type Un again can be written as an
Uk. When we form the topology by adding any union of sets of type Uk as open sets, supplied
by ∅, it only remains to note that the whole space S = U1 trivially belongs to T . This proves
that T is a topology.
3. Let y0 ∈N. Then the smallest open set, which contains y0, must necessarily be Uy0.
If we choose n0 ∈N, such that n0! = y0 · k for some k ∈N, it follows that n! ∈Uy0 for every
n ≥n0.
If instead y0 = 0 ∈S, then every Uk is a neighbourhood. Choose n0 ∈N, such that n0! = k · p,
p ∈N, and we obtain that n! ∈Uk for n ≥n0.
This implies by the deﬁnition of convergence in topological spaces that (n!) converges towards
every point in S.

sequentially compact subset K in S.
Hint: Construct a sequence (xn) on K for which

and make use of this to determine a point x0 ∈K, such that
f(x0) = inf f(K).

6. Semi-continuity
1. Indirect proof. Let K be sequentially compact. We assume that f is not bounded from below
on K. This means that we can ﬁnd points xn ∈K, such that f(xn) < −n, n ∈N. We may
assume that all (xn) ⫅K are mutually diﬀerent.
Since K is sequentially compact, (xn) has an accumulation point x0 ∈K.
Since f is lower semi-continuous in x0, we can to every ε > 0 ﬁnd a neighbourhood N of x0 in
S, such that
f(x0) −ε < f(y)
for all y ∈N.
Since x0 is an accumulation point, there are (inﬁnitely many) xn ∈N for which
−n < f(x0) −ε.
Since also xn ∈N, it follows that
f(xn) < −n < f(x0) −ε < f(xn),
which is a contradiction.
We have proved that every lower semi-continuous function f : S →R is bounded from below on
every sequentially compact set.
2. We infer from the deﬁnition of inf f(K) that there exists a sequence (xn) ⫅K, such that
lim
n→∞f(xn) = inf f(K).
The sequence (xn) itself needs not be convergent, but since it has an accumulation point x0 ∈K,
we can extract from it an subsequence which converges towards x0. The image of the sequence
will still converge towards inf f(K), so we may already from the beginning assume that (xn) →
x0.
By assumption, f is lower semi-continuous in x0, so to every ε > 0 there is a neighbourhood N
of x0, such that
f(x0) −ε < f(y)
for every y ∈N.
Using that N is a neighbourhood of x0 and that xn →x0 for n →∞, we infer that there exists
an m, such that xn ∈N for all n ≥m, thus
f(x0) −ε < f(xn)
for all n ≥m.
The right hand side is convergent for n →∞, hence
f(x0) −ε ≤lim
n→∞f(x0) = inf f(K)
for everyε > 0.
Finally, we get by taking the limit ε ↘0,
inf f(K) ≤f(x0) ≤inf f(K),
proving that
f(x0) = inf f(K)
[ = min f(K)].

Example 6.2 Let f : R →R be a diﬀerentiable function with bounded diﬀerential quotient. Show
that f is uniformly continuous.
Hint. You can use the classical Mean Value Theorem.
The diﬀerential quotient Df(z) is bounded, so
sup
z∈R
|Df(x)| = C < +∞.
Using the Mean Value Theorem we get for any x and y that there exists an z between x and y, such
that
f(y) −f(x) = Df(z) · (y −z),
z = z(z, y),
hence
|f(y) −f(x)| = |Df(z)| · |y −x| ≤C · |y −x|.
To any ε > 0 we choose δ = ε
C , such that
|y −x| < δ
implies that
|f(y) −f(x)| < ε,
where δ is independent of x and y. This means that f is uniformly continuous.
Example 6.3 A subset K in a metric space (S, d) is called precompact if for every ε > 0 there exist
ﬁnitely many points x1, . . . , xp ∈K such that
K ⫅Bε(x1) ∪· · · ∪Bε(xp).
1. Show that a subset K ⫅Rn in the space Rn (with Euclidean metric) is precompact if and only
if it is bounded.
2. Let f : X →Y be a mapping between the metric spaces (X, dX) and (Y, dY ), and let K ⫅X
be a precompact subset in X. Show that if f is uniformly continuous in K, then the image set
f(K) ⫅Y is precompact in Y .
1. Let K be precompact, and put ε = 1. There are points x1, . . . , xp, such that
K ⫅B1(x1) ∪· · · ∪B1(xp).
Deﬁning
R = max{d(x1, xj) | j = 1, . . . , p} + 1,
it follows that B1(xj) ⫅BR(x1) for every j ∈{1, . . . , p}, thus
K ⫅B1(x1) ∪· · · ∪B1(xp) ⫅BR(x1),
and K is bounded.
The phrase “K bounded” means that “K can be shut up” in a ball. Therefore, in order to prove
the claim in the opposite direction it suﬃces to show that whenever a ball KR(x0) and an ε > 0
are given, then there exist ﬁnitely many points x1, . . . , xp ∈S, such that
BR(x0) ⫅Bε(x1) ∪Bε(x2) ∪· · · ∪Bε(xp).

Remark 6.1 It is at this point that we use that the metric is Euclidean. In general, the claim
is wrong for metric spaces, which is illustrated by the following example.
Let X = R be equipped with the metric
d(x, y) =
 1
for x ̸= y,
0
for x = y.
A routine check shows that this is indeed a metric. Then R ⫅B1(0) is clearly bounded (the
radius is 1).
If 0 < ε < 1, then Bε(x) = {x}, and
R =

x∈R
{x}
is obviously not precompact.
This example shows that we must require more of the metric – it is quite natural her to assume
that it is Euclidean. ♦
We consider R2 with the usual Euclidean metric. Choose any ε > 0, and assume that
K ⫅[a1, b1] × [a2, b2] × · · · × [an, bn].
Each edge [aj, bj] can be divided into at most
√n
2ε |B −j −aj| + 1 intervals of length 2ε
√n.
This implies that

n-dimensional cubes cover K. Choose the centre of each of these cubes as centre of balls of
radius ε. Then every cube is again covered by a ﬁnite number of balls, and the claim follows.
2. If f is uniformly continuous on a precompact set K, then δ = δ(ε) depends only on ε > 0 and
not on x, y ∈K. Hence, if
dX(x, y) < δ(ε),
then
dY (f(x), f(y)) < ε,
and thus
(2)
f (BX,δ(x)) ⫅BY,ε(f(x)).
The set K is precompact, so there exist x1, . . . , xp ∈K, such that
K ⫅BX,δ(x1) ∪· · · ∪BX,δ(xp).
It follows from (2) that
f(K)
⫅
f (BX,δ(x1)) ∪· · · ∪f (BX,δ(xp))
⫅
BY,ε (f(x1)) ∪· · · ∪BY,ε (f(xp)) .
Since this holds for every ε > 0, we conclude that f(K) is precompact.

1. Let f : S →T be a continuous function, which is not constant, with e.g. {t1, t2} ⫅f(S). Since
{t1} and {t2} are open, both f ◦−1({t1}) and f ◦−1({t2}) are open, disjoint and non-empty, and
S is not connected.
Hence we get by contraposition that if S is connected, then every continuous function f : S →T

Example 6.5 Prove the following theorem: Let M be an arbitrary subset in the number space Rk
with the usual topology, and let {Ui | i ∈I} be an arbitrary system of open sets in Rk that covers
M. Then, either there exists a ﬁnite subsystem {Ui1, . . . , Uin}, or, there exists a countable subsystem
{Ui1, Ui2, . . . , Uin, . . . } that covers M.
The theorem is due to the Finnish mathematician Ernst Lindel¨of (1870–1946), and it is called Lin-
del¨of’s covering theorem.
Hint: consider the following system of open balls in Rk:
Br(x) | r ∈R+ is rational; x ∈Rk has rational coordinates}.

conclude that ϕ(x) = t0 ∈T, x ∈E is constant on E.
We get E by adding the boundary ∂E to E, thus E is the set of all contact points.
Therefore,
ϕ(x) = t0 ∈T is constant on E, because we get the values on ∂E by continuous extension, i.e.

7. Connected sets, differentiation a.o.
Example 7.2 Let (S, d) be a metric space. For an arbitrary pair of non-empty subsets A and B in
S, we deﬁne the distance from A to B, denoted d(A, B), by
d(A, B) = inf{d(x, y) | x ∈A, y ∈B}.
1. As in Example 4.4 we deﬁne for every x ∈S the distance from x to B by
d(x, B) = inf{d(x, y) | y ∈B}.
Argue that for arbitrary points x ∈A and y ∈B it holds that
d(A, B) ≤d(x, B)
and
inf{d(x′, B) | x′ ∈A} ≤d(x, y).
Utilize this to show that
d(A, B) = inf{d(x, B) | x ∈A}.
2. Show that if A is compact, then there exists a point a0 ∈A such that
d(A, B) = d(a0, B).
Hint: You can use that the function ϕ : S →R, deﬁned by ϕ(x) = d(x, B), is continuous.
Next show that if B is also compact, then there exists a point b0 ∈B such that
d(A, B) = d(a0, b0).
3. Let K be a compact subset in S contained in the open set U in S, i.e. K ⫅U ⫅S. Show that
there exists an r ∈R+, such that Br(x) ⫅U for every x ∈K.

1. It follows from d(x, B) = inf{d(x, y) | y ∈B}, that
d(x, B) = d({x}, B) ≥d(A, B)
for every x ∈A,
and the claim is proved.
Furthermore,
d(x, B) = inf{d(x, y) | y ∈B} ≤d(x, y0),
for y0 ∈B,
so
inf{d(x′, B) | x′ ∈A} ≤d(x, B) ≤d(x, y)
for x ∈A and y ∈B.

7. Connected sets, differentiation a.o.
It follows from these two inequalities that
inf{d(x′, B) | x′ ∈A}
≤
inf{d(x, y) | x ∈A, y ∈B}
=
d(A, B) ≤inf{d(x, B) | x ∈A},
hence we have equality
d(A, B) = inf{d(x, B) | x ∈A}.
2. Now, ϕ : S →R, given by ϕ(x) = d(x, B), is continuous, and A is compact. Therefore, ϕ(x)
attains its minimum at a point a0 ∈A, so
ϕ(a0) = d(x0, B) = inf{d(x, B) | x ∈A} = d(A, B).
If also B is compact, then use that ψ(y) = d(a0, y) is continuous, so there exists a b0 ∈B, such
that
d(a0, b0) = inf{d(a0, y) | y ∈B} = inf{d(x, y) | x ∈A, y ∈B} = d(A, B).
3. It follows from K ⫅U that K ∩(S \ U) = ∅. The mapping
ϕ(x) = d(x, S \ U)
is continuous, and since K is compact, we can by (2) ﬁnd a point x0 ∈K, such that
d(K, S \ U) = d(x0+, S \ U) > 0,
because x0 /∈S\U. (Strictly speaking we shall choose R > 0, such that B = (S\U)∪BR(x0) ̸= ∅,
thus B is closed and bounded, etc.)
Then choose r ∈]0, d(K, S \ U)[, and we have
Br(x) ∪S \ U = ∅
for all x ∈K,
hence
Br(x) ⫅U
for all x ∈K.

7. Connected sets, differentiation a.o.
Example 7.3 Let E = C∞([0, 2π], R) be the vector space of diﬀerentiable functions f : [0, 2π] →R
of class C∞. For f ∈E we set
∥f∥0 = sup{|f(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]},
∥f∥1 = sup{|f(x)| + |f ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]}.
1. Show that ∥· ∥0 and ∥· ∥1 are norms in E.
Deﬁne the linear mapping D : E →E by associating to f ∈E the derivative f ′ ∈E of f, i.e.
D(f) = f ′
for f ∈E.
2. Show that for every n ∈N there exists a function fn ∈E for which ∥fn∥0 = 0 and ∥D(fn)∥0 = n.
Utilize this to show that D : E →E is not continuous, when E is equipped with the norm ∥· ∥0.
3. Show that D : E1 →E0 is continuous, when E1 is E equipped with the norm ∥· ∥1 and E0 is E
equipped with the norm ∥· ∥0.
1. Obviously, ∥f∥0 ≥0, and if
∥f∥0 = sup{|f(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = 0,
then f(x) = 0 for every x ∈[0, 2π], thus f = 0.
Furthermore,
∥αf∥0 = sup{|αf(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = |α| sup{|f(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = |α|∥f∥0.
Finally, we get concerning the triangle inequality
∥f + g∥0
=
sup{|f(x) + g(x)∥| x ∈[0, 2π]} ≤sup{|f(x)| + |g(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]}
≤
sup{|f(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} + sup{|g(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = ∥f∥0 + ∥g∥0.
Summing up we have proved that ∥· ∥0 is a norm.
Then ∥f∥1 ≥∥f∥0 ≥0. If
∥f∥1 = sup{|f(x)| + |f ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = 0,
then
|f(x)| + |f ′(x)| = 0
for every x ∈[0, 2π].
This implies that ∥f(x)| = 0 for every x ∈[0, 2π], i.e. f = 0.
Furthermore,
∥αf∥1 = sup{|αf(x)|+|αf ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = |α| sup{|f(x)|+|f ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = |α|·∥f∥1.}
Finally,
∥f + g∥1
=
sup{|f(x) + g(x)| + |f ′(x) + g′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]}
≤
sup{|f(x)| + |f ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} + sup{|g(x)| + |g′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = ∥f∥1 + ∥g∥1.
We conclude that ∥.∥1 is also a norm.
2. The form of the interval [0, 2π] indicates that we shall think of trigonometric examples. Choosing
fn(x) = sin nx,
x ∈[0, 2π],
it follows that fn ∈E and
f ′
n(x) = n · cos nx,
x ∈[0, 2π],

7. Connected sets, differentiation a.o.
thus
∥fn∥0 = sup{| sin nx| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = 1,
and
∥D(fn)∥0 = sup{n| cos nx| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = n.
Clearly, the sequence gn = 1
n fn converges towards 0, because
∥gn∥0 = 1
n →0
for n →∞.
The image sequence ∥D(gn)∥0 = 1
n · n = 1 does not converge towards 0, and D : E0 →E0 is
not continuous.
3. The claim follows from the estimate
∥D(f)∥0
=
sup{|f ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]}
≤
sup{|f(x)| + |f ′(x)| | x ∈[0, 2π]} = ∥f∥1.
The mapping D is linear, so it suﬃces to prove the continuity at 0:
To any given ε > 0 we choose δ = ε > 0. If ∥f∥1 < δ = ε, then ∥D(f)∥0 ≤∥f∥1 < ε, and we
have proved that D : E1 →E0 is continuous.
Remark 7.1 The example shows that the same mapping D : E →E can be continuous in one
topology and discontinuous in another one. Both norms ∥˙∥0 and ∥· ∥1 are classically known. ♦

Addition and multiplication by scalars in normed vector
spaces
Example 8.1 Let V be the space of continuous functions f : R →R, such that f(x) →0 for |x| →∞.
For a function f ∈V holds, in other words
∀ε > 0∃a ∈R+∀x ∈R : |x| > a
=⇒
|f(x)| < ε.
Deﬁne the operations ‘addition’ and ‘multiplication with scalars’ in V by the obvious pointwise deﬁni-
tions.
1. Show that V is a vector space.
2. Show that every function f ∈V is bounded.
Making use of (2), we can deﬁne
∥f∥= sup{|f(x)| | x ∈R}
for f ∈V.
3. Show that ∥· ∥is a norm in V .
1. If f, g ∈V and α ∈R, then f + α · g : R →R is continuous, and
f(x) + α · g(x) →0 + α · 0 = 0
for |x| →∞,
so f + α · g ∈V , and V is a vector space.
2. Let f ∈V , and choose e.g. ε = 1. There exists an a > 0, such that |f(x)| < 1, whenever |x| > a.
The residual set [−a, a] is a compact interval. The function f is continuous, so |f| has a maximum
A on [−a, a]. Then
∥f∥= sup{|f(x)| | x ∈R} ≤max{1, A} < ∞,
and we have proved that f is bounded.
3. It follows from (2) that ∥f∥< ∞for every f ∈V . The rest is well-known: ∥f∥≥0, and if
∥f∥= sup{|f(x)| | x ∈R} = 0,
then f(x) = 0 for every x ∈R, hence f = 0.
Furthermore,
∥α · f∥= sup{|α f(x)∥| x ∈R} = |α| sup{|f(x)| | x ∈R} = |α| · ∥f∥,
and
∥f + g∥
=
sup{|f(x) + g(x)| | x ∈R} ≤sup{|f(x)| + |g(x)| | x ∈R}
≤
sup{|f(x)| | x ∈R} + sup{|g(x)| | x ∈R} = ∥f∥+ ∥g∥.

8. Addition and multiplication by scalars in normed vector spaces
Example 8.2 Let V be the space of sequences
x = (α1, α2, . . . , αi, . . . )
of real numbers αi ∈R in which at most ﬁnitely many αi ̸= 0.
Deﬁne the operations ‘addition’ and ‘multiplication with scalars’ in V by the obvious coordinate-wise
deﬁnitions. Furthermore, set
∥x∥=
∞

i=1
|αi∥.
1. Show that V is a vector space and that ∥· ∥is a norm in V .
2. Consider an inﬁnite series of real numbers
∞

i=1
ai.
(There is no condition that at most ﬁnitely many ai ̸= 0.)
Deﬁne the sequence (xn) in V by x1 = (a1, 0, 0, . . . ), x2 = (a1, a2, 0, . . . ), and in general
xn = (a1, a2, . . . , an, 0, . . . ).
Show that the series ∞
i=1 |ai| is convergent, if and only if the sequence (xn) is a Cauchy sequence
(fundamental sequence) in the normed vector space V , i.e.
∀ε > 0∃n0 ∈N∀n, k ∈N : n ≥n0
=⇒
∥xn+k −xn∥< ε.
3. Give an example of a Cauchy sequence in the normed vector space V that has no limit point in
V .
1. Let x = (α1, α2, . . . , αi, . . . ) ∈V and y = (β1, β2, . . . , βi, . . . ) ∈V , and k ∈R. Then
x + ky = (α1 + kβ1, α2 + kβ2, . . . , αi + kβi, . . . ),
and since x, y ∈V , there exists an N, such that αi = βi = 0 for every i > N. Then also
αi + kβi = 0 for every i > N, hence x + ky ∈V , and V is a vector space.
It is obvious that ∥x∥≥0, and if ∥x∥= ∞
i=1 |αi| = 0, then all αi = 0, thus x = 0.
Furthermore,
∥kx∥=
∞

i=1
|kαi| = |k|
∞

i=1
|αi| = |k| · ∥x∥,
and
∥x + y∥=
∞

i=1
|αi + βi∥≤
∞

i=1
|αi| +
∞

i=1
|βi| = ∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
We have proved that ∥· ∥is a norm.
2. Assume that ∞
i=1 |ai| < ∞is convergent. This means that
∀ε > 0 ∃N :
∞

i=N
|ai| < ε.
Then for every n ≥N and every k ∈N,

Conversely, if (xn) is a Cauchy sequence,

∥xn+k −xn∥< ε,
then for n = n0 and every k ∈N,

Example 8.3 Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional, normed vector space with norm ∥· ∥. Let L : V →V
be an arbitrary linear mapping. Show that there exists a unit vector x0 ∈V , i.e. ∥x0∥= 1, such that
∥L(x0)∥= ∥L∥, where ∥L∥is the operator norm of L, i.e.
∥L∥= sup{∥L(x)∥| ∥x∥= 1}.
Show by an example that this does not hold in general, when V has inﬁnite dimension.
Any ﬁnite dimensional and normed vector space V is isomorphic with (Rn, ∥· ∥⋆) for some n and some
norm ∥· ∥⋆. In particular, the closed unit ball in V is compact.
Since L : V →V is continuous, there exists a point x0 from the compact set {x ∈V | ∥x∥= 1}, such
that ∥x0∥= 1, and such that
∥L∥= sup{∥L(x)∥| ∥x∥= 1} = ∥L(x0)∥.
Then let V be the inﬁnite dimensional vector space with consists of all summable sequences (xn) of

that ∥L∥= 1.
Finally, if ∥(xn)∥1 = ∞
n=1 |xn| = 1 is any unit vector, then there exists an n0 ∈N, such that |xn0| ̸= 0.
Then we have for every unit vector (xn), ∥(xn)∥1 = 1 that

Normed vector spaces and integral operators
Example 9.1 Let C([0, 1], R) be the vector space of continuous real-valued functions in the unit in-
terval [0, 1]. For a continuous function f : [0, 1] →R we set
∥f∥1 =
 1
0
|f(x)| dx.
1. Show that ∥· ∥1 is a norm in C([0, 1], R).
We now equip C([0, 1], R) as a normed vector space with the norm ∥· ∥1 and deﬁne the function
I : C([0, 1], R) →R
by
I(f) =
 1
0
f(x) dx.
2. Show that I is a continuous linear function.
3. Determine the operator norm of I.
4. In C([0, 1], R) equipped with the norm ∥· ∥1, consider the sequences (fn) and (gn) deﬁned by

Examine the convergence of each of these sequences and, in case of convergence, determine the
limit function.
1. Obviously, ∥f∥1 ≥0. It follows from f being continuous and
∥f∥1 =
 1
0
|f(x)| dx = 0,
that |f(x)| = 0 for every x, so f = 0.
Remark 9.1 We give a simple indirect proof. Assume that |f(x0)| > 0 for some x0 ∈[0, 1].
Then there are a constant c > 0 and an interval J with x0 ∈J of length ε > 0, such that
|f(x)| ≥c for every x ∈J. Then we have the estimate
∥f∥1 =

|f(x)| dx ≥

J
|f(x)| dx ≥c · ε > 0,
and the claim follows. This proof should be well-known to the reader, so it is only given here
for completeness in a remark. ♦
Furthermore,

(To any ε > 0 choose δ = ε, such that if ∥f∥1 < δ = ε, then |I(f)| ≤∥f∥1 < ε).

∥I∥= sup{|I(f)| | ∥f∥1 = 1} ≤sup{∥f∥1 | ∥f∥1 = 1} = 1,
thus ∥I∥≤1.

4. A simple ﬁgure shows that both (fn) and (gn) converge pointwise towards 0 for x ∈]0, 1], so 0

which does not converge towards the only possible limit value 0 for n →∞, and (gn) is not

linear.
When f is diﬀerentiable at 0 ∈E, then there exists a linear mapping Df(0) : E →F, such that

where we have used that f(0) = f(0 · 0) = 0 · f(0) = 0.
Insert α(x + y) instead of x. Then
αf(x + y)
=
f(αx + αy) = Df(0)(αx + αy) + ε(α(x + y))∥α(x + y)∥E
=
αDf(0)x + αDf(0)y + ε(α(x + y)) · |α| ∥x + y∥E.
When this identity is divided by α ̸= 0, we get with another ε-function,
f(x + y) = Df(0)x + Df(0)y + ε(α(x + y)) · ∥x + y∥E.
It follows by taking the limit α →0 that
f(x + y) = Df(0)x + Df(0)y.
An analogous, though simpler argument shows that
f(x) = Df(0)x
and
f(y) = Df(0)y,
thus
f(x + y) = Df(0)x + Df(0)y = f(x) + f(y).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

9. Normed vector spaces and integral operators
Finally,
f(x + λy) = f(x) + f(λy) = f(x) + λf(y).
This holds for every x, y ∈E and every λ ∈R, so we have proved that f is linear.
Example 9.3 Let C([0, 1], R) be the vector space of continuous functions f : [0, 1] →R equipped as a
normed vector space with the norm
∥f∥= sup{|f(x)| | 0 ≤x ≤1}.
Let Φ = Φ(x, y) : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →R be a continuous function in two variables deﬁned in the square
[0, 1] × [0, 1] in R2. Assume that Φ(x, y) ≥0 for all (x, y) ∈[0, 1] × [0, 1].
Deﬁne the function ϕ = ϕ(x) : [0, 1] →R by
ϕ(x) = sup{Φ(x, y) | 0 ≤y ≤1}.
For f ∈C([0, 1], R) we deﬁne the function fΦ = fΦ(y) : [0, 1] →R by
fΦ(y) =

1. Show that for every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
(a) Φ(x0, y) −ε ≤Φ(x, y) ≤Φ(x0, y) + ε for |x −x0| ≤δ and all y ∈[0, 1].
(b) |Φ(x, y) −Φ(x, y0)| ≤ε for |y −y0| ≤δ and all x ∈[0, 1].
Make use of this to show that the functions ϕ = ϕ(x) and fΦ = fΦ(y) are continuous.
Since fΦ ∈C([0, 1] × R), we can deﬁne the mapping
L : C([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R)
by
L(f) = fΦ.
The mapping L is called an integral operator with kernel Φ.

1. The mapping Φ is continuous on the compact set [0, 1] × [0, 1], hence Φ is uniformly continuous,
thus to every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0, such that if (x0, y0) and (x, y) ∈[0, 1] × [0, 1] satisfy the
conditions
|x −x0| < δ
and
|y −y0| < δ,
then
|Φ(x0, y0) −Φ(x, y)| < ε.
If in particular, y = y0, then of course |y −y0| = 0 < δ, and it follows that
if |x −x0| < δ, then |Φ(x0, y) −Φ(x, y)| < ε,

which is also written
Φ(x0, y) −ε ≤Φ(x, y) ≤Φ(x0, y) + ε
for |x −x0| ≤δ, y ∈[0, 1].
When we repeat the argument with |y −y0| < δ and x = x0 ∈[0, 1], we get
|Φ(x, y) −Φ(x, y0)| ≤ε
for |y −y0| ≤δ and x ∈[0, 1].
It follows from the estimates
Φ(x0, y) −ε ≤Φ(x, y) ≤Φ(x0, y) + ε
for |x −x0| ≤δ and y ∈[0, 1] that
sup{Φ(x0, y) | y ∈[0, 1]} −ε
≤
sup{Φ(x, y) | y ∈[0, 1]}
≤
sup{Φ(x0, y) | y ∈[0, 1]} + ε,
and then we use the deﬁnition of ϕ to imply that
ϕ(x0) −ε ≤ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(x0) + ε,
thus |ϕ(x) −ϕ(x0)| < ε, which holds whenever |x −x0| < δ. This proves that ϕ is continuous.
If |y −y0| < δ, then we get the estimates

hence L(f + λg) = L(f) + λL(g), and the mapping L is linear.
Furthermore, |Φ(x, y)| has a maximum, ∥Φ∥∞p˚a [0, 1] × [0, 1],
∥Φ∥∞= sup{|Φ(x, y)| | (x, y) ∈[0, 1] × [0, 1]},

10. Differentiable mappings

Diﬀerentiable mappings
Example 10.1 Let U be an open set in a normed vector space E. A real-valued function f : U →R
is said to have a local maximum (minimum) at a point x0 ∈U if there exists a neighbourhood N ⫅U
of x0 such that f(x) ≤f(x0) [f(x) ≥f(x0)] for all x ∈N.
1. Suppose that the function f : U →R is diﬀerentiable at the point x0 ∈U.
Prove that for
each ﬁxed h ∈E, there exists an r > 0 such that the function g(t) = f(x0 + th) is deﬁned for
t ∈] −r, r[ and is diﬀerentiable at 0 with derivative g′(0) = Df(x0)(h).
2. Suppose that the function f : U →R is diﬀerentiable at the point x0 ∈U and that f has the local
maximum (minimum) at x0 ∈U. Prove that the diﬀerential of f at x0 is zero, i.e. Df(x0) = 0.
1. When f : U →R is diﬀerentiable at x0 ∈U, then
f(x0 + h) −f(x0) = Df(x0)(h) + ε(h)∥h∥,
hence
g(t) = f(x0 + th) = f(x0) + t · Df(x0)(h) + ε(th) · t∥h∥.
Then g(0) = f(x0), and
g(t) −g(0) = t · Df(x0)(h) + t · ε(th)∥h∥,
hence
lim
t→0
g(t) −g(0)
t −0
= Df(x0)(h) + lim
t→0 ε(th) · ∥h∥= Df(x0)(h),
i.e. g′(0) = Df(x0)(h).
2. Assume e.g. that f(x) ≤f(x0) for every x ∈N. (Analogously, if f(x) ≥f(x0)). Then
0 ≥f(x0 + h) −f(x0) = Df(x0)(h) + ε(h)∥h∥,
hence

Let E denote a ﬁnite dimensional proper subspace of H and let u ∈H be a ﬁxed point in H outside
E.
Deﬁne the function f : E →R by
f(x) = ∥x −u∥2 = ⟨x −u, x −u⟩
for x ∈E.
1. Prove that f is diﬀerentiable at every point x ∈E with diﬀerential Df(x) : E →R given by
Df(x)(h) = 2⟨x −u, h⟩
for all h ∈E.
2. Prove that the diﬀerential of f is zero at exactly one point x0 ∈E.
Hint: The diﬀerential of f is zero at x0 ∈E, i.e. Df(x0) = 0, if and only if the vector x0 −u
is orthogonal to E.

1. We shall only rearrange a little for x, h ∈E,

= ⟨(x −u) + h, (x −u) + h⟩−⟨x −u, x −u⟩
= {⟨x −u, x −u⟩+ 2⟨x −u, h⟩+ ⟨h, h⟩} −⟨x −u, x −u⟩
= 2⟨x −u, h⟩+ ∥h∥2,
hence
Df(x)(h) = 2⟨x −u, h⟩
og
∥h∥2 = ε(h) · ∥h∥,

ε(h) = ∥h∥,
and the claim is proved.
2. Let x0 ∈E be the point of the minimum for f(x) = d(x, u)2. It exists, because E ∩BR(u) is
compact for R > dist(E, u), and f(x), x ∈E, is continuous. It follows from Example 10.1 that
Df(x0) = 0, so x0 −u is perpendicular to E.
Any other x ∈E can be written x = x0 +h, h ∈E. From h ⊥x0 −u, and Pythagoras’s theorem
follow that
∥x −u∥2 = ∥x0 −u∥2 + ∥h∥2,

Choosing k = h ̸= 0 we see that the diﬀerential is ̸= 0 at x = x0 + h, h ∈E \ {0}, and the claim

Complete metric spaces
Example 11.1 Let (S, d) be a metric space. Show that if a subset A in S is a complete metric space
in the induced metric from S, then A is a closed set in S.
A
x_0
Indirect proof. Let x0 ∈A \ A, i.e.
A ∩Br(x0) ̸= ∅
for every r > 0.
To a given r = 1
n we choose xn ∈A ∩B1/n(x0). Then xn →x0 in S for n →∞. A convergent
sequence is also a Cauchy sequence, thus (xn) is a Cauchy sequence in both S and A.
In a metric space a possible limit point for a Cauchy sequence is always unique. The limit point is
x0 /∈A, and we have constructed a Cauchy sequence on A, which is not convergent in A. Hence, A is
not complete in the induced topology.
We get by contraposition that if A is complete in the induced topology, then A is closed.

11. Complete metric spaces
Example 11.2 Let X be a compact topological space, and let S be a complete metric space with metric
d.
By C(X, S) we denote the space of continuous mappings f : X →S.
For f, g ∈C(X, S) we put
D(f, g) = sup
x∈X
d(f(x), g(x)).
Then D is a metric in C(X, S).
1. Show that (fn) is a Cauchy sequence in the metric space (C(X, S), D) if and only if (fn : X →S)
is a uniform Cauchy sequence, i.e.
∀ε > 0∃n0 ∈N∀n, m ∈N : n, m ≥n0
=⇒
∀x ∈X : d(fn(x), fm(x)) < ε.
Now let (fn) be a Cauchy sequence in (C(X, S), D).
2. Show that for every x ∈X, there exists a uniquely determined y ∈S, such that fn(x) →y for
n →∞.
Deﬁne a mapping f : X →S by setting f(x) = y for all x ∈X, where y ∈S is determined as in (2).
In other words, the mapping f is deﬁned by
f(x) = lim
n→∞fn(y)
for x ∈X.
3. First show that (fn) converges uniformly to f for n going to ∞, i.e.
∀ε > 0∃n0 ∈N∀n ∈N : n ≥n0
=⇒
∀x ∈X : d(fn(x), f(x)) < ε.
Next show that f : X →S is continuous.
Hint:
d(f(x), f(x0)) ≤d(f(x), fn(x)) + d(fn(x), fn(x0)) + d(fn(x0), f(x0)).
4. Show that (C(X, S), D) is a complete metric space.
1. Since d is a metric, it follows that
D(f, g) = sup
x∈X
d(f(x), g(x)) ≥0}.
Furthermore, since X is compact, we have D(f, g) < ∞, so D is deﬁned.
If D(f, g) = 0, then d(f(x), g(x)) = 0 for every x ∈X, thus f = g.
Furthermore,
D(f, g) = sup
x∈X
d(f(x), g(x)) = sup
x∈X
d(g(x), f(x)) = D(g, f),
and
D(f, g)
=
sup
x∈X
d(f(x), g(x))

x∈X
d(f(x), h(x)) + sup
x∈X
d(h(x), g(x))
=
D(f, h) + D(h, g),
and we have proved that D is a metric on C(X, S).
Assume that (fn) is a Cauchy sequence in (C(X, S), D). Then
(3)
∀ε > 0∃n0 ∈N∀m, n ≥n0 : D(fm, fn) < ε.

11. Complete metric spaces
Now,
D(fm, fn) = sup
x∈X
d(fm(x), fn(x)) ≥d(fm(x), fn(x))
for all x ∈X, so
(4)
∀ε > 0∃n0 ∈N∀m, n ≥n0∀x ∈X : d(fm(x), fn(x)) < ε.
We see that this is the condition that (fn) is a uniform Cauchy sequence.
Conversely, if (fn) is a uniform Cauchy sequence, then (4) holds, and thus in particular
d(fm(x), fn(x)) < ε
for alle x ∈X,
and it follows that
D(fm, fn) = sup
x∈X
d(fm(x), fn(x)) ≤ε.
The only diﬀerence from the above is that we here have “≤ε” instead of “< ε”, so we derive
again (3). This means that (fn) is a Cauchy sequence in (C(X, S), D), and (1) is proved.

11. Complete metric spaces
2. Then let (fn) be a Cauchy sequence in (C(X, S), D). It follows from (1) that (fn) is a uniform
Cauchy sequence. In particular, (fn(x)) is a Cauchy sequence on S for every x ∈X. Since S is
complete, (fn(x)) is convergent for every x ∈X, hence
∀x ∈X∃y ∈S : lim
n→∞fn(x) = y.
Now, y corresponds uniquely to x, so
f(x) = lim
n→∞fn(x),
x ∈X,
is a well-deﬁned mapping.
3. The sequence (fn) is a uniform Cauchy sequence, and the pointwise limit function f exists
everywhere. Hence, (fn) is uniformly convergent with the limit function f.
We shall prove that the limit function f is continuous. Using the hint we consider the estimate
(5)
d(f(x), f(x0)) ≤d(f(x), fn(x)) + d(fn(x), fn(x0)) + d(fn(x0), f(x0)).
It follows from (4) that given any ε > 0 we can ﬁnd an n0, such that
d(fm(x), fn(x)) < ε
6
for every x ∈X, if m, n ≥n0.
It follows that
d(f(x), fn(x)) < ε
6 + ε
6 = ε
3
for every x ∈X and n ≥n0,
and we now control the ﬁrst and the third term of (5).
Using that fn(x) is uniformly continuous there is a δ > 0, such that
d(fn(x), fn(x0)) < ε
3,
if x ∈Uε(x0),
where Uε(x0) is an open neighbourhood corresponding to ε and x0.
Hence, if x ∈Uε(x0), then
d(f(x), f(x0)) ≤ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε,
and f is continuous at every x0 ∈X, i.e. in all of X.
4. We shall only collect all the previous results: If (fn) is a Cauchy sequence in (C(X, S), D), then
(fn), fn : X →S, is a uniform Cauchy sequence of limit function f, where this limit function
f ∈C(X, S) is also continuous.
In other words: The Cauchy sequence (fn) converges uniformly (hence also in the metric D)
towards a continuous function f ∈C(X, S), and (C(X, S), D) is a complete space.

Let E be a Banach space, and let U ⫅E be an open set in E. The norm in E is denoted by ∥· ∥.
A mapping f : U →E is said to be Lipschitz continuous in U, if there exists a constant k, such that

for all x1, x2 ∈U.
Now assume that f : U →E is a Lipschitz continuous mapping in U. (One can think of f as a vector
ﬁeld in U by placing the vector f(x) ∈E at every point x ∈U.)
Consider the Initial Value Problem consisting of the diﬀerential equation (i) below together with the
initial value condition (ii):
(i) dx
dt = f(x),
(ii) x(0) = x0 ∈U.
By a solution, or, an integral curve, to the Initial Value Problem (i) and (ii) we understand a diﬀer-
ential curve ϕ : J →U deﬁned in an interval J around 0 ∈R, such that
dϕ
dt = f(ϕ(t))
for all t ∈J,
and such that ϕ(0) = x0.
1. Show that ϕ : J →U solves (i) and (ii) if and only if ϕ satisﬁes the integral equation
ϕ(t) = x0 +
 t
0
f(ϕ(τ)) dτ.
For a > 0, let Ja denote the interval Ja = [−a, a], and for b > 0, let
Sb = {x ∈E | ∥x −x0∥≤b}
denote the closed ball in E with centre x0 ∈U and radius b. For b > 0 suﬃciently small, we have
Sb ⫅U, and we shall only consider such b.
Let C(Ja, Sb) denote the space of continuous mappings ϕ : Ja →Sb equipped with the metric D as in
Example 11.2.
To ϕ ∈C(Ja, Sb) we associate ψ : Ja →E deﬁned by
ψ(t) = x0 +
 t
0
f(ϕ(τ)) dτ
for t ∈Ja.
2. Show that for suﬃciently small a > 0, the mapping ψ ∈C(Ja, Sb).
3. Show that for suﬃciently small a > 0, the mapping
T : C(Ja, Sb) →C(Ja, Sb),
which assigns ψ = T(ϕ) ∈C(Ja, Sb) to ϕ ∈C(Ja, Sb), is a contraction.
4. Show that with a > 0 as in (3), there exists a unique solution ϕ ∈C(Ja, Sb) to the diﬀerential
equation
dx
dt = f(x),
such that ϕ(0) = x0.
5. Show that if ϕ1 : J1 →U and ϕ2 : J2 →U are two solutions to the diﬀerential equation
dx
dt = f(x),
deﬁned in overlapping open intervals J1 and J2 in R, such that ϕ1(t0) = ϕ2(t0) at a point
t0 ∈J1 ∩J2, then ϕ1(t) = ϕ2(t) at all points t ∈J1 ∩J2.

6. Show that there exists a unique maximal solution to the Initial Value Problem (i) and (ii). (A
maximal solution in a solution with an open interval of deﬁnition that cannot be extended.)
1. It follows from dϕ
dt = f(ϕ(t)) by an integration that
[ϕ(τ)]t
0 = ϕ(t) −ϕ(0) =
 t
0
f(ϕ(τ)) dτ,
so we get since ϕ(0) = x0 that
ϕ(t) = x0 +
 t

f(ϕ(τ)) dτ.
Conversely, if ϕ is given by this integral equation, then ϕ(0) = x0 + 0 = x0, and
dϕ
dt = [f(ϕ(τ))]τ=t = f(ϕ(t)),
and the claim is proved.

∥f(ϕ(t0))∥· |t −t0| < ε
2
for |t −t0| < δ1.
Now, ϕ is continuous, so to every ε1 > 0 we can choose δ2 > 0, such that
∥ϕ(τ) −ϕ(t0)∥< ε1
for
|τ −t0| < δ2.
In this case we have

Then
∥ψ(t) −ψ(t0)∥≤ε

2 = ε
for |t −t0| < δ = min{δ1, δ3}, thus ψ ∈C(Ja, Sb).

If Da is the metric on C(Ja, Sb), given by

∥ϕ1(t) −ϕ2(t)∥,
then it follows that

 ≤k · a · Da(ϕ1, ϕ2).
Choose a > 0, such that k · a < 1. Then T : C(Ja, Sb) →C(Ja, Sb) is a contraction.
4. It follows from Example 11.2 that (C(Ja, Sb), Da) is a complete metric space. By Banach’s ﬁx-
point theorem the contraction T has only one ﬁxpoint, thus there exists a unique ϕ ∈C(Ja, Sb),
such that ϕ(t) = T(ϕ)(t). This means that
ϕ(t) = x0 +

f(ϕ(τ)) dτ.
This is by (1) equivalent with that x = ϕ(t) is the unique solution of

12. Local Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for Autonomous ...
5. Let ϕ1 : J1 →U and ϕ2 : J2 →U be two solutions which agree in a point t0 ∈J1 ∩J2, where
both J1 and J2 are closed intervals. We claim that
ϕ1(t) = ϕ2(t)
for every t ∈J1 ∩J2.
The mapping ϕ1 −ϕ2 is continuous, so
{t ∈J1 ∩J2 | ϕ1(t) = ϕ2(t)} = (ϕ1 −ϕ2)◦−1({0}) ∩(J1 ∩J2)
is a closed and nonempty set. If it is not all of J1 ∩J2, then the set (ϕ1 −ϕ2)◦−1({0}) must
have a boundary point t1, which lies in the interior of J1 ∩J2.
It follows from ϕ1(t1) = ϕ2(t1) and the construction above that ϕ1(t) = ϕ2(t) in an interval
[t1 −b, t1 + b] around t1, i.e.
[t1 −b, t1 + b] ⫅(ϕ1 −ϕ2)◦−1({0}).
Then t1 is not a boundary point which contradicts the assumption. Hence, we conclude that
(ϕ1 −ϕ2)◦−1({0}) ∩(J1 ∩J2) = J1 ∩J2,
thus ϕ1(t) = ϕ2(t) on J1 ∩J2.
6. Let ϕ : J →U be a maximal solution of (i) and (ii), hence ϕ is unique on J, and ϕ cannot be
extended further to a unique solution on a larger set J ′ ⊃J. We shall prove that the interval J
is open.
Indirect proof. Assume that J is not open, and let t0 ∈J be an end point of the interval.
Then there exists a b > 0, such that ϕ is a unique solution in [t0 −b, t0 + b]. This means that ϕ
is unique on
J′ = J ∪[t0 −b, t0 + b] ⊃J,
which contains points which are not in J. This is contradicting the assumption, so we conclude
that every maximal solution is deﬁned on a maximal open interval.

Euler-Lagrange’s equations
Example 13.1 Let [a, b] be a closed and bounded interval in R. Denote by
C1([a, b], Rn)
the vector space of diﬀerentiable curves x : [a, b] →Rn in Rn of class C1. Equip C1([a, b], Rn) with
the norm
∥x∥1 = sup{∥x(t)∥+ ∥x′(t)∥| t ∈[a, b]},
in which ∥· ∥is the maximum norm in Rn.
For an arbitrary open set U in R × Rn × Rn, we denote by ˜U the subset of curves x ∈C1([a, b], Rn),
in which (t, x(t), x′(t)) ∈U for all t ∈[a, b].
1. Show that ˜U is an open set in C1([a, b], Rn).
Now let U be an open set in R × Rn × Rn, considered with coordinates
(t, q, p) ∈R × Rn × Rn,
and let L = L(t, q, p) : U →R be a diﬀerentiable function of class C1.
Deﬁne the function f : ˜U →R by
f(x) =

L(t, x(t), x′(t)) dt

2. Show that f : ˜U →R is diﬀerentiable in ˜U with the diﬀerential determined by

 b
a
DL(t, x(t), x′(t)) · (0, h(t), h′(t)) dt
for x ∈˜U and h ∈C1([a, b], Rn).
In the following, the curves x ∈˜U and h ∈C1([a, b], Rn) are kept ﬁxed.
3. Show that there exists an ε > 0, such that the curve x + λh belongs to ˜U, for all λ ∈] −ε, ε[.
With reference to (3), deﬁne the function g : ] −ε, ε[ →R by
g(λ) = f(x + λh)
for λ ∈] −ε, ε[.
4. Show that g is diﬀerentiable at λ = 0 with the diﬀerential quotient

5. Now assume that h(a) = h(b) = 0 and that

13. Euler-Lagrange’s equations
The mapping t →(t, x0(t), x′
0(t)) is continuous [a, b] →R2n+1, and [a, b] is compact, hence the
graph
A = {(t, x0(t), x′
0(t)) | t ∈[a, b]}
is compact.
The compact set A and the closed set R2n+1 \ U are disjoint, hence

[ that
{x ∈C1([a, b], Rn) | ∥x −x0∥1 < ε} ⊂˜U.
This is true for every x0 ∈˜U with ε = ε(x0) > 0, so ˜U is open.
2. Let x ∈˜U and h ∈C1([a, b], Rn) with x + h ∈˜U. Then

cf. (1). Then x + λh ∈˜U for every λ ∈] −ε, ε[.
