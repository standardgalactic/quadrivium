Preface to these three texts
The three texts in this one cover, entitled ‚ÄòThe series solution of second order, ordinary differential equations and special 
functions‚Äô (Part I), ‚ÄòAn introduction to Sturm-Liouville theory‚Äô (Part II) and ‚ÄòIntegral transforms‚Äô (Part III), are three of 
the ‚ÄòNotebook‚Äô series available as additional and background reading to students at Newcastle University (UK). These 
three together present a basic introduction to standard methods typically met in modern courses on ordinary differential 
equations (although the topic in Part III is relevant, additionally, to studies in partial differential equations and integral 
equations). The material in Part I is the most familiar topic encountered in this branch of university applied mathematical 
methods, and that in Part II would be included in a slightly more sophisticated approach to any work on second order, 
linear ODEs. The transform methods developed in Part III are likely to be included, at some point, in most advanced 
studies; here, we cover most of the standard transforms, their properties and a number of applications.
Each text is designed to be equivalent to a traditional text, or part of a text, which covers the relevant material, with many 
worked examples and a few set exercises (with answers provided). The appropriate background for each is mentioned in 
the preface to each Notebook, and each has its own comprehensive index.

Preface
Preface
This text is intended to provide an introduction to the methods for solving second order, ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs) by the method of Frobenius. The topics covered include all those that are typically discussed in modern mathematics 
degree programmes. The material has been written to provide a general introduction to the relevant ideas, rather than 
as a text linked to a specific course of study. Indeed, the intention is to present the material in a way that enhances the 
understanding of the topic, and so can be used as an adjunct to a number of different modules ‚Äì or simply to help the 
reader gain a broader experience of mathematics. The aim is to go beyond the methods and techniques that are presented 
in a conventional module, but all the standard ideas are included (and can be accessed through the comprehensive index).
It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of, and practical experience in, various aspects of the differential and 
the integral calculus. In particular, familiarity with the basic calculus and elementary differential-equation work, typically 
encountered in a first year of study, is assumed. This brief notebook does not attempt to include any applications of the 
differential equations; this is properly left to a specific module that might be offered in a conventional applied mathematics 
or engineering mathematics or physics programme. However, the techniques are applied to some specific equations whose 
solutions include important ‚Äòspecial‚Äô functions that are met in most branches of mathematical methods; thus we will 
discuss: Bessel functions, and the polynomials of Legendre and Hermite.
The approach adopted here is to present some general ideas, which might involve a notation, or a definition, or a theorem, 
or a classification, but most particularly methods of solution, explained with a number of carefully worked examples (there 
are 11 in total). A small number of exercises, with answers, are also offered to aid the understanding of the material.

Power-series solution of ODEs
1	 Power-series solution of ODEs
In this chapter we will describe the fundamental ideas and method that underpin this approach to the solution of (second 
order, linear) ordinary differential equations. This will be presented with the help of a simple example, which will provide 
much of the motivation for the more general methods that follow later. However, as we explain in ¬ß1.2, this first analysis 
is very restrictive. We extend its applicability by first classifying the equations for which we can employ this technique, 
and then we carefully formulate (Chapter 2) the general method (due to G. Frobenius). All the possible cases will be 
described, with examples, and then we apply the procedure to a number of important equations.
1.1	
Series solution: essential ideas
The methods for finding exact solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are familiar; see, for example, the volume 
‚ÄòThe integration of ordinary differential equations‚Äô in The Notebook Series. So, for example, the equation
‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ +
‚Ä≤ +
=
+
y
y

x

(where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to x) has the complete general solution (complementary function 
+ particular integral)
y x
A
B
x
x
x
( ) =

,
where A and B are the arbitrary constants. A solution expressed like this is usually referred to as being ‚Äòin closed form‚Äô; 
on the other hand, if we wrote the solution (of some problem) in the form

then this is not in closed form. (It would become closed form if we were able to sum the series in terms of elementary 
functions.) A solution is, of course, best written in closed form, but we may not always be able to do this; it is, nevertheless, 
sufficient for most purposes to represent the solution as a power series (provided that this series is convergent for some 
x, so that the solution exists somewhere). We should note that the solution of

Power-series solution of ODEs
(with the usual identification: 0!
1
=
). In other words, we could always seek a power-series solution, and this will be 
particularly significant if we cannot solve the equation any other way. Indeed, it is evident that this approach provides a 
more general technique for tackling the problem of solving differential equations, even if the downside is the construction 
of a more complicated-looking form of the solution. 
Thus the procedure is to set y x
a x
n
n
n
( ) =
=
‚àû

, and then aim to determine the coefficients, an , of the series, in order 
to ensure that this series is the solution of the given equation.

We have assumed that y, ‚Ä≤y  and ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
y , all expressed via the given series, exist for some x i.e. all three series are convergent 
for some xs common to all three series. With this in mind, we require the equation, expressed in terms of the series, to be 
valid for all x in some domain ‚Äì so we do not generate an equation for x! For this to be the case, x must vanish identically 
from the equation. Now our equation, written out in more detail, becomes

which recovers our original (closed form) solution, because the infinite series (on using the formula that defines all the 
coefficients) can be summed and are convergent for all finite x. This approach, we observe, has automatically generated 
both the complementary function and the particular integral.
In summary, direct substitution of a suitable series, followed by the identical elimination of x, enables the complete general 
solution to be found. This approach, we note ‚Äì perhaps with some relief ‚Äì does not invoke any integration processes; any 
technical difficulties are now associated with the issue of convergence of the resulting series.

The method of Frobenius
2	 The method of Frobenius
We consider the second order, linear ordinary differential equation
a x y
b x y
c x y
r x

( )

( )
‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ +
‚Ä≤ +
=
for which we know that the solution can be expressed as
y x
y
x
y
x
CF
PI
( )
( )
( )
=
+
,
where the particular integral, y
y
x
PI
=
( ) , is any function that will generate r x
( ) . It is known that, if we can find 
one or both solutions that contribute to the complementary function, y
x
CF ( ) , then the complete general solution 
can be found (by the method of variation of parameters, for example). Thus it is sufficient here to work only with the 
homogeneous equation i.e. r x
( ) ‚â°0 . (For the relevant background ideas and techniques, see volume ‚ÄòThe integration 
of ordinary differential equations‚Äô in The Notebook Series, or any other suitable text.) We shall consider a power-series 
solution, in powers of (x
x
‚àí
0 ) (and quite often we will have x0
0
=
) and if x
x
=
0  happens to be an ordinary point 
of the equation, then the simple method described in the previous chapter is applicable. We allow the equation to have, at 
most, regular singular points, and then the most useful results are obtained by expanding about a regular singular point 
i.e. x
x
=
0  may be a regular singular point. The method cannot be applied, in general, if x
x
=
0  is an essential singular 
point. If there are, for example, two regular singular points, then it is often necessary to construct two power series: one 
about each of the regular singular points; we will comment on this in more detail later.

where Œª  is a parameter (called the index) which is to be determined; this is usually called a ‚Äòpower series about  
x
x
=
0 ‚Äô. This type of series solution is at the heart of the method of Frobenius. [Georg F. Frobenius (1849-1917), German 
mathematician; developed the concept of the abstract group; published his method for finding power-series solution of 
second order ODEs early in his career (in 1874).] Apart from the appearance of Œª , the method follows precisely that 
described in Chapter 1. Note that Œª  gives the power of the first term (n = 0 ) in the series, whatever that may be. Thus, 
provided that a power series of this form exists, there must be a first term and this has been designated D

and so we require a0

. As we shall see, our previous method can be simplified and made more systematic, and this 
is the approach we will incorporate here.

something that we must be wary of later.)
Now for each value of Œª , we can find the coefficients am , ultimately in terms of a0 . However, because the equation 
is linear, we may perform the two calculations (one each for Œª = 0  and Œª = 1 2 ) and then construct a general linear 
combination of the two in order to generate the complementary function. In particular, for Œª = 0 , we obtain

Comment: These two series converge for all finite x, as can be seen by applying the ratio test.
In this example, we found that the indicial equation was quadratic ‚Äì it always will be ‚Äì and that its roots were not equal 
(nor did they differ by an integer, which will be an important observation). The upshot is that we have two special cases

‚Äì this second solution contains a logarithmic term, which is therefore certainly linearly independent of our first solution 
(Y). As we have demonstrated, this second solution can be obtained directly from the first solution or, as is quite often 
done, it is computed by seeking an appropriate solution of the differential equation.

The second special case arises when the roots for Œª  differ by an integer; let us write Œª

 in the denominator. 
(In exceptional cases, this factor is cancelled by one in the numerator and then the standard procedure (¬ß2.1) can be 
employed; we discuss this special situation in ¬ß3.2.)
Because of the appearance of this factor, it is convenient to write

which follows the same pattern as for repeated roots. We have avoided giving the details of this general argument; we have

We conclude with one more example which contains two regular singular points, and show what happens when we expand 
about each in turn. In this case we will write a little more about the convergence of the series that we generate (and we 
will take the opportunity to mention one of the special cases that can arise, but we will write more of this later).

by an integer, then the smaller value will always generate the complete, general solution.)

We conclude, therefore, that the singular point at x = 1 corresponds to a logarithmic singularity in the solution here. 
Thus if we want to use the solution not too near x = 1, we should employ the power-series representation about x = 0
. However, if we wished to capture more accurately the behaviour near x = 1 then we should use the power series valid 
about x = 1 (i.e. about z = 0 ). (Note that the solution does not exist on x = 1 unless B = 0 .)

and its solution, in his study of the perturbations of planetary orbits.] We shall use the method of Frobenius to construct 
solutions of this equation, for various ŒΩ ; we note that this is permitted because the equation possesses a regular singular

The  Besse l equati on and  Besse l function
3.2	
The second solution
From our work with the method of Frobenius, in the previous chapter, we know that the second solution of these equations 
depends critically on the relationship between the two roots for Œª . First we note that only for ŒΩ = 0  are the roots 
repeated, and this case is essentially the same as ŒΩ = n  (n integer), for then ¬±ŒΩ  will differ by an integer; in these cases, 
we must expect that logarithmic terms will arise (unless something exceptional occurs). In addition, there are non-integral 
values of ŒΩ  which also give rise to Œªs  that differ by an integer: all the half-integers e.g. ŒΩ = 1 2 , for then Œª = ¬±1 2  
(which differ by 1). For all other ŒΩ , the solution that we have just described is appropriate when ŒΩ  is replaced by ‚àíŒΩ , 
the solutions then being J‚àíŒΩ ( )
x ; this is the second solution.
In the case ŒΩ = n  (n = 1 2
, , ... ), withŒª
ŒΩ
= ‚àí
= ‚àín , the recurrence relation becomes a m m

)
‚àí

(m = 2 3
, , ...)
which is not defined when m
n
= 2 , for a given n. Thus this case, and that of a repeated root, will certainly require the 
inclusion of a logarithmic term. The calculation follows that described in Chapter 2 and, although it is rather cumbersome 
and lengthy, it is altogether routine. So, for example, for n = 0 , we find that the second solution can be written

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Generating functions
6	 Generating functions
We conclude with an additional and intriguing property of the functions that we have discussed in this Notebook (and 
similar properties arise for other functions and polynomials). The existence of recursion formulae, and also the Rodrigues‚Äô 
formulae [O. Rodrigues (1794-1851), French mathematician] for the polynomials, is related to another important idea: 
the generating function.
Suppose that we are given a set of functions, F
x
n( )  say; further, suppose that these can be obtained as the coefficients 
of some power series (in z, say) i.e. we write
F
x z
n
n
n
( )
=
‚àû
‚àë
0
.
If we can find a function, f z x
( ; ) , whose Maclaurin expansion in z recovers the series, so that we have
f z x
F
x z
n
n
n
( ; )
( )
=
=
‚àû
‚àë
0
,
we call f z x
( ; )  a generating function. (It obviously generates, in a purely algebraic way, the set of functions that are of 
interest.) An elementary example of this idea is the choice
f z x
z
x
( ; ) =
+
which has the Maclaurin ‚Äì actually binomial in this case ‚Äì expansion

Second-order ordinary differential equations

Preface
Preface
This text is intended to provide an introduction to some of the methods and ideas that come under the heading of ‚ÄòSturm-
Liouville theory‚Äô. This topic is likely to be included in any modern, fairly comprehensive mathematical degree programme, 
probably linked to the method of series solution (Part I). This volume in the ‚ÄòNotebook Series‚Äô has been written to extend, 
and explain in more detail, these ideas, but it has not been designed to replicate any typical module that includes this 
material. Indeed, the intention is to present the material so that it can be used as an adjunct to a number of different 
modules ‚Äì or simply to provide a different and broader experience of these mathematical ideas. The aim is to go beyond 
the methods and techniques that are presented in the relevant course of study, but the standard ideas are discussed here, 
and can be accessed through the comprehensive index.
It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of, and practical experience in, the elementary methods for solving 
ordinary differential equations (as encountered in any standard course in the first year of study). Some knowledge of the 
material taught beyond the first year (e.g. series solution: Part I) would be an advantage, but this is not essential. Further, 
this brief notebook does not attempt to include any applications of these equations; this is properly left to a specific 
module that might be offered in a conventional applied mathematics or engineering mathematics or physics programme. 
The approach adopted here is to present some general ideas, which might involve a notation, or a definition, or a theorem, 
or a classification, but most particularly methods of solution, explained with a number of carefully worked examples ‚Äì we 
present 11. A small number of exercises, with answers, are also offered in order to aid the learning process.

Introduction and Background
1	 Introduction and Background
The thrust of this volume is to present and describe some of the essential features of the properties of solutions of second 
order, linear, ordinary differential equations that contain a parameter. Most significantly, these ideas are developed within 
a general framework which does not require explicit solutions to have been obtained. Indeed, it will become apparent that 
it is possible to derive some important (and often quite detailed) properties of the solution of these equations, even when 
we cannot write down a solution. First, we shall provide a general description of the type of equations, and problems, 
that we shall discuss here.
1.1	
The second-order equations
We start with the homogeneous equation for y x
( ) :
L y
p

p x y

the functions p0 , p1 and p2  are continuous throughout the domain of the solution. Because this is a second-order 
equation, the general solution will be constructed from two linearly independent solutions ( y
x
1( ) , y
x
2( ) , say) i.e.
y x
Ay

By

where A and B are arbitrary constants.
As an introduction to our more detailed work, it is convenient to write down the two equations that, separately, define 
y

. Consequently, either W = 0  everywhere 
(because W0
0
=

0
‚â†
 and the exponential term can never be zero). Further, W 
(which is called the Wronskian of the two functions) possesses an additional and fundamental property: W = 0  if and 
only if y1  and y2  are linearly dependent functions.
Proof
Suppose that y1  and y2  are linearly dependent, then y

the functions y

Thus we deduce, for the solution of a linear, second-order ordinary differential equation, comprising two linearly 
independent solutions, that W ‚â†0 . However, if the two solutions are linearly dependent (so that we do not have the general 
solution), then W = 0  everywhere; indeed, this property of W can be used to test if the solution we have constructed is 
the general solution. When W ‚â†0 , we say that the functions form a fundamental set.
Example 1
Find the general solution of the equation ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ +

[Josef Maria Ho√´n√©-Wronski (1778-1853) was a Polish mathematician with great manipulative skills, but not much 
concerned with rigor (which he regarded as a ‚Äòpendantry which prefers means to ends‚Äô). He spent most of his career in 
France ‚Äì he became a French citizen in 1800 ‚Äì where he often quarrelled with other mathematicians and the academic 
institutions: he was a troubled man. For many years his work was dismissed as having no merit. However, in recent times, 
it has been realised that he produced some important results ‚Äì even if a lot of what he did is erroneous.]
We conclude this section by commenting on two other variants of the second-order equations that we shall discuss. The 
first is at the heart of Sturm-Liouville theory; write equation (1) in the form

are all continuous on the domain of the solution; the constants Œ± , Œ≤ , Œ≥  and Œ¥  are also real (and not both of the pair 
( , )
Œ± Œ≤ , nor both the pair ( , )
Œ≥ Œ¥ , are zero). These (two-point) boundary conditions are homogeneous (because the 
transformation y

 leaves them unchanged); the constant Œª  is the eigenvalue and is to be determined. 
The problem posed by (5) (with s x
( ) ‚â°0 ) and (6) is usually called the Sturm-Liouville problem; this was first discussed 
in a number of papers that were published by these authors in 1836 and 1837. [Charles-Fran√ßois Sturm (1803-1855), 
Professor of Mechanics at the Sorbonne, had been interested, since about 1833, in the problem of heat flow in bars, so 
was well aware of eigenvalue-type problems. He worked closely with his friend Joseph Liouville (1809-1882), Professor 
of Mathematics at the Coll√®ge de France, on the general properties of second order differential equations. Liouville also 
made many contributions to the general field of analysis.]
1.3	
Self-adjoint equations
One final, but general aspect of second-order equations, closely related to the Sturm-Liouville form, needs to be mentioned 
before we proceed with the more detailed discussion. We return to equation (1):

and ask if there is a function, v x
( ) , that makes vL y
( )  an exact differential i.e. does an integrating factor, for the whole 
equation, exist? To examine this possibility, we write

Thus, for vL y
( )  to be an exact differential, we require M v
( ) = 0  ‚Äì another second-order, ordinary differential equation 
(so probably not that helpful).
We call the operator M the adjoint to L, and M v
( ) = 0  is then the adjoint equation. In general, the differential operators 
M and L are not identical, but if M
L
‚â°
 then the equation L y
( ) = 0  is said to be self-adjoint. It is immediately apparent

2	 The Sturm-Liouville problem:  
the eigenvalues
The strength, and beauty, of the approach developed by Sturm and Liouville is that considerable general information, 
and some specific detail, can be obtained without ever finding the solution to the problem. Thus we are able to find, 
for example, integrals involving these functions ‚Äì orthogonality integrals are the prime example ‚Äì without knowing the 
solution. Such integral results are likely to be useful in their own right, and they are essential in the context of Fourier 
series. We shall describe, first, the nature of the eigenvalues and then, in the following chapter, turn to the associated 
solutions (the eigenfunctions).

Now equation (8) may have, in general, complex roots; indeed, this must be expected as a possibility. However, we do not 
have y1  and y2  available to use in (8), which would allow us ‚Äì in principle, at least ‚Äì to determine theŒª s by solving 
(8). It turns out that we can deduce the nature of the roots directly from the differential equation itself. Although p, q, r, 
Œ± , Œ≤ , Œ≥ and Œ¥  are all real (as is the domain), Œª  might be complex and then, in turn, so will be the associated solutions 
y; we shall prove, however, that all the eigenvalues of a Sturm-Liouville problem are real.

We have demonstrated that the eigenvlues of the general Sturm-Liouville problem are necessarily real, and then so are all

Comment: This proof requires r x

simply multiply through by ‚àí1; if the resulting equation then has r x

Th e Sturm-Liouvill e problem:  
th e eigenvalue
2.2	
Simple eigenvalues
Although we have written little so far about the eigenvalues (and eigenfunctions) ‚Äì other than to prove that the eigenvalues 
must be real ‚Äì it is probable that the reader assumes that to each eigenvalue there corresponds one (linearly independent) 
solution. Is this the case? If there is only one solution to each choice of the eigenvalue, we describe this as ‚Äòsimple‚Äô i.e. the 
eigenvalues are said to be simple if there is one solution to each eigenvalue. We will provide a proof of this property for 
the Sturm-Liouville problem; this will require the introduction of a suitable Wronskian (¬ß1.1).
Proof
For a given Œª , let us suppose that there are two linearly independent solutions, y
x
1( )  
and y
x
2( ) , say. (Note that we may certainly allow a constant multiple of any particular solution, because a constant
√óy  is necessarily a solution of the Sturm-Liouville problem, if y x
( )  is.) The Wronskian of these two solutions is then
W y
y

y y
(

)

=

‚Ä≤ ,
and we may compute W at any point in the domain; let us do this at one end e.g. x
a
=
 (and we may equally evaluate at 
x
b
=
, if we wished). The boundary condition (in (5) and (7)), at x
a
=
 applies to each solution, y1  and y2 , because 
each is a solution of the same Sturm-Liouville problem. Hence, if Œ≤ = 0, then y a

Hence in all cases, W = 0 . But (see ¬ß1.1) the functions y1  and y2  are linearly independent, if and only if W = 0 ; 
thus y1  and y2  are linearly dependent: to each Œª  there is one and only one linearly independent solution. Thus the 
eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem are simple.

i.e. they are discrete, ordered and extend to infinity. This is a general property of eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville 
problem; the proof of this follows from the oscillation theorems, which are described in Chapter 3. It is natural, however, 
to note this important property here, in the context of a discussion of the eigenvalues. However, it is worthy of comment 
that if we relax the conditions that underpin the formulation of the Sturm-Liouville problem, then we can produce a 
very different picture.

x ‚àà[ , ]

problem has a solution that is readily accessible. Indeed, if we include the exceptional solution that corresponds to repeated

Th e Sturm-Liouvill e problem:  th e eigenfunction
3	 The Sturm-Liouville problem: the 
eigenfunctions
We now turn to a consideration of the solutions of the Sturm-Liouville problem, that is, we analyse the eigensolutions 
(more often referred to as eigenfunctions; each is associated with an eigenvalue, as described in ¬ß2.2). The main tool for 
this analysis is a set of theorems, usually called oscillation theorems (but some authors prefer comparison theorems). The 
equation that we consider is (see (5) and (7))

q x
r x y
( )
( )
( )
‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ +
+
=
Œª
0 , a

‚â§
‚â§
;
to proceed, we introduce two equations, each of this form, namely

‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ ‚àí
= 0  and p x v
x v
( )
( )
‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ ‚àí

0, a
x
b
‚â§
‚â§
. 
(9)
These two equations define, respectively, the functions u x
( )  and v x
( ) ; note that, at this stage at least, the dependence 
on the parameter Œª  is irrelevant (and the negative sign is simply a convenience). Consistent with our standard Sturm-
Liouville problem, we require that p x
( ) > 0  in the domain of the solution.

Th e Sturm-Liouvill e problem:  th e eigenfunction
When we consider the other associated function, v x
( ) , with M < 0 , we observe that consecutive zeros are a distance 
œÄ
‚àíQ M  apart, and so y x
( )  has at least m zeros on [ , ]
a b  if
(
)
m
Q M

(Note that m zeros for x
a b
‚àà[ , ] require (
)
m‚àí1  spacings between them.) Thus a sufficient condition that y x
( )  
oscillates on [ , ]
a b  is that

Demonstrate that the zeros of the two solutions of ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ +

This is an elementary exercise: the two independent solutions are the familiar y

. The former has 
zeros at x
n
= œÄ , and the latter at x
n
=

Orthogonality
A very significant and fundamental property of the eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville problem, with far-reaching 
consequences, is that of orthogonality. (This word is used because, as we shall see, the property mimics the familiar 
orthogonality of vectors: a b
‚ãÖ
= 0  implies that the vectors are mutually orthogonal (if they are both non-zero) and so 
linearly independent. Indeed, the connection goes far deeper when we consider how a set of linearly independent vectors 
spans a space; this is to be compared with a complete set of independent functions used to represent general functions 
as series ‚Äì the Fourier series.)
The procedure follows very closely that which we adopted in the proof that the eigenvalues are real (¬ß2.1). We consider 
the classical Sturm-Liouville problem

Eigenfunction expansions
The construction of an expansion of a given function as a power series in x is a very familiar (and useful) technique: the 
Maclaurin and Taylor expansions. Further, many readers will be almost equally familiar with the expansion of a function 
in a trigonometric series: the classical Fourier series. However, this latter series is simply one example of an expansion 
that is based on a set of orthogonal functions generated by a Sturm-Liouville problem. The statement of this property, 
and its construction, is readily presented.
Suppose that we are given a set of orthogonal functions , y
x
n( )  (n = 1 2
, , ... ), of some Sturm-Liouville problem 
(defined for a
x
b
‚â§
‚â§
). Further, suppose that we are given a function, f x
( ) , also defined for a
x
b
‚â§
‚â§
; we assume 
that we may write
f x
c y
x
n n
n
( )
( )
=
=
‚àû
‚àë
1
and then we address the question: how do we determine the coefficients cn ? To accomplish this, we first multiply 
by r x y
x
m
( )
( )  (where we must remember that the general Sturm-Liouville problem involves the weight function,  
r x
( ) ), to give
f x r x y

This determines each coefficient cm , m = 1 2

is quite simple. Of course, this does not justify the correctness of the expansion itself ‚Äì this issue concerns the existence, 
i.e. convergence, of the series representation for f x
( ) . The proof of convergence is altogether beyond the scope of this 
text (and beyond the assumed background of the reader); however, we can state the relevant theorem:

Comment: The notation x+ , x‚àí, means the approach to the value x from above and below, respectively. Thus, if f x

is continuous at x
x

(

Comment: A Sturm-Liouville problem that does not satisfy the usual conditions prescribed for p x
( ) , q x
( )  and r x
( )  
at the boundary points is called a singular Sturm-Liouville problem. In the example above, we have that p x
x
( ) =
 and 
r x
x
( ) =
, so the conditions p > 0  and r > 0  for x ‚àà[ , ]
0 1  are not satisfied. The problem and its solution, as we have 
seen, turn out to be well-defined, although this explains why we were careful to prescribe the domain as the open interval 
x ‚àà( , ]
0 1 , with a condition as x ‚Üí0 .

All the same conditions (see ¬ß1.2) apply to the functions p x
( ) , q x
( )  and r x
( ) ; additionally, for this equation, we 
shall assume that s x
( )  is a continuous function on [ , ]
a b . The analysis of this problem, as we shall see, produces an 
intriguing and unexpected situation.
To initiate the discussion, we will make use of the eigenfunctions associated with the classical Sturm-Liouville problem i.e. 
obtained by setting s x
( ) ‚â°0 ; let y
x
n( )  be the (orthogonal) eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue Œªn . We now 
assume that the solution of the inhomogeneous equation can be represented by an expansion in these eigenfunctions, so

and this automatically satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions because each y
x
n( )  does. (For the purposes of 
this discussion, we assume that this solution exists for x
a b
‚àà[ , ], and this will be the case ‚Äì according to the theorem 
stated in the previous section.) At first sight, all this appears quite satisfactory, but there is a complication lurking here.
In all the analysis so far, we have not made any detailed statements about Œª , the parameter in the original equation. 
Certainly Œª  is a free parameter in the solution that we have obtained, and the solution is well-defined, provided that 
Œª
Œª
‚â†
n  for any n. If it happens that Œª  has been chosen (or fixed by some additional constraint ‚Äì perhaps a physical 
requirement) to be one of the eigenvalues, then it is immediately evident that we are presented with a difficulty. Let 
Œª
Œª

There are thus two cases: either Œ± m ‚â†0  or Œ± m = 0 . In the former case, we have an inconsistency, and so no solution 
exists. If Œ± m = 0 , then we do have a solution, but not a unique solution because cm  is undetermined: it has become 
an arbitrary constant in the solution. Further, if Œ± m = 0 , then we must have that

which implies that the forcing term, s x
( ) , must be orthogonal to the eigenfunction y
x
m( ) . Thus the existence, or 
otherwise, of the solution in the case Œª
Œª
=
m  hinges on the value of this integral: if it is non-zero, no solution exists; 
if it is zero, then a non-unique solution exists. (This situation, where a (non-unique) solution exists only if a quantity 
vanishes, is usually called the Fredholm alternative. It occurs in various branches of mathematics, and in various guises; 
for example, in matrix theory, in the form M = 0  which ensures that MX = 0  has a non-zero solution, and in the 
theory of integral equations, a field of analysis that was essentially founded by Fredholm.)

Preface
Preface
This text is intended to provide an introduction to, and a discussion of, integral transforms. This topic, as a stand-alone 
course of study, may not appear in a particular degree programme, although the possibility of solving problems using 
this technique may be mentioned in connection with specific applications. For example, modules on complex analysis are 
likely to include a brief mention of the Fourier Transform, and a fairly comprehensive course on differential equations may 
mention the Laplace Transform. The material has been written to provide a general introduction to the relevant ideas (but 
it could provide the basis for a module based on these ideas). The intention is to present the material so that it can be used 
as an adjunct to a number of different modules ‚Äì or simply to help the reader gain a broader experience of mathematical 
ideas. Necessarily, therefore, this material goes beyond the methods and techniques that are likely to be presented in any 
current programme of study, but any elementary ideas that might be mentioned are certainly included here.
It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of, and practical experience in, various aspects of standard methods 
of integration, and is familiar with the more routine methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations. Some 
use is also made of complex analysis (but this can be ignored without any detrimental effect on the basic ideas and their 
applications). This brief notebook does not attempt to include any ‚Äòapplied mathematical‚Äô applications of these methods, 
although various differential (and integral) equations are solved, as examples of what can be done.
The approach adopted here is to present some general ideas, which might involve a definition, or a theorem, or an idea, 
but with the emphasis on methods and applications of the ideas, explained with a number of carefully worked examples 
‚Äì we present 35. A small number of exercises, with answers, are also offered, to reinforce the ideas and methods that are 
described here. In addition, a list of the transforms of the more common functions is provided at the end of the Notebook.

Second-order ordinary differential equations

Introduction
1	 Introduction
A powerful technique ‚Äì certainly for solving constant coefficient ordinary and partial differential equations ‚Äì is the integral 
transform. The essential idea is to replace the unknown function (which may be the required solution of a differential 
equation) by a suitable integral of this function that also contains a parameter. When this is done, we can expect that 
ODEs are reduced to algebraic equations and that PDEs are replaced by differential equations of lower dimensionality. 
One of the simplest integral transforms is the Laplace Transform:

I [

(where R(s)> 0 ), and one of the most commonly-used is the Fourier Transform:
i
( )
( )e
d

F k
f x

‚àû
‚àí
‚àí‚àû
= ‚à´
(for real k).
In this Notebook, we shall introduce four standard and popular integral transforms, describe some of their properties 
and apply them to a variety of problems (mainly differential equations, but not exclusively so). An important ‚Äì and 
obvious ‚Äì question to pose is simply: having obtained the transformed version of a problem, and generated a solution for 
the transform itself, (the ‚ÄòF‚Äô above), how do we recover the solution (equivalently, the ‚Äòf‚Äô above) to the original problem? 
Although the answer to this, in practice, is often very straightforward: look it up in a table, we shall comment on this 
important aspect. However, it is useful, first, to show how transforms appear fairly naturally within familiar contexts.
1.1	
The appearance of an integral transform from a PDE

which, in this case, might be restricted to y ‚â•0 . (Note that this solution, as written, is complex valued; we could, however, 
elect to take the real or imaginary part, or construct a suitable linear combination with a complex conjugate, essentially as 
we do below.) The boundary conditions for a particular problem lead to an eigenvalue problem, and then we may write 
down a more general solution:
u x y

where the Ans are (complex) constants and the summation is over all the allowed values of œân  (which are essentially 
the eigenvalues here). This solution, for suitable An , can be made real, as mentioned above. We have obtained the familiar 
structure of the separation of variables solution (although it is likely to have been expressed in terms of sin and/or cos 
functions, with real coefficients).

Second-order ordinary differential equations

Introduction
where a and b are given (real) constants and r x
( )  is a known function. There is a very familiar method for solving 
such equations: seek a solution for the complementary function (CF) by writing y
x
= eŒª
, determine Œª , write down 
the CF, and also find (by some appropriate means) a particular integral (PI). A slightly more formal approach, and one 
that is applicable for any r x
( ) , is to write y x
v x
x
( )
( )
= eŒª
 (where Œª  is chosen to be a value associated with the CF), 
solve for v x
( )  and hence write down y x
( ) . (This is recognised as a version of the method of variation of parameters, 
resulting in a first-order equation for ‚Ä≤v x
( ) .) We now demonstrate how this approach can be generalised and modified.
First, it is evident that it is more convenient to work with v x
( ) ; second, we treat Œª  as a parameter ‚Äì rather like the k 
and œâ  in the previous section ‚Äì and then generate a new function (to replace v x
( ) ) which depends only on Œª ; this is 
the integral transform. Thus, guided by these observations and given
‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ +
‚Ä≤ +
=
y
ay
by
r x
( ) , x ‚â•0 ,
we multiply throughout by e‚àísx  (introducing the most commonly-used notation for the parameter, although some texts 
use p rather than s) and integrate over all x:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The Laplace Transform

The Laplace Transform (LT), of the function f x
( ) , is defined by
) V

,
where s is, in general, a complex parameter but with R(s) large enough to ensure that F s( )  exists. (Of course, if such 
an s does not exist, then the LT cannot be defined; so, for example, the LT of I [
[
 
H[S
 
4 9, 0 ‚â§
< ‚àû
x
, does not 
exist.) The LT, not surprisingly, was introduced by Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749-1827), in 1782, but in the form of an 
integral equation:
I [

He then posed the question: given f x
( ) , what is g t( ) ? (It was S.-D. Poisson who, in 1823, provided the general solution 
to this problem ‚Äì but more of this later.) We start by obtaining a few LTs of simple functions; a list of the more common 
LTs can be found in Table 1 at the end of this Notebook.

The extension to f x

should then recover the result of Example 1.

We may note, for Œ± = n  (integer), that we have the familiar result Œì(

1+

n
0

We note here that the upper limit in the u-integral has been written as s.‚àû, because s is, in general, a complex parameter; 
if s were restricted to the reals, then we would simply write 
 G[

fI
. The inclusion of s makes clear that, in the complex-u 
plane, we go to infinity in a given direction (with x given as real, of course). This does not affect the definition of the Œì
-function.
Example 3
Find the LT of f x

In the above, we have presented a few simple examples of LTs (and a few others are included in Table 1); we now examine 
some general properties of the LT, some of which lead to the construction of more LTs based on our earlier examples.
2.2	
Some properties of the LT
We now consider a few algebraic, differential and integral properties of the Laplace Transform; many of these will prove 
to be useful when we turn to the problem of finding solutions to differential (and integral) equations.

2.3	
Inversion of the Laplace Transform
So far, we have discussed various aspects of the LT, from the viewpoint: given a function, the derivative of a function, and 
so on, what is the LT? However, we must now address the question of how we can recover the original function, knowing 
the LT of the function; we will examine some aspects of this issue. The conventional (and simple) approach is to have 
available a comprehensive list of functions and their LTs; a few are provided in our Table 1 (and most standard texts list 
many more). However, this assumes that a fundamental principle is at play here: there is a one-to-one correspondence 
between a function and its LT. This is the case, but only for continuous functions (which, fortunately, is the situation that 
we encounter most often). Lerch‚Äôs theorem (1903) states that, if two functions have the same LT then these functions differ, 
at most, by a set of measure zero i.e. only at isolated points of discontinuity. If, on the other hand, the two functions are 
continuous, then the functions are identical; on this basis we may use a table to recover the functions from their LTs. 
[M. Lerch, 1860-1922, was a Czech mathematician who was taught by Weierstrass and Kroneker at Berlin University; 
he made contributions to analysis and number theory.] If the functions are not continuous, but their LTs are identical, 
we say that the functions are equal almost everywhere, usually written in mathematical shorthand as ‚Äòa.e.‚Äô. But how do we 
proceed if our LT is not on the list? This requires an inversion formula and, if possible, its evaluation, in order to obtain 
the original function.
On the basis of the Fourier Inversion Theorem (which we shall introduce in ¬ß3.3, and we shall mention there the connection 
with the Laplace Transform), it is reasonable to infer that the inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) takes the form

f x
F s
s
Œ≥
Œ≥
œÄ
+ ‚àû
‚àí‚àû
=

,
where Œ≥ (real) is sufficiently large. We shall use this as our starting point, and then provide an outline proof that this is 
indeed the required ILT. First we need some fundamental properties of the LT
0

( )e

F s
f x

for this to exist, we require 
( )
O(e
)
x
f x
Œ±
=
 as x ‚Üí‚àû (for some real Œ±), and then we select Œ≥
Œ±
>
. We also assume 
that f(x) is a 
1
C  function i.e. it has continuous first derivatives. It then follows that F(s) is analytic in the complex half-
plane R(s) > Œ≥; this ensures that F(s) is sufficiently well-behaved for all that follows to be valid.

This result, in conjunction with the integral theorems of complex analysis, enable the function to be recovered from the 
ILT. To accomplish this, we note that F(s) is analytic in R(s) > Œ≥, and so we use the reversed-D-shaped contour (below) 
where F(s) is analytic in Œ≥ > œÉ and, indeed, everywhere outside C i.e. all the poles of F(s) must lie inside C; the curved 
section of the contour is of radius R. (This contour is often called a Bromwich contour, after T.J.I‚ÄôA. Bromwich (1875-1929), 
an English mathematician.) To proceed, we use Cauchy‚Äôs residue theorem, followed by taking the limit R ‚Üí‚àû (and 
for all valid F(s)s, the integral along the semi-circular arc tends to zero as R ‚Üí‚àû, enabling f(x) to be recovered from 
F(s)). [A presentation of the relevant ideas, results and methods in complex analysis can be found, for example, in the 
volume of the Notebook Series entitled ‚ÄòThe integral theorems of complex analysis with applications to the evaluation of 
real integrals‚Äô.]

The Laplace Transform
2.4	
Applications to the solution of differential and integral equations
We conclude this chapter with a few simple applications of the Laplace Transform to various standard problems, notably 
differential equations (both ordinary and partial), and also to an integral equation. The essential idea is the same in all 
cases: take the LT of the given equation, find an expression for the LT of the solution that we seek, and then invert this.

The Laplace Transform
If there is any doubt about the correctness of this answer ‚Äì and there may be some concerns because of the appearance 
of the step function ‚Äì it is left as an exercise to confirm by direct substitution that this is indeed the solution, defined for 
0
x ‚â•
. (Of course, some care is required when differentiating the step function.) This example was a rather routine one 
in the context of ordinary differential equations and LTs; let us now consider a slightly more involved one.

the given boundary conditions. Perhaps a more interesting example is offered the problem of solving a partial differential 
equation ‚Äì and we met one in Exercise 1 ‚Äì and so we examine, carefully, a simple example of this type.

which has become an ODE for U as a function of x (with parameter s). The homogeneous equation here (i.e. the one with

difficult: integral equations. A number of types of integral equation are encountered, particularly in branches of applied 
mathematics; we shall consider a simple ‚Äì but important ‚Äì class which are of Volterra type with a special form of the kernel:

g
=
 (which is necessary for a conventional solution to exist). [V. Volterra, 1860-1940, Italian mathematician, 
remembered for his work on functionals, PDEs and, of course, integral equations.] The problem here is: given ( )
g x  and 
the kernel (
)
k x
y
‚àí
, find the (continuous) function 
( )
f x . We recognise, in the light of our work on LTs, that the left 
side of this integral equation is in convolution form, and so taking the transform immediately produces
( )
( )
( )
F s K s
G s

where F, K and G are the LTs of 
( )
f x , ( )
k x  and ( )
g x , respectively. The solution for F, and then for f, follows directly 
(at least, in principle).

The Fourier transform was, not surprisingly, introduced by Fourier (in his paper on Fourier series published in 1811); 
however, the notion of it as a transform, in the modern sense, almost certainly did not occur to him, nor did he use it 
any way that we would recognise. Essentially, he allowed ‚Äì without being too careful about the underlying procedures and 
necessary conditions ‚Äì the summation in his Fourier series to go over to an integral and this, together with the integral 
representation of the coefficients of the Fourier series, constitutes a version of the FT and its inverse. It was Cauchy, in 
1816, who produced a more mathematically robust and complete description, albeit in the context of a problem on water 
waves; he used this approach to construct a solution of that problem.

although we will approach this exercise by working with a sequence of functions that, in the appropriate limit, recover 
the delta function. (This is the usual method that is adopted when introducing, and developing the properties of, the 
generalised functions.) Thus we write

The Fourier Transform
which recovers our previous result when we select 0

.
The development just presented, we note, requires a little experience in working with generalised functions (but nothing, 
we suggest, too extreme). A short list of standard FTs can be found in Table 2, at the end of this Notebook. We now turn 
to a consideration of some important and general results associated with the Fourier Transform.
3.2	
Some properties of the FT
Corresponding to the results that we presented for the Laplace transform, in ¬ß2.2, we now describe some standard properties 
of the Fourier transform, namely those that relate to algebraic and differential formulae.
(a) Algebraic
First, let us be given a function, 
( )
f x , and its FT, 
( )
F k ; we form the FT of 
(
)
f ax  where 
0

 is a real constant. 
Thus we have

In our discussion of the LT, we observed that the use of the derivative can be extended to mean: differentiate the transform

Inversion of the Fourier Transform
A complete and rigorous proof of the Fourier Integral Theorem (which provides the inversion of the FT) is well beyond 
the scope of the Notebook ‚Äì it involves a number of functional-analytic ideas that we cannot assume of the reader (and 
cannot possibly develop here). Thus we will content ourselves with a proof in outline only, based on a complex version 
of the familiar Fourier series; this will therefore, in a small way, mimic what Fourier did in 1811. To accomplish this, we 
first express a (suitable) function f(x) in the form
i
( )
e n
n

f x
c

(This formulation is no more than the familiar Fourier series, containing both sin and cos terms, written in a complex 
form.) The important interpretation of this pair of definitions is afforded by considering the extension to any (suitable) 
general, non-periodic function; this is possible by allowing the period to increase indefinitely i.e. we take ‚Üí‚àû
ÔÅ¨
.

This result should be compared with that obtained in Example 15, demonstrating a symmetry between f(x) and F(k), in

This important identity is usually referred to as Parseval‚Äôs theorem. [M.-A. Parseval, 1755-1836, a French mathematician 
who published only 5 papers; this was his second (1799), and was regarded by him as a self-evident property of integrals: 
he did not prove or derive it! Note that this pre-dates the introduction of the Fourier Transform, as we recognise it today.] 
This result is a quite powerful tool in analysis ‚Äì and then it is usually expressed as an inner product ‚Äì and it also constitutes 
a fundamental property in physics, namely, the conservation of energy (in particular, of a waveform over all wave number).
3.4	
Applications to the solution of differential and integral equations
As we did for the Laplace Transform (¬ß2.4), we shall conclude with a couple of applications: we solve some equations, 
but this can give little more than a hint of the usefulness of FTs in modern mathematics and physics. Our first example 
involves the solution of Laplace‚Äôs equation.

We now turn to the problem of solving an integral equation. As we found for the LT (see Example 4), the most straightforward 
type of problem is one that involves a convolution ‚Äì and the same applies here. Thus an integral equation of the form

The Hankel Transform
4	 The Hankel Transform
In the final two chapters, we introduce and briefly describe two other fairly important integral transforms (and many 
others exist, and have been used in certain specific contexts). Here we present the main features of the Hankel Transform 
(HT). [These were introduced by H. Hankel (1839-1873), a German mathematician who made contributions to complex 
analysis and the theory of functions, as well as recasting Riemann‚Äôs fundamental work on integration in terms of more 
modern measure theory. However, he is probably best remembered for his work on Bessel functions of the third kind: 
Hankel functions.] 
In order to initiate our discussion, we note that any problem posed in cylindrical coordinates, together with the requirement 
to separate the variables, necessarily results in ordinary differential equations of Bessel type. Such problems are therefore 
likely to be neatly represented ‚Äì and perhaps solved easily ‚Äì by introducing an integral transform based on a Bessel 
function; this is the Hankel Transform. We define the HT, of order ŒΩ, as

our discussions here. Of course, if

f x .

It should already be evident that any use of the Hankel Transform ‚Äì powerful though it is ‚Äì necessarily involves some 
considerable knowledge of, and skills working with, the Bessel functions. Furthermore, many of the integrals that we 
encounter are not, in any sense, elementary; in consequence, in this chapter (and in the context of this Notebook), we 
shall proceed without giving all the details. Many of the main results that we mention can be found, described in detail, 
in a good text on transforms, read in conjunction with a standard work on the Bessel functions.
4.1	
HTs of some elementary functions
The Hankel Transforms of many functions can be obtained from standard results in the theory of Bessel functions. As 
we have just implied, we shall not dwell upon this aspect of the derivations; we shall, however, outline the underlying 
structure in most cases. To start this process, we first consider the HT of the function

The procedure is then slightly tedious (but routine): expand JŒΩ  via its defining power series, integrate term-by-term and 
finally interpret the result (which turns out to be the power-series representation of another Bessel function). The result 
of all this is to generate

We note, as we must expect, that we have used appropriate properties of the Bessel function (and its various integrals). 
Many other results follow from these, but we should mention another route that is useful in the construction of HTs, 
which is based on this observation:

Some properties of the HT
We shall discuss just two important properties of the Hankel Transform: a simple algebraic property and the HT of 
derivatives. These are ‚Äì by far ‚Äì the most useful, although others do exist (but are not derived in any routine or direct way).

will use this important property in an application.

It is possible to write this solution in alternative forms, mainly by re-expressing the double integral that is generated when 
the expression for F(k) is inserted. Of course, simplifications can arise for appropriate, special choices for f(r).

The Mellin Transform
5	 The Mellin Transform
The Mellin Transform (MT) arises most naturally in problems that involve, for example, the solution of Laplace‚Äôs equation 
in a wedge (an idea that we will not develop here, but this situation will arise in one of our examples). This type of problem 
then suggests the introduction of the integral

The Mellin Transform

Some properties of the MT
Corresponding to our development for the Hankel Transform, we show that there exist simple algebraic and differential 
properties that the MT satisfy; indeed, for this transform, we may also include the integral of a function.
Algebraic
Three results are readily obtained. First, given the MT of f(x), we form the MT of f(ax), where

This example shows that the MT of a less-than-trivial function (essentially the error function, erf), which might have been 
expected to generate a complicated MT, presents us with a particularly routine exercise.
5.3	
Applications to the solution of a PDE
Although the MT can be used to solve a class of integral equations (using the appropriate convolution theorem, much as 
we have seen for other transforms), arguably the most useful application for the applied mathematician is to the solution of 
certain types of PDE. However, we should mention that the MT also plays a r√¥le in the solution of functional equations and 
in certain problems in statistics. For us, a suitable problem involves Laplace‚Äôs equation written in plane polar coordinates:

 (see after Example 33). The application of the MT therefore produces a fairly routine problem, 
although we may need to take care over where the MT exists; we rehearse all the salient points in our final example.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
