“The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
Where grew the arts of war and peace,
Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
Eternal summer gilds them yet,
But all, except their sun, is set.”
—Byron, Don Juan

T
he Greek period lasted for three millennia,
from the beginning of the Minoan civilization
in Bronze Age Greece (around 3000 BC) until the
Romans took control of the last of the Greek territo-
ries (around 30 BC). During this time the cultures of
the Minoans and the Mycenaeans developed and dis-
appeared, and Greece passed through an anarchic
Dark Age to emerge as a collection of city-states and
colonies that were ﬂeetingly merged into the Empire
of Alexander the Great. The breakup of his Empire
into smaller Hellenistic states achieved a kind of
equilibrium that, in some areas, continued well into
the Roman period.
The Roman conquest stripped Greece of its her-
itage. Works of art were removed, and skilled arti-
sans and trained professionals served the Roman
Empire, leaving Greece a backwater for the next
2,000 years. Paradoxically, this dispersion of culture
undoubtedly led to the high achievements in Greek
art, architecture and philosophical thought having an
enormous and lasting inﬂuence on the development
of Western culture.
The aim of this book is to present information
relating to Greek history from the Minoan period to
the Roman conquest. The chapters are organized
thematically rather than chronologically, in order to
give readers easier access to particular topics. By con-
sulting the extensive index, the book can also be used
as a dictionary. All too often, archaeological and his-
torical evidence are used in isolation from each other.
We have therefore tried to select the most important
aspects of both disciplines. No attempt has been
made to separate historical from archaeological ele-
ments in the text, and so there are no speciﬁc chapters
devoted solely to archaeological evidence or artifacts.
Often a particular topic can be viewed in more
than one way, so it may be covered in more than one
section. For example, pottery can be considered as a
container, as part of a manufacturing process, or as a
work of art. Where this occurs, repetition of infor-
mation has been kept to a minimum. The reader
should make full use of the index to ﬁnd all refer-
ences to a particular subject and also the meanings of
particular words. Inevitably, there is room to do no
more than summarize the various topics, but we have
tried to provide further references for readers wish-
ing to know more about any subject. In addition to
technical, historical and archaeological terms, we
have also tried to give the meaning of those Greek
words and phrases more commonly encountered in
other works on the subject.
Place-names are usually in English, except where
convention prefers the Greek (transliterated) or
where no English equivalent exists. Where the
names of modern countries are used, only the names
of properly deﬁned territories at the time of writing
have been used. Standard U.S. measurements are
given, with metric equivalents in parentheses. Pre-
cise dates are given wherever possible, but at times
only approximate dates are known. A date written as
INTRODUCTION

c. 360 BC means approximately (circa) 360 BC. One
written as c. 360–c. 250 BC means approximately 360
BC to approximately 250 BC. Written as c. 360–250 BC,
it means approximately 360 BC to precisely 250 BC;
and 360–250 BC means precisely 360 BC to precisely
250 BC. A date such as 120/118 BC means either 120
BC or 118 BC.
Many people nowadays prefer BCE (Before Com-
mon Era) to BC, but the traditional term BC is used
here, with no religious signiﬁcance whatsoever.
Transliteration of Names 
and Words
The transliteration of Greek names and words from
the Greek alphabet is a problematic area, because
people invariably have preferences. Many words are
more familiar today in a Latinized or Anglicized
form, while others are more familiar in their original
Greek form. Furthermore, there were differences in
names even amongst the Greeks. The least familiar
method of presenting names and words is direct
transliteration, such as Aiskhylos, Kleon, Lysandros,
Perikles, Epeiros, Mykenai. The Romans transliter-
ated words by using c for kappa, ch for chi, ae for
alpha iota, oe for omicron iota, u for omicron upsilon,
y for upsilon, -us for an -os ending, and -der for a -dros
ending.
Generally, the Roman spelling is followed in this
book. Consequently, Aiskhylos becomes Aeschylus,
Kleon becomes Cleon, Lysandros becomes Lysander,
Perikles becomes Pericles, Epeiros becomes Epirus
and Mykenai becomes Mycenae. The Greek translit-
erated version is given in italics, usually with kh rather
than ch and k not c. So for archon, the ancient Greek
version will be presented as arkhon. The Greek
upsilon can be transliterated as y or u.
No attempt is made in this book to differentiate
between the long and short vowels e and o (eta and
epsilon, and omega and omicron). In some cases the
modern Greek words or the Anglicized forms are
used, such as “Athens,” “Lesbos” and “Cos.” What
has been chosen in this book is the term that is likely
to be most familiar to the reader. There is no agree-
ment between scholars on how Greek terms should
be presented to a modern audience.
Updated Edition
At the invitation of Facts On File, the opportunity
has been taken to revise and expand this Greek hand-
book. We have concentrated by and large on the lit-
erature published since we ﬁrst wrote the book, as we
believe that directing the reader—especially stu-
dents—to far more detailed sources is of particular
value. Our purpose has always been to provide acces-
sible information, simply stating the known facts and
giving the terminology and dates, while leaving
interpretation for others to expand. We have con-
centrated especially on areas such as social life, like
the role of women, health and medicine, and homo-
sexuality, as these are areas that have received most
attention from recent scholars.

BRIEF HISTORY
Greece was never a single nation but was a series of
independent states, often in conflict. The Greek
world existed until 30 BC, when Ptolemaic Egypt (the
last major Hellenistic kingdom) came under Roman
rule. Early Greek history (particularly 8th century BC
and earlier), before the advent of alphabetic writing,
is dependent solely on archaeological evidence, with
limited credence given to mythological accounts.
Later Greek history, based increasingly on written
accounts, is more certain. Most dates before 600 BC
are approximate, while dates after this period can still
be subject to problems and dispute. Further details on
historical events are given in chapter 2 (biographies of
prominent people) and in chapter 4 (on geography).
Minoan and Mycenaean
Civilizations
This period is the Bronze Age, 3300–1050 BC.
DATING METHODS
Earliest farming settlements in mainland Greece and
Crete date from the 7th to 4th millennium BC (the
Neolithic Period and Copper Age, fig. 1.1). The
Bronze Age began around 3300 BC, characterized by
the use of copper alloy or bronze for tools and
weapons. Since the early 20th century, the Aegean
Bronze Age has tended to be divided into three chron-
ological periods, a tripartite system that was originally
intended to mirror the Old, Middle and New King-
doms of Egypt. The Aegean also tends to be divided
into three geographical regions for this period: main-
land, Cyclades and Crete. The dating continuously
undergoes revision, and the phases (often referred to
in abbreviated form) are no longer distinct. Relative
chronology is based mainly on pottery styles, and it is
not often possible to use absolute dates, even with the
availability of some radiocarbon dates.
CRETE
In Crete the Bronze Age begins with the Minoan
culture, named after the legendary king Minos. The
earliest phase is the Prepalatial Period, to about 2200
1.1 Early settlement of the late Neolithic period and Early Bronze Age at Khirokitia in Cyprus

or 2000 BC. It is divided into Early Minoan I (EMI),
Early Minoan II (EMII) and Early Minoan III
(EMIII); the latter is a transitional phase overlapping
with Middle Minoan IA (MMIA).
The next period (c. 2200 or 2000–c. 1700 or 1600
BC) is the First Palace Period (or Old Palace Period),
equating approximately to Middle Minoan IB
(MMIB), Middle Minoan IIA (MMIIA), Middle
Minoan IIB (MMIIB) and Middle Minoan IIIA
(MMIIIA). Vast palaces were built across Crete during
the First Palace Period. The end of the ﬁrst palaces c.
1700 BC may have been due to a severe earthquake (or
series of earthquakes) or to warfare and conquest, with
Knossos emerging as the leading center.
The next phase (c. 1700 or 1600–c. 1500 BC) is
the Second Palace Period, equating approximately to
Middle Minoan IIIB (MMIIIB), Late Minoan IA
(LMIA) and Late Minoan IB (LMIB). During the
Second Palace Period the palaces were promptly
rebuilt, including at Knossos, Mallia, Phaistos and
Zakros. A system of writing known as Linear A was
also developed (ﬁg. 7.1). In this period Minoan inﬂu-
ence (though probably not settlement) is apparent
elsewhere in the Aegean, including the mainland.
The enormous eruption of the Thera (Santorini)
volcano (which brought about the legend of the lost
city of Atlantis) was once thought to have marked
the end of the Second Palace Period, causing the
destruction of the palaces on Crete c. 1500 BC. This
date is no longer accepted, and the eruption is gen-
erally believed to have occurred before the end of
Late Minoan IA and Late Helladic I (around
1630/20 BC) (ﬁg. 1.2). Indeed, the eruption may not
have had such devastating consequences as was once
thought. Instead, the palaces and other settlements
on Crete could have continued for over 100 years,
only then being destroyed by devastating fires or
severe decline and prolonged abandonment. Internal
conﬂict is the most likely explanation; an invasion by
mainland Mycenaeans is no longer an accepted view,
even though they apparently invaded Crete shortly
after this period of decline.
The Third Palace Period (c. 1500–c. 1200 BC)
equates approximately to Late Minoan II (LMII) and
part of Late Minoan III (LMIIIA1, LMIIIA2, LMI-
IIB). In the Third (and last) Palace Period on Crete,
Knossos was powerful, exerting inﬂuence over a wide
area of the Aegean. It is debatable whether the
Mycenaeans ever controlled Crete. Linear B (fig.
7.1) was adopted, and the last palace at Knossos was
destroyed by ﬁre, preserving the Linear B archives
(written on clay tablets). This may have occurred c.
1400 BC along with the destruction of other Cretan
palaces, or it may have been at the end of LMIIIA2
(late 14th century BC) or even as late as 1200 BC.
The Postpalatial Period, from c. 1200 to c. 1050
BC, is approximately equivalent to Late Minoan IIIC
(LMIIIC). Previously occupied sites did continue in
use, but they were fewer in number, with apparent
depopulation.
CYCLADES
In the Cyclades Islands there are various dating
schemes, the simplest termed “Cycladic”: Early
Cycladic I (ECI), Early Cycladic II (ECII) and Early
Cycladic III (ECIII) are all equivalent to the Prepala-
tial Period. The Middle Cycladic (MC) is partly
equivalent to the First Palace Period, with the later
part equivalent to the Second Palace Period. Late

1.2 The eruption of the volcano at Thera took place
around 1630/1620 BC, destroying the settlement of
Akrotiri.

Cycladic I (LCI) and Late Cycladic II (LCII) are also
equivalent to the Second Palace Period. Late
Cycladic III (LCIII) is equivalent to the Third Palace
and Postpalatial Periods.
MAINLAND
On the mainland various dating schemes exist for the
Bronze Age, the most common being termed “Hel-
ladic” and usually divided into three: c. 3000–c. 2100
BC is Early Helladic, c. 2100/2000–c. 1550 BC is
Middle Helladic and c. 1580–c. 1100/1050 BC is the
Late Helladic or Mycenaean period. The Prepalatial
Period comprises Early Helladic I (EHI), Early Hel-
ladic II (EHII) and Early Helladic III (EHIII). The
First Palace Period comprises the early part of Mid-
dle Helladic (MH). The Second Palace Period com-
prises the later part of Middle Helladic, as well as
Late Helladic I (LHI) and Late Helladic IIA
(LHIIA). Possibly because of Minoan inﬂuence and
trade, a ruling class became established at Mycenae
and elsewhere on the mainland, represented by much
wealth and rich burials, and probably by the first
palaces on the mainland.
On the mainland the Third Palace Period com-
prises the Late Helladic IIB (LHIIB) and Late Hel-
ladic III (LHIIIA1, LHIIIA2, LHIIIB1 and
LHIIIB2), while the Postpalatial Period is Late Hel-
ladic IIIC (LHIIIC). The Third Palace Period was
the main Mycenaean period, with the mainland
becoming more important than Crete. Several
palaces (such as Tiryns, Mycenae, Pylos and Thebes)
and many new settlements were established (ﬁg. 1.3).
The 14th and 13th centuries BC especially were the
Heroic Age of the poets, when legends and oral tra-
ditions were mixed with some element of truth. Dur-

1.3 The Late Bronze Age site at Mycenae, Greece, situated on the nearer hill

ing this time many of the palaces were protected by
massive fortiﬁcations (ﬁg. 1.4), probably in prepara-
tion for sieges. The threat may have been from afar
or from neighboring states.
From about 1250 BC a breakdown of settled con-
ditions began in the eastern Mediterranean, Egypt
and Asia Minor, and c. 1220 BC level VIIa of Troy
was destroyed (fig. 1.5). This was a time of great
insecurity, and in c. 1200 BC there was widespread
destruction and/or abandonment of many major
Mycenaean sites and palaces. Like Crete, some sites
did continue to be inhabited for several decades, but
they were far fewer in number. Following the ﬁnal
collapse of Mycenaean culture, it used to be believed
that the Dorians (Indo-Europeans from the Danube
area) invaded much of mainland Greece from
approximately 1200 to 1000 BC. It is no longer
accepted that the invasion caused the major dramatic
collapse of Mycenaean civilization, and such an inva-
sion is not supported by the archaeological evidence.
Climate-shift may have been responsible, leading to
crop failure, famine and social collapse.
Dark Age to Geometric
The Dark Age, a period about which little is known
except from the archaeological record, is equivalent
to the end of the Bronze Age and the Iron Age (c.
1110–900 BC). There was a greatly diminished pop-
ulation, poor material culture and buildings that left
few surviving remains, and no written records, as it
was a nonliterate society. From 1050 to 950 BC the
Ionian Greeks and other Greeks migrated from the
mainland to the Aegean Islands and Asia Minor’s
west coast. Most inhabitants of mainland Greece
(except Arcadia) in the Classical Age called them-
selves Dorian Greeks. The terminology used by
scholars for this period is imprecise, with much dis-
agreement. Despite the term “Dark Age,” some such

settlements were evidently quite prosperous at this
time. There also seems to have been a division into
separate political organizations, which become
clearer in the ensuing Archaic Age. The term “Geo-
metric” is usually applied to the period 900–700 BC
when describing pottery, and at this time the popula-
tion appears to have increased.
Archaic Age
This period is c. 750–479 BC, when the Persian inva-
sions ended, although the dates of this period are dis-
puted, and some prefer 780–480 BC. The cities of
Chalcis and Eretria in Euboea emerged as the lead-
ing settlements in Greece. From 800 BC the Greeks
began to travel far aﬁeld and colonized many parts of
Europe and Asia Minor, mostly by sea, because of
the increasing population and consequent land
shortage. Chalcis and Eretria were responsible for
the earliest colonies, and in 733 BC Corinth followed
with colonies at Corcyra and Syracuse. The Lelan-
tine War between Chalcis and Eretria for the fertile
Lelantine Plain broke out around 730 BC and devel-
oped into a conflict involving many Greek states,
leading to the disintegration of Euboea’s power.
From about 730 BC Corinth emerged as the most
advanced city in Greece. Other important cities
included Corinth’s neighbors Sicyon and Megara, as
well as Aegina, Samos, Miletus, Athens and Sparta.
From the mid-7th century BC there were revolts to
overthrow some aristocratic city governments. In
Corinth around 657 BC, Cypselus became the ﬁrst
tyrant to overthrow an aristocratic government. Sim-
ilar revolts followed in Megara and Sicyon, and an
attempted revolt by Cylon in Athens failed in 632 BC.

Although tyrannies seem to have been widespread in
the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Sparta’s hereditary
kingship and unique system of rule endured.
Thought to have been established by Lycurgus in the
early 7th century BC, Sparta’s system resembled one
in Crete and had probably developed from earliest
times.
In the years following 625 BC Sparta and then
Athens dominated mainland Greece. Many tyrannies
were overthrown (such as at Corinth) and were
replaced by oligarchic governments or democracies.
Economic problems in Athens were addressed by
Solon, the archon in 594/593 BC, who refused the
role of tyrant. Nevertheless, Peisistratus became
tyrant of Athens from c. 560 BC, succeeded by his
sons Hipparchus and Hippias, the former subse-
quently assassinated and the latter forced into exile.
Cleisthenes then undertook reform at Athens, and
by the end of the 6th century BC Athens became very
powerful and came into conﬂict with Sparta. By now
Sparta was head of an alliance (the Peloponnesian
League, but known then as “the Lacedaemonians
and their allies”), which included all states of the
Peloponnese except Argos.
By the 6th century BC Greek settlements existed
in Asia Minor, northern Africa, Egypt and the
Mediterranean basin. Some colonies were established
for political purposes and for trade. Many were agri-
cultural settlements, owing to overpopulation and a
shortage of suitable fertile land on mainland Greece.
Athens did not participate in colonization, as it had
sufﬁcient agricultural land, and Sparta had only one
colony (Taras), until Heraclea Trachinia in the mid-
5th century BC.
In 546 BC the Persians under Cyrus the Great
conquered Lydia and came into contact with the Ion-
ian Greek cities of Asia Minor. Conﬂict with Persia
dominated the late Archaic Age (until 479 BC). In 513
BC Darius the Great invaded Thrace and Scythia.
Persia came to control Thrace as far as Macedonia, as
well as Asia Minor, the Middle East, Egypt, and
northern Africa as far as Cyrene (beyond which was
the Phoenician colony of Carthage, a threat to Greek
Sicily and southern Italy). In 499 BC the Ionian
Greeks revolted against Persian control. Sparta
refused to help, but Athens and Eretria sent assis-
tance. The Persians crushed the revolt and destroyed
Miletus (494 BC). In 492 BC the Persians under Mar-
donius took Thasos and campaigned in Thrace. In
490 BC Darius again attempted to invade Greece,
probably to punish Athens and Eretria, but was
defeated by Athens at the battle of Marathon (ﬁg. 2.5)
with the loss of 6,400 Persian troops but only 192
Athenian Greeks.
The Persians did not invade again for another 10
years, this time under Xerxes. In Athens, Themisto-
cles became an inﬂuential leader and prepared for
another Persian invasion by building new trireme
warships and fortifying Piraeus (Map 6). Thirty-one
Greek states attended a conference at Sparta in 481
BC and one at the Isthmus of Corinth in spring 480
BC, forming an alliance that is today known as the
Hellenic League, because the Greeks used the word
Hellenes to describe themselves, and led by Sparta to
combat the Persians. Also in 480 BC the Persians
invaded Greece for a second time and defeated the
Greeks at Thermopylae (fig. 2.6) and Artemisium

(Euboea). They moved through central Greece, and
were supported by Thebes. Athens was next taken by
the Persians, but the Persians were ﬁnally defeated at
the naval battle of Salamis in the channel between
the island of Salamis and the Greek mainland (ﬁg.
1.6). Possibly on the same day in 480 BC, Sicilian
forces under Theron and Gelon at the battle of
Himera (north coast of Sicily) defeated the
Carthaginians under Hamilcar.
Xerxes sailed to Asia Minor to prevent a revolt
there, and his general, Mardonius, moved north to
Thessaly for the winter. In 479 BC a combined Greek
force defeated the Persians under Mardonius at the
battle of Plataea (ﬁgs. 1.7 and 1.8) and then moved to
Thebes, where the town was besieged and its leaders
executed for supporting the Persians. In Ionia the
Greeks revolted against the Persians. The Hellenic
League now incorporated island states such as Chios,
Lesbos and Samos. The Greeks sailed to Asia Minor
and defeated the Persians at Mycale (near Samos).
Sestus (base of the Persians) was then attacked and
destroyed by Xanthippus (479/478 BC).

Classical Age
DELIAN LEAGUE
The 5th and 4th centuries BC are regarded as the
Classical Age of Greece, from the end of the Persian
invasions to the accession of Alexander the Great
(479–336 BC). In 478 BC Pausanias was sent with an
allied fleet to recapture Byzantium from the Per-
sians, but was recalled by Sparta. From 478 BC
Athens rose to power, particularly under Pericles,
and replaced Sparta as leader of the Greeks. Sparta’s
displeasure when Athens began to rebuild its walls
lessened after Themistocles was ostracized (c. 471
BC) and Cimon became powerful. Athens became
leader of a group of allies called the Delian League,
set up to fight against the Persians. The Delian
League, also known today as the “Confederacy of
Delos,” (because it was based on the island of Delos)
was known in the 5th century BC as “The Athenians
and their allies.” Developed from the Hellenic
League, its treasury and meeting place were at Delos.
Some states contributed money and others con-
tributed ships, and its money was administered by
Athenian ofﬁcials known as hellenotamiai (treasurers
of the Greeks). Until 461 BC the Delian League
forces were led by Cimon who was pro-Spartan. The
Delian League undertook various activities against
Persia and also for and against its own members,
including besieging and capturing Eion (476 BC),
clearing Scyrus of pirates (475–473 BC) and subju-
gating a revolt at Naxos (469 BC).
Although the battle of the Eurymedon (in south-
ern Asia Minor) in c. 467 BC removed the Persian
threat, Athens continued the Delian League. Revolts
by member states were suppressed, including one by
Thasos in 465 BC. Sparta offered to help Thasos, but
was prevented by a devastating earthquake and a
revolt by the helots of Messenia. Cimon, whose offer
to send Sparta assistance from Athens was rejected,
was ostracized in 461 BC (ﬁg. 1.12). From that date the
Delian League was gradually converted into an
Athenian Empire. Athens adopted a greater imperial-
ist strategy, using the Delian League to pursue its own
interests, which attracted opposition from Sparta and
Corinth. From c. 460 to 446 BC the First Pelopon-
nesian War was fought between Athens and the Pelo-
ponnesian League (involving mainly Corinth). The
Delian League treasury was moved to Athens in 454
BC. With the inﬂuence of Cimon, a ﬁve year truce was
signed between Athens and Sparta c. 451 BC.
Cimon renewed attacks on Persian-held territory,
and the Persians were ﬁnally defeated at the battle of
Salamis off Cyprus in 449 BC. A peace treaty (called
the Peace of Callias) between Athens and Persia was
negotiated in 449/448 BC. In the treaty, Athens
agreed not to attack Persian territory, and the Greeks
of Asia Minor were to be autonomous. From 450 to
446 BC Athens undertook colonization in the form of
cleruchies, including Thurii in southern Italy and
Amphipolis in the northern Aegean. In 446 BC
Sparta invaded Attica but then withdrew. The First
Peloponnesian War was settled the same year, and
peace between Athens and Sparta lasted 15 years.
At this point there was little justiﬁcation for the
prolonged existence of the Delian League, but Athens
forced the allies to continue paying tribute. From 445
BC Athens and Sparta drifted toward war. In 435 BC
Corinth and Corcyra fought over Epidamnus. Athens
intervened, but the 30-year peace treaty between
Athens and Sparta held. In 432 BC, Potidaea (a colony
of Corinth) revolted from the Delian League. The
Peloponnesians and Athenians sent forces; the Athe-
nians were victorious and then besieged Potidaea.
Sparta subsequently declared war in 431 BC.
SECOND (OR GREAT) 
PELOPONNESIAN WAR
The ﬁrst part of the war (431–421 BC) was the Archi-
damian War (after Archidamus II). Attica was invaded
annually by the Peloponnesians, but its population
was concentrated at Athens and Piraeus within the
defensive walls. When plague broke out in Athens,
leading to the death of Pericles, Cleon became the
dominant leader. After Brasidas and Cleon were killed
in 422 BC, Athens and Sparta wanted peace, and a 50-
year truce (Peace of Nicias) was signed in 421 BC.
When Sparta’s allies refused to ratify the treaty,
Athens, Argos, Mantinea and Elis formed an alliance.
Corinth and Megara formed a new alliance with
Sparta. The Spartan alliance was victorious at the
battle of Mantinea (418 BC). Sparta and Argos then
agreed on an alliance, and then Alcibiades played an
important part during the Peloponnesian War (until
the battle of Notium in 406 BC). In 416 BC Athens
conquered the independent island of Melos, and in
415 BC sent a huge expedition to Sicily to help

Segesta against Selinus (an ally of Syracuse) and to
cut off supplies to the Peloponnese. Before the expe-
dition embarked, nearly all the stone herms at
Athens were mutilated, which caused an outrage and
resulted in accusations against Alcibiades. In 414 BC
the Athenians attempted to besiege Syracuse; rein-
forcements were sent under Demosthenes, but
Athens suffered disastrous defeats in 413 BC.
Meanwhile Sparta established a fortiﬁed base at
Decelea, north of Athens, which controlled routes to
Boeotia and Attica. This base facilitated invasions
into Attica, which severely affected Athenian trade,
mining and agriculture. The ﬁnal phase of the Pelo-
ponnesian War (to 404 BC) is therefore called the
Decelean War; it was fought almost entirely at sea in
the eastern Aegean. In 412 BC Sparta signed the
Treaty of Miletus with Persia, surrendering to Dar-
ius II the Greek communities in Asia Minor in return
for support in its war against Athens. Consequently,
Athens made Samos its naval base. An oligarchic rev-
olution in 411 BC overthrew the democracy in
Athens. The soldiers and sailors at Samos declared
themselves the true government of Athens, and full
democracy was restored in 410 BC.
Athens gained several naval victories against Sparta
in 411 BC, and the Spartan ﬂeet was destroyed. Sparta
sued for peace, but was rejected by Athens. Persia
assisted Sparta ﬁnancially in building a new naval ﬂeet,
and consequently Lysander of Sparta defeated the
Athenians at the naval battle of Notium (near Eph-
esus). Athens then defeated Sparta at the naval battle
of Arginusae, but executed its own victorious generals
for failing to pick up survivors. Athens was ﬁnally
defeated at the naval battle of Aegospotami (405 BC)
and was then besieged at Piraeus. In 404 BC Athens
surrendered to Sparta and had to suffer the loss of its
navy, destruction of the Long Walls, loss of foreign
territories, and an alliance with Sparta. An oligarchy
of Thirty Tyrants was established, who acted ruth-
lessly against the democrats. The democrats seized
Piraeus (403 BC), and civil war ensued, with the sub-
sequent restoration of full democracy. However, the
political power of Athens was lost.
CORINTHIAN WAR
About this time in Sicily (405 BC), Dionysius I
became tyrant of Syracuse with Spartan help, which
caused disquiet in Corinth. Despite the cessation of
the Peloponnesian War, interstate conﬂict continued
in the Greek world, with the rise in power of lesser
states such as Thebes. In 400 BC Sparta assisted the
Persian Cyrus against his brother Artaxerxes II. The
Greek cities of Asia Minor called on Sparta to assist
them against Persia. Agesilaus II went to their aid,
but his campaign was cut short by the Corinthian
War (395–386 BC), in which Athens, Argos, Thebes
and Corinth (backed by Persia) fought against Sparta
(ﬁg. 1.9). In 394 BC Sparta won land battles, but was

defeated at sea in the battle of Cnidus by a Persian
ﬂeet under the Athenian admiral Conon. In 393 BC
the Long Walls of Athens were rebuilt (Map 6), and
some territory was recovered. In 390–389 BC Athens
made alliances with Thasos, Samothrace and many
cities of Asia Minor. Persia then joined Sparta to
defeat Athens in a naval battle in the Hellespont. In
386 BC the Corinthian War was terminated; the
King’s Peace was signed at Sardis by the Persian king
Artaxerxes II and the Greek states. The peace was to
be enforced by Sparta, with any dangerous alliances
broken up. All states were to be autonomous, Persia
was to keep Asia Minor and Cyprus, Thebes was to
give up leadership of the Boeotian Confederacy, and
Athens had to abandon plans to regain its Empire. It
was also called the Peace of Antalcidas, because of the
prominent involvement of the Spartan Antalcidas.
RISE OF THEBES
In 382 BC Sparta seized the citadel of Thebes (Cad-
mea), and in 379 BC destroyed the Chalcidic Confed-
eracy (a group of settlements in Chalcidice centered
on Olynthus) for infringing on the King’s Peace.
Athens established the Second Athenian League (or
Confederacy) in 378 BC against this Spartan aggres-
sion. The new league defeated Sparta in a naval battle
off Naxos in 376 BC. In 371 BC another treaty known
as the Peace of Callias was signed by all Greek states
except Thebes; in the same year Thebes defeated
Sparta (which had invaded Boeotia) at the battle of
Leuctra, which ended Spartan military domination
and the Peloponnesian League. In 370/369 BC
Thebes extended its influence over Thessaly and
intervened in the Peloponnese, reestablishing Messe-
nia as an independent state, which deprived Sparta of
its helots and its economic base. An alliance of states
was set up against Sparta (Arcadian Confederacy),
with a new capital at Megalopolis. Thebes was also
active in the north and in the Aegean. The power of
Thebes collapsed in 362 BC at the battle of Mantinea,
which was fought against the Spartans, Athenians and
Mantineans, when the Theban leader Epaminondas
was killed.
RISE OF MACEDONIA
In 359 BC Philip II became king of Macedonia,
which had been weakened by dynastic struggles.
Macedonia subsequently became the dominant

Cleopatra’s marriage to king Alexander of Epirus. He was buried in a tomb nearby.

power in the Greek world. In order to facilitate
access to the sea and to gain control of the gold
mines of Mount Pangaeus, Philip II repeatedly came
into conﬂict with Athens (including the capture of
Amphipolis in 357 BC and Methone in 354 BC).
Athens embarked on the Social War (357–355 BC)
against allies of the Second Athenian League who
had revolted, while Sparta attempted in vain to
recover Messenia. Philip II took advantage of the sit-
uation. He gained the support of the Chalcidic Con-
federacy by capturing Potidaea and handing it over
to Olynthus (356 BC). He intervened in the Third
Sacred War against Phocis (355–346 BC), and in
349–348 BC he attacked the Chalcidice promontory,
destroying Olynthus and enslaving its inhabitants,
with little opposition from Athens.
In 346 BC Athens and Philip II made peace (Peace
of Philocrates), although Philip crushed the Phocians
later that year. He besieged Perinthus and Byzantium
(340–339 BC), which had revolted from the Mace-
donian alliance, but failed to take either. In 339 BC he
took part in the Fourth Sacred War, and in 338 BC
inﬂicted a devastating defeat on Thebes and Athens at
the battle of Chaeronea. He then summoned a con-
gress of Greek states at Corinth, with another in 337
BC, in which he put forward his military plans to
attack Persia. His assassination in 336 BC (ﬁg. 1.10)
led to the accession of Alexander the Great.
Hellenistic Period
The term “Hellenistic” describes the period from the
accession of Alexander the Great in 336 BC to the
final conquest of the Greek world by Rome in 30
BC—a period of about 300 years. During this time
city-states such as Athens declined, but there was a
huge expansion of Greek territory into non-Greek
areas as far as Afghanistan, with the establishment of
numerous monarchies, the founding of many Greek
cities, and a shift of the cultural center to Alexandria
in Egypt. On his accession Alexander acted against
the tribes of the lower Danube and suppressed a
revolt in Greece, in which he destroyed Thebes,
killing and enslaving its inhabitants (335 BC). Alexan-
der next pursued Philip II’s plan to invade the Persian
Empire; within 12 years he had conquered as far as
the steppes of Russia, Afghanistan and the Punjab
(Map 5), all of which became part of the Hellenistic
world. For his campaigns, see pp. 46–48. All Hellenis-
tic rulers throughout his empire came to use the title
“king.”
AGE OF THE SUCCESSORS (DIADOCHI)
After Alexander’s death there was a struggle among
his former generals (the Successors, diadokhoi—liter-
ally, the inheritors) to retain control of Alexander’s
empire (323–301 BC), initially by the regent Perdic-
cas. From 321 BC Ptolemy I had established Egypt as
a separate kingdom. Greek states including Athens
tried to revolt against Macedonia, but were defeated
by Antipater in the Lamian War (323–322 BC), and
Athens was occupied by the Macedonians. In 320 BC
Perdiccas died, and Antigonus I tried to gain control
of the Empire. The other generals—Cassander, Lysi-
machus, Ptolemy I and Seleucus I—formed alliances
against Antigonus I and his son Demetrius I
Poliorcetes. By 306 BC Alexander’s family had been
eliminated, and the Successors claimed the title of
king in their own areas (Map 1). Demetrius I
Poliorcetes and Antigonus I were defeated at the bat-
tle of Ipsus in 301 BC, so destroying any chance of
holding together Alexander’s empire.
FORMATION OF HELLENISTIC
KINGDOMS
Demetrius I Poliorcetes became king of Macedonia
in 294 BC, but was defeated and captured in 285 BC
by Seleucus I when trying to regain Asian territories.
Lysimachus and Pyrrhus of Epirus took over Mace-
donia (288 BC), but Lysimachus was defeated and
killed in 281 BC by Seleucus I. Pyrrhus was pushed
back to Epirus and then intervened in Sicily and
southern Italy against Rome. By about 275 BC three
main Hellenistic kingdoms had emerged—Macedo-
nia, Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. The Ptolemies
held not only Egypt, but also Cyrene, Coele-Syria,
Cyprus, the Aegean Islands and parts of Asia Minor.
The Antigonids held Macedonia and dominated
parts of Greece. The Seleucids occupied the largest
kingdom, holding northern Syria, parts of Asia
Minor and Persia, and Babylonia. The 3rd century
BC saw conflicts between these kingdoms and the
emergence of a new Greek kingdom when the Attal-

ids (centered at Pergamum) established indepen-
dence from the Seleucids.
From 334 to 264 BC Rome gradually expanded its
control of Italy, and from 264 BC it began expansion
into Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Rome then became
involved in the First Punic War, a result of Cartha-
ginian expansion in Spain. From 220 to 167 BC
Rome brought much of the Mediterranean area
under its control. Sicily became a Roman province in
211 BC, and other areas followed.
GREECE AND MACEDONIA
In 268 BC the Chremonidean War started, in which
Athens and Sparta (supported by Ptolemy II) unsuc-
cessfully revolted against Antigonus II of Macedo-
nia. Athens was taken by the Macedonians (262 BC).
In 251 BC Aratus freed Sicyon and united it with the
Achaean Confederacy against Macedonia. In 249 BC
Alexander of Corinth revolted against Antigonus II,
declaring Corinth independent. In 243 BC Aratus of
Sicyon freed Corinth from the Macedonians (who
had regained control there), but in 222 BC he joined
with Antigonus III to defeat Cleomenes III of Sparta
at the battle of Sellasia.
In 221 BC Philip V became king of Macedonia
(see p. 78 for his campaigns). He became involved in
two Macedonian wars against Rome (in 215–205
and 200–197 BC). He was defeated at the battle of
Cynoscephalae in Thessaly in 197 BC, and harsh
penalties were imposed. Perseus became king of
Macedonia in 179 BC and fought the Third Mace-
donian War against the Romans (171–168 BC), in
which he was defeated. Macedonia was then divided

into four republics by Rome (167 BC), and it became
a Roman province in 148 BC after the defeat of the
pretender Andriscus. In 146 BC the actions of the
Achaean Confederacy led to Corinth being sacked
by Rome and the rest of Greece becoming part of
the Roman province of Macedonia. In the First
Mithridatic War against Rome, Mithridates VI of
Pontus liberated much of Greece, which led to the
Roman general Sulla besieging and sacking Athens
(86 BC).
SELEUCID SYRIA
The Ptolemies and Seleucids fought six Syrian wars,
mainly in the 3rd century BC, over possession of
Coele-Syria. Civil war was also waged between Seleu-
cus II and his younger brother Antiochus Hierax. In
the east the empire started to disintegrate, and Bactria
became an independent Greek kingdom c. 240 BC
(Map 2). In 223 BC Antiochus III became Seleucid
king (see p. 51 for his campaigns). He attempted to
conquer Syria and Palestine but was defeated at the
battle of Raphia by Ptolemy IV in 217 BC. Antiochus
emulated Alexander the Great in his expedition as far
as India and on his return, he and Philip V of Mace-
donia attacked Ptolemy V in the Fifth Syrian War
(202–195 BC), with the Seleucid Empire ﬁnally gain-
ing Coele-Syria. Antiochus invaded Greece and was
consequently attacked by the Romans and defeated in
189 BC at Magnesia ad Sipylum. In the Peace of
Apamea, Antiochus had to give up much of Asia
Minor, and the Seleucid Empire was no longer a
Mediterranean power.
Antiochus IV became king in 175 BC, and the
Sixth Syrian War against Egypt took place (170–168
BC), followed by a revolt of the Jews under Judas
Maccabaeus (from 167 BC). Numerous dynastic
struggles and civil wars followed, and in 64 BC Pom-
pey made Syria a Roman province at the end of the
Third Mithridatic War.

PTOLEMAIC EGYPT
Six Syrian wars were fought against the Seleucids,
and c. 202 BC Ptolemy lost Coele-Syria (Map 3). The
Ptolemies suffered from dynastic struggles from the
time of Ptolemy VI (170 BC). In 96 BC Cyrene was
bequeathed to Rome by Ptolemy Apion; it was made
a Roman province in 74 BC, with Crete becoming
part of the province in 67 BC. In 59 BC Ptolemy XII
ceded Cyprus to Rome. Cleopatra VII formed an
alliance with the Roman Mark Antony, which ended
in her suicide in 30 BC. Egypt, which had been
bequeathed to Rome in 87 BC, became the Roman
province of Aegyptus in 30 BC.
OTHER TERRITORIES
In 133 BC Attalus of Pergamum bequeathed his king-
dom to Rome, and it became the Roman province of
Asia in 129 BC (Map 4). Mithridates VI of Pontus
occupied much of Greece and Asia Minor and fought
three Mithridatic wars against Rome (88–63 BC).
When he committed suicide his kingdom became
part of the new Roman province of Bithynia et Pon-
tus (Bithynia had been bequeathed to Rome in 74 BC
by Nicomedes IV). Commagene, the last minor Hel-
lenistic kingdom, did not become part of the Roman
province of Syria until AD 72.

POPULATION
Citizens
In the Greek world adult males, not women, were
citizens (polites). The only public role a woman
played was in some aspects of religion. In Homer’s
time citizens were apparently male heads of house-
holds with many dependents, mainly women, other
relatives and slaves. From archaic times the polis
consisted of male citizens, as well as a large popula-
tion of women, slaves, dependent lower classes and
foreign residents. Most Greek states divided their
citizens into hereditary tribes (phylai, sing. phyle).
Dorian cities usually had three tribes and Ionian
cities four, some with identical names. Many citizens
also belonged to brotherhoods or clans known as
phratries (phratriai, sing. phratria), or patrai in some
states. Citizenship normally passed through the
father only, but Athens (followed by other states) leg-
islated that it should be through both parents. Not
every free adult male in a city-state was a citizen.
ATHENS
Every citizen belonged to a phratry (phratria), which
controlled his religious and social life, though not his
political life. A phratry usually consisted of one or
more gene (sing. genos—family or clan). The genos was
comprised of one or more families (usually aristo-
cratic) who claimed descent from a common ancestor.
Its members were gennetai, and they had exclusive
rights to certain priesthoods of important city cults.
Citizens were also divided into four traditional
Ionian tribes (phylai), in which membership was
hereditary: Geleontes, Aegicoreis, Argadeis and
Hopletes. Each of these four tribes was composed of
three trittyes (thirds)—a total of 12 trittyes.
C I V I L I Z A T I O N S ,  C I T Y- S T AT E S
A N D E M P I R E S

In the early 6th century BC Solon divided the male
citizens into four property classes, reﬂecting the sys-
tem of eligibility for military service, but assessing
them in terms of agricultural produce. The richest
were the pentakosiomedimnoi (500-bushel men whose
land produced 500 medimnoi of grain a year), then the
hippeis (equivalent to the cavalry and sufficiently
wealthy to own horses) and the zeugitai (equivalent to
hoplites); the remaining landless citizens were the
thetes. The nine archons and state treasurers came
from the highest two classes, not from the aristocratic
Eupatridae as previously. Minor magistracies and
membership in the boule could be held by the zeugi-
tai, while the thetes were eligible only for membership
in the Assembly and jury service, and could not hold
magistracies.
Cleisthenes undertook far-reaching political
reform in the late 6th century BC, breaking the
power of the aristocratic families. He changed the
division of Attica from the four Ionian tribes into 10
new artificial phylai named after local traditional
heroes (in their ofﬁcial order, they were: Erechtheis,
Aigeis, Pandionis, Leontis, Akamantis, Oineis,
Kekropis, Hippothontis, Aiantis and Antiochis). The
old tribes were retained for religious purposes. Each
new tribe (phyle) was composed of three units called
trittyes, making a total of 30 new trittyes. A trittys
itself was a group of demes (demoi) selected for the
phyle from three geographical regions of Attica: the
coast, the city (Athens, Piraeus, Phalerum and part of
the plain of Athens) and the inland. No phyle there-
fore had a continuous territory or local interest.
There were 139 or 140 demes (later about 170),
but no speciﬁc number of demes per trittys, as the
demes could vary greatly in size—anything between
one and seven demes per trittys. The word demos (pl.
demoi) generally denoted a village, but under Cleis-
thenes it became an artificial political division. In
Athens a deme probably constituted a ward of the
city, but elsewhere in Attica a deme contained one or
more centers of population—a town, village or sanc-
tuary. Each citizen was enrolled in one deme. Mem-
bership in a deme was hereditary and did not reﬂect
actual domicile. Every Athenian citizen subsequently
cited his deme as part of his name. Under Cleis-
thenes’ reforms, many freedmen and metics were
enrolled as citizens, and zeugitai became eligible for
election as strategoi. See also chapter 4 for Cleis-
thenes’ reforms.
Before 451 BC a citizen could have an Athenian
father but a mother from any state, as long as she was
of free birth. In 451 BC a law of Pericles restricted
citizenship to Athenian parentage on both sides, and
in the mid 4th century BC marriage to a noncitizen (a
foreigner) became illegal, with severe penalties.
Atimia was the loss of civic rights, either temporarily
or permanently, as punishment for an offense: the
citizen was stripped of political rights and could not
speak in a law court. Any noncitizen who exercised
the rights of a citizen was liable to prosecution under
graphe xenias (indictment for alienhood). If guilty,
they were sold into slavery and their property seized.
Many citizens at Athens (and probably elsewhere)
were peasants, who owned just a small amount of
land and farmed at subsistence level. Evidence for
peasants is limited, both in written records and from
archaeological evidence.
SPARTA
From early on, male Spartan children underwent a
harsh system of education (agoge) and lived commu-
nally from the age of seven (see chapter 3). At the age
of 20, they were eligible for election to syssita (sing.
syssiton); these were men’s clubs that formed the basis
of Spartan social and military life. They could live in
their own home but had to eat communally in the
syssita. These male citizens were the warrior or
hoplite class, regarded as homoioi (literally, similars
and often translated as equals). Some citizens were
excluded, such as those who had failed their military
training or were defeated in war. Citizens of Sparta
were called Spartiates (Spartiatai), also classiﬁed as
Lacedaemonians, along with the perioikoi. Each adult
citizen was given an allotment of land (kleros) to be
worked by helots, so that he could devote himself to
public and military service. Particularly with the lib-
eration of Messenia, many Spartan citizens became
so poor that they were reduced to the status of
hypomeiones (inferiors). There were also free nonciti-
zens (neodamodeis and mothakes), such as those who
had lost their citizenship and helots who had been
freed for good military service.
PROXENOS
A citizen had no rights in other cities, and so formal
friendship (xenia) was made between the cities. Local

citizens were appointed as proxenoi to look after the
interests of citizens from states with which they had
formal ties.
Women
Women were not regarded as citizens and had no
political rights. They were legally under the care of
their male relatives and played virtually no part in
the political and social system, except for a religious
function. Their role was primarily in the home, and
at times even confined to their own quarters. In
Sparta the family itself was devalued, and here
women had far more rights and greater freedom than
elsewhere. They were able to own land, which was
illegal at Athens, and some aristocratic women exer-
cised inﬂuence in politics, although only in a major
way from the Hellenistic period. Women of the royal
family in Macedonia could have immense power, and
marriages were often arranged for military or politi-
cal reasons. See also chapter 10.
Slaves
Imported slaves were common in many states. In
Attica, where slaves may have been as numerous as
free inhabitants, they served as a substitute for wage
labor. Many free inhabitants owned at least one slave,
with rich citizens owning large numbers. They could
be freed and given the same status as metics. Other
states such as Macedonia had no slaves. See also
chapter 10.
Serfs
In many states serfdom was common. In Attica serfs
were called hektemoroi (sixth-part men), because they
worked the land at a rent of one-sixth of their pro-
duce. They were not technically slaves but were
semiservile peasants or serfs, possibly bound to
landowners by debt. If they failed to pay their debts,
serfs could be sold into slavery. Solon reformed their
status by the seisakhtheia (shaking off the burdens),
which canceled their debts. In Thessaly the land was
owned by very few people who controlled many serfs
called penestai.
Helots
Sparta conquered and colonized neighboring Messe-
nia in the later 8th century BC. The land was shared
out equally in kleroi amongst the Spartiates and was
worked by the defeated Messenian population.
Messenian helots (heilotes) spoke Greek and were
serfs, not slaves owned by individual people. They
effectively performed the role of slaves and were very
important to the Spartan economy. They were
bound to the land and possibly had to surrender half
their produce to their masters. They could be manu-
mitted only by the state. They also provided lightly
armed soldiers (also called helots) for the army.
Every year the Spartan citizens formally declared war
on the helots. In 464 BC a serious revolt of the helots
began that lasted to 455 BC. In 369 BC the Messenian
helots were liberated, depriving the Spartan citizens
of their kleroi and the use of the helots. There was a
similar system of helots in other areas such as Crete,
where they may have been slaves.
Perioikoi
When city-states conquered neighboring territory,
the inhabitants could be regarded as perioeci (peri-
oikoi, dwellers round about)—free inhabitants but
not citizens. This occurred in places such as Crete,
Elis, Thessaly and Sparta. The perioikoi of the semi-
autonomous towns and villages around Sparta were
classiﬁed as Lacedaemonians, along with the Sparti-
ates. They provided troops for the Spartan army but
did not undertake the same training as the Spartiates.
They also conducted various trade and craft busi-
nesses since Spartiates were prohibited from such
work by their devotion to military matters. Perioeci
seem to have regarded their status as privileged.
Metics
In city-states about one-third of free inhabitants
could be noncitizens, including those foreign resi-
dents who had acquired the status of metics (metoikoi,
sing. metoikos, “one who dwells among”). A large and
often prosperous metic population resided at Athens.
Though they enjoyed full civil rights, metics had no
political rights and were not able to own land or
C I V I L I Z A T I O N S ,  C I T Y- S T AT E S
A N D E M P I R E S
29

houses in Attica or to legally marry citizens. They
were obliged to pay an annual poll tax (metoikion) and
to pay property tax (eisphora) at a slightly higher rate
than citizens. They undertook the normal duties of
citizenship, such as naval and military service and
liturgies, but had little chance of becoming full citi-
zens. Most metics at Athens engaged in commercial
and industrial activities, based largely at Piraeus.
Some metics were physicians, philosophers, sophists,
orators and poets.
Numbers
Population estimates are beset with difﬁculties, and
most information is for Athens where various kinds of
citizen lists were maintained. Life expectancy was
low, especially for women, who probably died at a
younger age than men. In the 5th century BC there
were about 45,000 adult male citizens in Athens, and
about 30,000 in the 4th century BC. Other contem-
porary cities probably had about half this number or
less. In Sparta the ratio between Spartan citizens and
helots may have been one to seven, and the ratio
between citizens and perioeci seems to have been
equal. When land was divided amongst the Spartiates
(possibly by Lycurgus or later), there were apparently
9,000 lots (kleroi), indicating 9,000 citizens. At the
end of the Persian Wars (479 BC), there were about
8,000 full Spartan citizens. The number dropped dra-
matically in the following decades, probably through
continuous warfare and the earthquake around
465/464 BC. By the battle of Leuctra (371 BC), the
number of male citizens at Sparta seems to have been
around 1,500, though 400 more died in that battle.
By the end of the Hellenistic period, the free popula-
tion of Alexandria was 300,000, but it is unclear if
women and children were included in this ﬁgure. An
estimate of 30–35 million people has been made for
the population of the entire Hellenistic world.
GOVERNMENT
Many city-states had a king, council and assembly,
although over time the type of government changed.
Types of Government
MONARCHY
The earliest type of known government is monarchy
(basileia), rule by a king (a basileus), often with a coun-
cil of advisers surrounding the king. It dates to the
Dark Age and earlier, such as the Mycenean system
with its king (wanax), but in many places may have
been more an aristocracy than a hereditary monar-
chy. A form of the word basileus is found on Linear B
tablets as qa-si-re-u, possibly meaning more speciﬁ-
cally an overseer. Evidence for a hereditary kingship
exists for some states, such as Corinth, Messenia,
Sparta and Sicyon, but the monarchy virtually disap-
peared in the 8th century BC, evolving into an aris-
tocracy. In the Classical period, rule by kingship was
only known from myths and in barbarian areas.
At Sparta a hereditary dyarchy (rule by two
kings) survived. It may have originated from two
separate communities that had combined by agree-
ment. There was often friction between the two
kings, especially over succession. The kings com-
manded the army (not the navy) in war, although
occasionally the Spartans chose other commanders.
They also held certain judicial powers and enjoyed
some privileges, though there were no palaces, and
they were expected to eat communally with the
other Spartiates.
Macedonia also had a hereditary monarchy, dat-
ing from c. 650 BC, with Perdiccas I being the ﬁrst
recorded Temenid king from Argos in the Pelopon-
nese. The Macedonian kings were also the military
leaders. There is no evidence for a Council of Elders,
but instead the king had various advisers: hetairoi
(Companions), philoi (Friends) and hegemones (Com-
manders). The hetairoi, who were probably aristo-
crats, served as advisers, performed important
military functions, and rode in the elite cavalry
(Companion Cavalry). The sons of leading Compan-
ions became Royal Pages (basilikoi paides). Numerous
monarchies were established throughout Alexander
the Great’s newly conquered Empire in the late 4th
century BC, including the Ptolemies in Egypt and the
Seleucids in Asia. Monarchy then became the main
form of government in the Greek world, and king-
worship was encouraged. Philosophers were wel-
comed to the Hellenistic courts, and most schools of
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
30

philosophy wrote treatises entitled On Kingship in
order to justify the system of monarchy.
SATRAPY
Persian provincial governors were called satraps, in
effect vassal kings, the word satrap meaning literally
“guardian of the land.” Alexander the Great pre-
served this system of government by satraps in his
newly conquered territories. Satraps were responsi-
ble for collecting tribute, as under the former Per-
sian system, although in larger satrapies separate
officials were in charge of taxation. In Egypt he
placed a nomarch in charge of civil administration.
ARISTOCRACY
“The rule of the best,” originally the nobles, seems
to have been the prevalent method of rule in the
Dark Age and earlier. In the poleis the aristocrats
replaced the monarchy, if one had existed. They
formed the knights or cavalry (hippeis), owned most
of the land and ruled the city-states through a coun-
cil. After the 8th century BC, they lost their power
due to changing military tactics—strength and supe-
riority in war no longer lay with them, but with the
hoplite soldiers. New sources of wealth also enabled
more people to acquire the same status as the old
aristocracy, who instead became the oligarchy. The
overthrow of the aristocracy usually led to the estab-
lishment of a tyranny.
TYRANNY
A common form of monarchical government in the
7th and 6th centuries BC was rule by tyrants (“Age
of the Tyrants”). The word tyrannos is non-Indo-
European, probably of eastern origin and meaning
“king.” It did not mean a brutal dictator, as it would
today. The tyrants were often wealthy and ambitious
leaders, who seized power unconstitutionally, usually
by overthrowing oppressive aristocratic govern-
ments. With the wealth of a city at their disposal,
many tyrants were patrons of the arts and of festivals.
Rule by tyrants occurred in many of the major city-
states, particularly near the Isthmus of Corinth,
including Corinth, Megara, Sicyon, Athens, Myti-
lene, Miletus and Samos. Tyrants included Cypselus,
Periander, Polycrates, Cleisthenes, Peisistratus and
Pheidon. The last tyrants of this period were Theron,
Gelon and Hieron in Sicily. Thessaly, Boeotia and
Sparta never had tyrannies, and Athens avoided one
until the mid-6th century BC. From the 5th century
BC, the concept of tyranny implied a reign of terror
and the worst form of government, and tyrannies
usually fell to oligarchies. The later tyrants in Asia
Minor and Sicily were military dictators and forerun-
ners of a new age of monarchy.
An aisymnetes (pl. aisymnetai) was a type of tyrant
or dictator, such as Pittacus of Mytilene, elected for
life or a speciﬁed period by a city-state in a time of
crisis. Magistrates in some city-states were also called
aisymnetai.
OLIGARCHY
The “rule of the few” developed from the old aristoc-
racies, with wealth not birth as the deciding factor.
Particularly when tyrannies were overthrown, politi-
cal power was still with a minority of wealthy people.
Although many full citizens were present in an oli-
garchy, they still did not have full political rights (such
as voting). The oligarchic system was a common form
of constitution, although it could differ from state to
state. The political power of the oligarchs was usually
vested in a council, such as the Areopagus.
The number of oligarchs could be limited to a
fixed total. In 411 BC the Four Hundred was an
extremist revolutionary oligarchic council established
to rule Athens and overthrow the democrats. When
the council of the Four Hundred was overthrown, an
oligarchic council of Five Thousand was instituted
(the franchise being extended to 5,000 citizens). In
410 BC full democracy was restored. At the end of the
Peloponnesian War (404 BC), the oligarchs again
controlled Athens. Thirty oligarchs were elected to
draw up a new constitution, but they seized power
and set up a new council under their control. A reign
of terror ensued under these “Thirty Tyrants,” but
they were deposed by moderate oligarchs in 403 BC.
Full democracy was restored later that year.
DEMOCRACY
Demokratia is rule (kratos) of the people (demos).
Although democracy is usually supposed to have
C I V I L I Z A T I O N S ,  C I T Y- S T AT E S
A N D E M P I R E S
31

originated with Solon at Athens, examples of the
people having power are found in other city-states
from an earlier date, such as in archaic Sparta.
Democracy at Athens meant that every full citizen
(that is, not slaves, foreigners or women) had the
right to be a juror, vote in the Assembly and be
elected to any state ofﬁce. The word “democracy”
had not been invented by the time of Cleisthenes
(late 6th century BC). Eunomia (good order) was
replaced with the word isonomia, meaning “equal
order” or political equality. This was the ﬁrst word to
indicate democracy. In the time of Pericles, the word
demokratia replaced the word isonomia to describe the
political status of Athens, incorporating ideas of law,
freedom and equality. There was no word for politics
or politician, but in 4th-century BC Athens they were
referred to as “orators and generals.” There were no
organized political parties. In a democracy the peo-
ple in the assembly made the decisions, which were
proposed and carried out by magistrates and the
council. The people also acted as jurors in law courts.
Prehistoric Government
The earliest known political system in the Greek
world was centered on the palaces of Crete and later
the mainland. Operating independently, each palace
center seems to have controlled the surrounding
countryside. Clay tablets reveal that the palaces were
centers for the reception and storage of produce, and
that they probably housed a major ofﬁcial. Linear B
texts from Mycenaean palace sites show that the
wanax was the most important figure in the state
(possibly the king), followed by a lawagetas. The
palaces, however, were not necessarily the headquar-
ters of a ruler, and the earliest form of government
may not always have been a monarchy. The term
basileus (pl. basileis) found in later texts may mean a
hereditary aristocrat rather than a king. In Homer the
top of society consisted of elite warriors called heroes,
who were chieftains (basileis) of one or more villages.
Poleis
In the Archaic and Classical periods the Greek world
was divided into a number of sometimes very small
self-governing independent states called in Greek
poleis (sing. polis, city), which increased in number
due to colonization. A polis consisted of a city sur-
rounded by countryside. The population lived in the
countryside and in the city. The political system (or
politics) was actually the membership, organization
and function of a polis undertaken only by male citi-
zens, and the government of the polis was concen-
trated entirely in the city. After the conquests of
Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC, the
poleis lost much of their autonomy.
The governments of the hundreds of city-states
were not standardized. They usually started with
monarchy (or aristocracy), then tyranny, and then
democracy or oligarchy. Usually each polis had a
council, assembly and magistrates, with a public
gathering place (agora). In tribal areas of Greece, the
ethnos (tribe) was the main form of social organiza-
tion, rather than the polis. See also chapter 4 for
poleis and chapter 6 for towns in general.
Athens
The government of Athens originally consisted of a
king, a council of advisers and probably an assembly.
The king was replaced by archons, and the council
(Areopagus) was later joined by a second council
(known as the boule). In Attica, Cleisthenes under-
took extensive political reform in the late 6th century
BC, breaking the power of the aristocratic families.
Each deme formed the local administrative unit, with
a local government and responsibility for maintain-
ing citizen lists; its chief ofﬁcial was the demarkhos.
Cleisthenes also created (or reformed) the boule, and
subordinated its role and that of the Areopagus to
that of the ekklesia (Assembly). The government of
Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC had much
influence on other city-states and is most well
known. See also chapter 4 for Cleisthenes’ reforms.
Sparta
Sparta became a warrior state, with two kings, ﬁve
annually elected ephors, a council of elders (gerousia),
over which the ﬁrst ephor presided, and an assembly
of the citizens (apella). The inhabitants had three
H A N D B O O K

I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
32

types of recognized status—citizens of Sparta (Spar-
tiates), perioikoi (noncitizens from surrounding vil-
lages) and helots from Messenia.
Boeotia
From about the 6th century BC a federal system
existed in Boeotia, but this Boeotian Confederacy
was disbanded after it had sided with the Persians in
the early 5th century BC. In 447 BC Boeotia reconsti-
tuted the federal oligarchic constitution amongst its
various cities. It was the ﬁrst type of federal govern-
ment. There were 11 poleis, some incorporating
smaller settlements. Each possessed a local boule
(council), which varied in size according to the size of
population. The boule was split into four, so that
only one-quarter of the councillors sat at any one
time. For the federal government there were also 11
wards (which did not equate exactly with the poleis;
for example, Thebes comprised four wards). Each
ward supplied one magistrate (boiotarkhos), as well as
60 councillors for the federal Council of 660. The
Council met on the Cadmea of Thebes. When
Thebes was destroyed the federal system was again
reconstituted but largely for religious purposes.
Councils, Assemblies 
and Magistrates
COUNCIL
The boule was originally a council of nobles advising
the king. In an aristocracy and oligarchy it was the
most powerful body, but it was subordinate to the
assembly in a democracy. The councillors were
bouleutai.
In Athens the boule was originally the council
known as the Areopagus, but it was replaced by a sec-
ond boule in the 6th century BC (possibly by Solon,
but reformed by Cleisthenes at the end of the cen-
tury). This new boule at ﬁrst consisted of 400 male
citizens (Council of Four Hundred), 100 from each
of the four traditional tribes. From the time of Cleis-
thenes it consisted of 500 male citizens over 30 years
old (Council of Five Hundred), 50 from each of the
10 new tribes (phylai). They were appointed annually
by the demes of Athens and Attica in proportion to
the deme population size (between 1 and 22 per
deme). They could not serve more than twice in
their lifetime. After the early 4th century BC, the
number of councillors varied, and by the 4th century
AD there were 300. The boule was originally elected
and unpaid, but from c. 450 BC the councillors were
chosen by lot, 50 from each tribe, and were paid sub-
sistence rates. They were paid from c. 411 BC, at a
rate of ﬁve obols a day in the late 4th century BC.
During one-tenth of the year the 50 representa-
tives from each of the 10 tribes served as a group of
presidents (prytaneis) or an executive committee of
the boule. This period of time was known as a pry-
tany (prytaneia)—anything between 34 and 39 days
in length. Each day one person out of the 50 was
chosen by lot to be president (epistates) of any meet-
ings of the boule and also chairman of the Assembly.
The boule met daily except on festivals and unlucky
days. During the oligarchic revolution at Athens
(411–404 BC), the boule was replaced by oligarchic
councils, but was subsequently restored and contin-
ued into the Roman period. From the late 4th cen-
tury BC proedroi (chairmen) instead of prytaneis
presided over the boule.
The council prepared all proposals or prelimi-
nary motions (probouleumata) for the Assembly and
implemented decisions of the Assembly (which were
delegated to boards of officials). It also received
embassies and undertook the everyday affairs of the
state, such as controlling public ﬁnance and admin-
istering public buildings. It was responsible for cer-
tain religious cults and sacrifices and had some
judicial functions. The bouleuterion was the council
chamber, where the boule normally met (ﬁg. 1.11).
A meeting and feasting hall for the prytaneis was next
to the new bouleuterion at Athens (built 5th century
BC), called the tholos (rotunda) because of its circu-
lar shape.
AREOPAGUS
The council of aristocratic advisers that originally
advised the king in Athens was known simply as the
council (boule). It came to be known as the Areopa-
gus, as it sometimes met on the Areios pagos (hill of
Ares), just west of the Acropolis (fig. 4.8). As the
monarchy declined the Areopagus became more
C I V I L I Z A T I O N S ,  C I T Y- S T AT E S
A N D E M P I R E S
33

powerful, and by the 7th century BC it was the main
body of government and was responsible for murder
trials. It was composed entirely of ex-archons, who
were Eupatridae (Eupatridai), the aristocracy of
Athens. The Eupatridae may have been a hereditary
ruling class, although it could just refer to “nobles.”
The Areopagus had a membership of about 200–300
citizens.
In the late 6th century BC Solon reformed the
constitution, and any wealthy person could be an
archon. After a year of ofﬁce, these people joined the
Areopagus, so that the power of the Eupatridae was
gradually broken. Solon may also have created the
second council (boule), which was reformed by
Cleisthenes. The Areopagus remained a powerful
body until the Persian Wars, but its powers were
restricted by Ephialtes in 462 BC, after which it
retained jurisdiction only in homicide and adminis-
tration of sacred property. The Areopagus still
existed in the 4th century AD, with a membership of
31 chosen by the Roman proconsul.
GEROUSIA
The gerousia, a council of elders (gerontes), was the
only council at Sparta. Its 30 members included two
kings and 28 gerontes who had to be over 60 years of
age and from certain aristocratic families. These
elders were elected for life in a similar way to ephors,
although later the ofﬁce was annual. Little is known
of the precise functions of the gerousia, although it
did try cases involving the kings, exile, death or
atimia (loss of civic rights), and it probably prepared
proposals for the assembly (apella) and could veto
decisions of the apella. City councils in Hellenistic
towns of Asia Minor were also called gerousiai.
ASSEMBLY
The state assembly was called an ecclesia (ekklesia). It
was the ultimate ruling body in most Greek poleis. In
some states it was called a halia, haliaia, agora or
apella. An assembly was open to all male citizens of a
polis, although membership could be subject to qual-
iﬁcations such as age and wealth. Most assemblies
met in the agora, where they considered and decided
upon foreign policy, military and ﬁnancial issues, and
legislation.
The Assembly of Athens changed its character
with the development toward democracy, and it
became the main political body there. All adult male
citizens over 18 years of age were entitled to attend,
speak and vote. Attendance was normally over 5,000
in the 5th century BC. It usually met on the Pnyx,
which was a low hill west of the Acropolis (Map 12)
This could hold about 6,000—not the entire male
citizen population. From c. 403 BC the Pnyx was
remodeled and could house about 6,500. There is no
evidence for seats. From the late 4th century BC, the
Assembly met in the theater of Dionysus, which had
seats. Meetings also took place in the agora if a ballot
was required. Voting was usually by a show of hands,
or by pebbles (psephoi) as ballots.

Meetings of the Assembly were summoned by the
boule. By the 4th century BC there were four regular
meetings in each prytany (40 per year), with extra
meetings if necessary. Payment for attendance was
introduced after 400 BC. Initially one obol per meet-
ing, the fee reached six obols by 327 BC, with nine
obols for the main meeting in each prytany.
The Assembly considered business that had been
prepared by the boule, and no decree (psephisma) or
law (nomos) could be passed without prior delibera-
tion (probouleusis) before the boule. The agenda for
each meeting was partly dictated by law, with several
routine issues coming up regularly, such as food sup-
ply, defense of the state and religious matters. It had
the right to depose magistrates and generals. From
the 4th century BC, laws and decrees were separated.
Laws were revised by nomothetai (lawgivers), while
the Assembly could only issue decrees (psephismata)
that were in accordance with the established law.
Indictments were made for proposing decrees con-
trary to law (graphe paranomon).
Leading ﬁgures became dominant in the Assembly
and could wield much inﬂuence, such as Pericles who
was elected strategos for many successive years. The
death of Pericles led to the rise of demagogues (“lead-
ers of the people”), who were usually wealthy and
aristocratic, but who introduced a populist style of
oratory. The term demagogue did not carry derogatory
overtones, as it does today. The individual demes at
Athens also had an assembly, called the agora, which
all adult citizens could attend. The principal ofﬁcer
was the demarch (demarchos), who was selected by lot.
Many of his responsibilities were religious in nature.
At Sparta and elsewhere there was a festival of
Apollo called Apellai. At Sparta people from the sur-
rounding countryside gathered for this monthly festi-
val, after which an assembly of Spartiates was held,
now termed the apella. From the 5th century BC the
meetings were presided over by one of the ephors.
The apella could not initiate proposals, but decided on
proposals from the gerousia. It could elect ephors and
members of the gerousia; appoint military comman-
ders; decide on disputed royal successions, peace, war
and treaties; and approve the emancipation of helots.
It also had to approve any proposed changes in the
law. The members of the apella did not include all the
Spartan citizens, as there were also birth and wealth
qualiﬁcations.
Voting
The assembly at Sparta (the apella) usually voted by
shouting or acclamation (boa), and very rarely by
division. The most common method of voting in
city-states (such as in the Athenian Assembly) was by
a show of hands (kheirotonia), which was estimated;
pebbles (psephoi) were used if a secret ballot was
required. Sortition or lot (klerosis) was a method of
choosing magistrates in many democratic city-states;
it was introduced for choosing archons at Athens in
487/486 BC.
Ostracism
This was a method of banishing prominent citizens
for 10 years from Attica without conﬁscation of prop-
erty or loss of political rights. The people voted
whether an ostracism (ostrakismos) should be held. It
took place without debate in the agora under the
supervision of the archons and the boule. There did
not need to be an allegation of misconduct. Ostrako-
phoria was the voting by potsherds. A citizen wrote the
name of the person he wished to banish on a potsherd
(ostrakon, ﬁg. 1.12) or piece of broken tile or brick. It
seems that if more than 6,000 ostraka were cast, the
man with the largest vote was banished within 10 days
for 10 years. Alternatively, banishment may have
occurred only if at least 6,000 ostraka had been cast
against one man. Political factions worked to inﬂu-
ence the vote, often by supplying voters with ostraka
that already had the name of the person inscribed.
The same hand has been recognized on many ostraka.
Ostracism may have been introduced by Cleis-
thenes in 508/507 BC, although it was not used until
487 BC, and only sparingly from 482 BC. Those ostra-
cized include Hipparchus (a relative of the tyrant
Hippias) in 487 BC, Megacles (486 BC), Xanthippus
(484 BC), Aristides (482 BC), Themistocles (c. 470
BC), Cimon (461 BC) and Thucydides (443 BC). The
last person to be ostracized was Hyperbolus (c. 416
BC), after which the system fell into disuse, as graphe
paranomon was a more effective way of attacking
politicians.
Over 12,000 ostraka have been found in excava-
tions in the agora and Kerameikos, some with names
of unknown politicians, and some with abusive

comments and caricatures. Ostracism also took
place in Argos, Megara and Miletus, while at Syra-
cuse there was a method called petalism, because
names were written on olive leaves ( petala). See also
PUNISHMENTS, p. 39.

Magistrates were usually elected annually and were
not eligible for reelection; instead they often became
life members of the city-state’s council. In a democ-
racy magistrates had no real political power, only an
executive role, and were obliged to carry out decrees
of the people. There could be hundreds of different
magistrates and public ofﬁcials in a city-state, many
serving on boards of three, five, 10 or more men.
They included, for example, 10 metronomoi (mea-
sures ofﬁcers) who tested weights and measures, 5
agoranomoi (supervisors of the market) and 20 (origi-
nally 10) sitophylakes (grain inspectors) who pre-
vented overpricing of grain, ﬂour and bread. Many
officials such as finance officers were elected and
received no pay, but lower ofﬁcials received salaries.
Candidates for ofﬁce in Athens were subject to prior
scrutiny (dokimasia) to ensure eligibility, and on leav-
ing ofﬁce they were subject to review (euthyna) by
the accountants (logistai). In addition, there were
numerous clerical assistants serving the boards. The
key posts were ﬁlled by lot or election, while lower
posts could be ﬁlled by slaves. In the early 4th cen-
tury BC it was forbidden to serve twice as an under-
secretary on the same board.
In the Hellenistic period, magistrates were paid
professionals; the highest posts were held by Greeks
and the lower posts by natives. A hierarchical,
bureaucractic system existed, especially in Egypt.
ARCHONS
Archons (arkhontes, rulers) were holders of the high-
est magistracies in city-states in central Greece,
including Athens, and they had wide executive and
judicial duties. When Athens ceased to be a monar-
chy (possibly 11th century BC), the religious, military
and judicial duties of the king were shared among
three archons: the arkhon basileus (king archon), ar-
khon eponymos (eponymous archon) and the polemar-
khos (polemarch). The archon basileus assumed the
king’s duties, was responsible for some religious cer-
emonies and presided over the Areopagus. The pole-
march’s original function was to command the army,
but this power was lost to the strategoi after 487 BC,
when archons were appointed by lot. Instead, the
polemarch assumed certain religious functions and
legal duties concerning non-Athenian citizens. The
name of the eponymous archon was used to date the
year. Until 487 BC he was the principal magistrate
and nominal head of state. His legal duties were
extensive, and he was also responsible for the Pana-
thenaea and Dionysia festivals.
Archons in Athens may have originally been
elected for life from the aristocracy, but there is evi-
dence to suggest that their terms were eventually
reduced to 10 years, and then to one year from 682
BC. Later, the post of archon could be held only once.
All ex-archons became members of the Areopagus for
life. The number of archons was increased, with the

addition of six junior archons called thesmothetai (lit-
erally “law-makers”), who were originally judicial
ofﬁcials. Archons were originally elected from the
Eupatridae, but from the time of Solon the magis-
tracy was open to other wealthy citizens. This system
failed, and political factions (hetairiai) developed in
different parts of Attica, with the formation of the
Pedieis (plainsmen), Paraloi (coastmen) and later the
Hyperakrioi or Diakrioi (hillmen). Eventually, this
led to the tyranny of Peisistratus, which lasted until
the late 6th century BC.
From 487 BC archons were chosen annually by
lot since they were no longer politically important.
Their number was increased to 10, with the addition
of a secretary of the thesmothetai, possibly as part of
the reforms of Cleisthenes. Archon lists began to be
published from 683 BC, although there is doubt
about the accuracy of dates before 594/593 BC.
Anarkhia was the term given to a year when no
archon was elected because of conﬂict. In Macedonia
a deputy was appointed as ruler (arkhon) when the
king went abroad to campaign.
STRATEGOI
From 501/500 BC a board of 10 generals (strategoi,
sing. strategos) was elected by the Assembly from each
of the new tribes at Athens, which must have reduced
the power of the polemarch. Originally, strategoi
were probably a board of military advisers, but from
487 BC they replaced the polemarch as military com-
manders. Strategoi also acquired importance as polit-
ical leaders, particularly in the Assembly. They also
seem to have been able to attend meetings of the
boule. They were elected annually and could be
reelected immediately. From the 4th century BC they
were apparently professional soldiers who took little
part in politics. In the Hellenistic period strategoi
were officials with extensive military and political
power in the Aetolian and Achaean Confederacies.
In Egypt a strategos was the governor of a district
(nomos), assisted by many ofﬁcials.
EPHORS
Ephor (pl. ephoroi) was the name given to a magistrate
in several Dorian states, particularly Sparta. Ephors
may have originally been servants of the king. By at
least the late 5th century BC, there was a board of ﬁve
ephors at Sparta, elected annually by the apella. They
were not eligible for reelection. The senior ephor
gave his name to the year. Ephors traditionally con-
trolled the conduct of the two kings, settled disputes
between them and even prosecuted them before the
gerousia. On campaigns a king was accompanied by
two ephors. They presided over the gerousia and
apella, and negotiated foreign treaties and received
foreign envoys. In the 5th and 4th centuries BC they
undertook much everyday state business. The ofﬁce
survived to at least AD 200.
BOEOTARCH
From 447 BC Boeotia reconstituted its federal type of
government. There were 11 wards, each of which
supplied one magistrate (boiotarkhos, leader of the
Boeotians). These boeotarchs served as executive
magistrates and as military commanders.
TAGOS
The tagos was the chief magistrate of Thessaly, a civil
and military leader. At times the tageia (office of
tagos) was left vacant, and it ceased to exist when a
new Thessalian Confederacy was formed c. 369 BC.
After this time the chief magistrate was an archon.
LAW
Lawmaking
Law and justice were essential elements of the polis,
and each city made its own laws, many of which
were probably similar, although each polis remained
independent. There was no police force, but at
Athens and other city-states publicly owned slaves
were put at the disposal of particular magistrates so
that they could be used, for example, to keep order
at public meetings. Most information about law
derives from Classical Athens, although generally
evidence is lacking.
The most common word for law in the 5th cen-
tury BC was nomos, meaning law or custom, while
C I V I L I Z A T I O N S ,  C I T Y- S T AT E S
A N D E M P I R E S

eunomia meant law and order. In the Archaic Age,
law was removed from the control of the aristocrats
by the establishment of written law codes, which
magistrates had to follow. Previously, laws were
unwritten. These law codes were made by one law-
giver (nomothetes, pl. nomothetai), although later laws
were made by the whole community. Lawgivers,
some of whom were legendary, included Zaleucus,
Charondas, Draco and Solon. Solon (eponymous
archon at Athens in 594/593 BC) apparently rewrote
all Draco’s laws and established a complete code of
laws that served as the basis of the Athenian legal sys-
tem for at least 300 years and continued to be known
as the laws of Solon. It covered all areas of the law
(civil, criminal and religious) and was revised at the
end of the 5th century BC.
Written laws were often inscribed on stone. Crete
seems to have been the earliest place to have had
unwritten laws and then to codify them in writing.
The ﬁrst written laws in a Greek city were suppos-
edly drawn up by Zaleucus c. 650 BC in Locri
Epizephyrii in southern Italy, but the earliest surviv-
ing written law is from Drerus in Crete (late 7th cen-
tury BC). Many colonies also had written law codes at
an early date. At Athens, the ﬁrst written laws were
due to Draco, c. 621/620 BC. The axones (axles) were
vertically revolving shafts or pillars on which Draco
and Solon’s laws were written in Athens. They were
originally wooden and were square or triangular in
cross-section. They were on permanent display in
the Prytaneum for everyone to read, and were later
inscribed on stone. Similar axones seem to have
been used elsewhere. Treaties between states were
often recorded on stelai, copies of which could be
placed in the religious centers of the states involved.
Throughout the 5th century BC, new laws and
decrees were made in the ekklesia (Assembly), but
Athens appointed a commission of citizens known as
nomothetai in 410 BC to comprehensively revise its
laws; the work was interrupted by the oligarchic rev-
olution but was completed in 400/399 BC. The laws
were inscribed on stone walls set up in the Stoa
Basileos (ofﬁce of the archon basileus). These new
laws lasted until the overthrow of democracy by the
Macedonians (322 BC).
The Athenian Assembly (ekklesia) continued to
pass decrees ( psephisma) that sometimes had the
effect of laws. After 403/402 BC, laws and decrees
were kept distinct, and revision of laws was under-
taken by nomothetai. From the 4th century BC, if a
decree contrary to established law was proposed in
the Assembly, the proposer could be indicted on the
charge of graphe paranomon (accusation of contraven-
ing the law). The proposed decree was suspended
until the case was heard in court. Graphe paranomon
was ﬁrst recorded in 415 BC and was used frequently
in the 4th century BC in place of ostracism.
Sparta never had a written law code. However,
the earliest surviving political constitution known as
the Rhetra or Great Rhetra (7th century BC) is from
Sparta. It may have been the work of the lawgiver
Lycurgus, and was allegedly brought back from Del-
phi as an oracle concerning the gerousia.
In Athens orators (rhetores) were not ofﬁce-holders,
but anyone who proposed decrees in the Assembly or
boule, proposed laws before the nomothetai or sup-
ported action in the law courts. Professional orators
such as Demosthenes were in effect politicians, who
debated public cases before the law courts.
Law Courts
Jurisdiction is best documented at Athens, where it
was performed by a variety of courts, councils and
ofﬁcials. Over 100 Athenian lawcourt speeches have
survived, though rarely those of the opponent, and
rarely is the outcome known.
Originally, cases were tried by one or more
archons (including the thesmothetai). The Areopagus
tried cases of murder, arson and wounding. Ephetai
tried cases of unintentional killing and killing of
noncitizens; they consisted of a board of 51 citizens
over the age of 50, and served under the presidency
of the archon basileus. One advance in the adminis-
tration of justice was Solon’s introduction of a right
of appeal against the decision of a magistrate.
Appeals were heard by a court of appeal known as the
heliaia, which may have originally been the Assembly.
This appeal court probably evolved into a jury court.
Trial by juries (instead of by magistrates) was insti-
tuted in the 5th century BC, with different size juries
for different cases (anything from 200 to 1,000 or
more jurors, so preventing bribery). By the 4th cen-
tury BC odd numbers of jurors were used to avoid a
tie in voting. Each year a list of 6,000 jurors was
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
38

drawn up who could be called on for jury service. Eli-
gible jurors were given a token (pinakion, pl. pinakia)
of wood or bronze. On the token was inscribed the
person’s name, deme and an alphabetical letter. If he
wished to serve as a juror, he placed the token in an
allotment machine (kleroterion), which randomly allo-
cated where he should sit that day. Payment for jury
service was introduced by Pericles to encourage vol-
unteers for jury service; originally this was probably
two obols a day, and by 425 BC it was increased to
three obols, probably on the proposal of Cleon, but
this was still less than the pay of a working man, so
elderly non-working people tended to be jurors.
Almost all jurisdiction was taken over by these jury
courts, which were known as dicasteries (dikasteria,
sing. dikasterion). The same word was used for a juror
and a judge—dikastes (pl. dikastai). Magistrates could
impose ﬁnes up to a certain limit, beyond which the
case had to be tried before a jury. Archons and other
magistrates had the responsibility to act as chairmen
of the courts in speciﬁc cases, but not to act as judges.
For example, strategoi were in charge of military and
naval cases, the polemarch in cases involving nonciti-
zens, the archon basileus in religious cases and homi-
cide, and the thesmothetai in general cases. Many
minor magistrates were involved in speciﬁc matters
such as the markets. The heliaia was now the law
court of the thesmothetai, not a court of appeal. The
Areopagus conducted investigations leading to trials
in the dicasteries, and the boule took over the role of
the Areopagus in investigating illegal behavior of
magistrates.
For most offenses in Athens there was no public
prosecutor. Solon introduced two classes of action: a
private case brought by the aggrieved person, often
called a dike (pl. dikai, case), and a public case
brought by an individual on behalf of the entire
community. The latter was often called graphe, as it
probably once had to be put in writing to the thes-
mothetai. There was some abuse of the system, and it
was often manipulated by political rivals and ora-
tors. Some public cases brought great financial
reward to the accuser (prosecutor). Compensation
could also be paid to the accuser in private cases. To
encourage citizens to bring public prosecutions,
ﬁnancial reward was given if the case was successful.
Penalties were also imposed if an accuser dropped a
case after starting it, or if it failed to win one-ﬁfth of
the jurors’ votes. These penalties discouraged mis-
use of the proceedings, particularly by sycophants
(sykophantai) who frequently brought prosecutions
for reasons such as personal reward, especially in the
5th century BC.
In murder cases the nearest male relative had to
bring a prosecution. Before the main trial of a private
case, an objection could be heard that the prosecu-
tion was inadmissible as it was contrary to the law.
This procedure was known as paragraphe and was
introduced c. 400 BC. Many private cases were sub-
ject to arbitration (diaita) prior to the jury trial. An
ofﬁcial system of arbitration was introduced in 399
BC, using citizens over 60 years of age as arbitrators
(diaitetai). If either litigant did not agree with the
verdict of the arbitrators, the case could still go to
jury trial.
In a trial the accuser and accused had the same
amount of time to speak, measured by a water clock
(klepsydra). Lawyers were not allowed to speak on
their behalf, although a professional speechwriter
could be employed. The accuser spoke ﬁrst, then the
accused (or the nearest adult male relative if the
accused was a woman or a child). No matter how
serious the charge, all trials took place on a single day
only. Witnesses could be called in the allotted time
(not women, children or slaves). Written evidence of
slaves was admissible only usually if they had been
tortured. The jury voted immediately without dis-
cussion or summing up and without any direction
from the judge. There was no appeal. They voted by
placing pebbles or shells (later bronze disks) in urns
to indicate conviction or acquittal. In some cases
they could also vote on the type of penalty.
Punishments
Punishments were usually ﬁnes, exile, loss of civic
rights, conﬁscation of property or death. For some
offenses, the punishment was laid down by law.
Imprisonment was rarely used, except for those
awaiting trial or execution. Although people could
be exiled from their native home as a punishment,
often for homicide, the same word could also mean
“to ﬂee”—that is, from an unwelcome situation. See
also Ostracism, p. 35. Execution could also take place
for crimes such as homicide and temple robbery.

BIOGRAPHIES
Until the late 8th century BC, it is difﬁcult to be cer-
tain about the authenticity of people in Greek his-
tory. Some legends are based on fact, but others are
mythological, ﬁctional accounts. Before this period
many of the legendary ﬁgures are Greek heroes such
as Odysseus, who are mythological creations with
some possible basis in truth.
Following are the main characters of Greek his-
tory, listed under the name by which they are most
commonly known, followed by the transliteration of
their original Greek name in italics (even where
spelled the same).
Achaeus (Akhaios):
Died 213 BC. He was a sup-
porter of Seleucus II against Antiochus Hierax. In
223 BC he accompanied Seleucus III on an expedition
to regain Seleucid territory lost to Attalus of Perga-
mum, but Seleucus III was murdered. Achaeus subse-
quently supported Antiochus III (successor of Attalus)
as king, who appointed him governor of Seleucid
Asia. In 220 BC Achaeus revolted and proclaimed
himself king of Phrygia. In 216 BC Antiochus block-
aded him in Sardis, and in 213 BC Achaeus was caught
trying to escape and was executed.
Aeschines (Aiskhines):
Lived c. 390–c. 322 BC. Born
in Athens, he became an orator and great rival of
Demosthenes. Only three of his speeches survive.
Faced with Macedonian expansion by Philip II,
Aeschines was sent in 346 (possibly 348) BC by Eubu-
lus to Arcadia to propose a Common Peace amongst
Greek states, so that no state would ask the Macedo-
nians for military support. When this failed, Aeschines
and Demosthenes were sent to make peace with Philip
II, which was agreed upon in 346 BC (Peace of Philo-
crates). Along with an associate Timarchus, Demos-
thenes prosecuted Aeschines in 346/345 BC for
accepting bribes from Philip II. Aeschines retaliated
with Against Timarchus, a speech in which he invoked
a law forbidding those guilty of misconduct from
addressing the Assembly. In 343 BC Demosthenes
continued his prosecution of Aeschines (as if Aeschines
had been solely responsible for negotiating the Peace);
Aeschines responded with a speech of the same name
(On the False Embassy) and was acquitted.
In 339 BC Aeschines was one of the Athenian rep-
resentatives on the Amphictyonic Council, where he
provoked Philip II to start the Fourth Sacred War.
Aeschines was sent as part of the embassy to negoti-
ate with Philip II after the battle of Chaeronea in
338 BC. In 336 BC Ctesiphon proposed that Demos-
thenes should be crowned for his services to Athens,
and in 330 BC Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon for
making an unconstitutional proposal (Against Cte-
siphon), denouncing Demosthenes’ policies. Demos-
thenes replied with On the Crown and won decisively.
Aeschines went into exile to Rhodes, where he
taught rhetoric until his death.
Agathocles (Agathokles):
Lived 361–289 BC. Tyrant
and king of Syracuse 317/316–289 BC. Born at Ther-
mae Himerae, he migrated to Syracuse with his father.
He was involved as a mercenary in wars against Acra-
gas and conquered the Bruttii tribe of southern Italy,
but was exiled by the ruling oligarchy of Syracuse. He
overthrew them in 317 BC and ruled as tyrant of Syra-
cuse. He captured most of eastern Sicily, but the
Carthaginians intervened and blockaded Syracuse.
Agathocles escaped to Africa and attacked Carthage
(310 BC). The Carthaginians agreed to a peace in 306
BC and Agathocles adopted the title of king in
305/304 BC. He later intervened in southern Italy and
even occupied Corcyra c. 300/299 BC. He arranged
marriage alliances with Pyrrhus and Ptolemy I. Just
before his death (possibly by poisoning) he allegedly
“restored Syracusan freedom.”
Agesilaus II (Agesilaos):
Lived c. 444–360 BC.
Eurypontid Spartan king from 399 BC. Son of Archi-
damus II and half brother of Agis II. He became king
largely through the inﬂuence of the general Lysander.
He campaigned against the Persians in Asia Minor in
396–395 BC, but this campaign was cut short by the
Corinthian War. He won an unproductive victory at
the battle of Coronea in 394 BC against the Atheni-
ans and Boeotians (related in Xenophon’s Hellenica)
and then fought elsewhere in Greece. His continued
hostility to Thebes led to the battle of Leuctra in 371
BC which Sparta lost, thus ending its leadership of
Greece. Hopes of ﬁnancial gain led him to conduct
an expedition against Persia in 361 BC, and he died at
Cyrene on the homeward voyage during the winter
of 361/360 or 360/359 BC.

Agiads (Agiadai):
This senior royal house at Sparta
with ceremonial precedence over the Eurypontid
house was named after the legendary Dorian king
Agis. Its kings included Cleomenes I and II, Leonidas
and Pausanias.
Agis II (Agis):
Eurypontid king of Sparta from
427/426 to 400/399 BC, this son and successor of
Archidamus II commanded Peloponnesian forces in
the Archidamian War in 426 and 425 BC. He cam-
paigned against Argos and other enemies of Sparta in
418 BC, gaining victory at the battle of Mantinea and
reestablishing Sparta’s control over the Peloponnese.
He made Decelea a permanent base in 413 BC at the
start of the Decelean War, and collaborated with
Lysander in blockading Athens in 405–404 BC. In
402/400 BC Agis II invaded Elis.
Agis III (Agis):
Eurypontid king of Sparta from
338 to 331/330 BC. Son of Archidamus III. During
Alexander the Great’s campaigns in Asia, he orga-
nized an army against Macedonian domination, using
mercenaries from survivors of the battle of Issus and
Persian money and gifts. His revolt was not widely
supported, especially by Athens and Megalopolis.
When besieging Megalopolis, Antipater’s army
attacked Agis III, who was killed (late 331 or early
330 BC).
Agis IV (Agis):
Lived 262–241 BC. Son of Euda-
midas II, he was Eurypontid king of Sparta from 244
BC. He became king in a period of ﬁnancial crisis,
and his controversial methods of combating the cri-
sis met with opposition. In 242 BC he deposed his co-
king Leonidas II and the ephors. While Agis IV was
absent helping Aratus of Sicyon against the Aetolians
in the same year, Leonidas returned and seized
power. Agis IV was executed.
Agyrrius or Agyrrhius (Agyrrhios):
Floruit 403–
389 BC. An Athenian democratic politician, particu-
larly associated with public ﬁnance and business. In
addition to restoring the theorika, he introduced and
later increased payment for attendance at the Assem-
bly. He spent several years in prison as a state debtor
after charges of embezzlement.
Alcibiades (Alkibiades):
Lived c. 450–404 BC. An
Athenian politician from a noble family and later a
military leader. His unscrupulous personal ambition
caused the Athenians to disregard him at periods
when his leadership was crucial. When his father
Cleinias died at the battle of Coronea, Alcibiades was
raised by his guardian Pericles and became a friend
of Socrates. He was involved in the siege of Potidaea
(432–430 BC) and the battle of Delium (424 BC). In
420 BC he was elected strategos and arranged an
alliance between Athens and Elis, Mantinea and
Argos (Peloponnesian states opposed to Sparta) that
led to the collapse of the Peace of Nicias. This
alliance was defeated by Agis II at the battle of Man-
tinea (418 BC). In 417 BC Hyperbolus tried to ostra-
cize Alcibiades, but was himself ostracized.
In 416 (or 424) BC Alcibiades entered seven char-
iots for the Olympic Games, winning ﬁrst, second
and fourth places. Also in 416 BC, he supported an
expedition to Sicily to assist Segesta against its rival
Selinus. He was appointed to command the expedi-
tion with Nicias and Lamachus, but was recalled on
an accusation of mutilation of the herms and other
profanations at Athens. He escaped ship at Thurii
and took refuge with the Spartans, providing them
with military advice. In his absence he was con-
demned to death, and his property was conﬁscated. In
412 BC he accompanied a Spartan ﬂeet to Ionia, but
ﬂed to Tissaphernes, the Persian satrap. The Athen-
ian ﬂeet at Samos appointed Alcibiades general, and
he destroyed the Spartan ﬂeet in 410 BC at the battle
of Cyzicus. In 408 BC he returned to Athens and was
elected strategos in 407 BC, but was later held respon-
sible for the defeat of the Athenian ﬂeet at Notium in
406 BC. In the summer of 406 BC he retreated to the
Thracian Chersonesus. In 405 BC his advice before
the battle of Aegospotami was ignored, and Athens
was utterly defeated. In 404 BC Alcibiades fled to
Phrygia where he was murdered, possibly through
the inﬂuence of the Thirty Tyrants and Lysander.
Alcidas (Alkidas):
A Spartan who was admiral in
the early part of the Peloponnesian War. Due to his
hesitation, he arrived too late to assist the revolt of
the Mytilenean aristocrats against Athens in 427 BC,
and in 426 BC he lost a naval battle against the
Athenian and Corcyran ﬂeets. He was sent to found
the colony Heraclea Trachinia in 426 BC.
Alcmaeonidae or Alcmaeonids (Alkmaionidai):
One of the leading Athenian aristocratic families
R U L E R S
A N D L E A D E R S
45

prominent in politics. One early member, Megacles,
was responsible for successfully besieging Cylon on
the Acropolis c. 630 BC, but received a hereditary
curse for the sacrilege, which was frequently invoked
against the family in political disputes at Athens. His
son Alcmaeon (Alkmaion) won the family’s and
Athens’ ﬁrst victory at the Olympic Games in 592
BC. Alcmaeon commanded the Athenian forces in
the First Sacred War (c. 590 BC). His son Megacles
married the daughter of Cleisthenes (tyrant of
Sicyon). As a leading rival of Peisistratus, Megacles
spent some time in exile. His son Cleisthenes
reformed the Athenian constitution, but was in turn
exiled by the tyrant Hippias, returning in 510 BC.
After c. 500 BC the family suffered decline, partly
because of its pro-Persian tendencies. Pericles’
mother was an Alcmaeonid, as was the mother of
Alcibiades.
Aleuadae (Aleuadai):
One of the leading aristo-
cratic families of Thessaly whose leader Thorax sup-
ported Persia in 480 BC. After 404 BC the Aleuadae
opposed the tyrants of Pherae and invited interven-
tion from Macedonia. Philip II annexed Thessaly
and divided it into tetrarchies in 342 BC.
Alexander I or Alexander of Epirus (Alexandros):
King of Molossia in Epirus 342–330 BC. He was
made king by his brother-in-law Philip II, in order
to safeguard control of Epirus. Philip II was mur-
dered at Alexander I’s marriage celebrations to
Cleopatra (Alexander the Great’s sister). Alexander I
made Epirus an important power united to Mace-
donia. From 334 BC he conquered much of south-
ern Italy at the instigation of Tarentum, but was
defeated at the battle of Pandosia (331/330 BC) and
was murdered.
Alexander I Philhellene (Alexandros):
King of
Macedonia c. 495–452 BC. In 492 BC he submitted to
Persia and served with the Persian forces under
Xerxes in their invasion of Greece. At the same time
he apparently assisted the Greeks and was admitted
as a Hellene to the games at Olympia. He was the
ﬁrst king of Macedonia to enter Greek politics, and
he attempted to hellenize his court. He invited Pin-
dar and Bacchylides to his court and competed at
Greek festivals. He took over Thracian territory,
whose mines produced silver for the ﬁrst Macedon-
ian coinage. Cimon’s conquest of the island of Tha-
sos in 463 BC
prevented Alexander’s further
expansion into Thrace.
Alexander II (Alexandros):
King of Macedonia
370–368 BC. He intervened in Thessaly at the request
of the Aleuadae, but a rebellion forced him to return
to Macedonia. Pelopidas made an alliance with him,
but shortly afterward Alexander was murdered.
Alexander II (Alexandros):
King of Molossia in
Epirus 272–c. 240 BC. Son of Pyrrhus of Epirus. In
the Chremonidean War (c. 268–263/262 BC), Epirus
was an ally of Athens against Macedonia. Alexander
II invaded Macedonia when Antigonus II Gonatas
was besieging Athens. Alexander was driven from
Epirus (about 259 BC) but was restored by the Aeto-
lians. He then conquered Arcarnania, sharing it with
the Aetolians. On his death the Aetolians invaded his
half of Arcarnania.
Alexander III the Great (Alexandros):
Lived 356–
323 BC. King of Macedonia 336–323 BC and of Per-
sia 330–323 BC. Son of Philip II and Olympias of
Epirus. One of his tutors (from 342 BC) was Aristo-
tle. In 338 BC Alexander (ﬁg. 2.1) led the Macedon-
ian cavalry at the battle of Chaeronea, in which
Athens and Thebes were defeated. When his father
was murdered Alexander succeeded without opposi-
tion, but murdered Philip’s baby son by his latest
wife Cleopatra-Eurydice and later ordered the mur-
der of his uncle Attalus. Alexander initially secured
his position in Greece, including his northern bor-
ders. In 335 BC, false reports of his death led to
revolts by some Greek states, especially Thebes,
which Alexander ruthlessly suppressed, destroying
Thebes. He left his general Antipater in control of
the Greek states and proceeded in 334 BC to under-
take his father’s mission to attack Persia in punish-
ment for the wrongs inﬂicted on Greece during the
Persian Wars (Map 5). He crossed into Asia with a
force of about 43,000 men and 50 warships. At the
battle of the Granicus River (near the Hellespont) in
334 BC, he defeated Darius III and proceeded to lib-
erate cities of Asia Minor such as Sardis, Ephesus,
Miletus and Halicarnassus. He continued through
Asia Minor and in November 333 BC he defeated
H A N D B O O K

46

Darius III at the battle of Issus. He refused Darius’
favorable terms for peace, intending to conquer the
entire Persian Empire.
The next year (332 BC) Alexander continued
through Phoenicia, Palestine and Egypt, besieging
and taking Tyre, so that Persia ceased to be a
Mediterranean power. Early in 331 BC (April 6) he
founded Alexandria on the Nile delta and visited the
desert oracle of Zeus Ammon at Siwa. He left Egypt
for Babylonia, and in November 331 BC he defeated
the Persian army at the battle of Gaugamela east of
the Tigris River. He then occupied the Persian capi-
tals of Babylon, Susa, Persepolis and Ecbatana, pos-
sibly not intending to destroy Persepolis (early 330
BC), which was the ritual center of Persia. Soon after,
Darius III was murdered by Bessus (satrap of Bac-
tria), and Alexander became ruler of Persia, even
adopting Persian dress. He treated further resistance
as rebellion.
From 330 to 327 BC Alexander pursued Bessus,
subduing huge areas of Hyrcania, Aria, Drangiana,
Bactria and Sogdiana, and crossing the Hindu Kush.
In Sogdiana he eventually captured and killed Bessus.
During this period, he suppressed a conspiracy against
him (October 330 BC), murdered Cleitus (328/327
BC), which he bitterly regretted, and founded eight
cities, all called Alexandria. In 328 BC he reached the
farthest northeast boundary of the Persian empire
( Jaxartes River—Syr Darya), where he founded
Alexandria Eschate (the farthest). Early in 327 BC he
captured and immediately married Roxane, daughter
of a Bactrian aristocrat. Also in 327 BC there was
apparently another plot to murder him (conspiracy
of the pages), involving Callisthenes, the expedition’s
historian, who was imprisoned and executed.
In summer 327 BC Alexander began his Indian
Expedition; he crossed the Indus in 326 BC and
fought his last great battle at the Hydaspes (Jhelum)
River against Porus, king of the Paurava. Alexander’s
horse Bucephalas died there. He advanced through
the rest of the Punjab to the Hyphasis (Beas) River,
where his army refused to proceed to the Ganges. It
returned to the Hydaspes, and a huge ﬂeet was con-
structed to transport the army down the Indus to
subdue the people of southwest India. Here Alexan-
der was nearly killed besieging Multan. In 325 BC he
reached the Indus delta where he left the ﬂeet with
half the army, choosing a route through the waterless
deserts of Baluchistan, with the rest of his army suf-
fering great loss of life.
Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC and found mis-
government and disloyalty among his subordinates.
He ruthlessly purged them, but there was imminent
warfare in Greece. He forced his ofﬁcers into mar-
riages with Persian women, and his enrollment of
Persians into the army caused a mutiny at Opis in
324 BC. He executed the ringleaders. It is possible
that in 324 BC he requested the Greek cities to treat
him like a god, and he may have believed in his own
divinity. In autumn 324 BC his closest companion
Hephaestion died, and Alexander later returned to
Babylon. Here he fell ill and died after a 10-day ill-
ness on June 10, 323 BC, possibly by poison or from
fever. He was buried at Alexandria, and his cofﬁn was
seen by the Roman emperor Augustus three cen-
turies later.
Alexander extended the Greek language and cus-
toms across the eastern world, and the center of the
Greek world in Hellenistic times shifted to Alexan-

dria in Egypt. The main historical source for his
campaigns is the Anabasis by Arrian, who drew on
contemporary sources.
Alexander IV (Alexandros):
The posthumous son
of Alexander the Great and Roxane; king of Macedo-
nia 323–c. 311 BC, he became joint king with Philip
III Arrhidaeus. Alexander was captured by Cassander
in 316 BC and murdered in 311 BC or soon after,
marking the end of the Argead dynasty.
Alexander Balas (Alexandros):
Pretender to the
Seleucid throne 150–145 BC after he defeated and
killed Demetrius I Soter. He was supported by
Attalus II of Pergamum, Rome and Egypt. In
150/149 BC he married Cleopatra Thea, daughter of
Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy VI switched his support to
Demetrius II Nicator (son of Demetrius I), who
defeated and killed Alexander Balas in a battle in 145
BC, marking the beginning of the disintegration of
the Seleucid Empire.
Alexander of Corinth (Alexandros):
Lived c. 290–
c. 245 BC. Son of Craterus the Younger, succeeding
him as strategos of Corinth and Euboea. He declared
himself independent from Antigonus II Gonatas in
249 BC, calling himself king. He became an ally of
the Achaean Confederacy.
Alexander of Pherae (Alexandros):
Tyrant of
Pherae in Thessaly 369–358 BC. Nephew and suc-
cessor of Jason. Most cities of Thessaly opposed
Alexander, refusing to recognize him as tagos. He
became allied with Athens to prevent Theban expan-
sion, but was defeated by the Theban general Pelop-
idas at the battle of Cynoscephalae in 364 BC. A

He was assassinated by his wife’s brothers.
Alyattes (Aleuttes):
Fourth king of Lydia c.
610–560 BC and founder of the Lydian Empire. He
continued his predecessor’s efforts to conquer Greek
Ionia, including Smyrna, which he destroyed in 600
BC, but eventually made peace with Miletus. He sent
offerings to Delphi. He was buried in a huge round-
barrow tomb.
Amasis (Amasis):
Egyptian pharaoh c. 569–c. 525
BC. His long reign was noted for its peace and pros-
perity. He encouraged the Greeks to settle at Nau-
cratis and became an ally of several Greek states,
including Lydia and Samos. Just after his death,
Egypt was invaded by Persians.
Amynander (Amynandros):
King of Athamania
(between Macedonia and Aetolia) c. 210–c. 189 BC.
He tried to mediate between Philip V and Aetolia in
209 BC. An ally of Rome in the Second Macedonian
War, he became involved in the struggle between
Greece and Rome. In 192–191 BC he became an ally
of Antiochus III and of the Aetolians against Rome
and Philip. He was driven from his kingdom by
Philip but recovered it through Aetolian help in 189
BC and probably died soon afterward.
Amyntas (Amyntas):
A dynastic name in the Mace-
donian royal house, the most famous being Amyntas
III, king of Macedonia c. 393 to 370/369 BC. He con-
solidated his kingdom, especially through diplomacy,
and died a natural death. He was father of Philip II.
Anacharsis (Anakharsis):
A 6th-century BC Scythian
prince who traveled to Greece. He was executed in
Scythia for attempting to introduce the cult of
Cybele. He allegedly despised all Greeks except the
Spartans and was said to have been a guest of Solon
at Athens and one of the Seven Sages.
Anaxilas (Anaxilaos):
Tyrant of Rhegium from 494
BC, when he seized power, to 476 BC. He tried to
control Zancle on the Sicilian side of the straits, but
the people colluded with Hippocrates of Gela. Anax-
ilas expelled them and resettled Zancle with Messe-
nians (and changed its name to Messana). In 480 BC
he supported the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily, but
the Carthaginians were defeated at the battle of
Himera by Gelon. He made his peace with Hieron I,
whom his daughter married.
Andocides (Andokides):
Lived c. 440–c. 390 BC.
An early Attic orator from a wealthy family. He con-
fessed to involvement in the mutilation of the herms
in 415 BC and in profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries.
He lost his civic rights and left Athens to trade as a
merchant. He tried unsuccessfully to return to
Athens in 411 and 410 BC, but returned with his civic
rights restored under the general amnesty of 399 BC.
He was one of the envoys sent to Sparta in 391 BC to
try to negotiate peace in the Corinthian War. The
terms were rejected by Athens, and Andocides went
into exile. Three of his speeches survive: On His
Return, On the Mysteries and On the Peace.
Andriscus (Andriskos):
An adventurer from Adra-
myttium, he was a pretender to the Macedonian
throne c. 153–148 BC, claiming to be Philip, son of
Perseus and Laodice. The Seleucid king Demetrius I
(brother of Laodice) handed Andriscus over to
Rome, but Andriscus escaped and invaded Macedo-
nia. He was eventually defeated by the Romans and
executed.
Androtion (Androtion):
Lived c. 410–340 BC. An
Athenian politician, he was a pupil of Isocrates and
opposed Demosthenes and Eubulus’ view of an
alliance with Persia against Macedonia. He was sent
on an embassy to King Mausolus of Caria during the
Social War (357–355 BC), and in 355/354 BC he served
on a committee to prepare war against Persia. He was
accused in 354–353 BC of an unconstitutional proposal
and was exiled to Megara where he wrote a history of
Attica (Atthis) down to 343 BC in eight books.
Antalcidas (Antalkidas):
Floruit 393/392 to c. 361
BC. He was a Spartan diplomat and general. He tried
to end the war between Greece and Persia in
393/392 BC by surrendering the Greek cities to Per-
sia. He negotiated further with Artaxerxes II in
388/387 BC. Sparta’s enemies accepted this King’s
Peace (or Peace of Antalcidas) after Antalcidas block-
aded the Hellespont, abandoning the Greek cities of
Asia Minor to Persia. In c. 373 BC he was in Persia

again, but his mission of c. 361 BC failed, and he
committed suicide.
Antigonus I One-Eyed (Antigonos Monophthalmos):
Lived c. 382/381–301 BC. From a noble Macedonian
family, he was a general of Alexander the Great, who
appointed him satrap of Persia in 333 BC. In 320 BC
Perdiccas was murdered, and Antigonus was appointed
Macedonian strategos in Asia at the conference of Tri-
paradeisus. In 319 BC Antipater died, and until 301
BC Antigonus attempted to retake and rule the entire
empire of Alexander the Great. In 315–311 BC a
coalition of satraps fought against Antigonus, which
left him ruler of a reduced area of Asia (Map 1). Peace
between the Successors in 311 BC lasted only a year.
In 306 BC he proclaimed himself and his son
Demetrius Poliorcetes as kings, as did other satraps in
305–304 BC. Antigonus was ﬁnally defeated and killed
at the battle of Ipsus.
Antigonus II Gonatas (Antigonos Gonatas):
Lived
c. 320–239 BC. King of Macedonia 277–239 BC. He
was possibly called Gonatas because he was born at
Gonnus, Thessaly. Son of Demetrius I Poliorcetes
and grandson of Antigonus I. He was in charge of
Demetrius’ Greek possessions and assumed the title
of king on Demetrius’ death in 283 BC. In 277 BC
Antigonus II gained control of Macedonia, after
defeating around 20,000 invading Gauls near Lysi-
machia in the Chersonese. He became king, establish-
ing the Antigonid dynasty. He reestablished
Macedonia as a nation, to be ruled by his descendants.
He was a philosopher, and many poets, philosophers
and historians gathered at his court at Pella.
In 272 BC he joined Sparta to destroy Pyrrhus of
Epirus who had invaded the Peloponnese. He
reestablished his power as far as Corinth. Athens,
Sparta and other states, supported by Ptolemy II,
began the Chremonidean War against Antigonus (c.
268–263/262 BC). Athens fell to Antigonus in 262 BC,
and he imposed a puppet government. He entered
into renewed war (Second Syrian War) against
Ptolemy II in 260–253 BC, entrusting Corinth to his
half brother Craterus the Younger, who died c. 255
BC. Alexander of Corinth (son of Craterus) declared
himself independent. Antigonus regained Corinth,
but it was taken in 243 BC by Aratus of Sicyon, who
united it with the anti-Macedonian Achaean Con-
federacy. Antigonus then supported the Aetolian
Confederacy, which was a threat to the Achaean
Confederacy, but the Aetolians concluded peace with
the Achaeans in 241/240 BC.
Antigonus III Doson (Antigonos):
The meaning of
Doson is uncertain. Lived c. 263–221 BC, regent and
king of Macedonia 229–221 BC, son of Demetrius the
Fair. He became guardian to Philip V and married his
widowed mother Queen Phthia-Chryseis. He
defeated the Dardani (an Illyrian tribe that had killed
Demetrius II) in 229 BC, and in 228 BC he defeated
the Aetolians and Thessalians, thereby recovering
most of Thessaly. In 227 BC he mounted an expedi-
tion to Caria, probably directed against Ptolemy III,
and reestablished Macedonian inﬂuence in eastern
Greece and the Aegean. In 227/226 BC the Achaean
Confederacy gained the support of Antigonus Doson
against Sparta and Aetolia, in return for Acrocorinth.
In 225–224 BC Antigonus Doson occupied Acro-
corinth with a Macedonian garrison. In the winter of
224 BC he founded a league of allies (Hellenic
League), and in the battle of Sellasia in 222 BC he
crushed Cleomenes III (king of Sparta), who ﬂed to
Egypt. Antigonus Doson returned to Macedonia to
expel the invading Illyrians and died in 221 BC, hav-
ing burst a blood vessel in battle.
Antiochus I Soter (Antiokhos,
Savior):
Lived
324–261 BC. Son of Seleucus I and Apama. He mar-
ried his father’s wife Stratonice in 294/293 BC and
became Seleucid king in 281 BC, renouncing further
campaigns in the west. Instead, he formed an alliance
with Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedonia. During his
reign Antiochus I concentrated on holding his east-
ern kingdom together, but lost territory in Asia
Minor (partly in the First Syrian War against
Ptolemy II), and many of his eastern satrapies
seceded. After Alexander the Great, he was the great-
est founder of cities. His greatest victory was the
defeat of the invading Galatians c. 270 BC (Elephant
Victory), after which he acquired the title Soter.
Antiochus II Theos (Antiokhos, God):
Lived c.
287–246 BC. Seleucid king from 261 BC. Younger son
of Antiochus I Soter (his elder brother Seleucus may
have been executed). In the Second Syrian War of
260–253 BC (in alliance with Macedonia) against
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E

50

Ptolemy II, he recovered territory lost by Antiochus
I. He married Laodice I and c. 253 BC Berenice Syra
(daughter of Ptolemy II). There was a bitter acces-
sion dispute on his death, with his eldest son Seleu-
cus II becoming king.
Antiochus III the Great (Antiokhos):
Lived c.
242–187 BC. Younger son of Seleucus II, he became
Seleucid king on the death of his elder brother
Seleucus III in 223 BC. Antiochus suppressed revolts
by his eastern governors and then undertook the
recovery and expansion of Seleucid territories that
had been lost by his predecessors. He attempted to
conquer Syria and Palestine (in the Fourth Syrian
War, 219–217 BC), but was defeated in 217 BC by
Ptolemy IV at the battle of Raphia. He campaigned
in the east (his anabasis) 212–206 BC: he acquired
Armenia (212 BC), regained Parthia and Bactria (as
vassal kingdoms) and reached India, emulating
Alexander the Great. He returned to Antioch via
Arabia in 205/204 BC, and adopted the title “Great”
(megas). In alliance in 202 BC with Philip V of Mace-
donia to divide up Egypt’s territory, he conquered
Coele-Syria 202–195 BC (Fifth Syrian War), and
crossed to Europe to recover Thrace. The Romans
were alarmed, and despite lengthy negotiations,
Antiochus III decided to reject offers of peace and
invaded Greece in 192 BC. He was defeated by the
Romans in the battle of Magnesia ad Sipylum in 189
BC. With the Peace of Apamea (188 BC), the Seleucid
kingdom ceased to be a Mediterranean power. Anti-
ochus returned to his eastern possessions and was
murdered while robbing a temple.
Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Antiokhos, God Made
Manifest):
Lived c. 215–164 BC. He was the third
son of Antiochus III and was a hostage at Rome after
the battle of Magnesia ad Sipylum (189 BC). He
became Seleucid king in 175 BC. He invaded Egypt
three times (170–168 BC, Sixth Syrian War) but was
ordered to retreat by Rome. He attempted to hell-
enize the Jews, but instead his persecutions pro-
voked Jewish nationalism, and a serious revolt
erupted in 167 BC under Judas Maccabaeus. Also as
a process of hellenization, Antiochus IV founded
several eastern cities. He is reputed to have suffered
from eccentricity or madness. He died of an illness
at Tabae in Persis.
Antiochus V Eupator (Antiokhos, born of a noble
father):
Lived c. 173–162 BC. Son of Antiochus IV,
he ruled through a regent for less than two years,
and was executed in Antioch when his cousin
Demetrius I Soter claimed the throne.
Antiochus VI Epiphanes Dionysus (Antiokhos, God
Made Manifest):
Lived c. 148–138 BC. Son of
Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea (daughter of
Ptolemy VI). He was put forward as a candidate for
the Seleucid throne in the revolt at Antioch against
Demetrius II Nicator, but was deposed (142 BC) and
subsequently killed by the general Diodotus Tryphon.
Antiochus VII Sidetes Euergetes (Antiokhos; called
Sidetes because he had lived at Side, and Euergetes for
benefactor):
Lived c. 159–129 BC. Second son of
Demetrius I Soter. He became Seleucid king in 139
BC when his brother Demetrius II Nicator was cap-
tured in Parthia. In 138 BC he married Cleopatra
Thea. He defeated and killed the usurper Diodotus
Tryphon at Antioch (late 138 BC), and reconquered
Palestine (135–134 BC), but was eventually defeated
and killed by the Parthians, losing the Seleucid terri-
tories in the east.
Antiochus VIII Grypus Philometor (Antiokhos;
grypos means hook-nose, Philometor is “mother-
loving”):
Son of Demetrius II and Cleopatra Thea.
Seleucid king 125–96 BC. He reclaimed the throne
from the usurper Alexander II Zabinas in 123 BC
(Zabinas ruled 128–123 BC), but faced a serious
revolt from his half brother Antiochus IX from
114/113 BC, which lasted several years. He was assas-

brother of Ariarathes IV) to seize the throne (160
BC). Ariarathes recovered his kingdom with the help
of Attalus II of Pergamum (c. 157 BC) and sacked
Priene because the temple of Athena (fig. 9.17)

won control over much of Seleucid Asia Minor by
attacking Antiochus Hierax (230–228 BC), but lost
this territory to Achaeus in his revolt against Anti-

with Ptolemy II as Theoi Soteres (Savior Gods).
Berenice II Euergetis (Berenike,
Benefactor):
Queen of Egypt 246–221 BC. Daughter of King
Magas of Cyrene and Apama (daughter of Antiochus
I). Although betrothed to Ptolemy III, she was forced
by her mother to marry the Macedonian prince

prosecuted the ambassadors who proposed peace
with Sparta. In 378 BC he was elected strategos when
the Second Athenian League (Athens and Thebes
against Sparta) was founded, and organized its
finances. However, the rise of Thebes led him to
advocate peace with Sparta. In 366 BC Thebes seized
Oropus, and Callistratus was prosecuted, successfully
defending himself in a speech that inspired Demos-
thenes. A further prosecution forced Callistratus into
exile, and he was executed on his return in 361 BC.
Cassander (Kassandros):
Lived c. 355–297 BC.
Eldest son of Antipater (general of Alexander the
Great) and allegedly responsible for Alexander’s

Athenian statesman and soldier. Son of Miltiades and
father of Lacedaemonius. He was frequently strategos

476 BC he expelled Pausanias from Byzantium and
recaptured Eion on the Strymon River from the Per-
sians. He conquered and colonized the island of
Scyrus c. 475 BC, clearing it of pirates and bringing
back to Athens the bones of the hero Theseus. Circa
467 BC he destroyed the Persian ﬂeet at the battle of
Eurymedon, and after a two-year siege (465–463 BC)
he conquered Thasos, which had revolted from the
Delian League.
In 463 BC Cimon was unsuccessfully prosecuted
by Pericles for receiving bribes from Alexander I not
to invade Macedonia. In 462 BC he persuaded the
Athenians to allow him to assist Sparta in a war
against the helots. The Spartans turned away his
forces, and Cimon was ostracized in 461 BC (fig.
1.12). He was recalled after about ﬁve years in exile
and negotiated a ﬁve-year peace treaty with Sparta
(c.451 BC). He then commanded a ﬁnal expedition
against the Persians to recapture Cyprus, but died
while besieging Citium.
Cleisthenes (Kleisthenes):
Lived c. 565–c. 500 BC.
Athenian statesman, son of Megacles (of the
Alcmaeonid family) and Agariste (daughter of Cleis-
thenes of Sicyon). He was generally considered the
creator of Athenian democracy. He was archon
under Hippias in 525/524 BC but was later exiled.
After Hippias was expelled in 510 BC, Cleisthenes
returned to Athens and proposed major democratic
reforms. His opponent Isagoras appealed to
Cleomenes I of Sparta who invoked the hereditary
curse of the Alcmaeonids, forcing Cleisthenes and
his supporters to withdraw in 508 BC. They subse-
quently returned with popular support, carrying out
the political reforms. Cleisthenes replaced the four
traditional Ionian tribes with a system based on 10
tribes, trittyes and demes (see chapter 1). He also cre-
ated (or reformed) the boule, and possibly intro-
duced ostracism. He was buried in a public tomb in
the Kerameikos Cemetery at Athens.
Cleisthenes of Sicyon (Kleisthenes):
Tyrant of the
ruling house of Orthagoras c. 595–570 BC. Cleis-

drunken quarrel at Maracanda; his death was later
bitterly regretted by Alexander.
Cleitus or White Cleitus (Kleitos):
Died 318 BC.
A Macedonian general under Alexander the Great.
He later defeated the Athenian ﬂeet off the island of
Amorgos (322 BC), so ending the Lamian War. He
received the satrapy of Lydia (321 BC), but was
expelled by Antigonus I (319 BC). He became Poly-
perchon’s admiral, but failed to prevent Antigonus I
from crossing the Bosphorus into Europe. He was
killed in Thrace soon after.
Cleomenes I (Kleomenes):
Son of Anaxandridas II
and Agiad king of Sparta c. 520–488 BC. He expelled
the tyrant Hippias from Athens in 510 BC and unsuc-
cessfully supported Isagoras against Cleisthenes in
508 BC. Because of the obstruction of his fellow-king
Demaratus, he failed to take control of Attica and
reinstate Isagoras and Hippias. Demaratus prevented
R U L E R S
A N D L E A D E R S
57

him from punishing Aegina for favoring Persia, and
he consequently had Demaratus deposed in 491 BC
with a forged Delphic oracle on a charge of illegiti-
macy. This plot was exposed, and Cleomenes even-
tually committed suicide.
Cleomenes III (Kleomenes):
Lived 265/260–219
BC. Agiad king of Sparta 235–222 BC. He was son of
Leonidas II (king of Sparta 254–235 BC) and married

constitution, such as canceling debts, abolishing the
ephorate, redistributing land, and enrolling new cit-
izens from perioeci and metics. In July 222 BC he was
defeated by the Achaeans under Aratus of Sicyon at
the battle of Sellasia and ﬂed to his patron Ptolemy
III Euergetes in Egypt. Imprisoned by Ptolemy’s suc-
cessor, he later committed suicide.
Cleon (Kleon):
Died 422 BC. An Athenian politi-
cian toward whom ancient writers were hostile. He
attacked Pericles in speeches in 431 and 430 BC. After
Pericles died in 429 BC, Cleon became the most inﬂu-
ential Athenian politician. In 427 BC he proposed that
all men of Mytilene should be executed after its
revolt. He opposed peace with Sparta after Athenian
victory at Pylos and Sphacteria in 425 BC, in which he
was involved with his general Demosthenes. He
raised the pay of jurors from two to three obols, and
in 423 BC he proposed the destruction of Scione and
execution of its citizens (carried out 421 BC). In 422
BC he was elected strategos and led an expedition to
Thrace where he was defeated by Brasidas outside
Amphipolis, and both men were killed.
Cleopatra I (Kleopatra):

Cleopatra II (Kleopatra):
Lived c. 185/180–116/115
BC. Queen of Egypt c. 175/174–116/115 BC. Daughter

brother Ptolemy VI c. 175/174 BC and later ruled
jointly with him and their brother Ptolemy VIII dur-
ing the Sixth Syrian War (170–168 BC) against Anti-
ochus IV. Her children were Cleopatra Thea (who
married three Seleucid kings), Ptolemy VII and
Cleopatra III. She later married Ptolemy VIII (144
BC), who in turn also married her daughter Cleopatra
III (142 BC). Cleopatra II revolted against Ptolemy
VIII in 132 BC and declared her son Ptolemy Mem-
phites king and herself queen. Her son was murdered,
and she offered the Egyptian throne to Demetrius II
(Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III having fled to
Cyprus). She then ﬂed to Demetrius II Nicator who
was murdered in 125 BC. The two queens and
Ptolemy VIII were reconciled in 124 BC.
Cleopatra 
III (Kleopatra):
Queen 
of 
Egypt
142–101 BC. Daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra
II. She married Ptolemy VIII in 142 BC. On his

for power between her two sons Ptolemy IX and
Ptolemy X. The latter may have murdered her. She
also had three daughters: Cleopatra IV, Cleopatra
Tryphaena and Cleopatra Selene.
Cleopatra VII (Kleopatra):
Lived 69–30 
BC.
Daughter of Ptolemy XII. She was ruler with
Ptolemy XIII from 51 BC, expelled in 48 BC, but
reinstated by Julius Caesar, by whom she allegedly
had a son (47 BC) (ﬁg. 2.3). She joined in a political
alliance with Mark Antony, and followed him in
committing suicide (10 August, 30 BC).
Cleophon (Kleophon):
Died c. 404 BC. Athenian
politician and lyre maker. After the restoration of
democracy in 410 BC, he became a leader of the peo-
ple (demagogue). He was in charge of Athens’
ﬁnances from 410 to 406 BC, and introduced a dole
(diobelia) of two obols for poor citizens. He prevented
Athens from making peace with Sparta in 410 and
405 BC, and was prosecuted and condemned to death
by the oligarchs in 404 BC.
Conon (Konon):
Lived c. 444–392 BC. An Athen-
ian of noble birth, he was strategos in 414/413 BC,
commanding the Athenian naval ﬂeet at Naupactus.
In 407–405 BC he commanded ﬂeets in the Aegean
and Hellespont. At the battle of Aegospotami (405
BC) he was the only Athenian general to escape the

donian general of Alexander the Great, he com-
manded units at the battles of Granicus (334 BC),
Issus (333 BC) and Gaugamela (331 BC). He held
independent command in Bactria and Sogdiana
(329–328 BC) and at the battle of Hydaspes River in
India (326 BC). In 324 BC, he led home the Macedon-
ian veterans and replaced Antipater as strategos in
Europe. Following Alexander’s death he was defeated
and killed by Eumenes of Cardia near the Hellespont.
Craterus the Younger (Krateros):
Lived 321–c.
255 BC. Son of Craterus and Phila (daughter of
Antipater). Circa 280 BC he was appointed by his half
brother Antigonus II Gonatas as strategos over
Corinth and Euboea. Areus I of Sparta was killed by
him in 265 BC at Corinth on his way to relieve Athens
in the Chremonidean War. He may have written a
commentary on a collection of Athenian decrees. He
was succeeded by his son Alexander of Corinth.
Critias (Kritias):
Lived c. 460–403 BC. He was
from an aristocratic family and was implicated (but
released) in the mutilation of the herms. He pro-
posed the recall of Alcibiades, and was apparently
later exiled. On the surrender of Athens to Sparta in
404 BC, Critias returned and became leader of the
Thirty Tyrants (the pro-Spartan oligarchy). He was
portrayed as an unscrupulous leader, and was killed
ﬁghting against Thrasybulus in spring 403 BC. He
had literary interests and was the author of elegiac
poems and tragedies.
Croesus (Kroisos):
Last king of Lydia, c. 560–c.
546 BC. He subdued the Greek cities on the Asia
Minor coast, but was favorable to the Greeks.
Allegedly very wealthy, he made rich offerings at
Greek shrines, particularly Delphi. With the rise of
Persia, he attacked Cyrus the Great after an ambigu-
ous response from the Delphic oracle (“If you cross
the Halys, you will destroy a great nation”). Cyrus
defeated Croesus and captured his capital Sardis.
Various legends grew up about him being saved from
execution.
Cylon (Kylon):
Seventh-century BC Athenian aris-
tocrat who won an Olympic victory (possibly 640 BC).
He plotted to become tyrant of Athens with the aid of
his father-in-law Theagenes, tyrant of Megara. Cylon
seized the Acropolis (possibly 632 BC), but was
besieged by the archon Megacles the Alcmaeonid.
Cylon escaped but his followers were impiously taken
from sanctuary at an altar of Athena and executed. As
a result, the Alcmaeonids incurred a hereditary curse,
often invoked in political disputes at Athens.
Cypselus (Kypselos):
Tyrant of Corinth c. 657–627
BC. He escaped death by the Bacchiads (a dynasty
that had ruled Corinth since the 8th century BC)

overthrew the Bacchiad dynasty and was a popular
ruler. His son was Periander.
Cyrus the Great (Kyros, Persian Kurash):
The
ﬁrst king of Persia, 559–529 BC. When attacked by
Croesus, he defeated him, and Lydia and the Ionian
Greek states became part of the Persian Empire. He
became king of a vast empire and was regarded as a
model ruler by the Greeks. He probably died in bat-
tle, and his tomb is at Pasargadae.
Cyrus II the Younger (Kyros):
Lived c. 423–401
BC. Second son of Darius II. As satrap of Lydia he
became friendly with Lysander, ensuring Spartan
victory over Athens in the Peloponnesian War.
When his elder brother Artaxerxes II succeeded his
father as king, Cyrus was accused of treason.
Released from prison, he returned to Asia Minor and
amassed a large force of Greek mercenaries includ-
ing Xenophon. In 401 BC he set out with an expedi-
tion (anabasis) of 20,000 men, but was defeated and
killed by Artaxerxes at the battle of Cunaxa (near
Babylon). The expedition and the retreating army
(March of the Ten Thousand) were described in
Xenophon’s Anabasis.
Darius I (Dareios, Persian Darayavaush):
King of
Persia 521–486 BC. He was of the Achaemenid fam-
ily and came to the throne by overthrowing a usurper
who was impersonating a brother of Cambyses (king
of Persia, 530–522 BC). By 519 BC he had restored
order in the Persian Empire, and created 20 satrapies
(provinces governed by satraps), a system retained by
later rulers. From 513 to 512 BC he campaigned
against Thrace and the Scythians, and in 499–494 BC
he suppressed a revolt of the Ionian Greek cities. He
sent an army to Greece to punish its interference,
but this army was conquered at Marathon (490 BC),
and Darius died before he could mount another
expedition.
Darius III (Dareios):
Lived c. 380–330 BC. King of
Persia 336–330 BC. A great-nephew of Artaxerxes II,
he was defeated by Alexander the Great at Granicus
(334 BC), Issus (333 BC) and Gaugamela (331 BC).
He ﬂed eastward but was hunted down; his own fol-
lowers murdered him as Alexander approached.
Demades (Demades):
Lived c. 380–319 BC. An
Athenian politician and orator, he arranged a peace
agreement between Athens and Macedonia after
the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC). He led a pro-
Macedonian group at Athens, and was subsequently
exiled. After Macedonian victory at the battle of
Crannon in 322 BC, he was recalled in order to make
peace with Antipater, resulting in the deaths of
Hyperides and Demosthenes. He was himself exe-
cuted by Cassander after the death of Antipater.
Demaratus (Demaratos or Damaratos):
Eurypon-
tid king of Sparta c. 515–491 BC. He obstructed his
fellow-king Cleomenes I, ultimately intervening over
Aegina. Cleomenes therefore had him deposed on a
false charge of illegitimacy using an oracle from Del-
phi. Demaratus ﬂed to Darius I and later accompa-
nied Xerxes on his invasion of Greece (480 BC). He
was granted land in Mysia as a reward, where he died
many years later.
Demetrius the Fair (Demetrios ho Kalos):
Lived c.
286–c. 248 BC. Son of Demetrius I Poliorcetes and
Ptolemais (daughter of Ptolemy I) and father of
Antigonus Doson. He gained Cyrene from Ptolemy
II but was murdered soon after. His nickname was
due to his appearance.
Demetrius of Phalerum (Demetrios):
Lived c.
350–c. 283 BC. Athenian philosopher, orator, politi-
cian and probably strategos for several years from
325/324 BC. He was pro-Macedonian and was con-
demned to death in 318 BC. However, he was made
governor of Athens by Cassander (317 BC), and held
power for 10 years. He fled to Boeotia when
Demetrius I Poliorcetes liberated Athens (307 BC),
and was later librarian in Alexandria (297 BC). Under
Ptolemy II Philadelphus, he was exiled to Upper
Egypt where he died.
Demetrius of Pharos (Demetrios):
Died 214 BC.
He betrayed Corcyra to Rome (229 BC) and was
rewarded with the rule of a kingdom centered on
Pharos in northwest Illyria. He broke his treaty with
Rome and was expelled when Rome invaded Illyria
(219 BC). He escaped to his ally Philip V of Macedo-
nia and incited his anti-Roman policy. He was killed
in an expedition against Messene.

Demetrius I of Bactria (Demetrios):
King of Bac-
tria c. 200–185 BC, son of Euthydemus I. He annexed
Arachosia and Drangiana and apparently extended
his empire as far east as Pataliputra (Patna) in India,
intending to imitate Alexander the Great’s achieve-
ments. According to numismatic evidence, there may
have been a Euthydemus II (perhaps a son or brother
of Demetrius I), and the Euthydemids may have
been challenged by Antimachus Theos. Demetrius I
(or possibly a Demetrius II) may have been the
Demetrius known in classical sources as “King of
India” and who issued bilingual Indo-Greek coins.
Demetrius I Poliorcetes (Demetrios, the Besieger):
Lived 336–283 BC. He was a son of Antigonus I and
king of Macedonia 294–288 BC. He undertook many
campaigns in order to reunite Alexander the Great’s
empire and was defeated by Ptolemy I at Gaza (312
BC). In 307 BC he was sent by Antigonus to liberate
Athens from Cassander. He gained Cyprus by a naval
victory over Ptolemy I at Salamis (306 BC). He
unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305–304 BC, for
which he gained his nickname. He revived the
League of Corinth and was regarded as the leader of
Greece against Cassander. He and his father were
defeated at Ipsus (301 BC), and Antigonus’ empire in
Asia was destroyed. Demetrius was proclaimed king
by the Macedonian army (294 BC), and intended to
recover the empire in Asia, but instead lost Macedo-
nia to Lysimachus and Pyrrhus (288 BC). He fled
with a small force to Asia Minor in 286 BC, but sur-
rendered to Seleucus I in 285 BC and died two years
later.
Demetrius I Soter of Syria (Demetrios, Savior):
Lived 187–150 BC, Seleucid king 162–150 BC. The
elder son of Seleucus IV; he was sent as a hostage to
Rome, while his uncle (Antiochus IV) and cousin
(Antiochus V) gained the throne. In 162 BC
Demetrius escaped from Rome and regained the
throne from Antiochus V: He became an unpopular
ruler and died in battle against the usurper Alexander
Balas.
Demetrius II (Demetrios):
Lived c. 276–229 BC.
King of Macedonia 239–229 BC. Son of Antigonus II
Gonatas and Phila. He married Stratonice II (his
mother’s half sister) c. 253 BC, divorcing her in 239 BC.
After becoming king, he married Phthia-Chryseis,
daughter of Alexander I of Epirus. From 239 to 238
BC he was engaged in the Demetrian War against the
Aetolian and Achaean Confederacies. Demetrius was
killed fighting the Illyrian Dardani tribe on his
northern border.
Demetrius II Nicator Theos Philadelphus
(Demetrius II of Syria) (Demetrios, Conqueror,
God, Loving his Brother):
Lived c. 161–125 BC.
Eldest son of Demetrius I Soter. Seleucid king
145–139 BC and 129–125 BC. He gained the throne
after defeating the pretender Alexander Balas and
married Cleopatra Thea, daughter of Ptolemy VI
(previously wife of Alexander Balas), all in 145 BC.
He was captured by the Parthians in 139 BC and was
held for 10 years. He regained the throne from his
younger brother Antiochus VII Sidetes, but was later
murdered.
Demochares (Demokhares):
Lived c. 360–275 BC.
An Athenian orator and democratic politician, he
defended Athens during the Four Years’ War against
Cassander (307–304 BC). He was exiled c. 303 BC,
returning c. 286/285 BC. He saved Eleusis from an
attack by Antigonus II Gonatas and secured Athens’
finances with financial aid from Macedonia’s ene-
mies. He obtained a decree honoring Demosthenes,
his uncle, who had held anti-Macedonian views. On
retirement, he devoted himself to speeches and a his-
tory of Athens.
Demosthenes (Demosthenes):
Died 413 BC. An
Athenian general prominent in the Peloponnesian
War. In 425 BC (along with Cleon) he captured a
force of Spartan hoplites on Sphacteria. After an
unsuccessful campaign in 424 BC, he was given no
major command until 413 BC, when he went to
relieve Nicias at Syracuse. He urged withdrawal, but
eventually the Athenians were defeated at sea.
Demosthenes surrendered and was executed.
Demosthenes (Demosthenes):
Lived 384–322 BC.
An Athenian orator, he was regarded by his contem-
poraries as the greatest of the Attic orators. He
became a speechwriter (logographos), and was noted
for his orations advocating resistance to Philip II of
Macedonia. The First Philippic was delivered in 351
R U L E R S
A N D L E A D E R S
61

BC; there followed the three Olynthiacs (349 BC), On
the Peace (346 BC), Second Philippic (344 BC), On the
False Embassy (343 BC), On the Chersonese (341 BC),
Third Philippic (341 BC) and Fourth Philippic (341 BC).
In 339 BC Demosthenes arranged an alliance with
Thebes against Philip II to prevent him invading
Attica, but the alliance lost against Philip at the bat-
tle of Chaeronea (August 338 BC). Demosthenes was
present at the battle and later delivered the funeral
oration. Despite the loss of the battle, his supporter
Ctesiphon proposed that Demosthenes should be
honored at the City Dionysia with a golden crown in
recognition of his services. Aeschines prosecuted
Ctesiphon for this proposal in 330 BC. In his speech
Against Ctesiphon, Aeschines outlined Demosthenes’
policies, blaming him for Athens’ misfortunes.
Demosthenes’ defense (On the Crown) won deci-
sively. Demosthenes was later accused of receiving
bribes and retired to Aegina (323 BC). Following the
death of Alexander the Great, he returned to Athens
in triumph. After the Macedonian victory at the bat-
tle of Crannon (322 BC), Demades sentenced
Demosthenes to death, but he ﬂed from Athens and
committed suicide by poison at the temple of Posei-
don on the island of Calauria.
Dercyllidas (Derkyllidas):
Floruit 411–389 BC. A
Spartan general. In 411 BC he took Abydus and
Lampsacus from Athens, and in 339 BC he concluded
a treaty with Tissaphernes. He campaigned against
the Persian satrap Pharnabazus in Asia Minor, but
was replaced by King Agesilaus II. From 394 BC
Dercyllidas was responsible for Spartan interests in
the Hellespont.
Diocles (Diokles):
Died after 408 BC. Democratic
leader of Syracuse who altered its constitution in line
with Athenian democratic principles. In 409/408 BC
he led the army against Hannibal, who was besieging
Himera. He was sent into exile by supporters of his
opponent Hermocrates. After his death he received
hero-worship.
Dion (Dion):
Lived c. 408–354 BC. Brother-in-law
and son-in-law of Dionysius I. Under Plato’s inﬂu-
ence he tried to make Dionysius II a philosopher-
king, but was expelled from Syracuse c. 366 BC and
went to live in Athens, where he was closely associ-
ated with the Academy. In 357 BC he led an expedi-
tion to Sicily, finally liberating Syracuse and the
citadel of Ortygia. He had his lieutenant Heracleides
murdered (355 BC). Attempting to govern on Pla-
tonic principles (but in effect a tyranny), he was him-
self murdered by his follower Callippus.
Dionysius I (Dionysios):
Lived c. 430–367 BC.
Tyrant of Syracuse 405–367 BC. In 405 BC he per-
suaded the assembly to elect him the leading strategos
(strategos autokrator) and give him a bodyguard. As
sole ruler, he gained control of much of Sicily and
converted Ortygia into a private citadel. In 398 BC he
started a new war with Carthage, with Sicily eventu-
ally divided between Carthage (in the west) and Syra-
cuse. From 388 BC Dionysius campaigned in Magna
Graecia, gaining control over much of that territory.
From 383 BC he again fought Carthage, but was
heavily defeated at the battle of Cronium (winter 376
BC) and was forced to cede some territory. He began
a third war in 368 BC but died the following year.
Dionysius II (Dionysios):
Tyrant of Syracuse
367–343/342 BC. Eldest son of Dionysius I. He made
immediate peace with Carthage and welcomed
philosophers to his court. When Dionysius II was in
Italy, Dion seized Syracuse and the citadel of Ortygia
(355 BC). Dionysius II held Rhegium until c. 351 BC
and Locri Epizephyrii until 347/346 BC. He regained
Syracuse in 346 BC, but was blockaded at Ortygia
and surrendered to Timoleon in 343 BC. He lived in
exile at Corinth for many years.
Dorieus (Dorieus):
Died after 510 BC. Half brother
of King Cleomenes I. When his claim for the throne
was rejected, he and his supporters left Sparta to col-
orize north Africa. Expelled by the Carthaginians,
they founded a settlement in west Sicily, but were
later killed by the Carthaginians.
Draco (Drakon):
Circa 620 BC. An Athenian law-
giver who apparently gave Athens its first written
laws. He may also have established a constitution
based on the franchise of hoplites. Though he prob-
ably made laws only for particular crimes, the penal-
ties were very severe (draconian), and Solon later
repealed all his laws except for the ones addressing
homicide.

Ducetius (Douketios):
Died 440 BC. A hellenized
leader in eastern Sicily, he formed the native Sicel
communities into a league. Between 459 and 451 BC,
he founded new Sicel cities and established Menaenum
as his hilltop capital. Later he moved down from the
hill to Palice. In 451 BC he captured Aetna and came
into conﬂict with Acragas and Syracuse. He was
defeated in 450 BC and exiled to Corinth by the Syra-
cusans, but returned ﬁve years later to found a new city
at Caleacte with the approval of Syracuse.
Epaminondas (Epameinondas):
Died 362 BC. A
Theban general and politician. At peace negotiations
in 371 BC, Epaminondas wanted peace to be ratiﬁed
in the name of all Boeotia, but this was refused and
he withdrew. An army was therefore sent by Sparta
to invade Boeotia, but was decisively defeated at the
battle of Leuctra (371 BC). This victory of the The-
bans under Epaminondas brought Spartan military
supremacy to an end. The following year (370/369
BC) he invaded the Peloponnese to assist Arcadia
against Sparta and also liberated Messenia and
founded Messene. Further invasions of the Pelopon-
nese took place under him in 369 and 366 BC. When
war broke out again in Arcadia, he won an indecisive
victory at Mantinea (362 BC), but died of his wounds,
which ended Theban supremacy.
Ephialtes (Ephialtes):
Died 461 BC. Athenian
statesman who replaced Themistocles as the leading
democratic politician in opposition to Cimon. He
prosecuted several members of the Areopagus and
tried to prevent assistance to Sparta during its war
against the helots in 462 BC. With the help of Peri-
cles in 462/461 BC, he proposed laws reducing the
powers of the Areopagus. He was murdered in 461
BC and buried in the Kerameikos at Athens.
Ephialtes of Trachis (Ephialtes):
In 480 BC he
allegedly showed Xerxes the path by which the Per-
sians outﬂanked Leonidas at Thermopylae (ﬁg. 2.4).
Epitadeus (Epitadeios):
A Spartan ephor who
introduced laws after 404 BC allowing transfer of
property.
Eratosthenes of Athens (Eratosthenes):
Lived late
5th century BC. He was an oligarch in 411 BC and
became one of the Thirty Tyrants. After their fall
(403 BC), he was prosecuted for murder by the orator
Lysias, but was acquitted.
Eubulus (Euboulos):
Lived c. 405–c. 335 BC. A
major Athenian politician, especially in the 340s BC,
whose career is poorly documented. As a theoric mag-
istrate, he assumed control of Athenian ﬁnances; his
ﬁscal policies allowed increased revenue to be spent
on public works and shipbuilding rather than non-
essential military operations. He advocated a Com-
mon Peace of Greek states against Philip II of
Macedonia. After the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), no
more is heard of Eubulus, and by 330 BC he had died.
Eumenes I (Eumenes):
Ruler (never king) of
Pergamum 263–241 BC, and nephew of Philetaerus.
He was originally subordinate to Antiochus I whom
he defeated near Sardis in 262 BC with the help of
Ptolemy II. Eumenes greatly extended his frontiers,
and bought immunity for Pergamum from maraud-
ing Gauls.
Eumenes II Soter (Eumenes, Savior):
King of
Pergamum 197–159 BC. Eldest son of Attalus I, he
continued his father’s policies of cooperation with
Rome, particularly against Antiochus III. Through
the goodwill of Rome he acquired much new terri-
tory. He incited the Third Macedonian War
(171–168 BC) between Rome and Macedonia, but
was suspected by the Romans of negotiating secretly
with Perseus of Macedonia. His brother Attalus II
succeeded him.
Eumenes of Cardia (Eumenes):
Lived c. 362–
316/315 BC. He was secretary to Philip II of Mace-
donia and Alexander the Great; on Alexander’s death
(323 BC), he was appointed satrap of Cappadocia. In
the wars of the Successors he supported Perdiccas as
rightful heir. After Perdiccas was killed (321/320 BC),
Eumenes was besieged for a year by Antigonus I.
When the siege finally lifted, he continued the war
against Antigonus I on behalf of the regent Poly-
perchon. His own troops betrayed him, and he was
executed.
Eurybiades (Eurybiades):
The ﬁrst recorded Spar-
tan admiral of the Peloponnesian League. In 480 BC

Xerxes’ Persian navy at the battles of Artemisium
(Persian victory) and Salamis (Greek victory).
Eurypontids (Eurypontidai):
The junior royal house
at Sparta.
Euthydemus I (Euthudemos):
King of Bactria c.
227–200/190 BC, after seizing the throne from
Diodotus II. In 208 BC he was attacked and besieged
by Antiochus III. Euthydemus agreed to provide the
Seleucid army with supplies, while Antiochus recog-
nized him as the rightful ruler. Large numbers of his
coins have been found.
Evagoras (Euagoras):
Lived c. 435–374/373 BC.
King of Salamis in Cyprus from 411 BC. Through
close relations with Athens, he strengthened Hel-
lenism in Cyprus. His court received many Athenian
exiles, including Conon in 405 BC. Evagoras clashed
with Persia, resulting in his defeat in the naval battle
of Citium in 381 BC, when he had to sue for peace
after 10 years of ﬁghting. He was assassinated in a
private quarrel.
Gelon (Gelon):
Lived c. 540–478 BC. Tyrant of
Gela (and later Syracuse) 491–478 BC. He was cav-
alry commander under the tyrant Hippocrates and
guardian to his sons. On Hippocrates’ death in 491
BC, Gelon seized power. In 485 BC he captured Syra-
cuse and transferred his power there, leaving his
brother Hieron in charge at Gela. Syracuse became
the leading Hellenic power at that time. With
Theron (tyrant of Acragas), he defeated a huge
Carthaginian expedition under Hamilcar at the bat-
tle of Himera in 480 BC, apparently the same day as
the Greeks defeated the Persians at Salamis.
Gyges (Gyges):
King of Lydia c. 685–687 BC. He
seized the Lydian throne and founded the Merm-
nadae dynasty, of which Croesus was the last mem-
ber. He began the conquest of the Greek cities of the
Ionian coast and sent rich offerings to Delphi.
Archilochus called him “tyrant,” the ﬁrst recorded
use of the term in Greek.
Gylippus (Gylippos):
Late-5th-century BC Spartan
general. He was sent in 414 BC to help Syracuse,
which was besieged by Athens. He destroyed the
Athenian ﬂeet and army in 413 BC. In 404 BC he was
accused of embezzlement and went into exile (or
committed suicide).
Hamilcar (Amilkas; Punic Abd-Melkart):
Died 480
BC. A Carthaginian general who invaded Sicily to
expel Theron of Acragas from Himera. His invasion
was possibly intended to coincide with that of Xerxes
in Greece. His army was destroyed at the battle of
Himera by Theron and Gelon (480 BC), and he was
killed.
Harpalus (Harpalos):
Lived c. 355–323 BC. A
Macedonian noble and close friend of Alexander the
Great, he was an unreliable paymaster of Alexander’s
Persian expedition. In 333 BC he ﬂed to Greece, but
was reinstated by Alexander in 331 BC. During
Alexander’s absence in India (327–325 BC), Harpalus
was entrusted with the treasury at Babylon, but led
an extravagant, possibly treasonable, lifestyle. On
Alexander’s return, he ﬂed to Athens (324 BC) with
money and soldiers. He bribed various politicians
there, including Demosthenes. He was imprisoned
and his money stored on the Acropolis, but he
escaped to Crete, where he was killed by Thibron,
one of his ofﬁcers. Half his money was found to be
missing, and Demosthenes’ career was ended.
Hegesippus (Hegesippos, nicknamed Krobulos—top-
knot—because of his hairstyle):
Lived c. 390–c. 325
BC. An Athenian politician and contemporary of
Demosthenes, he was extremely opposed to Philip II
of Macedonia, including his offer to renegotiate the
Peace of Philocrates. His speech On Halonnesus (once
thought to be a speech of Demosthenes) demon-
strates his opposition. He was still alive after the bat-
tle of Chaeronea (338 BC).
Hephaestion (Hephaistion):
Lived c. 356–324 BC.
A Macedonian noble and general, and Alexander the
Great’s closest companion. Alexander awarded him
the revived Persian position of chiliarch. He died
suddenly of fever, and Alexander may never have
recovered from grief.
Hermias (Hermeias):
Died 341 BC. He was a
tyrant of Atarneus in Asia Minor from c. 355 BC.

Once a student of the Academy, he encouraged
philosophers at his court, including Aristotle who
married his niece. At Aristotle’s instigation, he nego-
tiated with Philip II of Macedonia. He was conse-
quently arrested by Mentor of Rhodes (a mercenary
leader) and taken to Artaxerxes III, who executed
him.
Hermocrates (Hermokrates):
Died 407 BC. A Syra-
cusan leader who urged all Sicilian Greeks to resist
Athenian interference. In 415 BC he was one of the
generals who opposed the Athenian expedition. In
412 BC he was commander of a Syracusan ﬂeet sent to
help Sparta; he lost all his ships at the battle of Cyzi-
cus (410 BC) and was banished from Syracuse. In 408
BC he returned to Sicily to ﬁght the Carthaginians;
the following year he attempted to take Syracuse but
was killed. His daughter married Dionysius I.
Hieron I (Hieron):
Tyrant of Syracuse 478–467/466
BC. He was originally appointed ruler of Gela by his
brother Gelon. On Gelon’s death, Hieron became
tyrant of Syracuse as well, despite the claims of his
brother Polyzelus. In Sicily he destroyed Catana and
refounded it as Aetna with 10,000 new settlers (475
BC). In Italy he prevented Anaxilas of Rhegium from
attacking Locri Epixephyrii and acted against Cro-
ton (477 BC); in 474 BC he won a decisive naval bat-
tle over the Etruscans at Cumae and founded a
colony at Pithecusae. In 472 BC he overthrew the
tyranny at Acragas. His court was frequented by poets
and philosophers, including Aeschylus, Simonides and
Epicharmus. Several victories by his chariots in the
Olympic and Pythian Games were celebrated in odes
by Pindar and Bacchylides.
Hieron II (Hieron):
Lived c. 306–215 BC. King of
Syracuse c. 270–215 BC. He was a lieutenant of
Pyrrhus of Epirus, then became strategos in Syracuse.
He was hailed as king c. 270 BC and reigned for 54
years, during which time Syracuse experienced peace
and prosperity. He was defeated by the Mamertines
(mercenaries settled by Agathocles in Syracuse), but
defeated them at the battle of the Longanus River c.
265 BC. In 264 BC Hieron unsuccessfully resisted the
Roman seizure of Messana for the Mamertines. He
concluded an alliance with the Romans in 263 BC for
the remainder of his reign, assisting them through-
out their Punic Wars with Carthage. He also main-
tained ties with the rest of the Greek world.
Hippias (Hippias):
Tyrant of Athens 527–510 BC,
who succeeded his father Peisistratus. He was origi-
nally a benign ruler who reduced taxation and
allowed members of leading families to hold the
eponymous archonship. He became increasingly
unpopular, and his brother Hipparchus was assassi-
nated in 514 BC. In 510 BC Hippias was forced by the
Spartans into exile at Sigeum. He later went to the
court of Darius I and accompanied the Persian expe-
dition of 490 BC. He was at the battle of Marathon,
but no record of him exists after this.
Hippocrates of Gela (Hippokrates):
Tyrant of Gela
498–491 BC. He succeeded his brother Cleander
(assassinated 498 BC) and conquered most of eastern
Sicily, including Naxus, Leontini and Zancle. He
failed to gain Syracuse and died the following year.
Histiaeus (Histiaios):
Died 493 BC. Tyrant of
Miletus. He assisted Darius I in his campaign against
Scythia (513–512 BC) by guarding the bridge of boats
across the Danube. He was rewarded with Myrcinus
in Thrace. He later went to Susa (the Persian capi-
tal), while his son-in-law Aristagoras ruled Miletus.
Both were probably responsible for inciting the Ion-
ian Revolt in 499 BC; Darius allowed Histiaeus to
return to Ionia to quell the uprising, but he was
unsuccessful and retreated to Byzantium where he
became a pirate. In 494 or 493 BC he was captured
and executed by the Persian satrap Artaphernes.
Hyperbolus (Hyperbolos):
Died 411 BC. An Athen-
ian demagogue during the Peloponnesian War, he
was strategos in 425/424 BC and represented Athens
at the Amphictyonic Council at Delphi in 422 BC.
He became important as leader of the people after
Cleon’s death (422 BC). He opposed the Peace of
Nicias (421 BC), and in 418 BC he proposed the
revival of ostracism, expecting to remove Nicias or
Alcibiades. Instead, he was himself ostracized (417
or 415 BC). He went to Samos and was murdered by
oligarchs.
Hyperides (Hypereides):
Lived 390–322 BC. He was a
professional speechwriter and later a public prosecutor

who was constantly hostile to Macedonia. He sup-
ported Demosthenes, and in 343 BC he successfully
prosecuted Philocrates for corruption in the peace
negotiations with Philip II (343 BC). After the battle
of Chaeronea, he suggested extreme measures and
was prosecuted by Demades for illegality. Hyperides
was one of the prosecutors of Demosthenes in the
Harpalus affair (324 BC). Hyperides was largely
responsible for the Lamian War (323–322 BC). After
the battle of Crannon in 322 BC, Antipater demanded
his surrender, and Hyperides was executed.
Iphicrates (Iphikrates):
Floruit 390–355 BC. An
Athenian general who led a company of peltasts that
destroyed a Spartan hoplite battalion near Corinth in
390 BC. He was responsible for establishing the
importance of the peltasts. He was active in the
Corinthian War (395–386 BC), and after 387/386 BC
he served as a mercenary commander for Cotys of
Thrace and married his daughter. He was also sent
by Athens to ﬁght for Persia against Egypt. Back in
Athens (373 BC), he was sent to help Corcyra against
a Spartan invasion. In 367–364 BC he unsuccessfully
attempted to recover Amphipolis and afterward
returned to Thrace. In 356 BC he commanded the
Athenian ﬂeet along with Timotheus at the battle of
Embata against Chios. The battle was lost, and he
was prosecuted but acquitted.
Jason (Iason):
Tyrant of Pherae in Thessaly c.
385–370 BC. He took control of all Thessaly, win-
ning Pharsalus, the last important city, in 374 BC. He
mediated between Thebes and Sparta after the battle
of Leuctra (371 BC). In 370 BC he caused alarm by
announcing his plans to lead his entire Thessalian
army to the Pythian Games at Delphi. His purpose is
not certain, but he was assassinated beforehand and
was succeeded by his nephew Alexander.
Lamachus (Lamakhos):
Died 414 BC. An Athenian
general who was strategos c. 435 BC, and so well
known by 425 BC that he was caricatured by Aristo-
phanes in the Acharnians. Along with Alcibiades and
Nicias, he was appointed in 415 BC to lead the expe-
dition to Sicily, but was killed in a skirmish.
Laodice I (Laodike):
Seleucid queen 261–c. 253
BC. She married Antiochus II and had two sons
(Seleucus II and Antiochus Hierax) and two daugh-
ters. Antiochus II married Berenice Syra (daughter of
Ptolemy II) in 252 BC and favored their son (born
251 BC) as heir-apparent. On the death of Antiochus
II (246 BC), a war of succession ensued (Third Syrian
War or Laodicean War) to 241 BC. Laodice’s sup-
porters murdered Berenice and her son, allowing her
son Seleucus II to succeed as king.
Leonidas (Leonidas):
Agiad king of Sparta 488–
480 BC. He succeeded his stepbrother Cleomenes I,
having married his daughter Gorgo. While Spartans
were celebrating the Carnea, he marched to Ther-
mopylae (Hot Gates) as commander of an allied
Greek army of about 6,000 or 7,000 men, occupying
the strategic pass from north to central and southern
Greece to stop the Persians invading central Greece
(fig. 2.4). Ephialtes showed the Persians under
Xerxes a mountain path around the pass. Leonidas
dismissed his allies in the army, but he himself
remained and was killed along with 300 Spartans. A
hero cult was later established at Sparta.
Leonnatus (Leonnatos):
Lived c. 358–322 BC.
Macedonian general and satrap. In 332 BC he
became personal bodyguard to Alexander the Great.
After 328 BC he was a general, with distinguished
service in India and during the return to the west.
After Alexander’s death (323 BC), he became satrap of
Hellespontine Phrygia and guardian of Alexander IV.
He assisted Antipater in the Lamian War (323–322
BC), but was defeated and killed in Thessaly.
Leosthenes (Leosthenes):
Died 323/322 BC. An
Athenian general, he became leader at Taenarum
(south Laconia) of 8,000 mercenaries disbanded
from Alexander’s army. These troops were com-
manded by him in a Greek army against the Mace-
donians in the Lamian War (323–322 BC). The
Greeks were initially successful, but Leosthenes was
killed when besieging Antipater at Lamia.
Lycophron (Lykophron):
Tyrant of Pherae c.
406–390 BC, about whom little is known. He tried to
control all Thessaly and defeated Larissa and other
cities on 3 September, 404 BC. However, he was still
at war in 395 BC, and his success cannot be deter-
mined. Jason may have been his son.

Lycurgus (Lykourgos):
Lived c. 390–c. 325/324 BC.
A prominent Athenian statesman and orator, a mem-
ber of the Eteobutadae clan. He controlled Athens’
ﬁnances from the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) until
326 BC, increasing the revenue. He undertook an
extensive building program at Athens, and the navy
was substantially enlarged at this time. He supported
Demosthenes’ policy of opposing Macedonia, and in
335 BC his supporters refused to surrender him when
Alexander the Great demanded the arrest of those hos-
tile to Macedonia. Only one speech survives, Against
Leocrates. He was responsible for erecting statues of
Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides and for an ofﬁcial
edition of their works. Much evidence for Lycurgus
comes from Plutarch’s Lives of the Ten Orators.
Lycurgus of Sparta (Lykourgos):
Possibly 7th cen-
tury BC or earlier. The legendary founder of Spartan
political reforms and its social system (agoge), includ-
ing education and military training. It is possible that
the social and political institutions were a gradual
development from earliest times, and that Lycurgus
as a single legislator never existed.
Lydiadas (Lydiadas):
Died 227 BC. Tyrant of Mega-
lopolis c. 243–235 BC. In 251 BC he was a commander
of the Achaean Confederacy against Sparta, and later
declared himself tyrant to protect his city. He abdi-
cated in 235 BC, and Megalopolis joined the Achaean
Confederacy. Lydiadas was appointed strategos of the
Confederacy several times. Cleomenes III moved
against Megalopolis, and Lydiadas was killed at the
battle of Ladocea, when he disobeyed orders with a
cavalry charge against the Spartans in order to save
Megalopolis.
Lysander (Lysandros):
Died 395 BC. A Spartan
leader who claimed descent from the Heraclidae. He

2.4 The pass of Thermopylae, where the Spartan king Leonidas was killed defending it against the Persians in 480 BC

was appointed naval commander of the Spartan ﬂeet
for 408/407 BC. He won the friendship and support
of Darius II and defeated the Athenian fleet with
Persian support at the battle of Notium in 406 BC. In
405 BC he destroyed the Athenian fleet at Aegos-
potami and blockaded Piraeus until Athens surren-
dered in spring 404 BC. Lysander then installed a
pro-Spartan oligarchy (Thirty Tyrants). His policies
of governing cities formerly allied to Athens pro-
voked opposition from the Spartan government, and
his policies were reversed. Lysander tried to change
the Spartan constitution to allow for an elected
monarchy. He secured the kingship for Agesilaus II
(399 BC), but then found himself isolated. At the start
of the Corinthian War, he invaded Boeotia but was
killed at the siege of Haliartus.
Lysimachus (Lysimakhos):
Lived c. 360–281 BC. A
member of Alexander the Great’s Bodyguard and one
of his Successors. After Alexander’s death (323 BC), he
governed Thrace and northwest Asia Minor. From 315
to 311 BC, he joined Cassander and Ptolemy I against
Antigonus I. In 309 BC he founded Lysimachia as his
new capital. In 306 BC he proclaimed himself king of
Thrace. In 301 BC he joined Cassander, Ptolemy I and
Seleucus I in defeating Antigonus I and Demetrius I
Poliorcetes at the battle of Ipsus. As a reward he was
granted northern and central Asia Minor. Circa 299
BC he married Arsinoë II (daughter of Ptolemy I),
divorcing his wife Amastris. He was taken prisoner for
a short period in 292 BC by tribes north of the Danube
in Thrace. In 288 BC he took eastern Macedonia from
Demetrius I Poliorcetes, and in 285 BC he won west-
ern Macedonia and Thessaly from Pyrrhus, becoming
the strongest of the Successors. His former ally Seleu-
cus I defeated and killed him at the battle of Coru-
pedium, and his kingdom was broken up.
Mardonius (Mardonios; Persian Mardunija):
Died
479 BC. A Persian general, nephew and son-in-law of
Darius I. He took control in Ionia after the Ionian
Revolt, replacing the tyrants with democratic govern-
ments. He subsequently took Thrace and Thasos
(492 BC). According to Herodotus, he was responsi-
ble for Xerxes’ plans to invade Greece. After the bat-
tle of Salamis (480 BC), Mardonius was left in charge
of Persian forces. He was defeated and killed at the
battle of Plataea.
Mausolus (Mausolos):
Died 353/352 BC. Satrap of
Caria (southwest Asia Minor) 377/376–353/352 BC,
he ruled virtually independently of Persia. He
extended his rule over the Greek coastal cities in
Ionia and over Lycia and moved his capital from
Mylasa to Halicarnassus. He caused Rhodes, Cos and
Chios to revolt from the Second Athenian League,
resulting in the Social War (357–355 BC). Rhodes
and Cos became part of his kingdom. On his death,
he was succeeded by his widow and sister Artemisia
II. His tomb, the Mausoleum, was one of the Seven
Wonders of the World.
Megacles (Megakles):
Sixth-century BC Athenian
statesman of the Alcmaeonid family, son of
Alcmaeon and father of Cleisthenes and Hip-
pocrates. He married Agariste (daughter of Cleis-
thenes of Sicyon), possibly in 575 BC. He became
leader of a political faction known as the Paraloi
(coastmen), opposing Lycurgus and Peisistratus.
When the latter became tyrant (c. 560 BC), Megacles
and Lycurgus had him expelled. Megacles became
reconciled with Peisistratus c. 550 BC and married
his daughter, although the reconciliation and mar-
riage subsequently failed.
Miltiades (Miltiades):
Lived c. 550–489 BC. An
Athenian general, he was the son of Cimon and from
the Philaidae family. He was sent to the Thracian
Chersonese c. 524 BC to rule the native people as
king. He married Hegesipyle, daughter of a Thracian
king, and their son was Cimon. Miltiades participated
in the invasion of Scythia by Darius I (513–512 BC),
but he supported the Ionian Revolt against Persia.
When that failed he ﬂed to Athens (493 BC), where he
was prosecuted and acquitted of a charge of tyranny
in Thrace. He led the army at the battle of Marathon
(490 BC), where he won a decisive victory over the
Persians (ﬁg. 2.5). In 489 BC he unsuccessfully led the
Athenian ﬂeet in a siege of the island of Paros and was
wounded. He was prosecuted by Xanthippus and
condemned to death. He died of his injuries.
Mithridates II (Mithridates):
King of Pontus c.
250–c. 185 BC. He possibly died c. 220 BC, with his
son Mithridates III reigning until c. 185 BC. He mar-
ried Laodice, sister of Seleucus II, but supported
Antiochus Hierax in his ﬁght against Seleucus II. He

gave gifts to Rhodes after the great earthquake of
228/227 BC, which virtually destroyed the city
including the Colossus.
Mithridates VI Eupator Dionysus (Mithridates,
Born of a Noble Father):
Lived c. 132–63 BC. King
of Pontus 120–63 BC and son of Mithridates V Euer-
getes. He was an enemy of Rome and a permanent
threat to Rome’s client kingdoms in Asia Minor. He
shared the throne with his brother, but in 112 BC he
killed his brother, imprisoned (and later murdered)
his mother, married his sister Laodice and became
sole ruler of Pontus. He attempted to expand his
kingdom, and was involved in three Mithridatic
Wars with Rome, from 88 to 63 BC. In the First
Mithridatic War (88–85 BC) he was welcomed by the
Greeks as a liberator and occupied much of the
Greek mainland, islands and Asia Minor. This led to
the siege and capture of Athens by the Roman gen-
eral Sulla in 86 BC. Mithridates was defeated by the
Romans at the battles of Chaeronea and Orchome-
nus (86/85 BC), and negotiated a peace treaty in 85
BC, which allowed him to retain Pontus. In the Sec-
ond Mithridatic War (83–82 BC) he again made
peace with Sulla, but renewed hostilities in 74 BC
(Third Mithridatic War), when he invaded Bithynia.
He committed suicide after his son Pharnaces
revolted against him.
Myronides (Myronides):
An Athenian general in
458 BC, when he defeated the Corinthians at Megara
with an army of “the oldest and the youngest,” and
again in 457 BC, when he defeated the Boeotians at
the battle of Oenophyta. It is unlikely he was the
Myronides who was sent to Sparta with Cimon and
Xanthippus (480 BC) and who served as general at
the battle of Plataea (479 BC).
Nabis (Nabis):
Eurypontid king of Sparta 207–192
BC. He was regent to the king Pelops (a minor), and
on the latter’s death (which Nabis may have caused)
he declared himself king. He continued the reforms
started by Cleomenes III. In 204–203 BC he raided
Megalopolis and in 201 BC attacked Messene. In the
Second Macedonian War (200–197 BC) he supported
Macedonia against Rome. Although Nabis was
allowed to remain in power, he had to give up Argos
and the Laconian ports. Nabis attempted to regain
his losses, but was quelled by the Roman generals
Flamininus and Philopoemon. When Aetolian troops
assassinated Nabis, Sparta lost its independence and
was incorporated in the Achaean Confederacy.
Nicanor of Stagira (Nikanor):
Lived c. 360–317
BC. A Macedonian ambassador and general. He was
a pupil (possibly with Alexander the Great) of Aris-
totle, and later married Aristotle’s daughter. He may
have commanded Alexander’s ﬂeet (334 BC), and in
324 BC he was sent to Greece with Alexander’s
decree ordering repatriation of most Greek exiles.
In 319 BC he was Cassander’s garrison commander
at Piraeus, and in 318 BC commanded Cassander’s

BC), where he won a decisive victory over the Persians. The
Doric Athenian Treasury at Delphi was possibly dedicated
after the battle. It resembled a miniature temple, with a
porch with two columns in antis and a very short cella.

fleet in the Bosphorus. He was executed by Cas-
sander for treason.
Nicias (Nikias):
Lived c. 470–413 BC. An Athenian
general and politician, he was often elected strategos
and led several military expeditions. He was known
for his immense wealth and owned hundreds of
slaves who worked the silver mines at Laurium. He
became a principal opponent of Cleon, advocating
peace with Sparta. In 423 BC he was primarily
responsible for a year’s truce, and in 421 BC he con-
cluded the eponymous Peace of Nicias, a 50-year
peace agreement between Athens and Sparta. He
subsequently opposed Alcibiades’ schemes to inter-
vene in the Peloponnese and Sicily, but was never-
theless appointed one of the generals of the Sicilian
expedition with Alcibiades and Lamachus. Alcibiades
was recalled, and Lamachus was killed, leaving
Nicias in sole charge. Due to an eclipse of the moon,
which was considered a bad omen, he failed to with-
draw in time. The Athenian ﬂeet was destroyed and
the troops defeated on land at the Assinarus River
(413 BC). Nicias was captured and executed.
Nicomedes I (Nikomedes):
King of Bithynia c.
279–c. 250 BC. He allied himself with Heraclea Pon-
tica and the cities of the Northern League against
the Seleucids. He invited the Gauls to cross the
Bosphorus and settle in Phrygia. Nicomedes
founded a capital at Nicomedia c. 260 BC. He pur-
sued hellenizing policies and coined Greek money.
Nicomedes II Epiphanes (Nikomedes, God Made
Manifest):
King of Bithynia 149–c. 127 BC. He was
sent by his father Prusias II as an envoy to Rome to
release Prusias from his war indemnity. However, he
failed to support his father and joined Attalus II of
Pergamum to seize the throne. Nicomedes subse-
quently assisted Rome against Aristonicus in
133–129 BC and was rewarded with territory in
Greater Phrygia.
Olympias (Olympias; also known as Polyxena, Myr-
tale and Stratonice):
Died 315 BC. Daughter of
Neoptolemus of Molossia (in Epirus) and mother of
Alexander the Great and Cleopatra. She married
Philip II of Macedonia in 357 BC. In 331 BC she
withdrew to Epirus, which she ruled for many years.
After Alexander’s death (323 BC), she tried to win
support against Antipater. On his death (319 BC), she
joined with Polyperchon against Cassander. She
invaded Macedonia in 317 BC, which resulted in
Philip III Arrhidaeus’ murder and his wife Eurydice’s
forced suicide. Olympias then made her grandson
Alexander IV king. Cassander invaded Macedonia
and starved Olympias into surrender at Pydna, where
she was executed.
Olympiodorus (Olympiodoros):
Floruit c. 307–280
BC. Athenian leader who was often strategos. In 306
BC his alliance with Aetolia enabled Cassander’s
attack on Athens to fail. After Athens was starved
into surrender to Demetrius I Poliorcetes (spring
295 BC), Olympiodorus was archon from 294 to 292
BC. He led a revolt in Athens in 287 BC and success-
fully attacked the Macedonian garrison on the Hill of
the Muses. With Demochares he saved Eleusis from
an attack by Antigonus Gonatas. He may also have
freed Piraeus from the Macedonians.
Onomarchus (Onomarkhos):
Died 352 BC. He was
a general of Phocis in the Third Sacred War
(355–346 BC), and was elected strategos autokrator
after the Phocian defeat at the battle of Neon (354
BC). He used temple funds from Delphi to bribe
Thessaly and to hire mercenaries. He defeated the
Boeotians and Locrians and refounded Orchomenus
in Boeotia. He also forced Philip II of Macedonia to
leave Thessaly (353 BC). When Philip again invaded
Thessaly, Onomarchus was defeated and killed by
him at the battle of the Crocus Field.
Ophellas (Ophellas):
Died 309/308 BC. An ofﬁcer
under Alexander the Great, he was sent by Ptolemy I
in 322 BC to subdue Cyrene, where he became gov-
ernor and acquired a fairly independent status. In
310/309 BC he made an alliance with Agathocles who
had crossed the Libyan Sea with numerous Atheni-
ans and colonists, intending to attack Carthage.
Ophellas lost many men in the march through the
desert; he brought troops and chariots to Agathocles,
but was murdered by him.
Parmenion (Parmenion):
Lived c. 400–330 BC. A
Macedonian noble and Philip II’s ﬁnest general. He
later accompanied Alexander the Great to Asia and
was second-in-command at the battles of Granicus
(334 BC), Issus (333 BC) and Gaugamela (331 BC). In

331/330 BC he was left to guard the Persian royal
treasure at Ecbatana when Alexander moved east.
Alexander had Parmenion murdered when his son
Philotas was tried and executed for treason.
Patrocles (Patrokles):
Lived c. 330–c. 275 BC. A
Greek commander (strategos) under Seleucus I and
Antiochus I. In 312 BC he was commander at Babylon
and assisted Seleucus I against Demetrius I Poliorcetes.
Subsequently, he probably governed the Caspian and
Bactrian areas near India. In 285 BC he undertook a
naval exploration of the Caspian Sea. The geographi-
cal information collated by him was contained in his
book the Periplous (Circumnavigation).
Pausanias (Pausanias):
Died c. 467/466 BC. A
Spartan regent 480–c. 467 BC, he was a member of
the Agiad royal family and son of King Cleombrotus.
When his uncle Leonidas died at Thermopylae (480
BC), he became a regent for his cousin Pleistarchus.
Pausanias commanded the victorious Greek land
forces at the battle of Plataea (479 BC). At Delphi he
dedicated a bronze serpent column bearing his name,
which the Spartans erased and replaced by the names
of the 31 Greek states that had fought in the battle
(ﬁgs. 1.7, 2.6). In 478 BC he recaptured Byzantium
from the Persians, but was recalled and accused of
treasonable negotiations with Xerxes. He was acquit-
ted and returned to rule Byzantium, but the Athenian
Cimon expelled him c. 476 BC. When in exile at
Colonae he was ordered to return to Sparta, where he
was accused of treason. He was acquitted but was
then suspected of instigating a rebellion amongst the
helots. He took refuge in a sanctuary of Athena,
where he starved to death.
Pausanias (Pausanias):
Agiad king of Sparta
409–395 BC and grandson of the regent Pausanias.
He first ruled as a minor (445–426 BC), when his
father Pleistoanax was temporarily deposed. Pausa-
nias persuaded the ephors to put him in charge of the
forces at Athens, replacing Lysander (403 BC). He
was responsible for withdrawing Spartan support
from the Thirty Tyrants, resulting in the restoration
of democracy at Athens (403 BC). In 395 BC he
arranged to meet up with Lysander near Haliartus in
an invasion of Boeotia; he failed to make contact, and
Lysander was killed. Pausanias was sentenced to
death and ﬂed into exile at Tegea.

general Pausanias was erased and replaced by the names

Peisander (Peisandros):
Floruit 430–411 BC. An
Athenian politician who took a leading role in the
investigation of the mutilation of the herms (415 BC).
In 411 BC he supported the pro-Spartan oligarchic
revolution, proposing the new council of the Four
Hundred. He ﬂed to the Spartans at Decelea when
the oligarchs were overthrown (410 BC) and was con-
demned for treason in his absence.
Peisistratids (Peisistratidai):
The family of Peisis-
tratus (tyrant of Athens c. 560–527 BC) whose two
sons Hippias and Hipparchus continued the tyranny.
Peisistratus or Pisistratus (Peisistratos):
Lived c.
600–527 BC. Tyrant of Athens c. 560–527 BC, he dis-
tinguished himself as a polemarch in a war against
Megara (c. 565 BC), with the capture of Nisaea (port
of Megara). In a period of unrest he became a leader
of a third political party, Hyperakrioi (the poorer hill-
men). When he was granted a bodyguard by the
Athenian people after an alleged attack, he seized the
Acropolis and declared himself tyrant. In 556/555 BC
he was expelled by the other two parties (plainsmen
and coastmen), but returned brieﬂy c. 550 BC due to
a reconciliation with Megacles, an Alcmaeonid, who
was leader of the coastmen and wanted a powerful
alliance against the plainsmen. The alliance with
Megacles and the marriage to his daughter failed, and
Peisistratus went into exile for a longer period the
same year, building up inﬂuence in the Aegean and
accumulating money. He returned with a mercenary
army, landing at Marathon and winning a battle at
Pallene (546 BC). He became tyrant until his death
and continued many of the reforms of Solon. He
granted poor farmers loans, introduced a tithe on all
produce and placated many of the nobles. He carried
out many public building works and was a patron of
the arts and literature. He gave support to the Pana-
thenaea and City Dionysia festivals and the worship
of Demeter at Eleusis. Peisistratus also pursued a
skillful foreign policy. He was considered to be a just
and humane ruler. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus
continued his policies.
Pelopidas (Pelopidas):
Lived c. 410–364 BC. A
Theban general who overthrew the oligarchy at
Thebes in the winter of 379/378 BC, recovered the
citadel from the Spartans and restored democracy. In
378 BC he was boeotarch. He won great fame in the
war against Sparta with his leadership of the Sacred
Band, especially at the battles of Tegyra (375 BC) and
Leuctra (371 BC), when the Spartans were driven out
of central Greece. In winter 370/369 BC he accom-
panied Epaminondas in his ﬁrst invasion of the Pelo-
ponnese. Later he campaigned against Alexander of
Pherae (in Thessaly) and Macedonia, both northern
enemies of Thebes. He was captured by Alexander in
368 BC but was rescued by Epaminondas. In 364 BC
he defeated Alexander at the battle of Cynoscepha-
lae, but was himself killed.
Perdiccas (Perdikkas):
Died 320 BC. A Macedon-
ian general and regent. Son of Orontes, a Macedon-
ian chieftain, he accompanied Alexander the Great to
Asia as taxiarch. In 330 BC he was promoted to the
Bodyguard, and in 324 BC he became his second-in-
command. After Alexander’s death (323 BC), he was
effectively regent of Alexander’s empire, which was
resented by Antipater, Craterus, Antigonus I and
Ptolemy I. Perdiccas invaded Egypt to eliminate
Ptolemy, but was assassinated by his own offﬁcers.
Perdiccas II (Perdikkas):
King of Macedonia c.
450/440–413 BC and son of Alexander I Philhellene.
In the 440s and 430s he fought a series of civil wars
against his brothers Alcetas and Philip, the latter
supported by Athens. When Athens founded
Amphipolis in 436 BC, Perdiccas supported the
revolt of Potidaea and the Chalcidians (432 BC), but
made his peace with Athens in 431 BC (arranged by
the Thracian king Sitalces). In 429 BC he halted an
invasion by Sitalces, and a marriage alliance was con-
tracted. He effected alliances with the Spartan gen-
eral Brasidas in 425 BC against Athens, with Athens
in 422 BC, with Sparta and Argos in 417 BC, and with
Athens in 415 BC.
Periander (Periandros):
Tyrant of Corinth c.
625–c. 585 BC, he was the son and successor of
Cypselus and one of the most famous of early tyrants
(ﬁg. 2.7), although allegedly the most cruel; he was
said to have murdered his wife. Corinth enjoyed
fame and wealth under his rule, and he appeared in
some lists of the Seven Sages of Greece. He probably
built the diolkos across the Isthmus of Corinth. He
undertook much public building at Corinth and also
H A N D B O O K

supported the arts. He founded colonies in north-
west and northeast Greece, including Potidaea. His
sons all predeceased him, and he was succeeded by
his nephew Psammetichus.
Pericles (Perikles):
Lived c. 495–429 BC. An
Athenian statesman who supported democracy (ﬁg.
2.8), he was an Alcmaeonid, the son of Xanthippus.
Pericles was leader of Athens at the peak of its power
in the 440s and 430s BC, an era called the “Periclean
Age.” In 472 BC he was choregos when Aeschylus’
Persians was produced. In 463 BC he prosecuted
Cimon for receiving bribes from Alexander I Phil-
hellene not to invade Macedonia (the feud with the
Cimonids being hereditary). In 462/461 BC he joined
Ephialtes in reducing the powers of the Areopagus.
He became the most prominent leader after Cimon’s
ostracism and Ephialtes’ murder (both 461 BC), and
the Delian League (an alliance formed against the
Persians) was gradually transformed into an Athen-
ian Empire under his leadership.
Not much is known of him in the 450s BC, but he
did propose the recall of Cimon (450 BC) and possibly
initiated the construction of the Long Walls
(458–456 BC). In 454/453 BC he was strategos, cam-
paigning in the Corinthian Gulf against Sicyon and
Oeniadae. In 451 BC he introduced a law restricting
citizenship to those whose parents were both Athen-
ian. After 451 BC he was elected strategos 15 times in
succession. He led a campaign to restore Delphi to
the Phocians (c. 448 BC). In 448–447 BC he proposed
a congress of all Greek states to consider universal
peace and the rebuilding of temples destroyed by the
Persians, but it was opposed by Sparta. He was build-
ing commissioner for the Parthenon (begun 447 BC),
the Propylaea and other important buildings of this
period (ﬁg. 2.9). In 446 BC he harshly suppressed a
revolt in Euboea, and in winter 446/445 BC he gained
Sparta’s recognition of the Athenian Empire with the
so-called Thirty Years’ Peace. Pericles planted many
cleruchies to strengthen the Athenian Empire, partic-
ularly in the Hellespont, and he established an impor-
tant colony at Thurii c. 443 BC to spread Athenian
inﬂuence in Italy. In 443 BC his most bitter enemy
Thucydides (son of Melesias) was ostracized, leaving
Pericles with no effective opponent and enabling him
to be elected strategos annually until his death. After a
nine months’ siege (440–439 BC), he suppressed
Samos, which had revolted from the Athenian
Empire. He founded a colony at Amphipolis in 436
BC and led an expedition to establish Athenian inﬂu-
ence in the Black Sea area.
When the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431
BC, Pericles was responsible for the entire Athenian
strategy. When Attica was invaded and plague broke
out in Athens in 430 BC, he was removed from ofﬁce,

tried for embezzlement and ﬁned, but shortly after-
ward (probably spring 429 BC) he was again elected
strategos. However, he died soon after of plague. His
younger son Pericles was illegitimate (son of his mis-
tress Aspasia), but was granted citizenship out of
respect for his father since his other sons by his wife
had died of plague. This son was put to death after
the battle of Arginusae in 406 BC.
Perseus (Perseus):
Lived c. 213/212–166 BC. King
of Macedonia 179–168 BC and the elder son of Philip
V, he fought against the Romans (199 BC) and Aeto-
lians (189 BC). He plotted against his pro-Roman
brother Demetrius, who was murdered by Philip V in
180 BC. In 179 BC Perseus renewed an old alliance
with Rome and extended Macedonian inﬂuence and
prestige. He married Laodice, daughter of Seleucus
IV, and gave his half sister Apama in marriage to Pru-
sias II of Bithynia. In 174 BC he visited the oracle at
Delphi with his army. Rome thought that Perseus was
about to declare war, a fear encouraged by Eumenes
II of Pergamum who went to Rome to complain of
Perseus. On his return, Eumenes was nearly killed
near Delphi, blamed by Eumenes on Perseus, which
precipitated the Third Macedonian War (171–168
BC). Perseus was initially successful, but was ﬁnally
defeated by the Roman general Aemilius Paullus with
troops from Pergamum at the battle of Pydna (168
BC). Perseus was taken to Rome to appear in Paullus’
triumph and died two years later.
Peucestas (Peukestas):
Lived c. 360 to after
317/316 BC. A Macedonian general and satrap, he
saved Alexander the Great’s life in the Indian expedi-
tion (325 BC) and was subsequently promoted to the
Bodyguard and to satrap of Persis (325–324 BC). He
adopted Iranian dress and learned Persian. In 323 BC
he assembled 20,000 troops for the Macedonian
army. After Alexander’s death (323 BC) he retained
Persis. He supported Eumenes of Cardia in his war
against Antigonus I, but deserted him at Gabiene
(317/316 BC). Antigonus spared his life, but Peuces-
tas was removed from his satrapy and disappeared
from history.
Phalaris (Phalaris):
Tyrant of Acragas soon after the
city’s foundation (c. 580 BC). He was renowned for his
cruelty, allegedly roasting his enemies alive in a hollow
bronze bull. He was replaced by an oligarchy.
Pharnabazus (Pharnabazos):
Persian commander,
and hereditary satrap of Phrygia c. 413–370 BC, he
was a rival of the Lydian satrap Tissaphernes. He ini-
tially supported Sparta against Athens in the Pelo-

ponnesian War, but in 408 BC encouraged the Athe-
nians to undertake negotiations with Darius II,
which broke down when Cyrus the Younger arrived
in Ionia in 408 BC. Cyrus’ defeat in 401 BC led to a
war between Pharnabazus and Sparta from 400 BC.
The Spartans were defeated at the battle of Cnidus
by a Persian ﬂeet under the Athenian Conon (394
BC). Pharnabazus was recalled to the Persian court at
Susa and married a daughter of Artaxerxes II. He was
sent in 385–383 BC and again in 374 BC to reconquer
Egypt with the aid of the Athenian mercenary com-
mander Iphicrates. He failed on both occasions and
died soon after.
Pharnaces I (Pharnakes):
King of Pontus c. 185–c.
156 BC. He went to war with most of the other king-
doms in Asia Minor when extending his own terri-
tory. He seized Sinope (c. 183 BC) and invaded
Cappadocia. The Romans were unable to prevent his
aggression, and numerous rulers formed alliances
against him. In 179 BC he was forced to surrender
most of his gains. He kept Sinope as his capital and
founded Pharnaceia farther east.
Phayllus (Phaullos):
Died 351 BC. A general of
Phocis in the Third Sacred War (355–346 BC), he
succeeded his brother Onomarchus after he was
killed at the battle of the Crocus Field (352 BC).
With assistance from Sparta, Athens and Achaea,
Phayllus occupied Thermopylae, preventing Philip
II of Macedonia from marching farther south (352
BC). Philip withdrew, and Phayllus waged war against
Thebes, but died of illness shortly thereafter.

the battle of Marathon to request the help of the
Spartan army. He undertook the 125-mile (200km)
journey in two days, and had a vision of Pan on his
return journey. The modern marathon race is based
on a legend that he ran from Athens to Marathon to
join in the battle, then ran back to Athens with the
words “Greetings, we win!” and dropped dead.
Pheidon (Pheidon):
King of Argos, possibly early
7th century BC. Facts about him, including his dates,
are uncertain. He was a Heraclid, allegedly descended
from the original Dorian conqueror Temenus. He
may have made himself tyrant and was probably a
successful military leader. He is known for standard-
izing weights and measures, for seizing the running
of the Olympian games from Elis and for extending
Argive domination over the northeast Peloponnese.
He may have been responsible for the defeat of the
invading Spartans at the battle of Hysiae (669 BC)
and for introducing coins.
Philaids or Philaidae (Philaidai):
One of the most
distinguished Athenian families who claimed descent
from Ajax. They included Cypselus (archon early 6th
century BC), Miltiades (son of Cypselus), Cimon,
Miltiades (son of Cimon) and Cimon (son of Milti-
ades).
Philetaerus (Philhetairos):
Lived c. 343–263 BC.
Founder of the Attalid dynasty at Pergamum. He was
descended from a Macedonian father Attalus and a
Paphlagonian mother. He was an officer of
Antigonus I, but deserted him for Lysimachus in 302
BC. He was put in charge of Pergamum, where Lysi-
machus stored a large treasure. In 282 BC he deserted
to Seleucus I. Lysimachus died at the battle of Coru-
pedium (281 BC) and Seleucus I was assassinated
soon after. Philetaerus was left as a fairly indepen-
dent ruler of Pergamum under the Seleucids, and
may have extended his territory. He defended Perga-
mum against Galatian invaders of Asia Minor
(278–276 BC). On his death he was succeeded by his
nephew (and adopted son) Eumenes I.
Philip II (Philippos):
Lived 383/382–336 BC. King
of Macedonia 359–336 BC. Youngest son of Amyntas
(king of Macedonia c. 393–370/369 BC) and Eury-
dice. As a boy he was sent as a hostage to Thebes,
where he learned much from the general Epaminon-
das. He married seven wives (polygamy was consid-
ered desirable), and his third wife was Olympias (a
Molossian princess from Epirus); their son Alexander
the Great was born in 356 BC. He married Cleopatra
(Eurydice) in 337 BC, provoking ill-feeling between
himself and Olympias and Alexander. Philip suc-
ceeded to the throne after his brother Perdiccas III
was killed in battle. He reorganized the Macedonian
army and defeated the Paeonians (early 358 BC) and
then the Illyrians. In 357 BC he captured the strate-
gically important Amphipolis. From spring 356 BC
he besieged Potidaea, which was given to Olynthus,
and colonized Crenides, changing its name to
Philippi. In 354 BC he besieged and captured
Methone (where he lost an eye from a catapult bolt),
razing it to the ground.
In 354 BC the Thessalian League asked Philip for
assistance against the tyrants of Pherae in central
Thessaly. He and the Thessalian allies were defeated
twice in 353 BC (the only defeats of his career), once
by Onomarchus who drove Philip from Thessaly. In
352 BC he returned to Thessaly and defeated and
killed Onomarchus at the battle of the Crocus Field
near Pagasae (port of Pherae). He suppressed the
tyranny at Pherae and became archon of the Thes-
salian League, bringing Thessaly under Macedonian
control. He marched toward Thermopylae, but the
defense of Thermopylae by the Phocians and allies
prevented him from marching farther south. From
351 to 350 BC he acted against the Illyrians and
Epirus and gradually enlarged his ﬂeet, which came
to harass Athens’ trade and territory. In 349–348 BC
he attacked and annexed Chalcidice, and instigated a
revolt in Euboea against Athens. In 349 BC he also
attacked Olynthus, which fell in 348 BC, despite
Athenian assistance; it was razed to the ground and
its inhabitants sold into slavery.
Philip’s threat to invade Phocis led Athens to
make peace with him (Peace of Philocrates) in 346
BC, with the agreement that Athens and Macedonia
would retain the territories currently held. Phocis
was not mentioned in the treaty. Athens retained the
Thracian Chersonese, but lost Amphipolis and was
not able to include Phocis. In 346 BC Philip marched
south, took Thermopylae and crushed the Phocians,
replacing Phocis on the Amphictyonic Council.
Philip presided over the Pythian Games that year. In

T O L I F E

76

345 BC he campaigned against Illyria, and in 344 and
342 BC against Thessaly. In 343/342 BC he inter-
vened in Epirus, installing his brother-in-law Alexan-
der as king of Epirus. He campaigned in Thrace,
making it a tribute-paying province of Macedonia in
342 BC and removing its king. He founded several
cities there, including Philippopolis (Plovdiv). This
action threatened Athenian interests in the Thracian
Chersonese, and Demosthenes delivered his Third
Philippic against Philip (341 BC), urging military
action. Philip’s attack in 340 BC on Perinthus and
Byzantium, which had both revolted from the Mace-
donian alliance, precipitated Athens’ declaration of
war (340 BC). He withdrew from the siege of Byzan-
tium into Thrace (340/339 BC) to campaign against
the Scythians, returning in the summer of 339 BC.
The Amphictyonic Council invited Philip in late 339
BC to lead the Fourth Sacred War against the Locri-
ans of Amphissa for sacrilege. Philip marched south
around November 339 BC and took Elatea in Phocis.
Demosthenes arranged an alliance between Athens
and Thebes to prevent Philip from invading Attica.
Philip defeated this alliance at the battle of
Chaeronea on 2 August, 338 BC, with his son Alexan-
der the Great leading the cavalry (ﬁg. 2.1).
Philip did not impose pro-Macedonian rule in the
newly conquered cities, except in Thebes, which had
to give up Oropus and accept a Macedonian garri-
son. A congress was held at Corinth in 337 BC, where
the Greeks established a Common Peace. The
League of Corinth was also established, a body that
Philip intended to use for military support to attack
Persia. Philip was appointed strategos autokrator, and
arrangements were made for an invasion, but Philip
was assassinated by Pausanias at the celebration of
his daughter Cleopatra’s marriage to King Alexander

of Epirus (ﬁg. 1.10). This was possibly a plot of his
deposed wife Olympias to secure the succession for
her son Alexander the Great. Philip was buried in a
tomb at Aegae (Vergina).
Philip III Arrhidaeus (Philippos Arrhidaios):
Lived
c. 358–317 BC. Son of Philip II and Philinna of
Larissa, he became joint king of Macedonia with
Alexander IV from 323 BC, until he was captured and
murdered by Olympias. He was apparently mentally
disabled.
Philip V (Philippos):
Lived 238–179 BC. King of
Macedonia 221–179 BC. Son of Demetrius II and
Phthia-Chryseis, he was adopted by Antigonus II
Doson who ruled as a regent. Philip’s actions were
largely responsible for bringing Greece under Roman
domination. As a boy he visited Aratus of Sicyon to
learn about the Greeks and the Achaean Confeder-
acy. He acquired renown in the so-called Social War
of 220–217 BC, acting with the Hellenic League
against Aetolia, Sparta and Elis. He was incited by
Demetrius of Pharos to attack Roman fleets off
Illyria in 216 BC, when Rome was involved in the
Second Punic War. In 215 BC Philip V made an
alliance with Hannibal, ending any possibility of
friendship with Rome. The First Macedonian War
ensued (215–205 BC) but was inconclusive. Philip
began to attack Messene in 215 BC, and from 213 to
212 BC he continued to harass the cities of Illyria and
build up the navy he had lost off Illyria in 214 BC.
Rome and Aetolia attacked Philip sporadically from
212/211 to 208 BC, assisted by Attalus I of Perga-
mum from 209 BC. In 207 BC, Philip sacked Ther-
mum and forced terms upon Aetolia in the following
year. The First Macedonian War ended inconclu-
sively with the Peace of Phoenice (205 BC).
In 202 BC Philip V made an alliance with Anti-
ochus III against Egypt, but in 201 BC his ﬂeet suf-
fered great losses in the defeat off Chios by Attalus I
and the Rhodians. This provoked the Second Mace-
donian War between Philip and Rome (200–197 BC).
He was ﬁnally defeated by Quintus Flamininus at the
battle of Cynoscephalae in Thessaly in 197 BC.
Harsh penalties were imposed, his rule was conﬁned
to Macedonia, and his son Demetrius was taken as
hostage to Rome. Philip then collaborated with
Rome against Nabis of Sparta (195 BC) and against
Aetolia and Antiochus III (192–189 BC). His tribute
was therefore remitted by the Romans and his son
Demetrius was returned to Macedonia. After 185 BC
he campaigned in the Balkans, and in 184 BC he sent
Demetrius back to Rome to argue his case. He mur-
dered his pro-Roman son Demetrius in favor of
Perseus, then died of sickness (allegedly remorse) at
Amphipolis.
Philocrates (Philokrates):
Floruit 340s BC. An
Athenian politician who ﬁrst proposed peace negoti-
ations with Philip II after his destruction of Olynthus
(348 BC). Philocrates was accused by a graphe para-
nomon, but Demosthenes successfully defended him
in court (347–346 BC). Philocrates undertook an
embassy to Macedonia with Demosthenes and
Aeschines in 346 BC to seek peace, and on the return
he secured a peace agreement and alliance with Philip,
later called the Peace (or Decree) of Philocrates.
Before this peace was ratiﬁed Philip II had advanced
farther into central Greece. Philocrates served on
other embassies to Philip, but in 343 BC he was pros-
ecuted for corruption in the peace negotiations and
was condemned to death in his absence.
Philomelus (Philomelos):
Died 354 BC. A Phocian
commander in the Third Sacred War (355–346 BC).
At the threat of war Philomelus was elected strategos
autokrator of Phocis. He seized Delphi with the help
of mercenaries (summer 356 BC), gaining control of
the sanctuary and defeating the Locrians. He then
defeated the Thebans in the winter of 356/355 BC,
and made an alliance with Sparta and Athens. In the
autumn of 355 BC the Amphictyony declared a
Sacred War, and he used sacred funds to hire 10,000
mercenaries. He was eventually defeated late in the
autumn of 354 BC at the battle of Neon against the
Locrians and Thebans. He committed suicide and
was succeeded by his brother Onomarchus.
Philopoemen (Philopoimen):
Lived 252–182 BC.
An Achaean statesman and soldier from Megalopolis
in Arcadia, he was educated by the philosophers
Demophanes and Ecdelus. Plutarch described him
as “the last of the Greeks.” He fought in the unsuc-
cessful defense of Megalopolis (223 BC), which was
sacked by Cleomenes III of Sparta. In July 222 BC he
was a cavalry commander in the battle of Sellasia
(near Sparta), with the Spartans under Cleomenes III
being defeated by Antigonus III Doson and the

Achaeans. Afterward, Philopoemen went to Crete
for 10 years as a mercenary soldier. He returned in
211 BC and was elected hipparch of the Achaean
Confederacy in 210/209 BC and general of the Con-
federacy eight times. He reorganized the cavalry and
infantry, and defeated the Spartans on several occa-
sions. In 183 BC he took part in an expedition against
Messene, which had revolted from the Achaean
Confederacy. He was ambushed and captured by the
Messenians and may have been poisoned in prison.
Philotas (Philotas):
Lived c. 360–330 BC. A Mace-
donian noble and son of Parmenion, he was the com-
mander of Alexander the Great’s Companion
Cavalry. He was executed for treason by Alexander,
apparently because he had failed to forward infor-
mation regarding a plot against Alexander.
Phocion (Phokion):
Lived 402/401–319/318 BC.
An Athenian general and politician, he was elected
general (strategos) 45 times from 371 to 319/318 BC,
and participated in several campaigns, notably in
Euboea (spring 348 and 341 BC), in the defense of
Megara (343 BC) and in Byzantium (339 BC). He was
a skilled orator and became important from the 340s
BC. He advocated peace with Macedonia, supporting
Eubulus, Aeschines and Demades against Demos-
thenes and Hyperides. When Athens was defeated at
the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), he helped Demades
to arrange a peace agreement with Macedonia. After
Alexander the Great’s death (323 BC), he tried to pre-
vent Athens from joining other Greek states in the
Lamian War against Macedonia (323–322 BC). In 319
BC Nicanor was commander at Piraeus, and in 318 BC
Phocion was put to death on a charge of treason,
apparently for complicity with Nicanor.
Phormion or Phormio (Phormion):
Fifth-century
BC Athenian naval commander, who undertook cam-
paigns c. 439 BC. From 430 BC he blockaded the
Gulf of Corinth with his ﬂeet from Naupactus, and
the following summer he won two naval victories
over the Peloponnesians. On returning to Athens
(428 BC) he was accused of embezzlement, and may
have died soon after.
Phrynichus (Phrynikhos):
Died 411 BC. An Athen-
ian politician. In 412/411 BC he opposed the recall of
Alcibiades and became one of the extreme oligarchs
at the time of the revolution of the Four Hundred
(411 BC). He went to Sparta to negotiate peace, but
on his return he was assassinated in the agora.
Pittacus (Pittakos):
Lived c. 650–c. 570 BC. A
statesman from Mytilene (Lesbos), regarded as one
of the Seven Sages after his death. He led the Mytile-
neans in a war against Athens for Sigeum at the
mouth of the Hellespont (on which Periander of
Corinth subsequently arbitrated). Pittacus became
aisymnetes (dictator) for 10 years to restore order (c.
590–c. 580 BC). He reformed various laws, including
doubling the penalty for all offenses committed
when drunk. He banished the nobles who opposed
him, including Alcaeus and Sappho. He retired and
died 10 years later. Little is known of his life.
Polycrates (Polykrates):
Tyrant of Samos c. 540–c.
523 BC, he established a powerful navy and annexed
several neighboring islands in the eastern Aegean.
He was a patron of the arts and initiated many pub-
lic works, most notably the harbor, temple of Hera,
and a tunnel that brought water to his capital.
Alliances were made with Egypt and Cyrene, but
later Polycrates sent Samians to help Cambyses of
Persia against Amasis of Egypt. When they returned,
they tried unsuccessfully to overthrow Polycrates
with Spartan help. Apparently envious of his success
and wealth, the Persian satrap Oroetes pretended to
plot against Darius I; he lured Polycrates to Magne-
sia ad Maeandrum and executed him.
Polyperchon (Polyperkhon):
Lived c. 380–c. 303
BC. A Macedonian general who was taxiarch after
333 BC, serving in Alexander the Great’s campaigns in
Asia. He was sent back to Europe as Craterus’ second-
in-command in 324 BC, and was commander in the
Lamian War (323–322 BC). The regent Antipater
appointed him as his successor in Europe in 319 BC,
but Cassander (son of Antipater) at once formed a
coalition of generals against him and called on the
help of Olympias. Polyperchon was driven from
Macedonia and eventually lost his bases in the Pelo-
ponnese, with Cassander replacing him as strategos.
Porus (Poros):
Died 317 BC. An Indian king who
was defeated by Alexander the Great in 326 BC at the
Hydaspes (Jhelum) River. He impressed Alexander
so much that he was allowed to retain his kingdom
R U L E R S

between the Hydaspes and Acesines (Chenab) Rivers
and was later given extra land. He was murdered by
the Macedonian satrap Eudamus.
Prusias I Cholus (Prusias):
King of Bithynia c.
230/228–c. 185/182 BC, he increased the territory of
Bithynia to its greatest size. In 220/219 BC he cam-
paigned against Byzantium, and in 218 BC he
defeated invading Gauls (Galatians). In the First
Macedonian War (215–205 BC), he took land from
Attalus I of Pergamum. He supplied Philip V with
ships, and in 202 BC was rewarded with the ports of
Cius and Myrleia (renaming them Prusias and
Apamea). In the Syrian War against Antiochus III
(192–188 BC) he remained neutral after advice from
the Roman Scipios. However, when he was ordered
to return land to Eumenes II of Pergamum as part of
the Peace of Apamea (188 BC), war broke out
(186–184 BC). Prusias was defeated, and Hannibal (a
refugee at his court) committed suicide (183 BC).
Prusias II Cynegus (Prusias):
King of Bithynia c.
182–149 BC (ﬁg. 2.11). He was son of Prusias I and
husband of Apama, daughter of Philip V. Prusias
joined Eumenes II of Pergamum against Pharnaces I
of Pontus (183–179 BC). War later broke out
between Prusias and Attalus II of Pergamum
(156–154 BC), and he had to pay a heavy indemnity
when defeated. In order to release himself from this
indemnity, he sent his son (Nicomedes II) to Rome
as an envoy. However, in 149 BC Attalus supported
Nicomedes II in seizing the throne. Attalus and

Nicomedes invaded Bithynia, and Prusias was mur-
dered in the temple of Zeus in Nicomedia.
Ptolemies (Ptolemaioi):
A Macedonian Greek
dynasty founded by Ptolemy I. It ruled Egypt from
323 BC to the Roman conquest in 30 BC.
Ptolemy I Soter (Ptolemaios, Savior):
Lived c.
367/366–283/282 BC. Macedonian king of Egypt and
founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. A friend of Alexan-
der the Great, he was exiled c. 337 BC, but was
recalled after Philip II’s murder (336 BC). In 330 BC
he was appointed Companion to Alexander (hetairos)
and fought with distinction in Alexander’s campaigns.
In 324 BC he married Artacama (granddaughter of
Pharnabazus), divorced her after Alexander’s death
(323 BC), married Eurydice (daughter of Antipater)
and then (possibly without divorce) Berenice I.
In the late summer of 323 BC Ptolemy I became
satrap of Egypt. In 319 BC he seized Palestine and
Coele-Syria, losing them again to Eumenes of Car-
dia. He fought against Antigonus I and Demetrius I
Poliorcetes intermittently from 315 to 301 BC. In
312 BC he defeated Demetrius Poliorcetes at Gaza,
and in 311 BC there was peace amongst the Succes-
sors, with a recognition of territory. In 310–309 BC
Ptolemy installed his brother Menelaus as governor
of Cyprus and also occupied Cos. He intervened in
Greek affairs 309–308 BC, and in 306 BC was
defeated at Salamis (off Cyprus) by Demetrius I
Poliorcetes. Ptolemy consequently lost all his
Aegean possessions. In 305/304 BC he declared him-
self king. From c. 301 to 286/285 BC he retook Pales-
tine, Coele-Syria, Cyprus and other territories in the
Aegean and Asia Minor.
Ptolemy wrote a ﬁrsthand account of Alexander
the Great, which was used as Arrian’s main source.
He established the military and administrative orga-
nization of Ptolemaic Egypt and his empire. He
founded the cult of Sarapis and established the
museum and library at Alexandria.
Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Ptolemaios, Loving his
Sister):
Lived 308–246 
BC. King of Egypt
283/282–246 BC and son of Ptolemy I and Berenice I,
born at Cos. He married Arsinoë I (daughter of Lysi-
machus) c. 289/288 BC. In 285 BC he was joint ruler
with his father, and became king in 283/282 BC. He
divorced Arsinoë I c. 281 BC, and c. 276/275 BC he
married his sister Arsinoë II and made her joint ruler.
The marriage caused a scandal among the Greeks,
although brother-sister marriage was normal among
Egyptian pharaohs. In the First Syrian War against
Antiochus I (c. 274/273–271 BC) he invaded parts of
Syria and Asia Minor, winning a victory in 271 BC.
Ptolemy established the Ptolemaic ruler-cult, deify-
ing himself and Arsinoë II in 272/271 BC. He later
adopted her title and cult-title Philadelphus.
Ptolemy suffered losses in the Chremonidean
War, supporting Athens and Sparta against Macedo-
nia (286–263/262 BC). In the Second Syrian War
against Antiochus II (260–253 BC), Ptolemy lost
large areas of Asia Minor and concluded the war with
a marriage between Antiochus II and his daughter
Berenice Syra. Ptolemy II (with his advisers) greatly
hellenized Egypt. He established much of the strict
Ptolemaic financial administration and founded
many Greek settlements, especially around Lake
Moeris. He built the Pharos and greatly extended the
museum and library at Alexandria. He also built a
canal from the Red Sea to the Nile. Alexandria, his
capital, became the cultural and intellectual center
of the Greek world.
Ptolemy III Euergetes (Ptolemaios, the Benefac-
tor):
Born between 288 and 280 BC, died 222/221
BC. King of Egypt 246–221 BC, he was the son of
Ptolemy II and Arsinoë I. He married Berenice II
(daughter of King Magas of Cyrene) in 246 BC and
united Cyrene with Egypt. In the Third Syrian War
(246–241 BC), he invaded large areas of the Seleucid
Empire in Syria and Asia Minor. He returned to
Egypt due to a revolt, and there was peace in Egypt
for the rest of his reign. Ptolemaic expansion subse-
quently ceased, although he intervened in Greece. In
243 BC he was elected strategos of the Achaean Con-
federacy, after supporting Aratus of Sicyon against
Macedonia. He later transferred his support to
Cleomenes III of Sparta, but did not assist him at the
battle of Sellasia in 222 BC, possibly fearful of war
between Macedonia and Egypt.
Ptolemy IV Philopator (Ptolemaios, Father-Loving):
Lived c. 244–204 BC. King of Egypt 221–204 BC.
Son of Ptolemy III and Berenice II. In 217 BC he
married his sister Arsinoë III. He was more inter-
ested in intellectual pursuits than public affairs,
which were in the control of his ministers Sosibius
R U L E R S
A N D L E A D E R S

and Agathocles. Antiochus III invaded Palestine in
221 BC and again in 219–217 BC (Fourth Syrian
War), which ended with victory for Ptolemy IV at
the battle of Raphia in 217 BC. Severe internal riots
by the native Egyptians took place, and from 207 BC
the Thebaid (Upper Egypt) was ruled by Nubian
kings. Ptolemy continued to neglect public affairs
and was instead devoted to the cult of Dionysus.
Ptolemy V Epiphanes (Ptolemais, God Made Man-
ifest):
Lived 210–180 BC. Joint ruler from 210 BC
and king of Egypt 204–180 BC, although in the con-
trol of his ministers Sosibius and Agathocles. He was
son of Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III. After his acces-
sion, there were serious revolts in Egypt for two
decades. Philip V of Macedonia and Antiochus III
planned to divide up Egypt, and from 203 BC
Ptolemy lost most of the territories in Asia Minor,
the Aegean and Palestine. His troops were finally
defeated by Antiochus in 200 BC at Panion (near the
headwaters of the Jordan River). He made peace with
Antiochus III and in 193 BC married Antiochus’
daughter Cleopatra I. In 187/186 BC his commander
Hippalus reconquered the Thebaid (Upper Egypt),
and in 184/183 BC the revolts in Lower Egypt were
ﬁnally quelled.
Ptolemy VI Philometor (Ptolemais, Mother-Loving):
Lived 186 or 184/183–145 BC. King of Egypt
180–145 BC. Son of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I. He
was joint ruler with his mother from 180 BC until
her death in 176 BC. In 175/174 BC he married his
sister Cleopatra II. The Sixth Syrian War broke out
against Antiochus IV (170–168 BC). Meanwhile,
Ptolemy formed a joint rule with his brother
Ptolemy VIII and with Cleopatra II (170–163 BC).
There was constant disagreement between the two
brothers. From 163 BC they agreed on a partition,
with Ptolemy VI sole ruler of Egypt, while Ptolemy
VIII ruled in Cyrene. In 155 BC Ptolemy VIII threat-
ened to bequeath his kingdom of Cyrene to Rome,
and so Ptolemy VI installed his son Ptolemy VII as
governor in Cyprus to forestall any invasion by
Ptolemy VIII. His daughter Cleopatra Thea was
married to Alexander Balas (150/149 BC). Ptolemy
VI switched his support to Demetrius II Nicator and
was acclaimed Seleucid king jointly with Demetrius
II, but was killed in battle against Alexander Balas.
Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator (Ptolemaios, New
Father-Loving):
Lived c. 162/161–144 BC. Son of
Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. Joint ruler in Egypt in
145 BC with Ptolemy VI, then sole ruler from
Ptolemy VI’s death (145 BC) until the arrival of
Ptolemy VIII in Egypt, when he was murdered in
August 144 BC.
Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II (Ptolemaios, Benefac-
tor; he was also called Physkon, pot-belly):
King of
Egypt 170–116 BC. He was joint ruler with his
brother Ptolemy VI in 170–163 BC, then king of
Cyrene only, until his brother’s death (145 BC). He
unsuccessfully tried to recapture Cyprus. Ptolemy IX
tried to have Ptolemy VIII assassinated (156/155 BC),
and Ptolemy VIII threatened to bequeath Cyrene to
Rome if he died childless. Ptolemy VIII returned to
Egypt, murdered Ptolemy VII and married his sister
Cleopatra II in 144 BC. He then expelled from
Alexandria the intellectuals and Jews who were
against him, and in 142 BC he seduced and married
Cleopatra III (daughter of his brother and of his sis-
ter/wife Cleopatra II) without divorcing Cleopatra
II. Cleopatra II successfully led a revolt against him
in 132 BC and declared her son Ptolemy Memphites
king and herself queen. Ptolemy VIII ﬂed to Cyprus,
and Ptolemy Memphites was murdered. In 127/126
BC Ptolemy VIII reconquered Alexandria and ruled
with the two queens from 124 BC. He bequeathed his
power to Cleopatra III and her children.
Ptolemy IX Soter II (Lathyrus) (Ptolemaios, Sav-
ior; his nickname Lathyros means Chick-pea, the
Greek equivalent of Cicero):
Lived c. 141–81 BC.
King of Egypt 116–81 BC and eldest son of Ptolemy
VIII and Cleopatra III. He was a priest of Alexander
the Great from 135/134 BC. He later became gover-
nor of Cyprus and married his sister Cleopatra IV. In
116 BC he was joint ruler with Cleopatra III, while
his younger brother Ptolemy X was sent to govern
Cyprus. He divorced Cleopatra IV and married
another sister, Cleopatra Selene, who eventually
divorced him. In 110 and 108 BC he was forced to
accept his brother Ptolemy X as joint ruler. There
was constant strife between them, and in 107 BC
Ptolemy IX ﬂed from Alexandria to Syria and then to
Cyprus. He was involved in conﬂicts with Antiochus
VIII and Antiochus IX. Cyprus and Egypt remained

separate states until 88 BC, when Ptolemy IX
returned from Cyprus to defeat Ptolemy X and
reunite the kingdom. He ruled with his daughter
Cleopatra Berenice until his death.
Ptolemy X Alexander I (Ptolemaios Alexandros):
Lived c. 140–87 BC. King of Egypt 116–88 BC (inter-
mittently). He was sent to Cyprus as governor in 116
BC to replace his older brother Ptolemy IX. There
was constant strife between the two brothers, and in
107 BC Ptolemy IX fled from Alexandria, and
Ptolemy X returned as joint ruler with Cleopatra III.
He was involved in conﬂict with Antiochus VIII and
Antiochus IX. In 101 BC he allegedly murdered his
mother Cleopatra III and married his brother’s
daughter Cleopatra Berenice a few days later.
Ptolemy IX returned from Cyprus in 88 BC, and
Ptolemy X was expelled from Egypt (spring 87 BC).
He willed his kingdom to Rome and was killed in a
naval battle off Cyprus soon after.
Ptolemy XI Alexander II (Ptolemaios):
Lived c.
100/99–80 BC. King of Egypt 80 BC, son of Ptolemy
X and a ﬁrst wife. The Roman general Sulla made
Ptolemy XI joint ruler with his stepmother Cleopa-
tra Berenice in 80 BC. He married her and murdered
her 19 days later, then was killed by the people of
Alexandria. He was the last legitimate male descen-
dant of the Ptolemies.
Ptolemy XII Theos Philopator Philadelphus
Neos Dionysos (Auletes) (Ptolemaios, God, Father-
Loving, Loving his sister, New; he was actually
known as Auletes, piper or flute player. His name
“Ptolemy XII” was not used.):
Born between 116
and 108 BC. Died 51 BC. King of Egypt 80–51 BC.
Illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX and a mistress. In
80/79 BC he married his full sister Cleopatra V
Tryphaena. He developed amicable relations with
Rome and was fully recognized by Julius Caesar in
59 BC. He was consequently deposed by the Alexan-
drians in 59/58 BC and ceded Cyprus to Rome. He
was restored by Aulus Gabinius (Roman governor of
Syria) in 55 BC. His children included Ptolemy XIII,
Ptolemy XIV and Cleopatra VII.
Ptolemy XIII (Ptolemaios):
Lived 63–47 BC. King
of Egypt 51–47 BC, and son of Ptolemy XII. There
was conﬂict between him and his sister Cleopatra VII
from 51 BC (she was expelled in 48 BC). Julius Caesar
forced him to rule with Cleopatra VII after the mur-
der of Pompey by his ministers (28 September, 48

BC). He declared war on Julius Caesar (Alexandrian
War) and was defeated and drowned in the Nile.
Pyrrhus (Pyrrhos):
Lived 319–272 BC. Molossian
king of Epirus and second cousin of Alexander the
Great. He reigned as a minor from 307 to 303 BC,
when he was exiled. He fled to Demetrius I
Poliorcetes and served at the battle of Ipsus (301 BC).
Demetrius Poliorcetes sent him as hostage to
Ptolemy I in 299/298 BC, where he married Anti-
gone, daughter of Berenice I. In 297 BC he regained
the throne at Epirus with the aid of Ptolemy I. On the
death of Antigone, he married Lanassa, daughter of
Agathocles, and later the daughter of a Dardanian
chief with whom he made an alliance.
Pyrrhus aimed to restore Alexander the Great’s
empire. After a successful war with Lysimachus
against Demetrius Poliorcetes (288 BC), he was the
most powerful ruler in Greece, in control of Thes-
saly and western Macedonia. In 285 BC he was
pushed back to Epirus by Lysimachus. From 280 to
275 BC Pyrrhus fought against Rome on behalf of
the Greeks in Italy and Sicily. Although he was ulti-
mately victorious in battles in 280 (Heraclea) and
279 BC (Asculum), his losses were so great he had to
move his forces to Sicily in 277 BC—thus the term
“Pyrrhic victory” for an empty or meaningless win.
He almost succeeded in ousting the Carthaginians
(then allies of Rome) but returned to Italy. He was
beaten by the Romans in 275 BC at the battle of Ben-
eventum (then called Maleventum) and so returned
to Epirus. In 274 BC he again invaded Macedonia.
He recovered most of Thessaly and Macedonia from
Antigonus II Gonatas, but in 272 BC turned to invade
the Peloponnese. Antigonus meanwhile regained
most of Macedonia, and Pyrrhus was killed in an
attempt to seize Argos.
Roxane (Rhoxane):
Died 311 BC. She was a Bac-
trian captive who married Alexander the Great in
327 BC. After his death (323 BC), she was said to have
murdered his other wife Barsine (Stateira). In 320 BC
Roxane returned to Macedonia with her son Alexan-
der IV, but on Antipater’s death (319 BC) they ﬂed to
Olympias in Epirus. Returning to Epirus they were
taken by Cassander (316 BC) and executed in 311 BC.
Sandracottus (Sandrakottos, Sanskrit Chandragupta):
Indian king c. 321–297 BC who founded the Mau-
ryan Empire in northern India. He resisted an inva-
sion of the Punjab by Seleucus I and was in conﬂict
with him from 308 BC. In 303 BC Seleucus ceded him
the satrapies of Gandhara, Arachosia and eastern
Gedrosia (the Punjab) in return for a marriage
alliance and a gift of 500 war elephants. Sandracottus
was in control of much of the Indo-Pakistani sub-
continent by 305 BC.
Seleucids: Dynasty founded by Seleucus I that ruled
much of Syria and Asia after the death of Alexander
the Great (323 BC). The Seleucid Era dates from 7
October, 312 BC on the Macedonian calendar and 3
April, 311 BC on the Babylonian calendar. The rulers
included Seleucus I–III and Antiochus I–III.
Seleucus I Nicator (Seleukos, Conqueror):
Lived
c. 358–281 BC. Founder of the Seleucid dynasty, he
was one of Alexander the Great’s Macedonian Com-
panions. In the Indian campaign against King Porus
(326 BC) he commanded the Bodyguard. After
Alexander died, Perdiccas made him chiliarch. He
married the Persian Apama in 324 BC. In 320 BC he
was one of the officers responsible for Perdiccas’
murder. He was appointed satrap of Babylonia (321
BC) and supported Antigonus I against Eumenes of
Cardia. Seleucus I, fearful of his life, fled from
Antigonus I to Ptolemy I in Egypt (spring 315 BC).
With Ptolemy I in late 312 BC, he defeated Demetrius
I Poliorcetes (who was trying to invade Ptolemy’s
territory) at Gaza and then recaptured his kingdom
in the east, including Babylon.
In the peace among the Successors of 311 BC,
Seleucus was conﬁrmed as the ruler of territories east
of the Euphrates. He then attempted to regain east-
ern territories of Alexander’s empire, including Bac-
tria. He proclaimed himself king in 305/304 BC (as
did the other Macedonian rulers). He ceded the Pun-
jab to the Mauryan king Sandracottus and received
500 war elephants in 303 BC. He and his war ele-
phants joined Cassander and Lysimachus to defeat
his chief rival Antigonus I at the battle of Ipsus (301
BC). With access to the Mediterranean via Syria and
Cilicia, Syria became the center of the Seleucid
Empire, with a new capital at Antioch (founded 300
BC). He subsequently campaigned against Demetrius
I Poliorcetes. In 299/298 BC he married Demetrius’
daughter Stratonice (but gave her to his son Anti-
ochus I in 294/293 BC), while keeping Apama. He
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E

ruled jointly with his son Antiochus I from 292 BC.
He captured Demetrius I Poliorcetes in 285 BC and
imprisoned him at Apamea. He acquired the rest of
Asia Minor by defeating and killing Lysimachus at
the battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. He then
invaded Europe in an attempt to take Macedonia,
but was assassinated near Lysimachia by Ptolemy
Ceraunus, a son of Ptolemy I.
Seleucus II Callinicus (Seleukos, the Triumphant):
Lived c. 265–226 BC. Seleucid king 246–226 BC and
eldest son of Antiochus II and Laodice I. He was
beset with various problems and spent his entire
reign on campaign. His stepmother Berenice Syra
claimed the throne for her infant son, so her brother
Ptolemy III invaded Syria (Third Syrian War,
246–241 BC). Berenice and her son were murdered,
and Ptolemy III advanced as far as Bactria, but had to
withdraw to Egypt. Seleucus II regained his eastern
territories, although Bactria became independent.
Seleucus II made his younger brother Antiochus
Hierax joint ruler in order to conclude the Third
Syrian War against Ptolemy (241 BC). Conﬂict arose
between the two brothers, so the empire was split
between them, with Hierax in Asia Minor. After the
latter’s death in 226 BC, Seleucus II regained sole
control of his empire, but large parts of Asia Minor
were now controlled by Pergamum. He died in an
accident.
Seleucus III Soter (Seleukos, Savior):
Lived c.
245–223 BC. Seleucid king 226–223 BC and son of
Seleucus II. He was murdered on a campaign against
Attalus I of Pergamum to regain former Seleucid ter-
ritory. Seleucus was succeeded by his younger
brother Antiochus III.
Sitalces (Sitalkes):
Died 424 BC. King of the Odry-
sian Empire in Thrace. He established a powerful
state in alliance with Athens, extending from the
Danube to the Aegean. He invaded Chalcidice and
Macedonia in 429 BC in support of the pretender
Amyntas, but returned to his own country soon after
with little accomplished. He died in a disastrous
expedition against the Triballi, a tribe of the lower
Danube.
Solon (Solon):
Lived c. 640–after 561 BC. An
Athenian statesman, lawgiver and poet. He was
archon in 594/593 BC, after having given good advice
for winning Salamis in the war against Megara.
There were serious problems in Athens at this time,
and Solon undertook economic reforms, in particu-
lar to help poor farmers who were often reduced to
serfdom. He canceled all debts for which land or lib-
erty was the security (a reform known as seisakhtheia,
“shaking off the burdens” [of the poor]) and prohib-
ited future borrowing on the security of a person. He
received some criticism for not redistributing land.
He may have introduced other reforms such as a
native Attic coinage, a system of weights and mea-
sures, prohibition of export of all crops except olives,
and granting of citizenship to immigrant craftsmen.
He introduced a more humane law code, repealing
the laws of Draco (except those which dealt with
homicide). He also undertook a major reform of the
constitution, making wealth, not birth, the factor in
eligibility for political ofﬁce, thus breaking the power
of the Eupatrids. He divided citizens into four prop-
erty classes, each one eligible for different ofﬁces. He
reformed the Areopagus and established a second
council, the boule of 400 members. After his reforms
Solon spent 10 years traveling overseas, including to
Egypt and Cyprus, returning to Athens to ﬁnd it on
the brink of tyranny, as Peisistratus had just been
granted a bodyguard. Solon wrote elegiac and iambic
poetry to explain and justify his political reforms, a
major source for later Greek historians.
Spartocids (Spartokidai):
A dynasty that ruled in
the Milesian colony Panticapaeum in the Cimmerian
Bosphorus from 438/437 BC (when a hellenized
Thracian Spartocus seized power) until c. 110 BC. It
established control over much of the Crimea and
Taman Peninsula. Although on the periphery of the
Greek sphere of inﬂuence, the colony became the
largest exporter of grain to Greece, particularly to
Athens, and acquired a great deal of wealth. The
kingdom became part of the empire of Mithridates
VI of Pontus.
Taxiles (Taxiles):
Floruit 320s BC. An Indian king,
whose personal name was Omphis or Mophis. He
ruled the country between the Indus and Hydaspes
(Jhelum) Rivers, with his capital at Taxila. He wel-
comed Alexander the Great and fought with him
against his neighbor and old enemy Porus. He
became subject to the Macedonian satrap Philippus
R U L E R S

and then ruled independently. By 312 BC his king-
dom was part of the empire of Sandracottus.
Theagenes (Theagenes):
Tyrant of Megara c.
640–620 BC. He became tyrant after slaughtering
the cattle of the rich in a dispute over land. He prob-
ably supported his son-in-law Cylon’s attempt to
become tyrant at Athens. He was later banished
from Megara.
Themistocles (Themistokles):
Lived c. 528/524–
462/459 BC. An Athenian democratic leader of the
Lycomidae tribe. He was elected eponymous archon
in 493 BC and started the development of the port of
Piraeus. In 490 BC he was elected strategos of his
tribe. After the death of Miltiades (489 BC), attempts
were made to ostracize Themistocles, and one-third
of surviving ostraka from the 480s BC bear his name.
Instead, he managed to ostracize his rivals. In 483 BC
he persuaded the Athenians to increase their naval
fleet by using the surplus revenue from the silver
mines at Laurium. The city was therefore prepared
for the Persian invasion under Xerxes. Themistocles
took a prominent role in this war, and as strategos he
commanded the Athenian ﬂeet. He was responsible
for the victory at the battle of Salamis (480 BC) and
received numerous honors in Sparta. He stayed in
Sparta as Athenian envoy in 479 BC, after power had
passed to his rivals. Themistocles was ostracized c.
471 BC and went to Argos. Circa 468 BC Sparta
claimed that Themistocles and Pausanias were plot-
ting with Persia. In his absence Themistocles was
condemned to death, but escaped to Asia. He was
given many honors by the Persian king Artaxerxes I
after 465 BC and was made governor of Magnesia ad
Maeandrum, where he died of sickness or possibly
suicide. He was buried outside the walls of Piraeus.
Theopompus (Theopompos):
Eurypontid king of
Sparta c. 720–675 BC and leader in the First Messen-
ian War (c. 730–710 BC). He may have instituted the
ephorate or given it further powers.
Theramenes (Theramenes):
Died 404 BC. A mod-
erate Athenian politician and orator, whom Critias
called Cothurnus (a theatrical boot that ﬁtted either
foot). He was one of the leaders of the oligarchic rev-
olution in 411 BC, which resulted in the council of
the Four Hundred. He was then responsible for the
overthrow of the Four Hundred and establishment
of the Five Thousand. When full democracy was
restored in 410 BC, he was serving as strategos in the
Aegean. In 406 BC he was a trierarch at the battle of
Arginusae. He failed to pick up survivors, but blamed
the generals who were subsequently executed. After
the Athenian ﬂeet was totally destroyed at the battle
of Aegospotami (405 BC), Theramenes led the peace
negotiations with Lysander of Sparta, delaying for
three months and causing starvation in Athens. In
March 404 BC Lysander appointed him one of the
Thirty Tyrants to rule Athens on behalf of Sparta.
However, his moderate stance conflicted with the
more extreme members, and Critias had him tried
and executed.
Theron (Theron):
Tyrant of Acragas 488–472 BC.
He married his daughter Demarete to Gelon, tyrant
of Syracuse, becoming his firm ally. In 483 BC he
expelled the tyrant Terillus from Himera and
installed his son Thrasydaeus as ruler. Terillus
appealed for help to the Carthaginian Hamilcar, but
the Carthaginian invasion was defeated by Theron
and Gelon at the battle of Himera (480 BC). After
Gelon’s death Theron supported Polysalus (younger
brother of Hieron I), but a compromise was reached
with the help of the poet Simonides. Theron was
succeeded by his son Thrasydaeus. Theron was a
supporter of the arts (Pindar was present at his
court), and made Acragas a beautiful Greek city.
Thrasybulus (Thrasyboulos):
Died 388 BC. An
Athenian general. In 411 BC he was leader of the
democratic opposition that had been formed by the
navy at Samos against the Four Hundred. He was
elected strategos and was responsible for the recall of
Alcibiades. Also in 411 BC he won naval victories
over the Spartans at Cynossema and Abydus. In 410
BC he helped Alcibiades at the naval victory against
Sparta at Cyzicus. He was trierarch at the battle of
Arginusae in 406 BC. Under the Thirty Tyrants he
was banished and went to Thebes, where he orga-
nized a democratic resistance that seized Phyle in
404/403 BC and Piraeus in 403 BC. After the fall of
the Thirty Tyrants (403 BC) he was a prominent
leader of the restored democracy at Athens. He led
an expedition to recover Thasos, Samothrace, the
Chersonese, Chalcedon and Byzantium (389 BC), but
was killed at Aspendus on a plundering expedition.

Thrasybulus of Miletus (Thrasyboulos):
Tyrant of
Miletus c. 625–600 BC, best known, according to
Herodotus, for the advice he gave to the Corinthian
tyrant Periander.
Thrasyllus (Thrasyllos):
Died 406 BC. An Athen-
ian democratic leader. He was one of those who
organized democratic support in the navy at Samos.
He was elected strategos and participated in the naval
victories at Cynossema and Abydus in 411 BC. When
democracy was restored in 410 BC, he returned to
Athens. After Alcibiades’ fall (406 BC) he was
reelected strategos, but was one of six generals exe-
cuted following the battle of Arginusae, after being
blamed by Theramenes.
Thucydides (Thoukydides):
Born c. 500 BC. An
Athenian politician and opponent of Pericles, he was
the son of Melesias and the brother-in-law of
Cimon. He was inﬂuential in Athens and in Greece.
He succeeded Cimon in leading the wealthy, aristo-
cratic, oligarchic faction. In 443 BC he was ostra-
cized, but returned the same year. He was prosecuted
in his old age, and was dead by 420 BC.
Timoleon (Timoleon):
Died c. 334 BC. A Corinth-
ian who liberated Syracuse. Circa 365 BC he con-
spired to kill his brother Timophanes who tried to
make himself tyrant of Corinth. In 344 BC he was sent
by Corinth with a small force of mercenaries to assist
Syracuse, which had appealed to its mother city for
help against the tyrant Dionysius II and the Car-
thaginians. Timoleon was a capable general and
expelled Dionysius II (343 BC). The Carthaginians
sent a large force to Sicily in 341 (or 339) BC, and
Timoleon defeated them in June as they were cross-
ing the Crimisus River. He eventually made peace
with Carthage, restored peace to Sicily and installed a
moderate oligarchic government at Syracuse. Circa
338 BC he retired from public life and remained in
Syracuse until his death.
Timotheus (Timotheos):
Died 354 BC. An Athen-
ian general, son of Conon and a pupil of Isocrates. In
378 BC he was elected strategos when the Second
Athenian League was formed. In a naval expedition
in 376–375 BC, he gained many allies in northwest
Greece, including Corcyra. When peace was con-
cluded with Sparta, Timotheus was recalled from
Corcyra, but he broke the peace almost immediately.
Sparta acted against Corcyra, and Timotheus was
recalled but could not raise sufficient funds. In
November 373 BC he was tried but acquitted on a
charge of ﬁnancial maladministration. However, he
left Athens to serve Persia as a mercenary against
Egypt. He returned to power on the fall of Callistra-
tus (366 BC), advocating an imperialist policy. He
captured Samos from the Persians after a 10-month
siege (365 BC) and extended Athenian territory in the
Thracian Chersonese and Chalcidice, but repeatedly
failed to take Amphipolis. He failed to cooperate in
an attack on Chios at the battle of Embata in 356 BC,
and was ﬁned the huge sum of 100 talents, causing
him to leave Athens.
Tissaphernes (Tissaphernes):
Died 395 BC. A Per-
sian satrap of the southern coastal provinces of Asia
Minor from 413 BC. After the intervention of Alcibi-
ades in 412 BC, he intermittently supported Sparta in
the Peloponnesian War against Athens. In 408 BC he
was conﬁned to ruling Caria, and Cyrus the Younger
began a pro-Spartan policy. At the battle of Cunaxa
(401 BC), the cavalry of Tissaphernes played a key role
in the victory of Artaxerxes II over Cyrus, and Tissa-
phernes was restored to the coastal provinces. When
Sparta began war with Persia in 400 BC, he was crush-
ingly defeated by King Agesilaus II near Sardis (spring
395 BC), and Artaxerxes II ordered his execution.
Xanthippus (Xanthippos):
Early 5th-century BC
Athenian leader and father of Pericles. In 489 BC he
successfully prosecuted Miltiades. In 484/483 BC
Xanthippus was ostracized on suspicion of support-
ing the Persians. He was recalled in 480 BC before
the invasion of Xerxes, and was elected one of the
strategoi for 479 BC. He commanded the Athenian
ﬂeet which destroyed the Persian navy at the battle
of Mycale (479 BC). Xanthippus then led the ﬂeet to
the Chersonese and captured Sestus (winter 479/478
BC), so that the grain supply from the Black Sea
could be safeguarded.
Xerxes (Xerxes, Persian Khshayarshan):
King of
Persia 486–465 BC, after succeeding his father Darius
l. By 485 BC he had suppressed an Egyptian revolt
and another in Babylon in 482 BC. On the advice of
Mardonius he planned to invade Greece to punish
the Greeks for their part in the Ionian Revolt. He set

out in the spring of 480 BC and achieved initial suc-
cess. He won a naval victory at Artemisium and a land
battle at Thermopylae. He also destroyed Athens, but
his navy was crushed at Salamis. Xerxes was forced to
retreat, leaving Mardonius in command, who was
then defeated at the battle of Plataea in 479 BC (ﬁg.
2.6). Xerxes was assassinated in 465/464 BC.
Zaleucus (Zaleukos):
Lived c. 650 BC. A law-giver
who apparently produced for Locri the ﬁrst Greek
law code. It was subsequently adopted by other
Greek cities in Italy and Sicily, although his laws
were notoriously severe.

MILITARY AFFAIRS
3

ARMIES
Because the Greek world was divided into numerous
tribes, kingdoms and city-states from prehistory to
the Roman period, there was never a single overall
army. Most evidence on the organization of armies
relates to Sparta, to a lesser extent to Athens, and to
the later army of Macedonia. Very little is known
about armies of other states, and most evidence is
derived from noncontemporary authors. Before the
4th century BC, there is only evidence that the Spar-
tan troops were trained, possibly because the hoplites
in other Greek states were of a high social standing,
who would not have tolerated any training.
Prehistoric and Archaic
The earliest evidence for Greek warfare comes from
Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. These epic poems were
probably composed in the 8th century BC, but they
reﬂect a much earlier Mycenaean phase. Most mili-
tary information comes from the Iliad, since it deals
with the siege of Troy, rather than the Odyssey, which
deals with Odysseus’ travels through a world largely
at peace. As they are epic poems, they cannot be
treated as reliable and accurate historical documents.
However, a great deal of information can be
extracted and combined with the available archaeo-
logical evidence for the Mycenaean period.
Little is known about how the earliest Greek
armies were organized, but it is likely that they were
led by a state’s ruler, usually a king or chieftain. Such
armies were generally small, and there was probably
little need for an elaborate chain of command. The
only distinction usually made is between the champi-
ons or heroes (the more skilled warriors with better
weapons and armor) and the general mass of soldiers.
The Homeric poems give a few clues to how armies
were organized. The Iliad shows the besieging Greek
army composed of allied forces under individual com-
manders, led by a commander-in-chief, Agamemnon.
He appears to hold his position more through honor
and prestige than through a recognized jurisdiction
over the other commanders. In the poem a general
assembly is held to discuss certain military decisions.
Agamemnon, despite his position, must put forward
arguments to support his views. He is portrayed as
being similar to a feudal king with subordinate lords,
over whom he holds sway but not absolute power.
This situation contrasts with the command structure
of the besieged Trojans, most of whom had Greek
names and were probably of Greek extraction. The
Trojan forces were commanded by King Priam and
his sons, working as a team and holding the allegiance
of a substantial area around Troy, extending into
Europe and Asia Minor. This was effectively an
empire ruled by the dynasty of King Priam, in contrast
to the temporary command of Agamemnon, which
was apparently only for the duration of the war.
There is no direct continuity between the armies
portrayed in Homer and later armies. The next
glimpse of Greek military organization comes from
the historian Herodotus who, in the 5th century BC,
wrote about the Persian wars that took place just
before his birth and in his youth. The information
from Herodotus can be supplemented from other
authors, including Thucydides and Aeschylus.
Sources from the Roman period include the writers
Polybius (2nd century BC), and Diodorus Siculus and
Asclepiodotus (both 1st century BC).
Sparta
KINGS AND HOPLITES
The city-state of Sparta was organized on a military
basis. It was governed by two kings and ﬁve ephors,
but in time of war one king was given supreme power
as army commander. All freeborn male Spartan citi-
zens over 20 years of age were liable for military ser-
vice. They spent their lives as soldiers, other
professions being forbidden. The best of them were
taken into the army and became fully trained
hoplites. They were organized into ﬁve companies
called lochoi (lokhoi; sing. lokhos), which reﬂected the
ﬁve Spartan tribes. Further troops were drawn from
the towns that surrounded Sparta and were under its
dominance. Originally the two kings had the right to
make war upon whatever state they chose. They per-
sonally led the army in battle, each protected by a
bodyguard of 300 hoplites (the hippeis, a name mean-
ing “horsemen,” possibly implying this was originally
a cavalry unit, though there is no supporting evi-
dence), who were chosen by ofﬁcers known as hippa-

gretai. The kings had unlimited power of life and
death while in the ﬁeld. Sometime before the Persian
wars (early 5th century BC), the laws of Sparta were
changed so that the people chose one king to lead the
army, and he was responsible to the people for how

3.1 Spartan army of 5th century BC: a) the army consisted of six regiments or morae; b) a mora; c) a lochos (4 lochoi = 
1 mora); d) a pentekostys (2 pentekostyes = 1 lochos); e) an enomotia, the smallest unit of the army (2 enomotiai =
1 pentekostys)

EARLY ARMY
The phalanx describes a military formation used
from the 4th century BC, although some clues sug-
gest that it developed before then. Because the Spar-
tan army in the 4th century BC had units called
pentekostyes (sing. pentekostys—literally ﬁfties) of 72
men, it has been suggested that there was an earlier
unit of 50 men, possibly as early as the late 8th cen-
tury BC. It is thought that the early form of lochos
consisted of two units called pentekostyes. A pentekostys
consisted of two enomotiai (sing. enomotia). Each
enomotia had 23 hoplites, as well as a rearguard ofﬁ-
cer called an ouragos (pl. ouragoi), or tergiductor, and
a commanding ofﬁcer or enomotarch (enomotarkhes).
The lochos was commanded by a lochagos (lokhagos)
who fought at the front of the extreme right-hand
ﬁle; the left half of the lochos was commanded by a
pentekonter ﬁghting at the front of the right-hand ﬁle
of the left pentekostys. This formation would give 50
men in each pentekostys and 100 men in each lochos,
in comparison with 72 men and 144 men in later
Spartan formations.
5TH-CENTURY BC ARMY
At the very end of the 5th century BC, there is
detailed information about the Spartan army from
two contemporary authors, Thucydides and Xeno-
phon. Thucydides was writing some years earlier
than Xenophon, but had difﬁculty obtaining infor-
mation about the Spartan army. Xenophon, however,
had ﬁrsthand knowledge. Where conﬂicts of evidence
exist between the two sources, Xenophon is generally
accepted as more accurate.
The Spartan army was at this time still com-
manded by the king. It was divided into six regiments
known as morae (morai, sing. mora), each of 576 men
(ﬁg. 3.1). Each mora was commanded by a polemarch
( polemarkhos) and consisted of four lochoi. Each
lochos (now 144 men) was the standard unit of the
phalanx and was commanded by a lochagos. A lochos
was divided into two pentekostyes. Each pentekostys
(now 72 men) was commanded by a pentekonter and
was divided into two enomotiai. The enomotia was the
smallest unit of the army and was commanded by an
enomotarch. The enomotia was composed of three
ﬁles of 12 men or six half-ﬁles of six men. There were
also rearguard ofﬁcers called ouragoi, who could have
been an integral part of the unit, forming the rear
rank of each enomotia. In phalanx formation, the other
ofﬁcers would ﬁght at the front of the right-hand ﬁle
of the unit that they commanded.
The King’s Bodyguard (hippeis) served in the ﬁrst
mora. It consisted of 300 specially selected hoplites
who were regarded as the best in the army. They
were chosen by three hippagretae (hippagretai)—men
chosen annually by the ephors speciﬁcally for select-
ing hoplites to serve in the hippeis. In addition each
mora had an attached unit of cavalry, also called a
mora. These cavalry units, each about 60 strong,
began to be used only near the end of the 5th century
BC, during the Peloponnesian War.
When on the march, the Spartan army was led by
the cavalry with the sciritae (skiritai) forming a
screen in front of the column to provide advance
warning. The sciritae were originally perioeci from
the town of Scirus. They were foot soldiers serving
as lightly armed scouts and outpost guards.
Athens
Originally the armies of Athens were led by the king,
but this function was taken over by the polemarch
(Greek polemarkhos), who was one of the archons.
From around the early 7th century BC, the polemarch
held ofﬁce for one year and was elected to ofﬁce by
the council of archons, although his birth and wealth
were taken into account in his appointment.
In the early 5th century BC, Cleisthenes intro-
duced a number of constitutional reforms, including
dividing Attica into 10 new tribes of citizens. Each
tribe was required to supply an infantry regiment to
the army known as a taxis (pl. taxeis), each of which
was commanded by a taxiarch (taxiarkhos). The taxeis
were each divided into lochoi. A board of 10 generals
(strategoi, sing. strategos), one from each tribe, was
elected by the Assembly. The generals were elected
annually, but there was no limit on the number of
times they could be reelected. Usually only three
strategoi went on campaign with the army. The pole-
march still led the army in battle, but the importance
of his role was greatly diminished. All citizens
between the ages of 17 and 59 were liable for military
service, and during the 5th century BC this provided
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
96

about 30,000 hoplites. About half this number were
used in campaigns, while the other half (veterans and
those under 19 years old) were garrison troops. The
hoplites had to supply their own equipment, but a
soldier whose father had been killed in battle was
provided with arms at public expense.
Other City-States
Much less information is available for the other city-
states. Although the organization of other armies was
probably subject to local peculiarities, they seem to
have followed the system used by Athens, with citi-
zens divided into tribes, each of which supplied mil-
itary forces to the army. The citizens of Megara, for
example, were divided into ﬁve tribes, each of which
appointed a general and provided a military contin-
gent for the army. These ﬁve generals initially shared
military power with the king, but later on the monar-
chy seems to have disappeared.
Similarly, a Thessalian Confederacy was formed in
Thessaly around the end of the 7th century BC, and
eventually each land allotment or estate was required
to supply 40 cavalry and 80 infantry to the federal
army of the confederacy. Since war between city-states
was endemic, it is likely that any development in mili-
tary organization by one state was quickly copied by
others, just as developments in weapons, armor and
tactics appear to have spread rapidly. The phalanx for-
mation was probably adopted, with local variations,
by all warring city-states.
Macedonia
PHILIP II
The ﬁnal developments in Greek warfare came from
the Macedonians. In 359 BC Philip II became king of
Macedonia, but even before this the Macedonian
cavalry, called “the Companions” (hetairoi), was
probably the best in Greece. It was drawn from the
Macedonian aristocracy and probably originated as a
mounted bodyguard for the king. In contrast the
Macedonian infantry consisted of ill-trained and
badly organized peasants. Philip reformed the army,
imposing a severe code of training and discipline.
The heavy infantry was reformed into a phalanx,
probably based on that of the Theban army. Philip
appears to have adopted the Greek model of a ﬁle of
eight men as the depth of the phalanx, but he used
units of two, rather than three, ﬁles of eight men.
These units of 16 men were called dekades (sing.
dekas, literally “a company of 10”), implying that
before Philip’s reforms, the ﬁles were 10 men deep
rather than eight. From later information about
Alexander the Great’s army, it appears that each dekas
was commanded by a dekadarch (dekadarkhos or
dekadarkhes) who fought in the front rank. Behind
him was a man on double pay and then a “10-stater”
man, also probably ofﬁcers.
Philip called his newly formed phalanx the “Foot
Companions” ( pezetairoi) in recognition of their
improved status. The phalanx was possibly divided
into 12 taxeis, each raised from a specific area of
Macedonia. There is little information about the
smaller units within each taxis, but it has been sug-
gested that the organization of the Macedonian army
was similar to that of Alexander’s Successors. Each
taxis would therefore have been divided into six syn-
tagmata (sing. syntagma), with each syntagma possibly
divided into four tetrarchies.
It is uncertain exactly how the soldiers of the
Macedonian phalanx were armed in Philip’s time.
They were equipped with a long and heavy two-
handed spear (a sarissa) and may sometimes have
used javelins. They probably wore a helmet, cuirass
and greaves and carried a round shield, although
there are indications that the amount and type of
armor varied according to their position in the pha-
lanx. It is possible that soldiers in the front ranks had
the heaviest armor, while those at the rear wore little
or none, although the rearguard officers (ouragoi)
were probably heavily armored. There is evidence
that weapons and equipment were supplied free to
the soldiers and that they were ﬁned for any losses.
As Philip II captured more territory, he increased his
army by adding new units, such as Paeonian and
Thessalian cavalry, so that the proportion of Mace-
donian soldiers gradually decreased.
ALEXANDER THE GREAT
No work of contemporary authors has survived to
provide information about the army of Alexander
M I L I T A R Y A F F A I R S
97

(died 323 BC). The main work is by Arrian who wrote
in the 2nd century AD, more than 400 years after
Alexander’s death. Other sources include Polybius
(2nd century BC) and Diodorus Siculus (1st century
BC). These writers were able to use earlier sources of
information, but their accuracy cannot always be
trusted. In Alexander’s time, there seem to have been
12 taxeis, with each taxis being about 1,500 strong.
Alexander left six taxeis in Macedonia and took six to
invade Persia. This invasion force seems to have ini-
tially comprised 12,000 Macedonian infantry, 7,000
infantry drawn from allied states, 7,000 infantry from
the frontiers of Macedonia, and 1,000 archers and
agrianes (javelin throwers from the mountains on the
northern frontier of Macedonia), 1,800 Macedonian
cavalry, 1,800 Thessalian cavalry, 600 Greek cavalry,
and 900 Thracian and Paeonian scouts.
Alexander’s Macedonian infantry consisted of
9,000 Foot Companions and 3,000 hypaspists
(lighter infantry). The hypaspists were organized
into 1,000-strong chiliarchies commanded by chil-
iarchs. The first chiliarchy was the King’s Body-
guard, called the agema. The Macedonian cavalry of
1,800 men (the Companions or Companion Cavalry)
was divided into eight units called ilai (sing. ile), and
each ile was commanded by an ilarch (ilarkhes). The
ﬁrst ile (royal ile) was larger than the rest and was
usually commanded by Alexander. It is thought that
the ilai were 210 strong, with the royal ile 300 strong.
It is known that the ilai fought in a wedge formation
in battle, and these numbers do provide wedge for-
mations of a suitable size. The Companion Cavalry
was armed with long spears (sarissai).
The 1,800-strong Thessalian cavalry was also
divided into ilai, but of different strengths than the
Companion Cavalry. Little else is known about this
cavalry, except that its battle formation was diamond
shaped. According to Asclepiodotus (writing in the
1st century BC), the 600 Greek cavalry may have
been divided into ﬁve ilai of 128 men, with each ile
deployed in a square formation 16 men wide and 8
deep (each horse needing a space twice as long as it
was wide). The Greek and Thessalian cavalries were
armed with spears, and the Thracian and Paeonian
cavalries (used for skirmishing and scouting) were
armed with javelins.
As Alexander’s campaign progressed, he drafted
Oriental horsemen into his cavalry. Eventually he
was forced to reorganize the cavalry to cope with
this. The royal ile was retained, but the other ﬁve ilai
were reorganized into hipparchies (hipparkhiai, sing.
hipparkhia), each with an ile of the Companions. The
hipparchy became the standard unit of Macedonian
cavalry.
HELLENISTIC
Most information about the later Macedonian army
comes from Polybius and Asclepiodotus (the latter
writing when Hellenistic warfare had virtually
ended). Asclepiodotus described what was probably
an idealized or theoretical phalanx of 16,384 men (a
phalanx as large as 16,000 is recorded only at the bat-
tle of Pydna in 168 BC). His description may be based
on the late Egyptian or Syrian phalanx, not the Mace-
donian one. The phalanx he described consisted of 64
syntagmata, each commanded by a syntagmatarch
(syntagmatarkhes). These syntagmata consisted of 16
ﬁles of 16 men (totaling 256), as well as an ouragos
(rearguard officer), hyperetes (adjutant), stratokeryx
(herald), semaiophoros (signaler) and salpinktes (trum-
peter). The front-rank men (protostatai) of the syn-
tagma were all ofﬁcers. Each ﬁle (lochos) was led by a
lochagos, and every dilochia or pair of ﬁles (dilokhia)
was led by a dilochites (dilokhites). Every pair of
dilochiai (four ﬁles) was called a tetrarchy and was led
by a tetrarch (tetrarkhes). Each pair of tetrarchies
made up a taxis, commanded by a taxiarch (taxiark-
hos). The syntagma had two taxeis: the right-hand one
commanded by the syntagmatarch and the left-hand
one by the taxiarch.
Each ﬁle (lochos) was led by an ofﬁcer at the front
and also had a hemilochites (hemilokhites) who was
leader of a half-file known as a hemilokhia. There
were also two enomotarchs (enomotarkhai: quarter-
ﬁle leaders) and an ouragos (rearguard ofﬁcer). The
remaining individual ranks in each ﬁle were alter-
nately called protostatai (sing. protostates: front rank)
and epistatai (sing. epistates: rear rank). Each ﬁle of 16
men therefore comprised an ofﬁcer in the front rank,
followed in turn by an epistates, a protostates, another
epistates, an enomotarch, an epistates, a protostates,
another epistates (the rear-rank officer of the half-
ﬁle), a hemilochites, an epistates, a protostates, an epis-
tates, an enomotarch, an epistates, a protostates and an
ouragos.
Asclepiodotus also described the organization of
syntagmata into larger units. However, this descrip-
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
98

tion is thought to be a hypothetical system devised
by him to explain terms he did not fully understand,
and he may have fabricated some terms. In his sys-
tem, two syntagmata formed a pentakosiarchy, com-
manded by a pentakosiarch (pentakosiarkhes), and two
pentakosiarchies formed a merarchy of 2,048 men,
commanded by a merarch (merarkhes). Two merar-
chies made up a phalangarchy commanded by a pha-
langarch ( phalangarkhes), who was originally a
strategos. Two phalangarchies formed a keras (pl. ker-
ata) commanded by a kerarch, and two kerata formed
a phalanx commanded by a strategos.
The syntagma is not mentioned by Polybius, who
refers to a unit called a speira (pl. speirai). It is thought
that the syntagma was a Hellenistic army unit used
outside Europe, and that the speira was the unit of
Hellenistic armies within Europe. The speira may
have been very similar to the syntagma, since it was
divided into four tetrarchies, each consisting of four
lochoi. The taxiarch and dilochites mentioned by
Asclepiodotus are not referred to, and so it is uncer-
tain whether these formed part of the speira. Four
speirai made up a battalion, which may have been
called a chiliarchy, and four battalions made up a
strategia commanded by a strategos. Three other ofﬁ-
cers are known (grammateus, arkhiuperetes and hyper-
etes). They may have been the administrative ofﬁcers
of the speira, the battalion and the strategia respec-
tively, forming an administrative hierarchy, although
their precise function is unclear.
Descriptions of the organization of the later
Macedonian army are problematic because the units
cannot easily be combined into the two wings of a
phalanx totaling approximately 10,000 men, which
appears to have been the usual size of a phalanx at
that time. A possible solution is that each wing of the
phalanx was a 5,000-strong strategia, made up of ﬁve
not four battalions.
In addition to the phalanx, the later Macedonian
army had hypaspists, peltasts, archers and slingers,
which do not always appear to have functioned as in
Alexander the Great’s army. In later armies,
hypaspists seem to have been staff ofﬁcers selected
for special duties and members of the King’s Body-
guard (agema). The later peltasts apparently changed
completely and took over many functions of the ear-
lier hypaspists. The most noticeable change in the
later armies, though, is the change in emphasis from
cavalry to infantry. In Alexander’s army, which had to
be highly mobile to meet speciﬁc needs, the ratio of
cavalry to infantry was about 1 to 6, but in later
Macedonian armies it was about 1 to 20. This prob-
ably reﬂects Alexander’s exceptional use of cavalry,
rather than a long-term trend away from cavalry and
toward infantry. Other armies in Alexander’s time
had much smaller ratios of cavalry to infantry.
SOLDIERS
Hoplites
Hoplites were heavily armored infantry that eventu-
ally became the regular troops employed by city-
states. Citizens who could not maintain horses but
nevertheless had sufficient wealth to equip them-
selves were required to serve as hoplites. A hoplite
was protected by a breastplate, helmet, greaves and a
heavy round shield called a hoplon, from which the
name hoplite was derived. A hoplite was armed with
a sword and long thrusting spear (ﬁg. 3.2). This set of
equipment was very expensive (probably comparable
to the cost of a modern automobile), and varied in
price according to factors such as quality and style.
Hoplites fought in a phalanx in close formation (ﬁg.
3.4). In Sparta, a hoplite would also wear a red cloak
and his hair long.
Phalangites
After Philip II reformed the infantry into “Foot
Companions,” the Macedonian phalanx consisted of
heavy infantry armed differently from the usual
Greek hoplite. They are therefore usually referred to
as phalangites (soldiers of the phalanx). Their main
weapon was the sarissa (a name also used for a cavalry
spear). At times they were armed with other
weapons, such as swords and javelins. The phalan-
gites seem to have worn a cuirass, helmet and
greaves, and they carried a round shield. Evidence
suggests that the amount of body armor worn varied
with the soldier’s position in the phalanx. The pha-
langites in the front ranks apparently had more and
better-quality armor than those in the ranks behind,
with the rear ranks wearing little or no armor.

Hypaspists
These Macedonian infantry were less heavily armed
than the phalangites. The hypaspists (literally, shield-
bearers) are not mentioned before the time of Alexan-
der the Great, but were probably developed into
proper infantry by Philip II. They were probably
lightly armored hoplites, carrying a spear and shield.
They usually fought alongside the Foot Companions,
between the phalanx and cavalry, probably to protect
the ﬂanks of the phalanx. In later Hellenistic armies,
such as that of Philip V, the name hypaspist seems to
refer to a body of staff ofﬁcers reserved for special
duties and to the King’s Bodyguard (agema).
Peltasts
These lightly armed infantry soldiers were named
for their lightweight, wickerwork, peltate shield.
Originally, peltasts were Thracian tribesmen, ﬁght-
ing in their native dress, which included a patterned
cloak, high boots and a Phrygian cap of fox skin with
ﬂaps to cover the ears. The name “peltast” came to
be used for any similar, lightly armed infantry. The
main weapons of the peltast were javelins. Because
they were lightly armed, peltasts could avoid the
charge of the heavily armored hoplites. Their tactics
were to run in, throw their javelins and escape before
the hoplites could reach them. Later changes to their
equipment, attributed to Iphicrates, included
increasing by half the length of their javelins and
almost doubling the size of their swords, so that they
could act as regular troops and not just skirmishers.
The role of peltasts apparently declined after the rise
of the Macedonian armies.
Helots
The territory ruled by Sparta was divided into state-
owned farms run by helots (serfs) who greatly out-
numbered Spartan citizens (Spartiates). As the need
grew in the 5th century BC for lightly armed troops
to support the hoplites, helots were increasingly used
as skirmishers with the Spartan army. A combined
army of Spartiates and helots is referred to as
Lacedaemonian. On campaign each Spartiate was
accompanied by a helot who carried his baggage.
Archers
Archers were used in Greek warfare from earliest
times, and archery is mentioned quite often in
Homer’s Iliad. Archery seems to have played a crucial
role in the Trojan War, but Homer implies that
archers had a lower status than spearmen. Leaders
like Teucer and Odysseus were proﬁcient with the
bow, but they also fought with other weapons. How-

3.2 Hoplite soldiers, with Argive shields and long spears, wearing Corinthian helmets and greaves

ever, there is some evidence of groups of specialist
archers even at this early date.
Later Greek armies concentrated on soldiers of
the phalanx (ﬁg. 3.5), and archery seems to have been
neglected, except in Crete. Contingents of archers
in Greek armies were therefore often mercenaries,
usually Scythians or Cretans. Athens employed
Scythian and Cretan archers as early as the 6th cen-
tury BC. Scythian archers were often portrayed in
contemporary Attic vase paintings, frequently shoot-
ing from a kneeling position. They wore a distinctive
longpointed cap or hat, loose tunic, and trousers;
slung from their belt was a bow case, which also con-
tained their arrows. The Scythians protected the
hoplites, and in the 5th century BC Scythian archers
who had been bought as public slaves for Athens
served as a police force in the city.
Nevertheless, the importance of archery was not
fully appreciated until the latter part of the Pelopon-
nesian War, and archers were not always used effec-
tively. In part, this may have been because Greek
archers pinched the bowstring between thumb and
foreﬁnger, a weak grip that did not allow them to use
the most powerful bows. The Scythians used the ﬁrst
three fingers of the hand curled around the bow-
string (the “Mediterranean loose,” still used today)
and so could draw the more powerful Scythian bows
(fig. 3.15). Hellenistic armies made greater use of
archers, but unlike the Parthian armies, the Greeks
never used archers as a main element of their forces.
Archers were generally armed with only a bow and
arrows and did not wear armor. They were almost
always foot soldiers; mounted archers were rarely
used by the Greeks until the time of Alexander the
Great. See also bows p. 117.
Slingers
A simple weapon like the sling was probably used
from earliest times. Rare ﬁnds of baked clay sling bul-
lets show that the sling was used in the Mycenaean
period. Slingers were an important contingent within
armies, particularly from the 5th century BC. They
were recruited from Crete and from some peoples of
northern Greece, but the most famous slingers came
from Rhodes and usually served as mercenaries. Rho-
dian slingers could achieve a range of over 1,140 ft
(347 m), a greater range than the bow, and their sling
shot could penetrate unprotected ﬂesh from a dis-
tance of 300 ft (91 m). Slingers were generally armed
with only their sling and a bag of stones, although
some carried small shields and wore widebrimmed
hats to protect their eyes from the sun’s glare.
Macedonian armies had contingents of slingers.
Around 170 BC they developed a short arrow or bolt
called a cestrosphendone (kestros), which could be
ﬁred from a sling. Another late Macedonian inven-
tion was a sling mounted on a long pole, which ordi-
nary soldiers, rather than specialist slingers, used to
throw large stones. See also slings p. 118.
Elite Units
Several Greek armies had an elite unit of selected
warriors. The Theban army had a unit of 300 sol-
diers called the Sacred Band (Hieros Lokhos), which
apparently originated at an early period as 150 chari-
oteers and their drivers. According to Greek tradi-
tion (but later denied by Xenophon), the unit was
composed of pairs of homosexual lovers. The Sacred
Band is ﬁrst mentioned by name as taking part in the
battle of Delium in 424 BC, by which time it was a
unit of hoplites. It was probably the unit described as
the “300 ﬁrst and best Thebans” who died at the bat-
tle of Plataea (479 BC). These hoplites were probably
organized into 12 enomotiai of 25 men, and they were
the shock troops largely responsible for Theban mil-
itary successes.
The Spartans also had an elite force of 300 hoplites
called the hippeis who acted as the royal bodyguard
(see p. 94). In Arrian’s account of the life of Alexander
the Great, there is mention of a unit called the argy-
raspides (Silver Shields). Diodorus Siculus mentions
the Silver Shields as an elite unit accompanying
Eumenes of Cardia after Alexander’s death, but noth-
ing else is known about the unit in Alexander’s army.
Auxiliaries
The phalanx of heavily armed hoplites (ﬁg. 3.2) was a
massive improvement on the preceding haphazard
battle formations. It was adopted by all Greek states,
but in time its weaknesses became apparent. It was of
no use for fighting on hills, mountains or rough
ground, and was useless against cavalry or lightly
M I L I T A R Y A F F A I R S
101

armed troops using guerrilla tactics. To cope with
these problems, other types of soldiers (auxiliaries)
were employed. Athens used Scythian and Cretan
archers as early as the 6th century BC, but a need for
lightly armed troops was apparently accepted only
after the Persian Wars. Light cavalry and light
infantry were used in any numbers only during the
Peloponnesian War in the second half of the 5th cen-
tury BC. Peltasts became the most common and most
successful form of light infantry, and archers and
slingers were also employed. Lightly armed troops
were always regarded as inferior to the hoplites. The
light infantry’s main purpose was to protect the pha-
lanx of hoplites from the enemy’s lightly armed
troops, and so they were usually stationed on the
wings or behind the phalanx. In 390 BC a force of
highly trained peltasts led by Iphicrates defeated a
Spartan mora at the battle of Lechaeum, which com-
pletely changed the Greek attitude to lightly armed
troops.
Mercenaries
Records from Egypt show that Greeks were serving as
mercenaries as early as the 7th-6th centuries BC. Ini-
tially such mercenaries found employment outside
Greece, often with the Persians, but during the Pelo-
ponnesian War between Athens and Sparta (5th cen-
tury BC), both sides employed mercenaries, and they
were valuable in having experience of warfare. Merce-
naries were usually used as reinforcements and some-
times on garrison duties, but not in the phalanx.
Mercenaries were also employed to provide specialist
troops, such as archers from Crete or slingers from
Rhodes. At the end of the Peloponnesian War, large
numbers of mercenaries who had known no other life
were left unemployed. Consequently mercenaries
were commonly employed within Greece and beyond.
Chariots and Cavalry
CHARIOTS
Horses were originally used in Greece to pull chari-
ots and not for riding. Chariots were used from the
Mycenaean period, for hunting and ceremonial pur-
poses, as well as warfare (fig. 3.3). Surviving texts
from Knossos list more than 400 chariots associated
with the palace, which were probably used for mili-
tary purposes. The landscape of Greece is generally
too rugged for chariots, but they do appear to have
been used for warfare until at least the beginning of
the Dark Age. Chariots could be used effectively
only on smooth terrain, because uneven ground
could cause breakage of the pole that yoked the
horses to the chariot body, allowing the horses to
bolt and leaving the occupants stranded.
In Homer’s Iliad warriors are portrayed as riding
to battle in chariots driven by other warriors or by
specialist drivers. The warriors then fought on foot,
and the chariots were held at a short distance, ready
for retreat if necessary. There appears to have been
little in the way of formal tactics for ﬁghting from
chariots. Their main purpose was to deliver a body of
warriors swiftly to the point where they fought and
to get them away again if they were unsuccessful.
The Iliad does give some instances of warriors ﬁght-
ing from chariots with spears and bows and arrows.
However, chariots were not generally used as ﬁght-
ing platforms and were not used in attempts to
charge and break enemy formations.
By the end of the Dark Age, chariots no longer
seem to have been used for warfare. Although still
portrayed in paintings on pottery, they appear to
have been used for ceremonies or possibly races. War
chariots were obsolete by about 700 BC, and by the
time of the Persian Wars they were used by the
Greeks only for sport.

CAVALRY
The military role of chariots was replaced by cavalry,
probably because an improved horse bit was devel-
oped from about the 9th century BC, allowing better
control of horses. At ﬁrst horses appear to have been
used in the same way as chariots, largely as transport
for infantry. Some wealthier citizens rode to war on
horses, then dismounted to ﬁght as hoplites. How-
ever, very little cavalry is apparent in early Greek
armies, probably due to the expense of buying and
keeping horses and the unsuitable terrain in many
parts for breeding them. Greek city-states seem to
have relied on Boeotia and Thessaly to provide cav-
alry contingents. When Boeotia and Thessaly fell to
the Persians in the Persian Wars, the other states
appear to have fought without cavalry.
Cavalry (hippeis), drawn mainly from the upper
classes, ﬁrst appears to have been used seriously in
the later 5th century BC during the Peloponnesian
War. Even then it was only lightly armed, usually
with javelins, and was used for skirmishing and pro-
tection of the infantry. From the 5th century BC,
Athens, Sparta and most other city-states had their
own cavalry, but this was often supplemented with
auxiliary cavalry from other states, such as Thessaly.
Their own cavalry was often formed by the wealthier
citizens who served as “knights,” probably because of
the enhanced social status that this type of service
afforded. In some states, such as Eretria, the ruling
oligarchy was actually called the hippeis, owing to the
fact that only the wealthy could afford horses. In
Sparta wealthier citizens paid for cavalry horses but
did not serve in person. Cavalry does not seem to
have been used effectively until the Theban cam-
paigns led by Epaminondas in the early 4th century
BC. It was still a relatively minor part of Greek armies
until the rise of Macedonia in the second half of the
4th century BC.
Macedonia’s signiﬁcant cavalry force during the
5th century BC occasionally supplied contingents to

ﬁght in the Peloponnesian War. At this stage the cav-
alry may have been lightly armed, but at least some
wore armor. When Philip II gained power he
reformed the army, including the cavalry. His cavalry
was drawn from the aristocracy and called “The
Companions” (hetairoi), implying that it may have
originated as a royal mounted bodyguard. It formed
a unit of heavy cavalry that could break up opposing
infantry units. The Companion cavalry wore armor
and carried the long spears known as sarissai (or sari-
sai). The cavalry was probably also armed with a
slashing sword for close combat.
Xenophon recommended a number of items of
armor to be worn by a cavalryman and his horse,
although it is doubtful if all the items were used by
many cavalrymen. Most cavalrymen probably wore a
cuirass, helmet and high boots, and possibly thigh
guards and protection for the left arm (a piece of
armor that seems to have fallen from fashion soon
after Xenophon’s death). Little evidence exists for
the horse armor listed by Xenophon, such as chest,
side and belly armor, although chamfrons (face
guards) were used.
Even before the death of Philip II (339 BC), the
Macedonian army was swelled by contingents of sol-
diers from conquered territories, which continued
with Alexander’s campaigns. The Macedonian cav-
alry (the Companions) appears to have continued
with little change. However, elite detachments were
drawn from the Companions, such as the royal
squadron of cavalry (ﬁrst ile), which formed its spear-
head. The Companions remained the elite corps of
Alexander’s cavalry, but units were added of lightly
armed Thessalian and Macedonian scouts (prodro-
moi), contingents of cavalry from Greek city-states,
Persian mounted archers and increasing numbers of
Oriental cavalry (ﬁg. 3.4).
ELEPHANTS
In his campaigns Alexander the Great encountered
armies using war elephants. He was impressed by
their performance and brought 200 with him on his
return from India. Subsequent Greek armies often
included a contingent of elephants, which were used
almost exclusively against cavalry because horses do
not like their smell. The size and appearance of a
force of war elephants could also have a demoralizing
effect on an opposing army. Occasionally the strength
of elephants was useful in siege warfare for such tasks
as pulling down palisades. Initially Indian elephants
were used, but later a slightly smaller species of forest
elephant from North Africa was used as well. The
Indian elephants were sometimes ﬁtted with tops or
towers from which soldiers could ﬁght.
Supply
During military expeditions, it was easier to trans-
port troops by sea. If land transport was necessary,
the army marched on foot, apart from the cavalry.
With the campaigning season usually restricted to
the warmer months, the soldiers usually slept in the
open or in skin tents, and where possible they lived
off the land. Supplies could be transported by sea, or
else by carts, pack-animals such as mules and horses,
and by people. Soldiers also took what they could
from the land they invaded, at the same time
destroying crops and farmhouses as part of their mil-
itary tactics.
TRAINING
Sparta
There is little evidence for military training before the
Classical period, with most information coming from
Sparta and Athens. In the Classical period, Sparta,
Crete and possibly some other states had a totalitarian
and militaristic approach to education. The Spartan
education system (agoge) was wholly concerned with
maintaining the military strength of the state. From
the age of seven years children were entirely under
the state’s control. They lived away from their par-
ents, in barracks. Boys’ education concentrated on
making them good soldiers. Their hair was cut short,
and they were divided into classes, forming units in
which they trained, ate and lived together.
Boys were taught by a mature and experienced
citizen, and academic education was minimal;
emphasis was placed on discipline and exercise. They
went barefoot and generally naked, and food was
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
104

simple and scarce. This was to encourage them to
steal so that, as soldiers, they could endure food
shortages and forage successfully. If caught stealing,
they were punished for being unsuccessful, not for
stealing. At the age of 12 years, the discipline became
much harsher, with constant work and exercise.
They had only one tunic for winter and summer.
Bravery was the highest virtue, and cowardice the
worst crime. Fighting was encouraged, but not
anger. Fights were supposed to break up immediately
when ordered by a citizen. At 20 years of age, men
were liable for military service.
Writing about the Spartan army of the late 5th
century BC, Xenophon maintained that there was no
need to train soldiers to use weapons because the arm
actions needed to handle spear and shield developed
naturally. Natural ability was doubtless enhanced by
practice in mock battles. Paintings on pottery sug-
gest that a simple range of maneuvers with spear and
shield was common, possibly the result of training.
Soldiers needed to march in order and maneuver as a
body in the phalanx (ﬁg. 3.5) because the success of
the phalanx was due largely to the discipline of the
hoplites. Most training appears to have consisted of
perfecting various maneuvers required in battle.
Athens
In Athens an ephebic college was founded by c. 335
BC to give formal military training to 18-year-old
men. An ephebos (pl. epheboi) was a youth between the
ages of 15 and 20, but the term came to refer to those
being trained for military service. There is no evi-
dence for an organized training institution before
this time, although 18-year-old men had always been
liable for military service. The kosmetes was in charge
of the college; he was elected, as were his assistants
(sophronistai). There were 10 (later 12) sophronistai,
one from each tribe of Athens, under the general
jurisdiction of the strategoi (generals). There were
also six appointed teachers: two physical training
instructors, an archery instructor, catapult instruc-
tor, javelin instructor and an instructor on the use of
heavy armor. The ﬁrst year of training consisted of
exercises and guard duty, at the end of which the
epheboi were granted a shield and spear by the state.
In the second year they were employed in the coun-
tryside and on frontier patrols, after which they
became full citizens.
After 305 BC the training ceased to be compul-
sory, and by 282 BC training lasted for only one year.
The trainees were paid a daily allowance of four
obols, although this was stopped when training was
no longer compulsory. The ephebic college subse-
quently became an elite institution for the wealthy.
By the end of the 2nd century BC, it had lost most of
its military emphasis and provided a more general
education.
Macedonia
There is little information about training of Mace-
donian troops. When Philip II became king of Mace-
donia in 359 BC, the Macedonian cavalry (“the
Companions”) was probably the best in Greece, but
the infantry was ill trained and badly organized.
Philip reformed the army, imposing a severe code of
regular training and discipline. Wheeled transport
was banned, and only one servant to carry equipment
was allowed for every 10 soldiers. Soldiers had to
carry 30 days’ rations when starting out on cam-
paign, and Philip trained them by regular marches
with full equipment and baggage. The number of
servants allowed to the cavalry was also restricted, so
that the number of camp followers and the size of the
baggage train were minimized. The heavy infantry
was reformed into a phalanx, probably based on that
of the Theban army, and would have been trained in
all the necessary maneuvers to take advantage of the
new type of spear (sarissa) with which they were
equipped. Philip called his newly formed phalanx the
Foot Companions.
BATTLE TACTICS
Homeric Warfare
The earliest evidence for Greek tactics comes from
Homer’s Iliad. This gives the impression of a disor-
ganized mêlée, with warriors from each side ﬁghting
individual duels. This is probably an unbalanced
M I L I T A R Y A F F A I R S
105

picture of early Greek warfare, caused by the poet’s
concentration on the parts played by the champions
and heroes. The poem compares the battle line of the
Myrmidons (Achilles’ elite warriors) to a carefully
built wall, the warriors standing with shield touching
shield in a solid line. This is likely to have been the
position before a battle, with armies drawn up in
opposing lines and meeting in this simple formation.
The battle probably broke up into a mêlée only after
one side had given way, followed by individual duels
and single combat. Before and during the battle, mis-
siles such as arrows, stones and javelins rained down
on both sides. After one side had broken and ﬂed,
chariots would be used for pursuit and escape.
Phalanx
Although the term “phalanx” is found in Homer
(probably to signify a group of soldiers fighting
together), the term is usually applied more precisely
to a military formation used from the 4th century BC.
It may have originated at an earlier date in Sparta,
possibly as early as the 8th century BC (see p. 96). A
more disciplined system of ﬁghting was introduced,
possibly in the 8th century BC. Instead of a few long
ranks (the previous battle formation), the soldiers
were drawn up in many short ﬁles. These ﬁles were
often, but not always, eight ranks deep. Each phalanx
was composed of these ﬁles of men, with each ﬁle
being a unit. When one man fell, the soldier behind
took his place.
While the phalanx could withstand attacks from
cavalry and lightly armed skirmishers, it was too slow
and clumsy to be effective against them. Adding cav-
alry and lightly armed troops to the hoplites of the
phalanx gave it a measure of ﬂexibility and also some
protection for its ﬂanks. The lightly armed skirmish-
ers could harass the opposing phalanx or protect the
flanks of their own phalanx, while the cavalry
harassed the enemy. However, the outcome of the
battle still depended on the phalanx itself. Usually
both sides had cavalry and lightly armed skirmishers,
so the advantage of such troops was reduced.
In 390 BC the Athenian Iphicrates routed a Spar-
tan mora of hoplites with a force of lightly armed
troops at the battle of Lechaeum, something that was
thought virtually impossible. Lightly armed troops
had already proved a serious threat in the battle of
Sphacteria (425 BC), and after the success of Iphi-
crates, lightly armed troops played an increasingly
important role.
The phalanx battle formation developed parallel
with improvements in weapons and armor. Before
the rise of Macedonia, soldiers of the phalanx were
hoplites (heavily armored infantry), who originally
carried javelins, a sword and shield, but they were
later armed with a long thrusting spear instead of
javelins, which enabled them to keep a tighter for-
mation in the phalanx. Soldiers in the phalanx of
Macedonian armies were of different types and were
not always as heavily armed as earlier hoplites. The
term “phalangite,” meaning a “soldier of the pha-
lanx,” is sometimes used when referring to the later
Macedonian armies, where the phalanx consisted of
more than one type of soldier. See also the various
tactics using the phalanx (below).
Hoplites
The heavily armed hoplites fought in a phalanx in
close formation, and their tactics were relatively sim-
ple. The two main tactics of the hoplite phalanx were
to break through or push over the line of the oppos-
ing phalanx, or to outflank it. Phalanxes of two
opposing armies were drawn up facing each other,
four or more ranks deep. The shields of each front
rank overlapped to form a defensive wall, and the
thrusting spears were held above the shoulder in an
overarm grip, so that spears of several ranks could
project over the wall of shields (ﬁg. 3.5). Even with
their shields hoplites were very vulnerable to attack if
they were not in phalanx formation. To prevent out-
ﬂanking maneuvers, armies that were seriously out-
numbered would try to form up for battle in a place
where their ﬂanks were protected by natural obsta-
cles, such as in a pass.
The whole success of a battle depended on the
outcome of the initial clash of the two phalanxes. As
the opposing phalanxes approached, they would
break into a run just before impact, but keep in for-
mation. The opposing shield and spear walls would
crash into each other. Each phalanx tried to push for-
ward and break up the enemy phalanx formation. As
one soldier fell, the one behind took his place. The
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
106

struggle continued until one side broke and fled.
While the phalanx was locked together in combat,
casualties were few because there was little room for
effective use of spears. When one side broke, the
ﬂeeing hoplites usually discarded their shields and
were then vulnerable to faster, lighter-armed troops,
as well as to pursuing hoplites. Casualties were much
higher.
The Theban Tactic
In the 4th century BC there was an important devel-
opment in hoplite tactics. At the battle of Leuctra
(371 BC), the Thebans, led by Epaminondas and
Pelopidas, used a different formation of the phalanx
and defeated the Spartans. Instead of the front line of
the phalanx being straight, the Theban front line was
deliberately slanted forward on the left wing. This
meant that the left wing, which was 50 ranks deep,
impacted with the Spartan right wing, only 12 ranks
deep, before other parts of the front line of the pha-
lanx were engaged. The rest of the Spartan line was
engaged by light troops and cavalry. The formation
overwhelmed the Spartan right wing, traditionally
the strongest part of the phalanx with the best troops.
The Spartan attempt to reinforce their right wing was
stopped by a charge from the Theban Sacred Band,
and the Spartan army broke up into disarray. This
was the ﬁrst use of an echelon attack by a Greek army,
and Epaminondas used the same tactics successfully
at the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC.
Macedonian Tactics
With the reforms of the Macedonian army made by
Philip II came improved battle tactics. The phalanx
was uniformly deepened to between 16 and 20 ranks.
The enemy phalanx would first be attacked by a
charge from the cavalry, usually situated on the
Macedonian right wing. The cavalry would attempt
to crash through the enemy phalanx in a wedge for-
mation in order to swing around and attack from the
rear, while the Macedonian phalanx engaged it from
the front. The Macedonian phalanx might attack
with a straight front line, but usually it was deployed
obliquely with the right ﬂank leading. In the battles
of Alexander the Great, the initial attack was always
from the right wing led by Alexander himself at the
head of the Companion Cavalry. Other contingents
of cavalry covered the left wing.

shields; the ranks behind stand ready with their shields and spears to reinforce the front rank.

Hellenistic Tactics
After Alexander the Great tactics were further elabo-
rated, making use of all available tactical elements:
attacking in echelon formation, skirmishing, screen-
ing heavily armed troops with lightly armed troops
and using heavy cavalry to break the enemy line. A
new development was the use of elephants. They
were usually interspersed among units of lightly
armed troops, often as part of the frontal screen, in
order to disrupt the enemy cavalry. The phalanx was
no longer the most important element in the army
and was seldom used as the main thrust of the attack,
a role now performed by heavy cavalry. Tactics had
developed to the point that an army’s different ele-
ments had to act as a team to gain success.
WEAPONS
AND EQUIPMENT
Evidence of weapons and equipment comes mainly
from representations on painted pottery, sculpture,
models of clay or bronze, and remains of the actual
artifacts. Relatively little is known of the use of
weapons and equipment before the middle of the
2nd millennium BC, since such evidence comes
largely from archaeological ﬁnds of the weapons or
portrayals of weapons.
Armor
SHIELDS
Before the Mycenaean period, little evidence exists
for shields. In the Mycenaean period the most com-
mon type appears to have been the ﬁgure-of-eight
shield (ﬁg. 3.6a). It is depicted in frescoes and other
representations and is described by Homer. It had a
vertical curved piece of wood, fastened to a horizon-
tal curved piece of wood to form a cross-shaped
frame with bowed arms. The ﬁgure-of-eight cover-
ing built over this frame was made of several layers of
toughened bull’s hide, then glued and stitched over a
wickerwork layer. The rim of the shield was leather,
and the horizontal bowed frame was reinforced with
a wooden piece that also served as a grip. Homer also
described a shield “like a tower.” This probably
refers to a semi-cylindrical shield with a curved con-
vex top like the one portrayed on an inlaid dagger
found at Mycenae. Or it may refer to a shield without
the curved top, as portrayed in some frescoes. In
either case, this shield was probably also constructed
of leather stretched over a wooden frame.
Both types of Mycenaean shield were full-length
body shields and appear to have had shoulder straps
for support, so that both hands could wield a spear.
The “tower” shield is much less common than the
ﬁgure-of-eight in early portrayals of warriors. Small
round shields appear to have been introduced later in
the Mycenaean period, and representations of war-
riors show that a variety of other shield shapes were
also used, such as elliptical and round shields with a
segment cut from the bottom edge.
A shield developed from the ﬁgure-of-eight shape
and a round shield with a central hand grip were
both in use through the Dark Age. Bronze shield
bosses that probably belonged to a type of round
shield have been found. In the early 8th century BC
there were two main types of shield. The Dipylon
type (named after a cemetery at Athens where repre-
sentations of it were found) was oval in shape, with a
scallop cut from each side. This shield was similar to
the Mycenaean ﬁgure-of-eight shield and was prob-
ably a direct descendant (ﬁg. 3.6b). The other type of
shield was round with a central hand grip. Two late
examples of this type, dating to the early 7th century
BC, have been found at Delphi. They were made of
beaten bronze, had central hand grips, and one had a
pronounced central boss. These two Delphi shields
were probably obsolete by the early 7th century BC,
since the Argive shield had been developed in the
preceding century.
The Argive shield (hoplon, for which the hoplites
were named) probably developed from an earlier
type, as it was also a round shield, but it was much
more convex and had a reinforced rim (figs. 3.2,
3.6c). Instead of a central hand grip, Argive shields
had an arm band running vertically down the center
and a hand grip near the rim, so that the shield could
be supported by passing the forearm through the
arm band and clasping the hand grip. These shields
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
108

are shown in vase paintings from the mid-7th cen-
tury BC. Remains of these shields show that they var-
ied from 31.5 in (0.8 m) to 39 in (1 m) in diameter.
They were usually made of wood with an outer fac-
ing of bronze or ox hide and a bronze rim. The back
of the shield had a thin leather lining and bronze ﬁt-
tings. Because the shield’s wooden core was only
about 0.2 in (5 mm) thick in the center, a bronze
reinforcing plate was often mounted on the back of
the shield to provide added protection for the fore-
arm. Sometimes a leather curtain was hung from the
bottom of the shield to protect the legs from mis-
siles. The Argive shield continued to be used by
hoplites well into the 4th century BC.
With the increasing use of lightly armed troops
against hoplites in the 4th century BC, hoplite shields
were sometimes made smaller and lighter. The
Macedonian phalangite shield was also smaller and
did not have the pronounced rim of the Argive
shield. The phalangite shield was of wood faced with
bronze, usually with an embossed design. It had an
arm band and hand grip as on an Argive shield, but it
also had a strap that passed around the neck. Experi-
ments have shown that the shield could be supported
and controlled using the arm band and neck strap,
leaving both hands free to hold the sarissa, which was
longer than a hoplite spear and required both hands
to support it.
Lightly armed troops, such as peltasts, had lighter
shields made of wickerwork, sometimes covered with
goat or sheep skin or hide. Shields of Thracian
peltasts were known as peltai (sing. pelte). Originally
crescent (pelta) shaped, circular or oval pelta shields
became much more common. The peltasts were
named after their shields.
BODY ARMOR
The earliest known suit of European armor was
found in a tomb at Dendra, near Mycenae, and dates
to shortly after 1400 BC. It is plate armor, consisting
of a bronze cuirass with a skirt of three articulated
bronze plates in front and three behind. A separate
neck piece and hinged shoulder plates completed the
protection for the torso (ﬁg. 3.7) While not as cum-
bersome as it appears, it would have required heavy
internal padding and would have prevented the sol-
dier standing up once he had fallen. A composite hel-
met with bronze cheekpieces protected the head.
Remains of a pair of greaves and a single arm guard
were also found with the armor. A few other pieces of
bronze armor from this period are known, but it is

vase painting)

unlikely that bronze armor was commonly used.
Most armor at this time was probably leather, per-
haps reinforced with bronze plates. Breastplates and
greaves are mentioned by Homer, but apart from the
Dendra armor, no examples of a Greek cuirass sur-
vive from earlier than the 8th century BC.
An 8th-century bronze bell cuirass (so called
because of its shape) was found in a grave in Argos. It
is composed of front and back plates, which have
simple decoration reflecting the anatomy of the
upper torso (fig. 3.8a). The two plates are held
together by a series of catches along the sides and on
the shoulders. A semicircular bronze plate (mitra)
suspended from a belt could be used with this type of
cuirass to protect the abdomen. The bell cuirass
declined in popularity during the second half of the
6th century BC. It was replaced by the linen cuirass,
although the bronze cuirass continued to be used and
evolved into the muscled cuirass.
There were two types of muscled cuirass: a short
version, which ﬁnished at the waist, and a longer ver-
sion, which covered the abdomen. The muscled
cuirass was molded to reflect the muscles of the
torso. It consisted of front and back plates, usually
joined with catches at the sides and sometimes at the
shoulders (ﬁg. 3.8b). In the 4th century BC the longer
version of the muscled cuirass was adapted for cav-
alry use. The muscled cuirass continued in use until
the end of the Roman period.
Linen cuirasses (ﬁgs. 3.8c, 3.8d) are thought to
have been used since the Mycenaean period and are
mentioned in Homer’s Iliad, but they became standard
armor for hoplites only in the late 6th century BC. The
linen cuirass was made by gluing together many layers
of linen to form a stiff vest about 2 in (5 mm) thick. It
was wrapped around the body and tied together on
the left-hand side, with another piece protecting the
shoulders. Below the waist the cuirass was cut into
vertical strips to allow movement. A second layer cut
into similar strips (pteryges) was glued inside the ﬁrst
layer to cover the gaps. Linen cuirasses were cheaper
and lighter than bronze cuirasses, although they were
often reinforced by scales or plates. This type of
armor remained in use until the introduction of mail
armor in the 3rd century BC. An iron cuirass discov-
ered in the tomb of Philip II at Vergina is of the same
general design as a linen cuirass.
Cuirasses of bronze and linen continued to be
used into the Hellenistic period, but a much greater
variation is shown in contemporary sculptures and
paintings. Quilted linen cuirasses were also intro-
duced. Linen cuirasses are shown covered with scales
or overlapping rectangular plates (lamellar plates). In

LEG AND ARM GUARDS
Examples of greaves (full-length protection for the
lower legs) are known from the early 14th century
BC. Late Mycenaean artistic representations often
show warriors apparently wearing greaves. A few
bronze greaves of this date are known, and they are
also mentioned in Homer’s Iliad. However, greaves
appear to have come into general use only in the 7th
century BC. The early types covered the leg from the
ankle to just below the knee, but later examples were
lengthened to cover the knee as well (ﬁg. 3.2). The
7th- and 6th-century BC types were often highly dec-
orated, but later greaves were molded to reﬂect the
leg muscles in the same way that muscled cuirasses
were decorated. Greaves were usually pulled open and
clipped onto the legs, but examples from Italy have
attachment rings for straps to hold them in place.
Thigh guards are portrayed in contemporary art,
but only one example has been found (at Olympia).
Ankle guards, which covered both heel and ankle,
were much more common, and they were tied on.
There are also a few examples of foot guards, which
were ﬁtted to sandals to protect the toes and the part
of the foot not protected by greaves and ankle guards.
All these bronze guards were lined with leather or
fabric. Before the mid-6th century BC the lining was
rolled over the edge of the guard and stitched
through holes in the bronze. This method of ﬁxing
the lining was also used on Mycenaean greaves and
limb guards, giving possible evidence of continuity in
armor construction through the Dark Age. All limb
guards, except for greaves, went out of fashion at the
end of the 6th century BC, and even the use of
greaves was less popular after this date.
HELMETS
A conical helmet made from pieces of boar’s tusk on a
base of leather strips, together with bronze cheek-
pieces, was found with the bronze armor from a tomb
at Dendra, near Mycenae (fig. 3.7a). The helmet
dates to just after 1400 BC. The same type of helmet
appears in Mycenaean representations of warriors
(ﬁg. 3.9). Later pottery paintings show warriors wear-
ing horned helmets and helmets with a spiky outline,
perhaps representing hedgehog pelts. A helmet of the
type found at Dendra is also described in Homer’s
Iliad, but the bronze helmets Homer mentions were
probably worn mainly by the elite warriors. Ordinary
soldiers probably wore leather helmets.
Later helmets show a pattern of development that
appears to have evolved from two prototypes, the
Kegelhelm and the primitive Corinthian helmet.
There is much confusion and controversy over the
naming of various types of helmets. Terms such as
Attic and Illyrian, still used to identify helmet styles,
can erroneously imply speciﬁc geographical origins.
The Kegelhelm (a German name meaning a
“cone-shaped helmet” or “skittle-shaped helmet”) is

the earliest type of Iron Age helmet found in Greece
(ﬁg. 3.10a). Dating to the 8th century BC, it appears
to have gone out of use by the 7th century BC. Two
types developed from the Kegelhelm: the Insular and
Illyrian. The Insular dates to the 7th century BC and
is known from a fragmentary example and many
miniature models, all from Crete (ﬁg. 3.10c). The
Insular and Illyrian types were made in two halves
that were riveted together, but the Illyrian, which
also dates to the 7th century BC, was being made in
one piece by the ﬁrst half of the 6th century BC (ﬁgs.
3.10b, 3.10d). Variations of the Illyrian remained in
use into the 5th century BC.
The Corinthian helmet was the most successful
Greek helmet, undergoing a number of changes over
a period of several centuries (ﬁgs. 3.10e–h). It cov-
ered the head, leaving only the eyes, nose and mouth
clear. The primitive Corinthian helmet dates to the
8th century BC. The 7th-century versions of this hel-
met developed an indentation on the bottom edge,
separating the neckline from the jawline. This fea-
ture is also found on early 6th-century BC helmets,
such as the Myros, apparently a very popular helmet
as many examples have been found, including one
with the name Myros. The cheekpieces of the
Corinthian helmet were very ﬂexible, so that the hel-
met could be pulled down over the head and still ﬁt
closely to the face. This also allowed the helmet to be
pushed back on top of the head (where the grip of
the cheekpieces held it in place), leaving the face and
ears free when the soldier was not ﬁghting (ﬁg. 3.11).
Variations of the Corinthian helmet were used in
Greece until the early 5th century BC, but the type
continued in Italy, with very evolved forms surviving
to the 1st century AD.
Both Illyrian and Corinthian helmets completely
covered the ears, making hearing impossible. To alle-
viate this problem, the Chalcidian type of helmet was
developed (ﬁg. 3.10i). This helmet is depicted in vase
paintings from the early 6th century BC and is char-
acterized by a cutaway area around the ears that
allowed the wearer to hear properly. Cheekpieces on
Chalcidian helmets were either ﬁxed or hinged. One
variation of the helmet lacked a nose guard; this lat-
ter helmet is often called the Attic type and is known
from Italy, with no examples from Greece.

e) Corinthian (8th century BC); f ) Corinthian (7th century BC); g) Myros type of Corinthian helmet; h) Corinthian
(5th century BC); i) Chalcidian

The Thracian type of helmet (ﬁg. 3.12b) devel-
oped independently of the Corinthian and Illyrian and
was in use from the 5th century BC. Thracian and
Chalcidian helmets continued to be popular in the 4th
century BC, when they were often more decorated. A
simple bell-type cap was also popular at this time (ﬁg.
3.12a). The Boeotian type of helmet (ﬁg. 3.12c), with
only vestigial cheekpieces, provided good all-around
vision. It was used by the Macedonian Companion
Cavalry. In the Hellenistic period the Thracian type of
helmet continued to be popular. However, there was
now a much greater diversity of helmet styles, all more
or less loosely based on previous helmet types, and
often with the addition of new decorative features.
All bronze helmets were lined or worn over caps
to provide padding that reduced the force of blows to
the head. Early helmet linings were held in place by
being rolled over the helmet’s edges and stitched
through holes in the metal, but later linings were
glued in place.
Spears
Bronze spearheads with a partial socket (sometimes
called a “shoeslot”) were used in the First Palace
Period. Spearheads with very long sockets into which
the spear shaft ﬁtted appear to have been introduced
in the Second Palace Period. These spearheads were
generally very long, ranging from 11.8 in (0.3 m) to
23.6 in (0.6 m). They were used on thrusting spears,
although some smaller spearheads may also have
been used on javelins. In the Third Palace Period

“one-piece” spearheads were used; they were about
the same length as the long-socket type, but the one-
piece spearhead incorporated the socket completely
within the blade. Some were decorated and were
obviously prestige weapons. Spearheads in use
toward the end of the Third Palace Period were
shorter, seldom over 9.8 in (0.25 m) in length, and
with a definite socket. The trend toward smaller
spearheads appears to have continued, resulting in a
short, leaf-shaped spearhead. Both long and short
spearheads were in use in the Postpalatial Period.
Homer refers to spears in the Iliad. Throwing
spears (javelins) were usual, but some were obviously
thrusting spears, such as Hector’s, which was supposed
to be 11 cubits long (about 18 ft, 5.5 m). According to
Homer, spear shafts were made of ash wood.
In a Dark Age grave at Vergina, an iron spear-
head and an iron spike on the butt of the shaft were
found in situ, showing that the spear was about 7.5 ft
(2.3 m) long. This is consistent with the estimated
size of spears later portrayed in vase paintings, which
appear to be between 6.6 ft (2 m) and 9.9 ft (3 m)
long. Spears shown in vase paintings are leaf shaped,
and many socketed iron spearheads of this type have
been found. These spears sometimes had a socketed
iron or bronze spike on the butt of the shaft; the use
of socketed bronze spear butts had begun during the
Mycenaean period. If the spearhead was broken off,
the shaft and the spear butt could be used instead,
and armor has been found that was apparently
pierced by spear butts. The part of the shaft where
the spear was held was bound with leather thonging
to provide a secure grip. These thrusting spears were
the main weapon of the hoplite, and changed little
for several centuries. In phalanx formation the spear
was held in one hand in an overarm grip (ﬁg. 3.5).
Throwing spears (javelins) were used by the
lightly armed troops, such as peltasts, who supported
the phalanx of hoplites. These spears were shorter
and lighter, with smaller spearheads. A thong was
often ﬁxed to the spear shaft and twisted around it,
and the loop at the end of the thong was held around
the thrower’s ﬁngers. When the spear was thrown, the
thong provided extra leverage and also caused the
spear to spin in ﬂight, giving it greater accuracy.
After the reforms of Philip II the phalangites of the
Macedonian phalanx were armed with a long two-
handed spear called a sarissa. Ancient sources disagree
about its size. According to Theophrastus the longest
sarissa was 12 cubits (c. 18 ft, 5.4 m) long, but Polybius
said they were 14 cubits (c. 21 ft, 6.3 m) long and orig-
inally 16 cubits (c. 24 ft, 7.2 m). The shaft of the sarissa
was made of cornel wood (from the cornelian cherry
tree). It may have been made in two pieces and joined
with an iron sleeve. Such a sleeve has been found with
the iron head and butt of a sarissa at Vergina. The
name sarissa was also used for the smaller spears used
by the Macedonian Companion Cavalry.
Swords
Swords always seem to have taken second place after
spears (ﬁg. 3.13). Bronze swords were used by the
end of the First Palace Period. They had a long
tapering bronze blade with a strengthening midrib
and are usually classified as Type A swords. The
sword hilt was joined to the blade by a short tang
and a few rivets, which could not have provided a
particularly strong joint. By the Second Palace

Period these swords were a main part of a soldier’s
armament, and blades over 35.4 in (0.9 m) have been
found, although the usual length was probably less
than 27.5 in (0.7 m).
A Type B sword was developed, which had a larger,
ﬂanged tang and a broader base to the blade, providing
a better method of joining it to the hilt. A fully devel-
oped Type B sword has not been found in Second
Palace Period contexts on Crete itself, but was proba-
bly developed by mainland Mycenaean bronzesmiths.
In the Third Palace Period several types of swords
were in use that are generally classiﬁed as Types C, D
and G. The Type C sword had projections at the base
of the blade to protect the hand, while the Type D
sword was shorter and had shoulders at the base to
protect the hand. The Type G sword was even
shorter, but also had projections to protect the hand
and a blade less tapered than previous swords.
Toward the end of the Third Palace Period,
Types E and F short swords (or daggers) were in use,
and at the very end of the period the European Type
II sword (Naue Type II) was introduced. This was a
longer sword that had a blade with parallel edges and
a ﬂanged hilt. It became the predominant sword type
in the Postpalatial Period. Some Type II swords have
hilts with ivory hilt plates and decorative gold bands.
The Type II sword was in use at the very end of the
Mycenaean period, and similar iron swords dated to
the Dark Age show that the same style of sword con-
tinued, but was made of iron instead of bronze. A
slashing weapon, it slowly evolved into a slightly
shorter leaf-shaped slashing sword with a blade
about 23.6 in (0.6 m) long. This became the normal
hoplite sword, used only for ﬁghting at close quarters
or if the hoplite’s spear broke (ﬁg. 3.8c).
In the 6th and 5th centuries BC, a sword with a
curved iron, single-edge blade (kopis) gradually
appeared as an alternative to the hoplite sword. Early
versions of this sword were slashing weapons, with
blades about 25.5 in (0.65 m) long. They later evolved
into shorter cut-and-thrust swords with blades about
17.7 in (0.45 m) long that were popular in Macedonia.
Daggers
Early bronze daggers are known from the Prepalatial
Minoan Period. They were short, usually under 7.9
in (0.2 m) long, and may have been all-purpose
knives as much as weapons. Hilts were attached by
riveting them to the base of the blade; reriveted
blades show that this was not always a strong method
of attachment. The blades were strengthened by a
central midrib. By the First Palace Period longer
blades around 13.8 in (0.35 m) were in use, and by
the Second Palace Period large daggers were being
produced. It is often very difﬁcult to distinguish a
short sword from a long dagger (ﬁg. 3.14). Toward
the end of the Third Palace Period, short daggers
(or swords) known as Types E and F were in use. As
a weapon the dagger appears to have been totally
eclipsed by the sword.
Daggers continued in use through the Dark Age
and succeeding periods. After the Dark Age (if not
before), they may have been regarded more as all-
purpose knives than as weapons. Short swords or dag-

gers were carried particularly by lightly armed troops
such as slingers and archers, who would otherwise be
unarmed when they had ﬁred all their missiles.
Bows
Although bows were used throughout the Bronze
Age, no examples from Greece have been found.
Arrowheads were at ﬁrst made from stone such as
chert and obsidian, as in the preceding Neolithic
period, but were later made from bronze, of which
many examples have been found (ﬁg. 3.15). Records
of quantities of arrowheads and javelin heads in Lin-
ear B texts suggest that the use of missile weapons,
including the bow and arrow, was a more important
feature of early warfare than the evidence otherwise
indicates. It has even been suggested that armor was
developed to provide soldiers with protection from
missiles rather than from spear thrusts. The evidence
suggests that the Minoans used a composite bow, but
the few early representations of Mycenaean bows
appear to be the simple one-piece “stave” or “self”
bows, which continued in use in Greece for many
centuries. Evidence for bows and arrows dating to
the Dark Age is sparse, except in Crete where ﬁnds
of arrowheads show that they were used throughout
that period.
At some stage the Cretans switched from the
stave bow to the composite bow. Both Scythian and
Cretan archers used composite bows made from
wood, horn, bone and sinew (ﬁg. 3.15). Bowstrings
were of dried gut or sinew. The Cretan composite
bow was a simple bow in the shape of a segment of a

circle, whereas the Scythian bow was doubly convex.
The Scythian bow was more powerful than the Cre-
tan and had a range of over 480 ft (146 m). Vase
paintings show that Scythian archers carried a bow
and arrows in a composite case slung from a belt.
Arrowheads were bronze and of various shapes, but
Cretan arrowheads were generally larger and heavier
than Scythian ones. Arrowheads were usually sock-
eted so that the end of the arrow shaft ﬁtted neatly to
the head. Iron arrowheads may have been widely
used, but few examples have survived. See also
ARCHERS p. 100.
Slings
Slings were made from (or from materials reinforced
with) dried gut or sinew. One end of the sling was
looped around the slinger’s wrist, who held the other
end in his hand, with the shot held in the loop of the
sling. The sling was whirled around to give the sling
shot momentum, and the end of the sling was
released to launch the sling shot. Sling shots were
made of stone, baked clay and lead. Thousands of
lead sling shots or bullets have been found. They
were cast in clay molds and were plum shaped, some-
times with motifs and short inscriptions on the sur-
face as part of the casting, such as dexa (take that).
Lead shot generally weighed 0.7–1.7 oz (20–50 g),
but much heavier weights were also used (ﬁg. 3.16).
Sling shots could not be seen in ﬂight, and lead sling
shots in particular could cause terrible wounds.
Xenophon described how they could enter the body
deep enough for the ﬂesh to close over them.
A late Macedonian invention, around 170 BC, was
a short bolt or arrow called the cestrosphendone
(Greek kestros). This had a short iron bolt head
attached to a short wooden shaft with flights
attached. It was thrown by a sling with two loops in
order to hold the cestrosphendone securely. A sling
mounted on a long pole was a late Macedonian
invention and enabled ordinary soldiers to throw
large stones. See also SLINGERS p. 101.
Artillery
The earliest known piece of artillery is the gas-
traphetes (belly bow), which was invented in Syracuse
c. 400 BC, possibly at the instigation of Dionysius I,
tyrant of Syracuse. The gastraphetes was a very pow-
erful composite bow, mounted on a stock with a draw
and release mechanism. This mechanism had a slider
on a ratchet with a claw and trigger. To operate the
gastraphetes, the slider was pushed forward along the
stock, and the claw hooked the bowstring. The front
of the stock was then placed on the ground, and the
operator leaned on the back of the stock, which had
a specially shaped transverse piece of wood. The
slider was pulled back over the teeth of the ratchet
until the bowstring was taut, and the arrow was
loaded onto the stock, against the bowstring. The
weapon could be ﬁred by pulling the trigger, which
allowed the claw to pivot upwards, releasing the
bowstring. The advantage of the gastraphetes over an
ordinary bow was its greater power and range.
Because of its weight and slow rate of ﬁre, it was used
mainly in siege warfare.
A more powerful mechanical bow, the oxybeles
(bolt-shooter) was developed c. 375 BC. This used a
winch to draw back the bowstring. Because of the
extra weight involved in building a more robust and
powerful machine, the oxybeles was ﬁxed to a stand.
The use of an even more powerful bow than that of
the gastraphetes gave increased range and accuracy.
A later development of the oxybeles was to replace
the composite bow with a pair of torsion springs.
Each spring was made by twisting a bundle of sinew
ropes, into which was inserted a bar. The torsion of
the sinews provided the power, forcing the bar for-
ward. The two springs were mounted symmetrically,
so that the bars of the springs could act as the arms of

3.16 Lead sling shot with the inscription dexa (take that)

the bow. A bowstring was ﬁxed between them and
drawn back to the ﬁring position. The springs were
then drawn tight by further twisting of the sinew
ropes. The general name for this machine was kat-
apeltes (pl. katapeltai, shield piercers), because some
were capable of penetrating a soldier’s shield and
armor at ranges of more than 1,320 ft (402 m).
The bolts that were ﬁred from an oxybeles or kat-
apeltes varied according to the size of the machine. A
common length was about 27 in (0.68 m). The heads
of these bolts also varied, but they frequently had a
triple ﬁn or barb.
As katapeltai increased in size some were adapted
to throw stones. Depending on their size these
machines could throw stones of 10–180 lbs (4.5–82
kg). They were usually used in sieges to batter forti-
ﬁed walls, often at a range of 450–600 ft (157–185
m). Such a machine was called a lithobolos (literally,
stone-thrower). A machine capable of throwing the
larger stones was sometimes called a petrobolos (stone-
thrower). The stones used in these machines were
shaped into spheres to increase their accuracy, and
several dumps of these stones have been found.
Sometimes irregular stones were coated in clay to
make them spherical, but this reduced their impact
on the target.
Siege Engines
Before the mid-5th century BC siege engines were
apparently rarely used, although devices such as bat-
tering rams may have been used from earliest times.
It has even been suggested that the “wooden horse”
of Troy was in reality a battering ram protected by a
wooden superstructure. The siege of Plataea (429–
427 BC) provides the ﬁrst evidence of siege engines,
with a battering ram being used. This and other tac-
tics were unsuccessful, and the garrison had to be
starved into submission. Dionysius I (tyrant of Syra-
cuse, 405–367 BC) offered large rewards for new
inventions of siege engines and artillery. The result-
ing inventions revolutionized siege warfare, but they
seem to have been regularly used only under Philip
II of Macedonia (4th century BC).
The “tortoise” type of battering ram was used for
knocking down part of a wall. It was a beam of wood
(the actual ram) mounted within a protective timber
housing. The ram was either suspended so that it
could swing back and forth or supported by rollers.
The protective housing was mounted on wheels, so
that it could be pushed into position, and the housing
was covered with hide padded with seaweed. The
front end of the ram had a bronze or iron head in
order to cause maximum damage to the wall. The
ram was operated by men inside the protective hous-
ing. They swung the ram back and forth manually or
by a system of ropes and pulleys. A specialized form
of ram was the drill, which knocked a hole in a wall,
rather than shaking part of it down. The drill was a
wooden beam with an iron point that moved on
rollers within a wooden trough. The trough was
mounted inside a protective housing, and the drill
was moved back and forth by a system of ropes and
pulleys attached to a windlass.
Siege towers provided the attackers with pro-
tected access to the top of a wall. Built of wood and
covered with hides stuffed with wool or seaweed for
protection, the towers were mounted on wheels so
that they could be pushed up to the wall. Ladders or
stairs inside the protective tower gave access to the
top, and artillery and archers could ﬁre from interior
platforms. The towers sometimes had a drawbridge,
which could be let down onto the wall being
attacked. The Roman writer Vitruvius, quoting a lost
work by Diades (an engineer that Alexander the
Great took on his campaigns), gives the ideal dimen-
sions of siege towers. The smallest one (10 ﬂoors)
should be c. 88.5 ft (27 m) high and c. 24.5 ft (7.5 m)
wide at the base, with the top 20 percent narrower
than the base. The largest one (20 ﬂoors) should be
c. 177 ft (54 m) high, c. 34.5 ft (10.5 m) wide at the
base, with the top 20 percent narrower than the base.
The larger towers, with only slightly tapering sides,
would have been very unstable.
In 307 BC Demetrius I Poliorcetes (The Besieger)
used a massive siege tower during his siege of
Salamis. It was so large it was called the helepolis (lit-
erally, city destroyer). In his attempts to take Rhodes
in 305–304 BC, Demetrius built an even bigger hele-
polis, probably the largest siege tower constructed in
ancient Greece. It was 130–140 ft (40–43 m) high
and was built on a base 72 ft (22 m) square. The
tower tapered upward and was about 29.5 ft (9 m)
square at the top. It was mounted on wheels and had
nine ﬂoors, all of which were armed with some kind
M I L I T A R Y A F F A I R S
119

of artillery—catapults on the lower ﬂoors and bolt
throwers on the upper ones. It was built of wood,
and all major joints were reinforced with iron plates.
The front and sides were covered with iron plates to
protect it from burning missiles, and it had ports at
the front through which artillery could be fired.
These ports were covered with shutters, which could
be raised and lowered mechanically. The shutters
were covered with hide stuffed with wool to protect
against stone missiles.
At the siege of Delium in 424 BC, the Thebans
used ﬁre-raisers against a palisade held by the Atheni-
ans. The ﬁre-raiser was a cauldron of burning coal,
sulphur and pitch attached to one end of a long
wooden beam. The beam had been split and hollowed
out, so that an iron tube could be ﬁtted inside. The
two halves were bound together, and the cauldron end
was protected with iron plating. A bellows was ﬁtted at
the other end of the tube inside the beam to provide a
forced draught to the ﬁre in the cauldron. The beam
was ﬁxed to two wooden carts, so that the cauldron
could be pushed up against the palisade. The bellows
were operated at a distance to force ﬂames from the
cauldron to spread to the palisade.
Scaling ladders were frequently used in attempts
to break into besieged fortiﬁcations, but they were
vulnerable to attack by the defending forces. An
improvement on simple ladders was the sambuca
(sambuke), a ladder covered by a reinforced roof and
sides for protection. It was mounted on a wheeled
carriage by a horizontal pivot near the base of the
ladder, so that the top of the ladder could be raised to
the top of the wall being attacked. At the base of the
ladder was a compartment ﬁlled with stones. This
was used as a counterweight to the weight of the lad-
der and the soldiers (about 10) who climbed into the
protected top of the ladder before the attack. The
sambuca was wheeled up to the wall. Aided by the
counterweight, the top of the sambuca was raised to
the height of the wall by applying pressure to the
vertical arms of a capstan on the end of the pivot to
which the ladder was attached.
Various types of movable wooden shelters were
used to protect soldiers when they were close to the
walls of a besieged town, attempting to ﬁll in ditches
or undermine walls. Several shelters could be placed
together to provide a protective passage to the wall
or to siege engines close to the wall.
Casualties
Wounds must have been commonplace with the sol-
diers, though most information for treating wounds
and diseases comes from later (Greco-Roman) non-
military sources—see MEDICINE in chapter 9.
FORTIFICATIONS
Bronze Age–Iron Age
Evidence for fortiﬁcations before the Third Palace
Period is relatively rare and consists mainly of remains
of town walls, watchtowers and cisterns (that might
imply water storage in case of attack). In the Third
Palace Period fortiﬁed settlements were more com-
mon, but this may not be indicative of warfare until
the end of the period. It has been argued that fortiﬁ-
cations of the earlier Third Palace Period, such as
those at Mycenae and Tiryns, were initially for pres-
tige and control. A more serious threat is indicated at
these sites by the later provision of water supplies and
additional defended areas that could be used as refuge
for the surrounding population and their livestock.
The citadels of the Mycenaean period were nor-
mally built on the tops of hills and were fortiﬁed by
walls that followed the contours of the hills. The
walls at Mycenae are typical of such fortiﬁcations;
they are an average of 16.5 ft (5 m) thick and are built
of massive stones weighing up to 10 tons. The
method of construction has been labeled “Cyclo-
pean” (ﬁg. 1.4) from the later Greek explanation that
these walls had been built by the Cyclops. The walls
have ﬂat surfaces built with close-ﬁtting stones with-
out mortar, but the stones are irregular. An exception
is around gateways, which were often made more
impressive by the use of more massive blocks, or (as
at Mycenae) by the use of stones dressed into rectan-
gular blocks (fig. 6.22). For thicker walls the gap
between two outer layers of facing blocks was ﬁlled
with earth and rubble. Gateways through the walls
were constructed with a lintel supported by posts, all
made from massive slabs of stone. Only at Mycenae
has a sculpture been found surmounting the gateway
(ﬁg. 3.18). Walls of this type were used to enclose

probably weighs about 20 tons. Above is a relieving triangle with a carved slab 2 ft (0.61 m) thick. It has a relief of two
lions on either side of a column, but they have lost their heads.

large citadels, settlements, small forts and apparently
large areas of land. At Mycenae a bastion was built
out from the side of the gate, so that the defenders
could bombard attackers on their unshielded side.
Mycenae had two gateways (Lion Gate and Postern
Gate) and also two narrow sally ports to allow the
defenders to go out and attack the enemy without
having to open the main gates. At Tiryns the walls
had massive galleries built into them (fig. 3.17).
These may have been storage vaults for storing pro-
visions throughout a prolonged siege. There is evi-
dence that the tops of the walls were ﬁnished off with
mud-brick battlements.
Archaic and Classical
TOWN WALLS
Fortifications developed little from Mycenaean
methods until the 6th century BC. The 7th-century
BC fortiﬁcations of Emporion on the island of Chios
are very similar in concept to Mycenaean types, and
fortiﬁcations were still concentrated on the citadel
or acropolis. In the 6th century BC attempts were
made to enclose entire towns with effective fortiﬁca-
tions. Within (or sometimes outside) the walled city,
an acropolis usually occupied the most commanding
site, such as an isolated hill, serving as a refuge if an
enemy force gained access to the walled city itself.
Sometimes an acropolis served to hold a garrison,
often against the will of the inhabitants of the city it
dominated.
From the 6th century BC, town walls were built
following natural contours and making use of natural
defenses, such as steep slopes and cliffs. They were
often pierced by sally ports. Earlier walls of mud
brick or rubble masonry were now superseded by
stronger walls of dressed rectangular or polygonal
stone blocks, although mud brick may still have been
used for battlements. Towers projecting outward
from the walls were also introduced. Although bas-
tions projecting from walls and separate watchtowers
were used in Mycenaean times, the earliest use of
projecting towers appears to have been in the 6th-
century BC fortiﬁcations at Burunkuk in Asia Minor.
Initially such towers were used only to strengthen
weak points in the circuit of the wall and at gateways,
but by the 5th century BC two-story towers were
normal at regular intervals along the wall.
GATEWAYS
Gateways did not undergo any signiﬁcant develop-
ment until the 4th century BC (ﬁg. 3.19). Until then
they were modified versions of Mycenaean types,
guarded by one or two towers or bastions, or over-
lapping, with the outer wall parallel to the inner wall

Classical period: a) one ﬂanking tower; b) two ﬂanking
towers; c) overlapping type with one tower; d) Hellenistic

and ending in a tower. Attackers approaching the
gate had to pass between these two walls, and their
unshielded side was exposed to ﬁre from the tower at
the end of the outer wall. Gates usually had two
leaves opening inward. Hinges were not used.
Instead, the outer side of each gate had a pivot at
each end set into holes in the ﬂoor and the roof of
the gateway, allowing the gates to be opened and
closed. Gates were secured by a wooden bar placed
across the back of both gates and ﬁtted into holes in
the masonry on either side. This bar was sometimes
held in position by a locking bar and pin, which pre-
vented the main bar from being removed.
In the 4th century BC various gates that dropped
into place from above seem to have been used as a
second obstacle behind the traditional two-leaved
gates. There is some evidence that a true portcullis
was in use in the early 3rd century BC. This iron grat-
ing was raised and lowered from above, with its edges
running in vertical channels in the masonry walls of
the gateway.
Long Walls
In the 5th century BC, after the Persians retreated, the
fortiﬁcations of Athens were rebuilt and extended to
give fortiﬁed access to the harbors at Piraeus (Map 6).
Piraeus itself was fortiﬁed and connected to Athens
by “long walls,” which were strengthened at intervals
by two-story towers. Initially the northern wall (com-
pleted about 456 BC) ran from Athens to Piraeus and
the southern one from Athens to Phalerum, enclosing
a triangle of land. A middle wall was later added about
327 ft (100 m) south of the northern wall, to form a
defended corridor just over 4 miles (6.5 km) long.
The southern wall from Athens to Phalerum was then
allowed to decay.

Map 6 The Long Walls between Athens and Piraeus

Other seaboard cities, such as Corinth, also built
long walls to connect them with their ports or the
coast in order to ensure supplies when under siege.
In some instances the distance between the city and
the coast was too small for the connecting fortiﬁca-
tions to be called long walls. At Megara the Atheni-
ans built long walls (completed in 459 BC) from the
city to the port of Nisaea to ensure access to the
Athenian garrison in the city. The effectiveness of
long walls depended heavily on the number of sol-
diers available to defend them, but they probably
would not have been capable of withstanding a deter-
mined siege. With the development of siege warfare,
artillery and siege engines, long walls became
increasingly obsolete.
A Mycenaean wall on the Isthmus of Corinth has
been interpreted as an unfinished defensive wall.
This may be one of the earliest instances of such 
fortified walls. They were often constructed to
block passes during the Archaic and Classical peri-
ods. At various times from the 6th century BC,
isthmuses, such as those at Gallipoli, Methana and
Corinth, were blocked by walls and fortifications,
and the pass at Thermopylae was blocked by a wall
several times.
Forts and Towers
In the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC, Athens
built a series of frontier forts to secure communica-
tions and serve as a ﬁrst line of defense. Forts with a
garrison were called phrouria (sing. phrourion) and
could also act as a refuge for local inhabitants; forti-
ﬁed towns with garrisons were also sometimes called
phrouria. One purpose of frontier forts was to make
raids into enemy territory, and from 425 BC the
Athenians built forts on enemy coasts as secure bases
for raiding inland. In purely military forts, the garri-
son was housed in simple buildings, with each soldier
allotted a regulation bed space. Such barrack blocks
are known from Teke Kale in Turkey and Filla in
Euboea.
A large number of individual towers are known
from parts of mainland Greece and the Aegean
islands. Those on the islands have been interpreted
as part of a defense against slave raids by pirates, and
some at least were used as residences. Mainland tow-
ers often appear to have been used as signaling tow-
ers and watchtowers.
Hellenistic
The development of artillery and siege engines
could not easily be countered by modifications to
walls and towers of fortifications. Once an enemy
had reached the wall of a fort or town, it was only a
matter of time before it was breached. Improve-
ments to fortiﬁcations in the 4th and 3rd centuries
BC therefore concentrated on preventing the enemy
from reaching the walls. Walls were thickened, built
higher and provided with shuttered loopholes and
ports (instead of crenellations), through which
artillery could be fired. Towers were built higher
(often four or ﬁve ﬂoors), so that artillery ﬁred from
the towers would have a greater range. Towers had
pitched roofs instead of crenellations to provide bet-
ter protection from missiles, and sally ports allowed
the defenders to attack besiegers and drive them
back from the wall.
One or more large ditches were dug outside walls
to deter mining and to provide an obstacle for siege
engines. Outer ditches might have a palisade or
thorn hedge outside them, and the inner ditch could
be fronted by stone outworks, providing shelter for
artillery emplacements. Outside the fortifications
were various obstacles and traps, such as covered
holes and artificial marshes. Gateways were mas-
sively reinforced, often with a complex system of
outworks. The courtyard type of gateway was most
common; it was made by indenting the line of the
walls as they approached the gate, so that a courtyard
was formed outside the gate. A second outer gate was
sometimes built, creating a closed courtyard.
Temporary Camps
The Greeks never valued the fortiﬁcation of tempo-
rary camps as much as the Romans and usually did
not fortify a camp unless they expected to stay for at
least several weeks. No evidence for fortiﬁed camps
exists before the 5th century BC, but Homer’s Iliad
describes the beached Greek ships being protected by
a fortiﬁcation. This consisted of a wall of stones rein-
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
124

forced by wooden beams, outside of which was a wide
ditch; steep banks topped by palisades rose up on
either side of the ditch. It appears that the defenses of
a temporary camp depended on an assessment of the
risk. A camp might be hurriedly fortiﬁed to keep out
raiders, possibly with only a wall built with stones
found in the vicinity. In places where there were not
enough stones, mud bricks could be used, although
these would take time to dry. In either case the result
would be capable of refurbishment for many years,
more like a fort than a camp.
Thucydides mentions a number of 5th-century BC
Athenian camps. Two were described as “walled” and
others were “stockades.” One description of a stock-
ade shows that it consisted of a bank and ditch, with
stakes revetting the outer face of the bank. On top of
the bank, debris was piled, including stones, bricks
from demolished buildings, and vine stumps.
Wooden towers were built when necessary. Xeno-
phon reports that one regulation in Spartan armies
was that their camps should be circular in plan wher-
ever topography permitted, with the weapons stored
in the center. It seems that such camps were not for-
tified. The Spartans appear to have feared slave
revolts more than anything, and so their ﬁrst concern
was to keep their weapons safe. There does not
appear to have been a standard shape or plan for
camps built by other Greek armies. In general, tem-
porary camps and forts appear to have been built on
an ad hoc basis, making best use of the terrain and
available building materials. The result was usually a
ditch backed by some kind of rampart and palisade.
SIEGES
The strength, size and complexity of Mycenaean for-
tiﬁcations suggest that they could have been besieged
at times, although there is no evidence of siege war-
fare in this period. The siege warfare portrayed in
Homer’s Iliad is primitive. There appears to have
been no encircling fortiﬁcations around Troy and no
attempt to starve the city into surrender. Assaults
were made on the gates, but not the walls, which was
probably the main Greek tactic. Other legends
record the fall of Troy by use of the wooden horse
(ﬁg. 3.20), which was possibly a battering ram used to
demolish part of the wall.
The ﬁrst evidence for Greek siege tactics occurs
with the Spartans’ siege of Plataea (429–427 BC) dur-
ing the Peloponnesian War. They surrounded Plataea
with a stockade to prevent anyone getting in or out.
Against the wall they began to build an earth ramp
reinforced with timber. The Plataeans responded by
putting a screen on top of the wall, behind which they
built the wall higher. When the ramp reached the
wall, the Plataeans tunneled under the wall to try to
undermine the ramp. A crescent-shaped emergency
wall built behind the point being attacked by the
Spartans allowed them to maintain the circuit of the
town wall if it was breached. The Spartans brought
battering rams up the slope and tried to demolish the
wall, while the Plataeans lowered nooses in an
attempt to grip and haul up the rams. They also
dropped beams of wood suspended from chains to try
to break the rams. Finally the Spartans tried to set ﬁre

3.20 A modern, imaginative reconstruction at Troy of
the Trojan Horse, supposedly used in the siege

to the town, but a thunderstorm extinguished the ﬁre.
Having failed to take the town by force, the Spartans
reinforced the surrounding fortiﬁcation with ditches,
walls and a sentry walk with towers, and proceeded to
starve the town into surrender. Since most Plataeans
had escaped before the siege began, and others
escaped later, the remaining small garrison held out
for two years.
The siege of Plataea demonstrates the main prob-
lem of siege warfare: preventing supplies and rein-
forcements from reaching the besieged fortiﬁcation.
The success of subsequent sieges depended on the
ability of the attacker to seal off the besieged fortiﬁ-
cation. If this was not done properly, as in the Athen-
ian siege of Syracuse in 414–413 BC, there was a
good chance that the attackers would be defeated.
This situation changed with the development of
sophisticated and powerful artillery and siege
engines at the beginning of the 4th century BC.
In 379 BC Dionysius I (tyrant of Syracuse)
besieged Motya, a town on an island off Sicily’s coast.
Having previously offered large rewards for inven-
tions of new artillery and siege engines, he had the
most sophisticated siege weapons at his disposal.
Using a combination of artillery, battering rams and
siege towers, Dionysius broke into and captured the
town. Considering this success, it is surprising that
the new siege weapons did not immediately come
into common use. Not until the siege of Perinthus by
Philip II in 340 BC was extensive use made of such
engines. From then on the strength and power of the
attackers’ artillery and siege engines were often the
determining factors in the success of a siege.
Alexander the Great made use of siege engines,
most notably at the siege of Tyre (332 BC), but the use
of siege engines to break into fortiﬁcations reached its
peak after Alexander’s death. In the siege of Salamis
(306 BC), Demetrius I Poliorcetes (The Besieger)
took the city with the aid of a huge siege tower nick-
named helepolis (city-destroyer). In 305–304 BC
Demetrius earned his nickname attempting to take
Rhodes by siege. He used a massive array of siege
engines, including an even bigger version of the hele-
polis. Despite breaking down part of the curtain wall
and towers, Demetrius failed to take the city. Never
again were such massive siege engines used, although
artillery and smaller siege engines were now estab-
lished weapons. A well-fortiﬁed and well-equipped
city could resist attack, but few could afford the
expense. Nevertheless, besiegers sometimes had to
fall back on the tactic of surrounding and starving out
the defenders.
TROPHIES
Trophies (tropaia, sing. tropaion) were originally
intended as a religious image or dedication to the
theos tropaios (the god who caused the defeat). They
usually consisted of a suit of enemy armor set up on a
stake at the point on the battleﬁeld where the enemy
had been routed. Trophies were also dedicated at the
shrine of the deity who was thought to be responsible
for the defeat of the enemy (usually at Olympia or
Delphi). Several examples of such armor and weapons
have been found at these sites. Trophies were
depicted in artistic representations from the 6th cen-
tury BC. In the 4th century BC trophies became per-
manent monuments, usually in the form of buildings,
such as towers. The battle of Leuctra in 371 BC was
commemorated by a tower with a trophy of arms at
the top. Such trophies commemorated naval and land
battles and became an increasingly common motif in
art. By the time of Alexander the Great, captured
enemy shields with a dedicatory inscription were the
usual type of trophy dedicated at religious shrines. In
the Hellenistic period, kings and other rulers deco-
rated their buildings with sculptured trophies accom-
panied by statues representing the victors and their
captives. The defeated side in a battle was allowed to
retrieve their dead, who were usually cremated on the
battle site and their ashes taken home.
NAVIES
Function
Before the Classical period there is little evidence of
the way in which navies were used. Most warfare was
probably still conducted on land, and it is likely that
the earliest use of ships in warfare was to carry troops
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
126

on raids of coastal towns and of territory best
approached from the sea. Although no doubt used
primarily for transport, ships were probably equipped
for ﬁghting other ships. Although warships may have
been used for carrying troops in addition to their own
marines, they were increasingly adapted to ﬁghting
other ships. In the Hellenistic period the warships
were developed further to allow them to use artillery
and carry more marines. Navies played an extremely
important role in the history of Greece; without a
strong navy the formation of Athens’ overseas empire
would have been impossible.
Warships
The wood for building warships by and large had to
be imported. In Athens, for example, wood came
from Macedonia.
EARLY EXAMPLES
Before the Archaic period there is relatively little evi-
dence for ships of any kind and what does exist comes
mostly from artistic representations. It is usually
unclear whether the vessel portrayed is a warship or
not. It is likely that few, if any, specific warships
existed at this time and that all ships were used for
war when necessary. Two types of ship are shown in
Early Bronze Age representations. Both are powered
by oars (kopai) and have a mast with a single square
sail (ﬁg. 3.21). One type is approximately symmetri-
cal, with a gently rising bow and stern giving a curved
proﬁle to the bottom of the vessel. The other type has
a more steeply rising stern and a projecting forefoot
on the bow. It is thought that this projection is a
structural feature, probably a continuation of the keel
beyond the stempost, but it is also probably the fore-
runner of the ram, which is a common feature of later
warships. It is likely that these ships continued in use
to the end of the Mycenaean period or beyond, but
evidence that might show their development during
this period is not available.
PENTEKONTERS
Good information about warships becomes available
only in the Archaic period. Although Homer describes
events some centuries earlier, the ships that he
describes are 8th-century BC types and cannot be
taken as reliable descriptions of earlier vessels. Two
types of ship are mentioned by Homer: light, fast
ships powered by 20 oars, and heavier warships pow-
ered by 50 oars. These 50-oared galleys, known as
pentekonters (literally, ﬁfties; pentekontoroi, sing. pen-
tekontoros), had oars on one level only. They appear to
have been carvel built, mainly from pine wood, with
oars of polished spruce. The stern was curved, with
the end curving back over the ship like a scorpion’s
tail, while the bow terminated in a nearly vertical prow
with a metal-sheathed ram at the waterline.
Pentekonters had a mast with a square sail that
was taken down before going into battle, or perhaps
even left ashore before a battle to lighten the ship,
making it faster and more maneuverable. The ship
was steered by two large paddles or steering oars
lashed to the stern, and there was a stone anchor.
BIREMES
At the end of the 8th century BC the bireme was
invented (ﬁg. 3.22). This was a galley with two banks
of oars on each side, one above the other. The
bireme was developed by the Phoenicians or possibly
by the Ionian Greeks, and was later generally
adopted by the Greeks. Evidence about biremes is
relatively scarce, and so it is not clear exactly how the
banks of rowers were arranged, but the bireme seems
to have been developed to provide a more powerful

3.21 Two types of possible Bronze Age warships depicted

and several oars, c. 1800 BC; b) steeply rising stern 
and projecting forefoot on the bow, with a single mast, 
c. 2000 BC

vessel. Using two banks of oars meant that the vessel
could be shorter and more maneuverable, but still
have the same power as a pentekonter.
TRIREMES
In the 6th century BC, a third bank of oars was added
to the bireme to produce the trireme (trieres, pl. tri-
ereis, “three-ﬁtted”), and by the end of the 6th cen-
tury BC this was the most common warship in the
Mediterranean (ﬁgs. 3.22, 3.23). There is still contro-
versy over whether the triremes actually had three
banks of rowers on each side, and alternative expla-
nations have been given for its name. The warship
could have had two banks of oars on each side, but
three banks of rowers, with one bank being central to
the ship and pulling two oars instead of one. While
this scheme ﬁts some surviving evidence, it does not
explain it all, particularly the depictions of ships with
three banks of oars along each side. Sea trials of a
reconstruction of a trireme with three banks of oars
and three banks of rowers (one to each oar) on each
side have shown that such a ship is perfectly feasible,
and it is now usually accepted that this is how Greek
triremes were powered.
The Athenian navy was based at Piraeus, with
over 370 ship sheds in its three harbors. Excavations
of ship sheds at Piraeus harbor have provided maxi-
mum dimensions of 121.5 ft (37 m) long and 9.9 ft (3
m) wide at the bottom for the triremes based there.
Athenian naval records show that oars were 13.2–14.7
ft (4–4.5 m) long. There were three types of oars:
thranite, zygian and thalamian. The lowest level of
rowers were the thalamites (thalamitai). There were
27 thalamites on each side, and they worked their
oars through ports close to the waterline. The sec-
ond level of rowers were the zygites (zygitai), of
which there were also 27 on each side. The top level
of rowers were the thranites (thranitai). There were
31 thranites on each side, and they rowed through an
outrigger, which was an extension from the side of
the ship that provided greater leverage for the oars.
The trireme was steered by a pair of steering oars
at the stern, and it had a pair of anchors at the bow.
Triremes were carvel built, with a stern and prow of
similar shape to those of pentekonters. They had a
bronze-plated ram projecting from the bow at the
waterline. Earlier triremes apparently had no deck or
were only partially decked. Later they were decked
right across to accommodate more armed men.
Triremes still had a mast and sail like earlier ships, but
before battle these were left ashore to lighten the
load; the battle speed of a trireme depended only on
the rowers. Because there was little room for supplies
on board these ships, they were usually beached each
night in order to obtain food and water.
LATER EXAMPLES
The trireme was the main Greek warship at least
until the 4th century BC. At the beginning of that
century several new galleys were introduced, includ-
ing the four, ﬁve, six and one-and-a-halfer (hemidia).
Their names, such as tetereis (fours, sing. teteres) and
pentereis (ﬁves, sing. penteres), presumably relate to
the number and arrangement of oars and rowers.
These can be explained relatively easily, but by the
mid-4th century BC there were apparently “sixes,”

with numbers rising progressively to 13. Alexander
the Great is believed to have invented a seven and a
10. By the Hellenistic period in the 3rd century BC,
there was a “sixteen,” and by the end of that century
there was a “forty” (tessarakonteres), a showpiece gal-
ley built by Ptolemy IV. Little evidence survives
about these ships, and their names have proved difﬁ-
cult to interpret.
During this period ships were increasingly
designed as platforms for artillery, so the sides were
enclosed and they had a complete deck. Probably to
cope with the extra weight, ships began to be
designed with extra rowing capacity. The tetereis
(fours) probably had only two banks of oars, with
two men to each oar. The term “four” probably
referred to the number of men rowing each vertical
group of oars (two oars, with two men at each oar).
If this was the way that the names of the various gal-
leys were derived, it can account easily for the lower
numbers.
Ships of this type were depicted with up to three
banks of oars, so that they were really just larger ver-
sions of the bireme and trireme with more than one
rower per oar. From galleys used in the 17th and 18th
centuries AD, it is known that the maximum number
of men that can operate a single oar efficiently is
eight, and so the largest efﬁcient Greek vessel would
have had three banks of oars with eight men per oar (a
“twenty-four”). In fact a “sixteen” is one of the large
galleys most frequently mentioned. This could have
had two banks of oars on each side, with each oar
operated by eight men. However, this theory still
leaves the problem of the “forty” without a satisfac-
tory explanation.

ANCHORS
The earliest anchors were anchor-stones with a hole
through which a rope could be passed. Some stone
anchors had extra holes for the insertion of sharpened
stakes that would dig into the seabed, giving a more
secure anchorage. These were superseded from c. 600
BC by the standard hook anchor (agkura, hook),
although stone anchors continued in use until the
Hellenistic period. Like some modern anchors, the
hook anchor had a stock, shank and two arms (ﬂukes).
The stock fell to the bottom, causing one arm to dig
in, holding the anchor cable at the correct angle.
These anchors were of wood, with stocks of stone or
lead. This type of anchor is sometimes called the
“Admiralty type,” although strictly the stock is remov-
able on a true Admiralty-type anchor. Whenever pos-
sible, warships were beached at night, stern ﬁrst, and
propped upright with stones and lengths of wood.
Crews
EARLY WARSHIPS
Little is known about crews of early warships. Refer-
ences in the works of Homer imply that there was
usually no distinction between the men who rowed
and those who fought. Warships were also troop-
ships. Homer mentions ships of 50 oars, probably
referring to the pentekonters that were used in his
own day, rather than warships that were used against
Troy. The pentekonter had 50 rowers, as well as a
helmsman, a captain, a time-beater to maintain the
rowing rhythm, and probably four or ﬁve deck crew
to handle the sail and anchor and do other tasks. It is
not clear how biremes were manned; at least some
appear to have had 28 oars per side, a total of 56 row-
ers. The number of rowers may have been the only
signiﬁcant difference between the crews of the pen-
tekonter and the bireme. Both these warships also
carried a number of soldiers to act as marines.
TRIREMES
At the battle of Salamis in 480 BC, when the Greeks
defeated the Persians, the Greek triremes appear to
have had a crew of 200. These consisted of 170 row-
ers (62 thranites on the upper banks of oars, 54
zygites on the middle banks and 54 thalamites on the
lower banks), as well as 10 hoplites and four archers.
Rowers were not slaves, but highly trained recruits
from the poorer classes. In Athens rowers were usu-
ally thetes, the poorest class of free men. There was
also a ﬂute player (trieraules), who kept time for the
rowers, possibly up to 15 deck hands who controlled
the ship when under sail, and up to 40 marines, usu-
ally a mixture of hoplites and archers. For larger gal-
leys, such as the tetereis and pentereis, there is little
evidence for the size and composition of their crews.
Triremes were usually commanded by a captain (tri-
erarch: trierarkhos).
OFFICERS
Some indications of how a navy was commanded sur-
vive from Athens. Originally each of the local divi-
sions of Attica (the naukrariai) was responsible for
supplying and manning one ship, which was com-
manded by a naukraros. The naukrariai later became
local administrative units, and their naval responsibil-
ities were taken over by the boule and the trierarchs
in the early 5th century BC.
Trierarchs were chosen from the wealthier citizens
by the strategoi. The ofﬁce of trierarch was a compul-
sory civic duty that entailed ﬁnancial commitments (a
liturgy). There was one trierarch for each of the
triremes in service. Each trierarch served for one year
and was provided with a trireme, as well as the pay and
food of the crew. The trierarch served as captain and
bore the cost of maintenance and repair. After 411 BC
two citizens usually shared the cost of the ofﬁce of tri-
erarch, and after 340 BC the cost was spread more
equally. The liturgy requiring chosen citizens to
become trierarchs was abolished around 317–307 BC.
In other Greek states the term trierarch merely meant
a captain of a trireme, and in Hellenistic times it was
the name for the captain of any warship.
Tactics
The need for warships to frequently put into shore
(usually every night) to take on water and supplies
restricted the possibilities for an elaborate and pro-
longed strategy. The two main methods of attacking
a ship, ramming and boarding, determined naval tac-
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
130

tics. For example, the Athenian fleet carried rela-
tively few marines, and the emphasis was on ram-
ming rather than boarding. Tactics were generally
simple, and the outcome of a battle depended on the
success of individual ships.
For ramming, a ship would try to hit an enemy
ship at a vulnerable point along the side and then pull
away in order to get up sufﬁcient speed to ram again.
If the attacking ship could not pull away, marines
from both ships would try to board the other and take
it over in hand-to-hand fighting. For attempts at
boarding, many methods of locking the two ships
together were used, such as grappling hooks and
ropes. As ships approached each other, missiles such
as arrows and javelins were discharged.
Tactical maneuvers were developed to maximize
the chances of ramming, while other maneuvers
attempted to foil such tactics. The periplus ( periploos;
literally, sailing around) was the simplest form of
maneuver and was carried out by a ﬂeet that outnum-
bered its opponent. Its superior numbers were used to
outﬂank the line of enemy ships. Most of the ﬂeet
retreated, keeping their rams facing the enemy ships.
Meanwhile their ﬂanking ships rammed the side of the
outermost ship in the enemy line, leaving the next ship
exposed to similar attack. Once this ﬂanking maneuver
had been carried out, the entire ﬂeet would attack.
Another tactic was the diekplus (diekploos), which
was used by a ﬂeet of more maneuverable ships to
break up a formation of enemy ships. This maneuver
started with the attacking ships approaching the
enemy line one after the other, in line-ahead forma-
tion. The leading ship would make a sharp turn into
one of the enemy ships, shearing off its oars on one
side and leaving it stranded for the next ship in the line
to ﬁnish off. This maneuver could be forestalled if the
formation under attack consisted of two lines of ships,
one behind the other, so that the ships in the second
line could deal with the attacking ships once they had
lost their speed. However, dividing a ﬂeet into two
lines meant that it was vulnerable to the periplus.
The kyklos (circle) was a defensive formation
adopted by slow or outnumbered ﬂeets when attacked.
The ships formed up in a circle with their rams point-
ing outward, making it very difﬁcult for an attacking
ﬂeet to gain any advantage.
With the development of larger galleys with artil-
lery mounted on their decks, there was more use of
missiles in an attempt to cause casualties and drive
the opposing marines off the deck before boarding.
However, ramming and boarding were still the prin-
cipal methods of ﬁghting, and tactics remained much
the same.
Harbors
Early warships were usually beached when not in
use, but during the 6th century BC enclosed harbors
began to be developed. A harbor at Samos was
enclosed by a mole about 1,310 ft (400 m) long,
which was built out into water about 100 ft (30 m)
deep. At this time Athens beached its ships in the
open bay between Piraeus and Phalerum, but in the
5th century BC Themistocles instigated their move
to Piraeus. On the north side of Piraeus was a large
inlet, which became the commercial harbor; two
small inlets on the south side of Piraeus became the
military harbors of Zea and Munychia (Map 6). This
whole area was surrounded by walls constructed of
heavy limestone blocks, and the harbor entrances
were narrowed by the construction of moles so that
they could be closed with chains. The Zea harbor
entrance was reduced to 114 ft (35 m). The moles at
the harbor entrances had towers built on their sea-
ward ends.
Within the military harbors at Piraeus were ship
sheds, built in groups of four or eight. Each pair of
sheds was covered by a single roof, and the sheds
themselves were just less than 20 ft (6 m) wide and
about 131 ft (40 m) long. The sheds were separated
by rows of columns and sloped down to the water,
with slipways projecting into the harbor so that the
warships could be dragged up into the sheds, proba-
bly stern first. In the 4th century BC there were
almost 400 ship sheds at Piraeus. The main military
harbor was at Zea, where the naval stores were kept.
Fortifications known as the Long Walls were
built joining Piraeus with Athens in an attempt to
prevent hostile armies from cutting off Athens from
the harbors during a siege. From this time on, many
other coastal and island cities built harbors protected
by moles with towers at the end. This was not always,
as at Athens, because of the need to protect warships,
but often because of the growing importance of
trade, particularly in foodstuffs like grain.

GEOGRAPHY OF 
THE GREEK WORLD
4

LANDSCAPE
Greece is formed of limestone mountains, dividing
up the country into large fertile plains in Thessaly,
Boeotia and Attica, with some smaller plains else-
where. The plains are almost entirely surrounded by
mountains or have one side accessible to the sea. The
mountains comprise the majority of the territory and
often formed barriers with few passes and narrow
valleys, so that transport by land was difﬁcult. This
type of landscape encouraged the development of
independent states. The highest mountain is Olym-
pus in Thessaly (9,750 ft, 2,972 m), and the moun-
tains once had much deciduous and evergreen forest,
although the amount of forest and deforestation and
loss of fertility are disputed. It is believed that by
Classical times, much deforestation had already
occurred, so that the landscape was similar today,
although without the modern development and with
much more marshland.
The coastline is deeply indented, and in the
Aegean the submerged mountains form numerous
islands. To the south of the Aegean is the large island
of Crete. In the center of the Aegean are numerous
small islands known collectively as the Cyclades, and
off the west coast of Asia Minor are several larger
islands, such as Lesbos and Rhodes. There are over
3,000 islands.
In mainland Greece there were no navigable
rivers. The rivers were often torrents in winter but
dry in summer. There were many good harbors and
anchorages, though few in Thessaly or on the west
coast. The coastline in many areas has suffered con-
siderable change since antiquity for a variety of rea-
sons, such as tectonic activity, silting of rivers and
artiﬁcial drainage of wetlands (ﬁg. 4.1). Where possi-
ble, the original coastline is depicted on the maps in
Talbert (ed.) 2000a. Harbors like Pella are now well

inland. Sea levels have also risen since ancient Greek
times, possibly by as much as 2–3 meters (6–9 feet).
Mainland Greece is virtually split into two parts
by the Saronic Gulf and Corinthian Gulf, which are
separated by a narrow isthmus (now cut by the
Corinth canal). The southern mainland is the Pelo-
ponnese (island of Pelops). To the north of the isth-
mus is central Greece and northern Greece. Central
Greece is a long peninsula between the Corinthian
Gulf and the straits of Euboea (Map 10).
Hellas was originally a small district of Phthiotis
in Thessaly (and the people were Hellenes), but the
name was extended to the rest of Greece. The names
“Achaea” and “Argos” were also used for Greece or
just for the Peloponnese. The Greek people were
called Hellenes (and at times Achaeans, Argives or
Danai). The Romans called Greece Graecia.
The climate of winters is severe in the mountains,
but mild elsewhere, and in the hot summers there is
very little rain. Most rain falls during ﬁve months in
winter (the growing season), with the greatest
amount of rainfall in western Greece. The country is
prone to earthquakes, especially in the Peloponnese,
some of which have been devastating, as at Sparta in
c. 464 BC and at Helice on the northern coast of the
Peloponnese in 373 BC, which disappeared into the
sea. An active volcano exists at the island of Thera.
Colonization and expansion of territory by con-
quest extended the Greek world westward into
Spain, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, southern France and
Magna Graecia (Great Greece: southern Italy). Else-
where the Greek world eventually extended into
northern Africa (Cyrene), Egypt, around the Black
Sea, Asia Minor, Cyprus and as far east as India and
Afghanistan (Maps 7, 8). Greek sailors feared passing
through the Straits of Gibraltar into the Atlantic.
Ancient Greece was characterized by isolated
farms, hamlets, villages, small towns and cities.

CITY-STATES AND
COLONIES
POLEIS
In the Bronze Age during the Minoan and Myce-
naean periods, settlement consisted of villas, towns
and palaces (see chapters 1 and 6). The palaces may
have been administrative centers of specific geo-
graphical regions, rather than royal residences. From
c. 1200 BC there was widespread abandonment of
many settlement sites, but at the end of the Dark Age
self-governing states called poleis (sing. polis, city)
emerged, some of which were very small. The Greek
world was eventually divided into several hundred
poleis. These city-states or self-governing communi-
ties consisted of only one city (also called a polis) with
a citadel (acropolis) and marketplace (agora), sur-
rounded by the countryside (chora) and its villages
(hinterland). The term asty also referred to the city or
town itself. The citizens lived in the countryside or in
the city, but the government of the polis was concen-
trated in the city. The large number of poleis led to
numerous conﬂicts between them, as well as civil war
(stasis), particularly where there was a struggle con-
cerning the type of government (oligarchy or democ-
racy). Some poleis were very large, such as Sparta,
while some islands were divided into several poleis.
FEDERATIONS AND ALLIANCES
The Greek mainland was divided into a number of
regions, often distinct geographical entities. Tribal
units, such as Aetolians and Boeotians, occupied

these regions. When poleis began to develop, the
tribal units in these regions were frequently retained.
Cities within these regions often formed a loose or
more formal confederation. City-states in alliance
with each other were usually termed federal states,
confederacies or leagues. These alliances first
appeared in the 5th century BC. Alternatively one
city-state, such as Athens, became more powerful
than other city-states in the region.
A symmachia (symmakhia, alliance in ﬁghting) was
often an informal alliance of city-states in war or for
defense; it could also mean an alliance of city-states
under the leadership (hegemonia) of one state. They
were not federal states, and member city-states
retained their individual freedom. Examples include
the Peloponnesian League, Delian League, Second
Athenian League and Hellenic League, some of which
are also referred to as confederacies or alliances.
A sympoliteia (alliance in political life) was a true
federal state in which city-states gave up some of
their independence to a central federal government,
so that power was divided between central and local
governments. Citizens therefore often considered
themselves as belonging to both a city-state and a
federal state. Examples of sympoliteiai include the
Achaean Confederacy, Arcadian Confederacy,
Boeotian Confederacy and Aetolian Confederacy,
although they are often referred to loosely as leagues.
The term koinon (the state or commonwealth) is also
used for a federal state, as is ethnos (pl. ethne, “tribe”).
From c. 300 BC, federal states of Greece were classi-
ﬁed as ethne.
Many federal states were dissolved at the King’s
Peace (386 BC). Particularly from the 3rd century BC,
some federal states, such as the Achaean Confeder-
acy, became so powerful that they incorporated cities
and states from beyond their own regional bound-
aries. After the conquests of Alexander the Great in
the late 4th century BC, the poleis lost much of their
independence. Federal states were particularly
numerous and powerful in the Hellenistic period,
and continued in the Roman period in Asia Minor
and Greece as forms of local government. See also
chapter l for the government of poleis and chapter 6
for towns and town planning.
The Amphictyonic Council (or Delphic Amphic-
tyony) managed the affairs of the Delphi sanctuary. It
consisted mostly of states in the central and northern
part of Greece, and its name derived from amphicty-
ones (dwellers round about). Its original function had
been the care of the temple of Demeter at Anthela
near Thermopylae, but it acquired the care of the
oracle and temple of Apollo at Delphi (fig. 8.33).
Each member state sent one or two sacred represen-
tatives (hieromnemones) to the council meetings,
which were held twice a year.
COLONIES
Colonization was the establishment of new settle-
ments overseas by city-states of the Greek mainland,
Aegean islands and Asia Minor. It was usually under-
taken when an area could no longer support all its
inhabitants (land hunger) or less frequently for rea-
sons of trade, although the reasons for a particular
colonization are rarely clear. The main period of
colonization was c. 750–c. 550 BC (Map 9), although
Athens undertook no colonization, as the plains of
Attica could support its people, while Sparta founded
only one colony as it was supported by its helots and
perioeci. Colonization was undertaken by sea and
occurred in areas where the native people were polit-
ically weak and could offer little resistance. Some
colonies established friendly relations with the native
people and even had a mixed population of Greeks
and native people, although elsewhere there was
conﬂict. More politically advanced areas, such as the
Syrian coast, Egypt and central Italy, were excluded.
Colonization was mainly coastal and on islands, very
rarely in the hinterland.
Colonization took place by appointing a founder
(oikistes, oecist) from the mother city (metropolis), who
consulted an oracle, usually Delphi or Didyma. The
oecist then led a small group to a new site to found
the colony (apoika, settlement or home far away from
home), taking with him the sacred fire from the
hearth of the mother city. Additional settlers from
the mother city would often arrive later. Soldiers
were included among the colonists if opposition
from the native inhabitants was anticipated. There
were often joint colonization ventures with other
cities. The new colony was usually formed as a polis,
independent of the mother city, but with certain ties,
such as shared religious cults and political institutions.
The colonists did not have the automatic right to
return to their mother city and lost their citizenship.

These new colonies could themselves found
colonies, although the founder was usually appointed
from the original mother city. Founders received
heroic cults after their death.
The earliest colonization was undertaken by the
Euboean cities of Chalcis and Eretria, followed by
Corinth. Other main colonizing states were Miletus,
Achaea, Megara and some Aegean islands. The ﬁrst
areas to be settled were Sicily and southern Italy (ﬁg.
4.2), with other colonies around the Black Sea, Asia
Minor, northwest Aegean, northern Greece and
Illyria. Colonies numbered several hundred,
although details such as foundation dates are not
usually precisely known. In Sicily colonies were set-
tled from many parts of Greece, including Chalcis,
Corinth, Megara, Rhodes and Crete; Naxus was its
earliest colony, founded by Chalcis in 734 BC, with
Syracuse founded by Corinth in 733 BC. Corcyra was
also colonized by Corinth in 733 BC. In Italy several
colonies were founded by the Achaeans, including
Sybaris and Croton; Tarentum (Taras) in Italy was
the only colony of Sparta, founded c. 706 BC, largely
by Partheniai, who were the sons of unmarried
mothers. Phocaea founded Massilia in southern
France c. 600 BC, which in turn established trading
settlements in northeast Spain. Chalcis and Eretria
founded several colonies in the 7th century BC in the
promontory subsequently known as Chalcidice.
Numerous colonies were founded around the shores
of the Propontis and Black Sea, mainly by Miletus.
Megara founded Byzantium (c. 667 BC) and Chal-
cedon (685 BC). Cyrene was founded by Thera c. 630
BC following a famine.
TRADING POSTS
Some settlements were established speciﬁcally as trad-
ing posts (emporia, sing. emporion), not as poleis. Some
colonies were also established on trade routes, which
encouraged the expansion of trade and piracy. Trading
posts included Al Mina in northern Syria, Naucratis in
Egypt, Emporiae in Spain and Massilia in southern
France. At Naucratis, land was presented to the
Greeks as a trading center (not a colony) by the
Egyptian pharaoh; numerous Greek states, particu-
larly from Asia Minor, were involved in the settlement.

CLERUCHIES
A particular sort of colony (kleroukhia) was estab-
lished by Athens from the end of the 6th century BC
and through the 5th century BC in conquered Greek
and non-Greek territory. The main period of estab-
lishing cleruchies was during the Athenian Empire in
450–446 BC, when Athenian settlements were
imposed in allied territory. This policy of Pericles
was bitterly resented by many allies, particularly in
the islands, because local inhabitants were often dis-
possessed. Cleruchies were often established after
the revolt of an ally. The cleruchs came from Athens’
two lowest citizen classes. Each cleruch was given a
piece of land (kleros), which raised them to hoplite
status and made them eligible for military service.
The cleruchs retained their original citizenship, and
the settlements were not politically independent.
Places where cleruchies were established (some on
existing settlements) include Chalcis (506 BC), the
Chersonese, Chalcidice, Naxos, Andros, Lemnos
and Lesbos. It is not always certain if a settlement
was a colony or a cleruchy.
HELLENISTIC
From the time of conquest by Alexander, colonies of
Greek settlers were established in Egypt and
throughout the eastern territories of Asia. Alexander
the Great founded many cities, named after himself,
and the Seleucid kings (especially Antiochus I) also
founded many new cities or refounded existing ones
with Greek names, such as Antiokheia and Seleukeia.
Alexandria in Egypt was founded partly for trade, but
other colonies in Egypt were cleruchies founded for
military reasons. In Asia many new cities also began
as strategic military colonies, but developed into
poleis, with Greek civilians and foreign settlers as
well. Many eastern cities survived, even when they
came under Parthian and Roman rule.
REGIONS AND
ALLIANCES
For historical events and alliances, see chapter 1.
Acarnania
This region in the northwest coastal area of Greece
is bounded by the Ionian Sea, the Gulf of Ambracia
and the Achelous River (Map 10). Coastal sites were
colonized by settlers from Corinth in the 7th century
BC. In the 5th century BC the Acarnanians formed a
league, with its capital at Stratus. In 432/431 BC, it
sought help from Athens against Corinthian settlers
at Ambracia and other colonies, and again in 429/426
BC against Sparta during the Peloponnesian War. In
390 BC Acarnania was conquered by Sparta under
Agesilaus II, but in 375 BC it joined the Second
Athenian League. It supported Boeotia against
Sparta, and then Athens against Philip II of Macedo-
nia. However, Acarnania came under the control of
Macedonia. In 314 BC the Acarnanian League was
4.2 The colony of Heraclea in southern Italy was named
after Heracles, who was an important ﬁgure there. The
reverse of this silver didrachm of c. 350 BC from Heraclea
shows Heracles in combat with the Nemean lion, with his
club to one side and an owl below. The obverse shows the
head of Athena (ﬁg. 5.8).

replaced by a confederacy of newly founded cities.
Around 255 BC Acarnania was split between Epirus
and Aetolia, but at the downfall of the monarchy in
Epirus, Acarnania regained its independence and
acquired the island of Leucas. The Acarnanians sided
with Philip V of Macedonia against Rome in 200 BC.

Map 10 Major states and islands of Greece

Arcarnania lost Leucas in 167 BC, but was allowed by
the Romans to retain its confederacy of city-states
until 30 BC.
Achaea
The name Achaea (Akhaia) is derived from Akhaioi
(Greeks), which occurs in Homer and also in Hittite
and Egyptian texts of c. 1400–1200 BC. Greeks of the
Mycenaean period are sometimes described as
Achaeans by modern scholars. Two geographical
areas were known as Achaea. The minor one was in
southeast Thessaly (Achaea Phthiotis). The main
territory of Achaea was in the Peloponnese along the
coast of the Corinthian Gulf between Elis and
Sicyon (Map 10).
In the 8th century BC, this main territory of
Achaea founded colonies in southern Italy, including
Sybaris, Metapontum, Croton and Caulonia. Twelve
small towns in Achaea, including Patrae, Aegium,
Dyme, Cerynia and Leontium, were said to form a
federal state that met at Helice (the sanctuary of
Poseidon Heliconius), until Helice collapsed into the
sea after an earthquake in 373 BC. The confederacy
then met at Aegium. Achaea remained neutral in
most Greek wars, including the Persian and Pelo-
ponnesian Wars. As an ally of Sparta the confederacy
was not dissolved at the King’s Peace (386 BC). A new
confederacy was founded in 280 BC by four cities,
joined later by other Achaean and non-Achaean
cities, including Sicyon in 251 BC (after the expulsion
of its tyrant). In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC the
Achaean Confederacy became the most important
power in Greece, encompassing much of the Pelo-
ponnese and part of central Greece. Aratus of Sicyon
was a powerful leader of the Confederacy, with
Corinth as its main stronghold, initially against
Macedonia. The admission of Arcadian cities, such as
Megalopolis, led to conflict with Sparta, and the
Confederacy became an ally of Macedonia against
Sparta in 224 BC.
The Confederacy came into conﬂict with Rome,
and after the battle of Pydna (167 BC), the Romans
deported 1,000 eminent Achaeans to Italy, including
the historian Polybius. They were released in 150 BC.
In 148 BC further trouble again caused the Romans to
intervene; after the Achaean War, the Confederacy
was dissolved in 146 BC, with the Romans attaching
Achaea to the Roman province of Macedonia. In 27
BC the name Achaea was used for a new Roman
province, which comprised a large area of Greece.
Aenis
Aenis (Ainis) was a small region south of Thessaly
(Map 10), one of the original members of the Amph-
ictyony centered at Anthela near Thermopylae and
later at Delphi.
Aeolis
The northern part of the west coast of Asia Minor was
known as Aeolis (Aiolis); it stretched from the Helles-
pont southward to Smyrna, and included the island of
Lesbos (Map 11). The speech of the country resem-
bled that of Boeotia and Thessaly, from where the ﬁrst
settlers probably came in the 11th century BC. The
Aeolian cities in the south were grouped in a league,
possibly for religious purposes. Originally 12 in num-
ber, they were later reduced to 11 when Smyrna
became an Ionian city. Cyme was the principal city.
Aetolia
This region of central Greece (Map 10) was bor-
dered on the west by Acarnania, on the north by
Epirus and on the south by the Corinthian Gulf. A
marshy coast without good harborage left Aetolia
secluded, and it was still undeveloped in the 5th cen-
tury BC, organized not in city-states but primarily in
tribes under chieftains in remote unfortiﬁed villages.
A federal state (sympoliteia) was formed by 376 BC
(Aetolian Confederacy or League), which replaced
the tribal system. In the late 4th century BC (after
the death of Alexander the Great), this Confederacy
became very powerful and extended its territory. By
220 BC it controlled all of central Greece (except
Attica), including Delphi. It was a rival of Macedonia
and became Rome’s ﬁrst ally in Greece, supporting
Rome against Philip V of Macedonia in the Second
Macedonian War (200–197 BC). However, Aetolia
subsequently supported Antiochus III against Rome,
G E O G R A P H Y
O F
T H E G R E E K W O R L D
143

and after his defeat by the Romans in 189 BC, the
Aetolians were forced by Rome to accept a treaty.
Although it was not dissolved, the Confederacy lost
all its power. Its main towns were Calydon and Pleu-
ron, with a religious center at Thermum, where
Apollo was worshipped.
Arachosia
Situated in southern Afghanistan, Arachosia
(Arakhosia) was formerly an eastern satrapy of the
Persian Empire on a main route from Persia to India
(Map 8). Alexander the Great invaded it after defeat-
ing Darius at Gaugamela (331 BC). He subsequently
gave Arachosia as part of a huge province to Sibyr-
tius, a Macedonian supporter. When that king died
the territory passed to Seleucus I Nicator, although
he probably ceded the eastern part in 301 BC to San-
dracottus in return for war elephants. In the mid-3rd
century BC, western Arachosia was split between the
Greek kingdom of Bactria and the Parthian Empire.
Arcadia
A very mountainous and inaccessible region in the
center of the Peloponnese (Map 10). The archaic
dialect of Arcadia (Arkhadia) was closest to that of
Cyprus, probably indicating that the area was unaf-
fected by the Dorian invasions. The language is
known only from inscriptions and probably preserves
elements of the Mycenaean language. The most
prosperous areas were the eastern plains of Orcho-
menus, Mantinea and Tegea and also the valley of
the Alpheus River. Its main rivers were the Alpheus,
Stymphalus and Styx. Arcadia’s most important
towns were Tegea, Mantinea, Megalopolis and
Orchomenus. The region was mainly one of villages,
so it had little inﬂuence on Greek politics. Its main
strength was its manpower, and Arcadian mercenar-
ies were used from at least the 5th century BC.
From that time Arcadia came under Sparta’s con-
trol, but an Arcadian Confederacy was formed under
Epaminondas against Sparta between 370 and 362
BC. Epaminondas founded the city of Megalopolis as
the Confederacy’s center, and 40 villages were com-
pletely or partially abandoned. It became one of the
largest cities in the Peloponnese. In 235 BC, Arcadia
joined the Achaean Confederacy. Polybius the histo-
rian, a citizen of Megalopolis, was taken by the
Romans as one of the 1,000 Achaean hostages after
the battle of Pydna. Arcadia became part of the
Roman province of Macedonia, and later part of the
province of Achaea. The Roman poet Virgil ideal-
ized Arcadia’s pastoral life by setting his bucolic
poetry in the region. The notion of “arcadian” as a
simple, bucolic lifestyle was not a Greek concept.
Argolis
Argos was a city in the northeast Peloponnese about
3 miles (4.8 km) from the sea; it was in the southern
part of the Argive plain at the foot of the Larissa Hill.
The name Argos also describes the territory of the
city, itself also referred to as Argolis or the Argolid
(Map 10), about 540 sq mi (1,400 sq km) in area; its
inhabitants were Argives. In Homer, “Argos” usually
refers to the entire Peloponnese (with Hellas mean-
ing all of northern and central Greece), and the word
“Argives” frequently means “Greeks.”
Argos was the leading power in the Peloponnese
until challenged by Sparta in the 8th or 7th century
BC. Sparta was defeated by Argos at the battle of
Hysiae (669 BC), but the power of Argos soon waned.
The city-state played a secondary and ineffective role
in Greek politics, occasionally ﬁghting with Sparta,
but otherwise maintaining an apparent neutrality. In
461 BC Argos became allied with Athens against
Sparta, and again in 420 and 395 BC. It sided with
Philip II of Macedonia and was one of the last cities
to join the Achaean Confederacy. The territory of
Argos included Mycenae, Tiryns, Nauplia and Asine.
Its most important religious center was 6 miles (10
km) north of the city of Argos, where the goddess
Hera was worshipped at the Heraeum.
Aria
This mountainous territory of northeast Persia (Map
8), now western Afghanistan and eastern Iran, was
bordered by Parthia, Margiana, Bactria and Dran-
giana. Alexander the Great subdued the land in 330
BC and appointed a Persian satrap in charge. From

316 BC Aria formed part of the Seleucid Empire, but
came under Parthian control from c. 247 BC.
Armenia
A mountainous region to the northeast of Asia Minor
(Map 8), Armenia’s inhabitants came under Median
and then Persian control (forming a satrapy). Its
boundaries, which extended either side of the
Euphrates River, were subject to change, and there
were numerous subdivisions. It formed part of the
Empire of Alexander the Great from 331 BC and then
the Seleucid Empire from 301 BC, when it was ruled
by local governors. After Antiochus III was defeated
by the Romans at the battle of Magnesia (189 BC),
Armenia Major (the plateau region to the east of the
Euphrates as far as the Caspian Sea) revolted and
declared independence under King Artaxias. Armenia
Minor was a small kingdom to the west (Map 11),
forming part of Asia Minor. Tigranes I of Armenia
Major was an ally of Mithridates VI of Pontus against
Rome in 69 BC. Tigranes surrendered, and Armenia
became a protectorate kingdom of Rome.
Attica
The easternmost part of central Greece, Attica
formed a triangular promontory of about 1,000 sq mi
(2,500 sq km) in area (Map 10), bounded on two
sides by the sea for over 105 miles (170 km) and on
the other side by mountainous terrain. Its original
name was possibly Acte (promontory). It is an arid
and hilly region, divided by four mountain ranges
(Aegaleos, Hymettus, Pentelicus and Laurium) into
three interconnecting plains (Thriasian, Attic or
Athenian, and Mesogeia). The Attic Plain was often
called the Plain (Pedion). The area’s natural resources
included its famous marbles (from Pentelicus and
Hymettus), good-quality potters’ clay, and lead and
silver from Laurium. Laurium (Laurion) was a hilly
district near Cape Sunium. It formed one of the
largest mining districts in the Greek world, particu-
larly for silver from the ore galena.
There were originally many separate independent
communities (by tradition 12 in the time of the leg-
endary king Cecrops), which had probably united
into a single state by the 7th century BC (although
tradition attributed this process to Theseus). Athens

Map 11 Regions of Asia Minor before the rise of the Pergamum kingdom

became the main city, both in terms of politics and
religion. Other cities included Eleusis, Marathon,
Aphidna and Thoricus, whose inhabitants were full
Athenian citizens, if eligible. Aristocratic families
remained inﬂuential and independent in the coun-
tryside, but their power was broken by the tyranny of
Peisistratus (early 6th century BC) and by the reforms
of Cleisthenes (late 6th century BC), which central-
ized the entire Attic government at Athens. In the
Peloponnesian War, Attica was invaded annually by
the Spartans, and the population retreated to the
cities, notably Athens.
DIVISIONS OF ATTICA
Cleisthenes’ political reforms (late 6th century BC)
included the abolition of the four traditional Ionian
tribes ( phylai). Instead, Cleisthenes divided Attica
(including Athens) into 10 new tribes (phylai), each
composed of three trittyes. A trittys was a group of at
least three demes (the numbers varied), some selected
from the city, some from the coast and some from
inland (see chapter 1). There were 139 or 140 demes
in all, some representing divisions of Athens and
Piraeus, and others containing one or more centers of
population, such as a village or town. Much progress
has been made in identifying the location of demes.
The largest Attic deme was Acharnae, situated in the
northwest corner of the Attic Plain. The Acharnians
were made famous as charcoal burners by Aristo-
phanes. Cephisia was a deme situated northeast of
Athens (modern Kephisia). Colonos was a small deme
north of the Acropolis at Athens, near Plato’s Acad-
emy; its territory included the hill Kolonos Hippios
(not the Kolonos Agoraios on which the Hephaes-
teum stands overlooking the Acropolis).
ATHENS
Mycenaean Athens was centered on a heavily fortiﬁed
prominent citadel (the Acropolis) situated on an iso-
lated crag, probably similar in appearance to Myce-
nae, with a massive cyclopean wall and settlement on
the slopes and at the foot below it. The agora of Clas-
sical Athens was then the cemetery. At the end of the
Bronze Age, Athens did not decline, but continued to
expand over the surrounding terrain in the Dark Age,
unlike places such as Mycenae, where occupation was
not continuous. Athens became the main city of
Attica, situated within its largest plain, and was the
center of communications. The Eridanus River was
to the north, the Ilissus to the east and the Cephissus
to the west (Map 12). Athens had ready access to the
sea at Phalerum and Piraeus (Map 6).
In 480 BC Athens was destroyed by the Persians.
In 478/477 BC the Delian League was established
under Athenian leadership, with a treasury at Delos.
In the mid-5th century BC this Delian League was
gradually transformed into an Athenian Empire,
with the treasury based at Athens. In 431 BC the
Peloponnesian War broke out between Sparta and
Athens, leading to the complete defeat of Athens,
and its democratic government was temporarily
replaced by an oligarchy that lasted until 399 BC. At
the same time Athens’ Long Walls were demolished
and its empire dissolved. Athens established a Second
Athenian Confederacy (377 BC), but was defeated by
Philip II of Macedonia at the battle of Chaeronea
(338 BC). From then on Athens was under the domi-
nation of Macedonia, and Alexandria became the
cultural center of the Greek world. In 88–86 BC
Athens supported Mithridates VI against Rome, and
was sacked and partly destroyed by the Roman gen-
eral Sulla in 86 BC.
It is uncertain if there was settlement on the
Acropolis after the Mycenaean period, but by the 7th
century BC the Acropolis was no longer of military
importance, but was used for sacred buildings, par-
ticularly those dedicated to Athena. In the 6th cen-
tury BC there was monumental building work on the
Acropolis, which the Persians destroyed in 480 BC.
Rebuilding work did not take place until the mid-
5th century BC. This included a new precinct wall,
which increased the terrace area. The new main
gateway was the Propylaea, with the temple of
Athena Nike on its southwest side (completed c. 420
BC). Other new temples included the Parthenon
(which replaced the unﬁnished Peisistratid temple to
Athena) and the Erechtheum (a modern name; com-
pleted 407 BC) (Map 12, ﬁg 4.3).
After the destruction of the city by the Persians,
the ruined city below the Acropolis was surrounded
by a substantial wall (attributable to Themistocles),
surrounding an area about 0.9 by 0.9 miles (1.5 by
1.5 km) (ﬁg. 4.4). It passed through the Kerameikos
(Ceramicus) Cemetery, which had been used since
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
146

the Bronze Age. Here a double gateway (the Dipy-
lon) was built. A second wall was built outside the
main one in the mid-4th century BC. Outside the city
walls was the main city cemetery along the Eridanus
River. The Academy was situated about 0.9 miles
(1.5 km) from the Dipylon Gate.
The ﬁrst agora at Athens was on the northwest
slope of the Acropolis. The Sacred Way (Pana-
thenaic Way) led from the Acropolis to the Ker-
ameikos Cemetery and then to Eleusis. Here a new
agora was developed from c. 600 BC where a ceme-
tery once existed. This agora was an open space 218
by 273 yds (200 by 250 m) delimited by buildings,
eventually including stoas on every side. On the
north side were the Doric Stoa Basileos (Stoa of the
King) and Stoa Poikile (Painted Stoa) with paintings
of the battle of Marathon and the Trojan War. On
the east side was the Stoa of Attalus (ﬁg. 6.8), built in
the mid-2nd century BC by Attalus II. On the south
side was a fountain house, built c. 520 BC as part of a
more extensive water supply project. On the west
were mainly public ofﬁces, including the old bouleu-
terion, which was later used as the Metroon and
archive store when it was replaced at the end of the
5th century BC by a new bouleuterion (fig. 1.11).
Here a circular tholos (dated to c. 465 BC) also
replaced the old prytaneion as a meeting and dining
room for the prytaneis. The Stoa of Zeus was also
built on the west side of the agora.
The Areopagus (Hill of Ares, Areios Pagos) was
south of the agora; here the ﬁrst council met (itself
called the Areopagus). To the southwest was the
Pnyx Hill, the meeting place of the Assembly, situ-
ated in the densely occupied Koile district of the city.

Map 12 Athens and its main monuments

On the Kolonos Agoraios (a low hill to the west
of the Acropolis) a temple was built dedicated to
Hephaestus and Athena (Hephaesteum—erro-
neously called the Theseum), which was started
about the mid-5th century BC. A limestone temple
was also built to Apollo Delphinios about the same
time, near the abandoned temple of Olympian Zeus
(begun in the late 6th century BC and eventually
completed by the Roman emperor Hadrian).
On the south side of the Acropolis was the theater
of Dionysus (ﬁg 7.14), where theatrical performances
were transferred from the agora after the collapse
there of wooden scaffolding. Here the Attic tragedies
were staged, with the audience sitting on wooden
benches; in the 4th century BC this theater was sub-
stantially rebuilt with permanent seating. West of the
theater was the Asclepieion, below which was the
Stoa of Eumenes II (2nd century BC). Farther east
was a stadium between two low hills. Surrounding
the Acropolis was the street of the tripods, where
numerous choregic monuments were erected.
Elsewhere in Athens, streets and alleyways were
not laid out to a formal plan and varied in width (see
chapter 6, p. 224), and there would have been various
kinds of housing, shrines, shops and workshops,
although little information is available compared
with the vast amount of knowledge for public build-
ings. The potters’ quarter was in the Kerameikos,
and metalworking was probably around the Kolonos
Agoraios.
The port of Athens was 4 miles (6.4 km) to the
south of the city at Piraeus, where much commerce
and industry took place. In the late 6th century BC
the rocky hill of Munychia was fortiﬁed at Piraeus.
From the time of Themistocles (late 5th century BC),
a planned harbor city and naval base with a defensive
wall were built, connected to Athens by the Long
Walls (Map 6). There were numerous harbors and
slipways, and three harbors were incorporated: Can-
tharus, Zea and Munychia.
See also chapter 1 for the government of Athens.
Bactria
A ﬂat fertile region between the Hindu Kush and the
Oxus River, Bactria is now part of northern Afghani-
stan, southern Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan (Map 8).

4.3 Athens Acropolis (center) with the Parthenon temple. At the foot of the Acropolis (left) is a Roman theater, and to
its right is the Stoa of Eumenes II.

It became a province of the Persian Empire in the
6th century BC. When the Persian satrap unsuccess-
fully resisted Alexander the Great, Bactria became
part of the Seleucid Empire, although its governor
Diodotus I Soter established an independent Hel-
lenistic monarchy. Antiochus III was forced to con-
clude a treaty with Bactria. It became a very
important state, eventually extending over western
Pakistan and all of Afghanistan.
Bithynia
A region of northwest Asia Minor along the southern
Black Sea coast (Map 8), Bithynia was once just the
Chalcedon Peninsula, but the territory expanded. It
was largely mountainous, divided by the Sangarius
River. The coastal area was densely occupied, with
the interior only occupied from the Hellenistic
period. The Bithynians were of Thracian origin, and
the northern coast of Bithynia was called Thrace in
Asia. Bithynia was in constant conﬂict with Greek
colonies along the Black Sea coast. It repulsed
Alexander the Great and his Seleucid successors, and
became independent when its leader Zipoetes
became king in 297 BC, establishing a Greek-style
monarchy. The kingdom was bequeathed to the
Romans in 75/74 BC by Nicomedes IV.
Boeotia
This was a district of central Greece bordered on the
east and south by Attica and on the west by Phocis and

4.4 City walls near the Dipylon gate at Athens, where it passed through the Kerameikos cemetery. The wall was probably
originally constructed in the time of Themistocles (the two visible lower courses are early 5th century BC), with rebuildings
attributable to Conon (the polygonal masonry, early 4th century BC) and later (upper courses). Excavation of this stretch
has shown it to be c.8 ft (2.5 m) wide; it was originally a stone wall with rubble inﬁll, supporting a mud brick wall above.

Locris (Map 10). It covered 1,119 sq miles (2,898 sq
km). The south was rough and mountainous, and
access to Corinthian Gulf harbors was blocked by
mountains. The rich plains of Orchomenus and
Thebes were suitable for horse breeding and cultiva-
tion of olives and wheat. Much of the northern plain
was covered by the extensive shallow Lake Copaïs
(now drained). Boeotia’s rivers included the Asopus
and the Cephissus.
The Boeotians (Boiotoi) migrated from Thessaly,
possibly at the beginning of the Dark Age. They were
perceived as dull and thick witted, especially by the
Athenians. By the 9th century BC several poleis had
formed, including Orchomenus, Thebes, Thespiae,
Coronea, Haliartus, Plataea and Tanagra. Some of
these disappeared and some absorbed less powerful
neighbors. Early historians mention numerous towns
and villages, but few have been securely identiﬁed.
Twenty-nine towns are mentioned by name in the
Homeric Catalogue. By about 520 BC there was a
Boeotian Confederacy of city-states dominated by
Thebes, possibly against Thessaly, although Orcho-
menus and Plataea failed to join. Boeotia was defeated
by Athens and Plataea in 506 BC, after which Orcho-
menus joined the Confederacy, which was by now a
federal state.
During the Persian Wars, Boeotia sided with the
Persians and was defeated at the battle of Plataea. The
Boeotian Confederacy continued to exist, although
not under the domination of Thebes. In the Classical
period, there were only about 12 independent cities,
including Orchomenus, Thebes, Thespiae, Plataea,
Haliartus, Chaeronea, Coronea and Tanagra.
In the mid-5th century BC, Athens invaded Boeo-
tia and won a victory at the battle of Oenophyta in
457 BC, compelling all cities except Thebes to accept
Athens’ supremacy. Ten years later Athens was
defeated at the battle of Coronea, and so Boeotia’s
independence was restored. In the 4th century BC
Thebes extended its power over the rest of Boeotia. It
defeated Sparta at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and
again at Mantinea in 362 BC, and for a time Thebes
was the dominant power in Greece. Orchomenus
does not appear to have been a member of the Boeot-
ian Confederacy at that time, and was destroyed by
Thebes in 364 BC. Boeotia was unable to resist the
rise of Macedonia under Philip II. Theban and
Athenian forces were defeated at Chaeronea in 338
BC, and Thebes was destroyed in 335 BC by Alexan-
der the Great, after which Boeotia rapidly declined.
Thebes was reconstructed under Cassander (316 BC).
By the Roman period, Boeotian cities were in ruins:
only Tanagra and Thespiae remained as towns, with
Thebes surviving as a village.
Bosphorus
Also known as Bosporus (cow’s ford), the Cimmerian
Bosphorus territory (Map 8) was either side of the
Maeotic Channel (Straits of Kerch) between the
Black Sea and Sea of Maeotis (Azov). A kingdom was
established in the 480s BC for protection against
non-Greek neighbors, and the monarchy lasted for
over 200 years. The main colonies were Pantica-
paeum, Nymphaeum and Phanagoria. The kingdom
derived its wealth from ﬁsh processing, metalwork-
ing and huge exports of grain from Russia. From c.
250 BC there were increasing attacks from Scythians
and Sarmatians. Ultimately Mithridates VI of Pontus
was called on to help repulse the invaders, and he
annexed the territory c. 110 BC, when the last
Bosphoran king was killed.
The Cimmerian Bosphorus is not the same as the
Bosphorus Strait (Thracian Bosphorus) linking the
Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara (Propontis). This
17-mile (27-km) channel was lined with steep wooded
hills, and the indented shoreline and river inlets
encouraged numerous settlements.
Cappadocia
A mountainous region in Asia Minor, Cappadocia
originally extended from the Black Sea to the
Euphrates (Map 11). The northern part became
Pontus (or Pontic Cappadocia). Cappadocia was east
of Galatia and Cilicia and was ruled as a Persian
satrapy. It resisted Alexander the Great, and in 322
BC Ariarathes I, satrap of Cappadocia and Pontus,
was killed by Perdiccas. Cappadocia then became
part of the Seleucid Empire. After 301 BC Ariarathes
II regained Cappadocia (but not Pontus), but
remained subject to the Seleucids. Ariarathes III
declared its independence c. 250 BC. It became an
ally of Pergamum, but after Antiochus III was
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E

defeated by Rome at the battle of Magnesia (189 BC),
Cappadocia became an ally of Rome.
Caria
Caria (Karia) was a mountainous region in southwest
Asia Minor (Map 11), south of the Maeander River.
The coast had some hellenized towns, such as
Cnidus and Halicarnassus, but the interior was
largely hilltop villages. It came under the control of
King Croesus of Lydia and then the Persians, against
whom the Carians fought in the Ionian Revolt
(499–494 BC). Mausolus, son of the Persian satrap
Hecatomnus, moved the capital of Caria from
Mylasa to Halicarnassus. Under him, Caria was vir-
tually a separate kingdom, and he extended its terri-
tory into Ionia and Lycia. He pursued a policy of
hellenization, including building new cities. His sis-
ter Ada, who had been deposed, was reinstated by
Alexander the Great. Caria subsequently formed part
of the Ptolemaic Empire. Much of the territory was
given to Rhodes for supporting Rome against Anti-
ochus III in 188 BC. It became part of the Roman
province of Asia (133 BC).
Chalcidice
A promontory in Macedonia (Map 10), Chalcidice
included the three smaller promontories of Pallene
(Cassandra), Sithonia (Longos) and Acte (Athos). It
was situated between the Thermaic and Strymonic
Gulfs. The northern part was called Bottice. It gained
its name Chalcidice (Chalkidike) from being ﬁrst col-
onized by Chalcis in the 8th century BC. The
colonists founded about 30 settlements and dispos-
sessed the former Sithonian inhabitants. Eretria and
Andros also founded colonies, as did Corinth (at Poti-
daea c. 600 BC). The cities joined the Delian League,
coming under Athenian dominance, but in 432/431
BC they revolted by establishing their own Chalcidic
(or Chalcidian) Confederacy (or League) with its cap-
ital at Olynthus. There were common laws and citi-
zenship, and the Confederacy circulated its own
coins. It expanded northwest into Macedonia in the
380s BC, taking over Anthemus and the capital Pella.
Other threatened cities called on Sparta to intervene,
and the Confederacy was forced to become allies in
379 BC. The Chalcidians joined the Second Athen-
ian League, but then sided with Philip II of Mace-
donia in 356 BC. Philip dissolved the Confederacy
and destroyed many of its cities, the last being Olyn-
thus in 348 BC. Many cities were refounded in the
Hellenistic period, such as Cassandrea, which was
founded on the site of Potidaea in 316 BC.
Chersonesus
The Thracian Chersonesus or Chersonese (Kherson-
esos) was the Gallipoli Peninsula (Map 11). It was an
important wheat-growing area, and as it controlled
the Dardanelles, it was also strategically important. It
was colonized in the 8th and 7th centuries BC from
Miletus and elsewhere. It came under Athenian con-
trol in the 6th century BC, but in 338 BC it was ceded
to Philip II of Macedonia. It was subsequently fought
over by Hellenistic rulers, until it was taken over by
the kingdom of Pergamum in 189 BC.
The Tauric Chersonesus was the Crimea, which
came under the control of the kingdom of the Cim-
merian Bosphorus in 438 BC. A city named Cherson-
esus also existed in this area.
Cilicia
Cilicia comprised the southeastern coastal area of
Asia Minor and its mountainous hinterland (Map 11).
It contained a western mountainous area called Cili-
cia Tracheia and a fertile plain to the east called Cili-
cia Pedias. The land became subject to the Persians,
but was liberated unopposed by Alexander the Great.
It became part of the Seleucid Empire, but was long
disputed between the Ptolemies and Seleucids. In the
late 2nd century BC pirates were based in Cilicia Tra-
cheia, which led to it being occupied by the Romans.
Colchis
This region was at the east end of the Black Sea (now
Georgia), south of the Caucasus Mountains (Map 8).
Here several colonies and trading posts were estab-
lished by Miletus. Various goods were traded to the
G E O G R A P H Y
O F
T H E G R E E K W O R L D

Greek world, and there were also commercial con-
nections with the Scytho-Iranian world. The state
was possibly established in the 6th century BC and
was ruled by local chieftains. It was conquered by
Mithridates VI c. 111/110 BC, and was later incorpo-
rated in the Roman province known as Bithynia and
Pontus.
Commagene
A territory in northern Syria (now southeastern
Turkey) extending to the Euphrates River (Map 11).
It became a client kingdom of the Seleucids, but
declared its independence c. 162 BC. Subsequent
Greco-Iranian kings claimed descent from Darius I
and Alexander the Great.
Corinth
The city of Corinth, its acropolis (Acrocorinth) and
its surrounding territory (the Corinthia, in area about
340 sq miles [880 sq km]) are situated by the Isthmus
of Corinth, therefore controlling north-south com-
munications between the Peloponnese and north
Greece, and east-west communications between the
Aegean and Ionian Seas (Map 10). There was no
canal across the isthmus, but it was easier to drag
small ships across a special road (diolkos) (or to unload
from one ship and load on to another) than to sail
around the Peloponnese. Corinth’s two ports (one on
each gulf) were Lechaeum and Cenchreae.
Corinth is mentioned in Homer’s Iliad, where it is
also called Ephyre. It was probably occupied by
Dorians c. 900 BC. Ancient tradition stated that the
Dorian oligarchy of the Bacchiads ruled there from
747 to 657 BC. During that period Corinth founded
the colonies of Syracuse and Corcyra (traditionally
733 BC). In 657 BC, the tyrant Cypselus overthrew
the Bacchiads. Corinth’s power and prosperity grew
to its height under Cypselus and his son Periander (c.
625–585 BC). The colony of Potidaea was founded in
Chalcidice c. 600 BC. The tyranny of Periander’s suc-
cessor and nephew Psammetichus was overthrown
and replaced by an oligarchy friendly to both Sparta
and Athens. Relations with Athens deteriorated in
the later 5th century BC; disputes with Athens con-
cerning Corcyra and Potidaea led to the outbreak of
the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, in which Corinth
suffered badly due to the loss of trade, ships and
colonies. Corinth defended Syracuse against Athens
during its Sicilian Expedition (415 BC).
Corinth subsequently joined Athens, Argos and
Boeotia against Sparta (Corinthian War, 395–386
BC), and again joined Athens against Philip II of
Macedonia. When Athens and Thebes were defeated
at the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), Philip II sum-
moned a congress of Greek states at Corinth to form
the Hellenic League. It joined the Achaean Confed-
eracy and later passed into Macedonian hands. When
Macedonia was conquered by the Roman general
Flamininus, Corinth became a free city and the main
city of the Achaean Confederacy. It was destroyed by
the Romans in 146 BC, and its people killed or
enslaved. It was refounded by the Romans in 44 BC.
Crete
The largest island in the Aegean (Map 7), which
experienced the Minoan civilization (see chapter 1,
pp. 2–3). In historical times Crete was always outside
mainstream events in Greece. Its social system seems
to have been similar to that of Sparta (both were
Dorian regions). In early times, 90 to 100 cities are
thought to have existed: Homer mentions 100 cities,
for example, and over 50 are known, the most impor-
tant being Knossos, Gortyn, Lyttos and Cydonia.
These many small city-states were often at war, and
Cretans were often used as mercenary soldiers out-
side Crete, especially as slingers and archers. During
the Persian Wars in the 5th century BC, Crete refused
to assist Greece.
The island became notorious as a center of piracy,
second to Cilicia. In the late 3rd century BC Philip V
of Macedonia encouraged Crete to attack the ﬂeets of
his rival Rhodes. The pirates later supported Mithri-
dates Vl of Pontus against Rome. The Romans there-
fore captured the island in 68/67 BC and destroyed
Knossos. Crete was attached to the Roman province
of Cyrenaica, with Gortyn as its capital.
Cyprus
This island in the eastern Mediterranean, 50 miles
(80 km) south of Cilicia Tracheia (Map 7), traded

copper and wood for shipbuilding. In the Late
Bronze Age, Mycenaean settlements were estab-
lished. Subsequently the island came variously under
the control of Syria, Phoenicia, Assyria, Egypt and,
from 525 BC, Persia. Each city on Cyprus retained its
own king. Several cities joined the Ionian Revolt
against Persia (499–494 BC), but this was crushed.
The island supported Alexander the Great and
helped him capture the Phoenician city of Tyre (333
BC). Cyprus was then ruled by the Ptolemies, and the
individual kingships were abolished. The island was
ceded to Rome in 59 BC.
Cyrene
Also known as Cyrenaica, Cyrene was a fertile terri-
tory situated in the eastern part of Libya (Map 8). The
city of Cyrene was founded c. 630 BC by colonists
from Thera under Battus, and established colonies of
its own in the early 6th century BC. Cyrene was under
Persian control 525–c. 479 BC. The Battiad monar-
chy came to an end c. 440 BC, when democratic
reform took place. After the death of Alexander the
Great, Cyrene was ruled by the Ptolemies. The
coastal strip became known as the Pentapolis, with
the five Greek cities of Cyrene, Ptolemais, Eues-
perides, Apollonia and Taucheira. In 74 BC it became
a Roman province and merged with Crete seven years
later (67 BC).
Doris
A small area of central Greece around the headwa-
ters of the River Cephissus (Map 10), its small plain
contained the cities of Pindus, Erineus, Boeum and
Cytinium. It came under the control of Ono-
marchus, the Phocian commander, in the 4th century
BC, and later fell to Philip II of Macedonia.
Drangiana
This area (Drangiane), now largely comprising
southwest Afghanistan (Map 8), came under Persian
control and formed part of the satrapy of Arachosia.
In 330 BC Alexander the Great entered the region
and detached it from Arachosia, joining it with Aria
to the north. This territory then became part of the
Seleucid Empire, but subsequently came under the
control of Bactria (late 3rd century BC).
Egypt
Up to the time of Alexander the Great, Egypt (Aigyp-
tos) was little affected by Greece, apart from the trad-
ing post at Naucratis (Map 8). Alexander seized
Egypt from the Persians in 332/331 BC and appointed
Cleomenes (a Greek from Naucratis) as financial
administrator. After Alexander’s death Ptolemy was
appointed as satrap, and he had Cleomenes assassi-
nated. He became king (Ptolemy I) in 304 BC, and the
Ptolemies ruled Egypt as hereditary monarchs for
nearly 300 years, throughout the Hellenistic period.
In addition they ruled other territories at various
times, including Coele-Syria, Cyrene, parts of Asia
Minor and Cyprus. There was also continual conﬂict
with Seleucid Syria. At the end of the 3rd century BC,
Nubia in the south revolted. Internal dissension led
to Egypt becoming a Roman province, with its last
ruler (Cleopatra VII) committing suicide in 30 BC.
Despite the lengthy rule of the Ptolemies, Greek cul-
ture never took root in much of Egypt. Even in
Alexandria there were few Greeks by the 2nd century
BC, according to the writer Polybius.
ALEXANDRIA
This city was founded by Alexander the Great in 331
BC, though possibly not intended as a capital city. It
was on the Nile Delta, between the sea and Lake
Mareotis, and may have been situated on an existing
harbor and the village site of Rhacotis. It is the ﬁrst
known city to bear the name of its founder, and it
became the wealthy center of the Hellenistic world
and the largest of all Greek cities. It was inhabited by
descendants of the Greek and Macedonian settlers, a
substantial Jewish community, and people of numer-
ous other races. Little survives today, but numerous
ancient writers described it. It was planned by the
Macedonian town planner/architect Deinocrates. It
measured about 1.2 miles (2 km) north-south and 3.1
miles (5 km) east-west and was probably modeled on
the plan of Pella. A royal palace was built in the
northwest part of the town, adjacent to the sea, pos-
sibly occupying one-quarter or one-third of the city
G E O G R A P H Y
O F
T H E G R E E K W O R L D
153

area. Next to the palace was the Akra (a fortiﬁed area
but not an acropolis on a hill). There was an agora,
probably in the city center. The city was divided into
ﬁve klimata (strips), each of which was divided into
rectangular blocks divided by streets.
On his death, Ptolemy I buried Alexander the
Great at Alexandria, and the city subsequently
underwent much development, with Ptolemy mov-
ing his capital there from Memphis. Little is known
about Alexandria’s public buildings, such as temples.
The Museum became a center of Greek culture; it
was a courtyard structure with a shrine to the Muses,
and the nearby Library must have been substantial.
There was a sanctuary of Sarapis in the southwestern
part of the city, a theater, and a gymnasium next to
the east-west street. The most famous building was
the Pharos Lighthouse, which bears the name of the
island on which it was built; it was connected to the
mainland by a mole, which provided two harbors.
Initially houses may have been very large, but these
gave way to tenement blocks to house the rapidly
increasing population. Cemeteries with substantial
tombs exist, particularly on the east of the city.
Elis
A region in the northwest Peloponnese whose rich
plain (in which Olympia is situated) was famous for
horse breeding (Map 10). Elis consisted of three dis-
tinct districts. Hollow Elis was in the north (named
after its Plain of Peneus), and there were two other
annexed districts—Pisatis in the center in the lower
valley of the Alpheus (there may have been a town
called Pisa) and Triphylia in the south. Elis was often
in conﬂict with Pisatis (the district round Olympia)
over control of Olympia. With Sparta as an ally, Elis
regained control of the Olympic Games from Pisatis
by the 6th century BC.
From 471 BC the city of Elis became the region’s
political and religious center. Although the state
tended to remain neutral in politics, Elis was a close
ally of Sparta until 420 BC, when Sparta supported
the revolt and independence of Lepreum. Elis there-
fore became allied with Athens and Argos, and
fought against Sparta at the battle of Mantinea (418
BC). In 399 BC Sparta punished Elis by the loss of
Triphylia (which was united to Arcadia in 369 BC).
Sparta gave Xenophon an estate near Olympia, but
Elis forced him to move in 371 BC. In the 3rd cen-
tury BC, the Eleans were allies of Aetolia and fought
frequently with Arcadia. In 191 BC Elis was incorpo-
rated in the Achaean Confederacy, and in 146 BC
became part of a Roman province, although still able
to control the Olympic Games.
Epirus
Epirus (Epeiros, mainland) was a territory in north-
west Greece and southern Albania (Map 10). It was
inhabited by three main groups of Iron Age tribes—
the Chaones, Molossi and Thesproti. Along the
coast were colonies founded by the Greeks, includ-
ing the Corinthian colonies of Ambracia and the
island of Corcyra. The Molossi under Alexander I
(342–330 BC) unified much of Epirus. Pyrrhus I
(297–272 BC) established his capital at Ambracia and
expanded his kingdom, including the conquest of
southern Illyria, the invasion of Italy and Sicily, and
confrontations with the Carthaginians and Romans.
Constant strife occurred between his successors, and
the monarchy fell c. 232 BC. The Molossi alone sub-
sequently supported Perseus of Macedonia against
Rome. The Romans sacked much of the country and
deported 150,000 inhabitants into slavery (167 BC).
In 146 BC, Epirus was attached to the new Roman
province of Macedonia.
Galatia
A large upland region in central Asia Minor, Galatia
was formerly part of Phrygia and Cappadocia (Map
11). It was occupied by Gauls (Galatians) who had
crossed the Hellespont from Europe in the early 3rd
century BC. They supported Antiochus III against
the Romans, but became allies of Rome after the bat-
tle of Magnesia (189 BC). In 85 BC Galatia became a
protectorate of Rome.
Gandhara
A territory now in northwest Pakistan, southeast of
the Hindu Kush Mountains (Map 8), it was under
Persian rule for two centuries, but surrendered to
Alexander the Great in 327 BC. Toward the end of
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
154

the 4th century BC, western Gandhara was ceded to
Sandracottus by Seleucus I in exchange for war ele-
phants. Part of Gandhara was taken over in the early
2nd century BC by Bactria, which had also broken
away from the Seleucid Empire.
Gedrosia
This was an area of southern Pakistan and southeast
Iran that extended northward from the Arabian Sea
(Map 8). Its Persian satrap surrendered to Alexander
the Great in 330/329 BC. It later fell to Parthia.
Illyria
Illyria comprised the northwestern part of the Balkan
Peninsula to the north of Epirus and Macedonia
(Map 10). Its coast was settled by Greek colonists,
such as at Epidamnus and Apollonia, but elsewhere it
was populated by warlike Illyrians, who constantly
harassed Epirus and Macedonia. Illyria fought wars
with Rome in the late 3rd century BC, and in the 2nd
century BC it supported Perseus of Macedonia, but
was defeated by the Romans in 168 BC.
India
Alexander the Great in his Indian Expedition of
327–325 BC took over parts of modern Pakistan and
India as far as the Hyphasis (Beas) River (Maps 5, 8)
and founded various cities. Seleucus I relinquished
several of these eastern territories to the Mauryan
king Sandracottus in 303 BC in exchange for war ele-
phants. The Greco-Bactrian kings took control of
many of the territories in northwest India, following
the collapse of the Mauryan Empire in the early 2nd
century BC. However, the rise of Parthia separated
the Greek world from India.
Ionia
The central part of the west coast of Asia Minor
(including islands), with Caria to the south and Aeo-
lis to the north (Map 11), this area began to be colo-
nized before 1000 BC by migrations from mainland
Greece, when the Dorians were pushing into Greece.
By 700 BC a religious league was formed, known as
the Panionion, and was based at Mycale. Twelve city-
states emerged in the Archaic period and formed the
Ionian League: Phocaea, Clazomenae, Erythrae,
Teos, Lebedus, Colophon, Ephesus, Priene, Myus,
Miletus and the islands of Chios and Samos. In the
7th century BC Miletus and Phocaea undertook much
overseas colonization. Ionia came under the control
of Lydia and then the Persians, against whom they
revolted until defeated at Lade in 495/494 BC. They
were liberated from the Persians after the battle of
Mycale in 479 BC and joined the Delian League.
After Athens was defeated in the Peloponnesian War,
Ionia once again came under Persian domination. In
334 BC the Ionians (except Miletus) supported
Alexander the Great, and subsequently came under
Seleucid and Ptolemaic control, until the kingdom of
Pergamum was formed. When Pergamum was
bequeathed to the Romans (133 BC), Ionia became
part of the Roman province of Asia.
The term Ionian is also used to cover Attica,
Euboea, the Cyclades and the central part of western
Asia Minor.
Judaea
One of the three main divisions of Palestine (the
other two being Samaria and Galilee to the north),
Judaea was part of Syria (Map 8). It was in Persian
control (538–332 BC) until taken by Alexander the
Great. It later came under the control of the
Ptolemies and then the Seleucids (200 BC). Anti-
ochus IV attempted to hellenize Judaea, including
substituting Zeus Olympias for the worship of Yah-
weh in the temple of Jerusalem. His persecutions of
the Jews led to an insurrection. Judaea became the
independent Hasmonaean state, largely outside Hel-
lenistic inﬂuence, until it came under Roman control
in 63 BC.
Laconia
This area of the southeastern Peloponnese was called
Laconia or Laconica (Lakonia or Lakonike) (Map 10).
The area was also known as Lacedaemon (Lakedai-
mon), its most ancient name, which was used by
G E O G R A P H Y
O F
T H E G R E E K W O R L D
155

Homer. This was the territory of Sparta (Sparte),
itself also known as Lacedaemon. The name Sparta
was applied only to the city. Laconia was bounded on
the south and east by the Aegean Sea, on the west by
Messenia and on the north by Arcadia and Argos. It
is a mountainous limestone region, with Mt. Tayge-
tus rising to 7,800 ft (2,377 m), overlooking the Plain
of Sparta. The main rivers are the Eurotas and the
Oenus (a tributary).
By the 12th century BC the Mycenaean kingdom
was destroyed, and by 950 BC new Dorian settle-
ments existed. By 700 BC one such settlement—
Sparta—was in control of a large area of Laconia,
which formed the territory of the Spartiatai. Various
other territories were annexed, and the population
was reduced to the level of either helots (serfs), who
cultivated the land, or partially independent perioeci,
but in reality they were under Spartan domination.
Between c. 735 and 715 BC Sparta fought the First
Messenian War against Messenia, annexing much of
that state and reducing its population to the level of
helots. The area controlled by the city-state of
Sparta now covered 3,000 sq miles (8,000 sq km).
The Messenians later revolted, leading to the Second
Messenian War.
Circa 706 BC a group of Spartans colonized Taras
in south Italy (ﬁg. 4.5). In the mid-6th century BC
Sparta abandoned its policy of conquest and expan-
sion, and concentrated on consolidation. A Pelo-
ponnesian League of states was formed under
Sparta’s leadership, including Corinth and Megara,
but excluding Argos and Achaea. The states paid no
tribute, but provided military assistance when
needed. Sparta cooperated with Athens at the Per-
sian invasion under Xerxes, particularly at the bat-
tles of Thermopylae and Plataea. Due especially to
the disgrace of Pausanias, the leadership of the war
against Persia passed to the Delian League under
Athens, and Sparta was no longer the main power in
Greece.
Sparta suffered a devastating earthquake (464 BC)
and a revolt of the helots (Third Messenian War,
464–460 BC), but fear of Athenian expansion led to
the Peloponnesian War against Athens (431–404 BC).
Athens was defeated, leaving Sparta the dominant
power in Greece. Sparta subsequently waged war

his father Poseidon. He holds a cantharus in his right hand, and there is a star behind him. The obverse (b) depicts a
horseman, possibly Taras riding over land.

against the Persians (400–390 BC) in support of the
Ionian cities in Asia Minor. A league of Thebes,
Corinth, Athens and Argos was formed, which fought
the Corinthian War against Sparta. It was brought to
an end by the King’s Peace (386 BC), leaving Sparta
free and the Peloponnesian League in place. Sparta
invaded Boeotia on several occasions from 378 BC, but
was defeated by Thebes at the battle of Leuctra (371
BC). Sparta’s power was weakened by the repeated
invasions of the Theban commander Epaminondas
(who also freed Messenia) and by the formation of a
league of Arcadian cities.
By this time the number of Spartan citizens was
diminished to only 2,000. When Philip II of Macedo-
nia invaded the Peloponnese, Sparta’s power and ter-
ritory were further diminished, although the city
itself was not captured. Sparta was later captured by
Macedonia’s Antigonus Doson and was enrolled in
the Hellenic League, later being forced to join the
Achaean Confederacy. When the Achaean Confeder-
acy was abolished by the Romans, Sparta was joined
to the Roman province of Macedonia (146 BC).
Sparta was different from all other states in sev-
eral respects, including its constitution and its
emphasis on a military lifestyle. The Spartans’ repu-
tation for terseness is responsible for the term
“laconic.” See also chapter 1 for the government of
Sparta and its population.
SPARTA
Sparta was situated on low hills on the west bank of
the Eurotas River in the north of the plain of Laconia
(Map 13). A group of at least four Dorian villages
around the acropolis became united as a political
entity in about the 10th century BC. The four quarters
of the city were the villages known as Limnai, Pitane,
Cynosura and Mesoa. The city continued to be a
group of villages with no ﬁne buildings. It was only
partially walled by the end of the 4th century BC, and
the city walls were only completed in 184 BC, enclos-
ing an extensive area 1.8 by 1.2 miles (3 by 2 km).
On the acropolis was a sanctuary of Athena Chal-
cioecus. Chalcioecus (Khalkioikos, living in a brazen
house) was an epithet given to Athena Poliachos, the
tutelary goddess of the city; it was derived from the
metal shrine in which her statue stood. A theater of
Hellenistic date was built into the foot of the acrop-
olis. On the southeastern side of the acropolis was
an agora. On the west bank of the Eurotas was the
Sanctuary of Orthia (later linked to Artemis), where
over 100,000 lead ﬁgurines have been found. Con-
trary to normal Greek practice, burials were allowed
inside the settlement area, although few have been
found.
Locris
Two areas made up the territory of Locris (Map 10),
but these were separated by Doris and Phocis (prob-
ably as a result of invasions that divided Locris in
two). The two areas played little part in history. One
was Eastern Locris (Opuntian or Eoian Locris),
which occupied the mainland coast of the Euboean
Straits, from Thermopylae to Larymna. The center
of the federal state was at Opus; it founded Locri
Epizephyrii in Italy c. 700 BC. Opuntian Locris sup-
ported Greece against Persia, but still lost territory
to its neighbors (such as Thermopylae to Thessaly
and Daphnis to Phocis). The other area was Western

Map 13 Map of Sparta

Locris (Ozolian Locris or Locris Ozolis), which
occupied the northern coast of the Corinthian Gulf
and the Amphissa Valley. Ozolian Locris lost Nau-
pactus to Athens c. 460 BC, and became involved in
the Sacred Wars.
Lycaonia
Lycaonia (Lykaonia) was part of the uplands of cen-
tral Asia Minor (Map 11), whose people were not
easily controlled. Perdiccas subdued them in 322 BC,
and they became part of the Seleucid Empire
(280–189 BC), with a capital at Iconium (Konya),
which was once part of Phrygia. From 189 BC Lycao-
nia became part of the kingdom of Pergamum, and
from 133 BC part of the Roman province of Asia.
Lycia
Lycia (Lykia) was part of mountainous southern Asia
Minor between Caria and Pamphylia (Map 11). Lycia
was overrun by the Persians c. 540 BC, but the city-
states were temporarily liberated by the Athenians
under Cimon c. 468 BC. They joined the Delian
League for a brief period, but returned rapidly to
Persian control. Lycia became part of the kingdom
of Mausolus of Halicarnassus, but submitted to
Alexander the Great. After Alexander’s death, Lycia
became part of the Ptolemaic and then the Seleucid
Empires. Antiochus III defeated the region in 197
BC, but the territory was granted to Rhodes by Rome
after his defeat at the battle of Magnesia in 189 BC.
There was a Lycian Confederacy of city-states from
at least 200 BC.
Lydia
This was an inland territory of western Asia Minor
(Map 11), centered on the Hermus and Cayster val-
leys (main east-west routes). Under the Mermnad
dynasty (c. 700–550 BC), Lydia was a powerful king-
dom, with a capital at Sardis. It was the ﬁrst state to
issue coinage. Its last king, Croesus (c. 560–546 BC),
extended his Empire throughout Asia Minor but was
defeated by the Persians. Lydia became the main
Persian satrapy in Asia Minor. It was conquered by
Alexander the Great and became part of the Seleucid
Empire. From 189 BC it was part of the Pergamum
Kingdom, and from 133 BC part of the Roman
province of Asia.
Macedonia
Macedonia (Makedonia), also known as Macedon, was
an area north of Greece, west of Thrace and south of
Illyria, comprising a large Macedonian plain sur-
rounded by hills and mountains (Map 10). It was
ruled by kings of the royal house of Argeads, a
dynasty that claimed descent from Argos. Perdiccas I
set up his capital at Aegae (modern Vergina) c. 640
BC. Macedonia became subject to Persia from the
time of Darius I (512 BC) until Xerxes’ retreat from
Greece (480 BC). Archelaus moved the capital to Pella
and hellenized and strengthened the country. Philip
II gained control of Greece after defeating a Greek
coalition at the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC). He
established a Hellenic League at Corinth. Alexander
the Great (336–323 BC) overthrew the Persian
Empire and extended Macedonian control through-
out the east as far as India (Map 5). After his death
there were wars of succession, with the Antigonid
monarchy in Macedonia. Philip V (221–179 BC)
fought two wars against the Romans, who defeated
him at Cynoscephalae (197 BC), confining him to
Macedonia. His son Perseus was defeated by the
Romans at the battle of Pydna (168 BC), and Macedo-
nia was abolished and replaced by four autonomous
republics. In 146 BC they became part of the Roman
province of Macedonia.
PELLA
King Archelaus moved the capital of Macedonia here
from Aegae. It was situated by a lake, and the river
was navigable to the Thermaic Gulf of the Aegean
Sea. Pella covered a large area and had a grid of sub-
stantial streets (ﬁg. 4.6). Part of its northern area was
devoted to the palace of the Macedonian kings,
which seems to have consisted of a large structure
with two rectangular peristyle courtyards side by
side—possibly a public and private area. Also in the
north part was an acropolis on a pair of hills. The
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
158

agora was bounded by stoas on all four sides and was
in the main area of the city. The houses seem to have
been very large, with courtyards.
Malis
A small district in eastern Greece at the head of the
Malian Gulf, Malis was surrounded on all sides by
mountains, with Thessaly to the north (Map 10). The
first center of the Amphictyonic Council was at
Anthela, Malis’ southernmost town, although its ﬁrst
capital was at Trachis. It was forced to join the Per-
sian army of Xerxes in his invasion of 480 BC, and
Ephialtes (from Trachis) showed the Persians the way
through Thermopylae (fig. 2.4). Malis supported
Sparta in the Peloponnesian War, and Sparta estab-
lished the military colony of Heraclea Trachinia
there in 399 BC. This colony eclipsed Trachis, but
was captured by Boeotians and Argives in the
Corinthian War in 394 BC. It was destroyed by Jason
of Pherae in 371 BC. Lamia then became the only
important city of Malis. Malis sided with Sparta
against Thebes, and in 338 BC joined the League of
Corinth founded by Philip II. From c. 235 BC Malis
joined the Aetolian Confederacy, but in 189 BC it
became part of Thessaly.
Megara
A district centered on the Dorian city at the eastern
end of the Isthmus of Corinth (Map 10), its name was
derived from ta megara (the temples). Its port was
Nisaea on the Saronic Gulf, to which it was con-
nected by its Long Walls. Megara controlled much of
the isthmus. It was responsible for founding several
early colonies, including Megara Hyblaea in Sicily

(c. 300 BC), one of the larger, wealthier Hellenistic peristyle houses

and Byzantium and Chalcedon on the Bosphorus.
Megara lost western territory to Corinth, and Salamis
to Athens. It joined the Peloponnesian League before
500 BC and participated in the Persian Wars. Megara
was then involved in territorial disputes with Corinth
and left the Peloponnesian League to become allied
with Athens. It then revolted from Athens, and in
433/432 BC Pericles decreed to block its trade, which
was one of the causes of the Peloponnesian War.
Megara did not play any important role in subsequent
history. It regained some prosperity, came under
Macedonian control and then joined the Achaean
Confederacy.
Mesopotamia
An area of southeastern Turkey and Iraq between the
Tigris and Euphrates Rivers (Map 8), it was taken
from the Babylonians by the Persians in 539 BC.
Alexander the Great gained the territory after defeat-
ing Darius III at Gaugamela in 331 BC. Seleucus I
made the new city of Seleucia on the Tigris his capital,
and many other cities were founded here by the Seleu-
cids. In 141/140 BC the area was overrun by Parthians.
Messenia
Also referred to as Messene (a name that gradually
came to denote the town founded after the battle of
Leuctra), this was a region in the southwestern Pelo-
ponnese, with Arcadia and Elis to the north and Laco-
nia to the east (Map 10). There was extensive
occupation in the Mycenaean period, including the
palace at Pylos. Between c. 735 and 715 BC Sparta
fought against Messenia (First Messenian War) and
conquered at least its central plain, reducing the pop-
ulation to the level of helots. Messenia later revolted,
resulting in the Second Messenian War, when it held
out under its leader Aristomenes. He was subse-
quently defeated, and all of Messenia came under
Spartan control. There were several subsequent
revolts, and in 370/369 BC the Theban commander
Epaminondas freed Messenia from its state of servi-
tude to Sparta, and founded Messene as the new capi-
tal. Messenia sided with Philip II of Macedonia in 344
BC, and Philip increased its territory. From c. 244 BC
Messenia belonged alternately to the Aetolian and
Achaean Confederacies. Forced to rejoin the Achaean
Confederacy, it sent no troops to act against Rome
and ﬁnally came under Roman control in 146 BC.
Mysia
This was a district in northwest Asia Minor, with
Lydia to the south, Phrygia to the east and Propon-
tis to the north (Map 11). The Troad to the west was
sometimes regarded as part of its territory. It came
under the control of King Croesus of Lydia and then
fell to the Persians. It was taken by Alexander the
Great and became part of the Seleucid Empire.
When Antiochus III was defeated by the Romans in
189 BC, Mysia was incorporated with the kingdom of
Pergamum.
Pamphylia
This coastal plain of southern Asia Minor was
between Lycia and Cilicia, with the Mediterranean
on the south and the Taurus Mountains on the north
(Map 11). There was Greek colonization along the
coast, but the area came under the control of Lydia
and then Persia, until it surrendered to Alexander the
Great (333 BC). Subsequently it became part of the
Ptolemaic and then the Seleucid Empires. Antiochus
III ceded the region to Rome in 189 BC.
Paphlagonia
This was an area of northern Asia Minor between
Pontus and Bithynia along the Black Sea coast (Map
11), where there were numerous Greek colonies.
After Alexander the Great, it was divided between
Bithynia and Pontus.
Parthia
This territory was part of the Persian Empire until it
was overrun by Alexander the Great (Map 8). It
became a Seleucid satrapy, equivalent in area to mod-
ern Iran. Around 300 BC Scythian tribes moved from
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E

central Asia to Parthia. Circa 247 BC Arsaces I con-
quered the satrapy and established an independent
kingdom, with Ecbatana as its capital. From that
time the Parthian Empire began to expand, with ter-
ritories divided into satrapies from the Euphrates to
Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.
Peloponnese
This peninsula of southern Greece (Peloponnesos, Isle
of Pelops; medieval Morea) was connected with cen-
tral mainland Greece only by the Isthmus of Corinth
(Map 10). The main regions were Achaea, Elis, Arca-
dia, Argos, Messenia and Laconia. The main towns
were Sparta, Argos and Corinth. The Peloponnesian
League was a confederacy of Greek states, including
Sparta and its allies.
Pergamum
A city in Asia Minor, about 15 miles (24 km) from the
sea (Map 11), it became the capital of the powerful
Hellenistic Attalid kingdom in the 3rd century BC.
The city itself was made one of the finest in the
Greek world (ﬁg. 4.7), with a library second only to
Alexandria. It became part of the Seleucid Empire,
but became independent under Eumenes I. The
kingdom was bequeathed to Rome in 133 BC.
Persia
An area of about 1,000,000 sq mi (2,589,900 sq
km), Persia extended from the Tigris to the Indus
Rivers. The Persian Empire was established through
conquest from the 6th century BC by Cyrus, who

overthrew the Medes. Persia was then extended by
Cambyses and Darius (late 6th–early 5th century BC)
into Asia Minor, Bactria, India and Egypt, resulting
in conﬂict with the Greeks (Persian Wars). Persia’s
administrative capital was at Susa. The Empire was
divided into a number of autonomous provinces
called satrapies, each governed by a satrap (either a
local ruler or a Persian). Each satrapy was required to
pay tribute and provide supplies for the military. The
Empire was conquered in the late 4th century BC by
Alexander the Great, who maintained the satrapies.
It later became part of the Seleucid Empire.
Phocis
A territory in central Greece, Phocis (Phokis) was
organized as a confederation of small towns (Map 10).
It controlled Delphi until the early 6th century BC,
when Delphi was brought under the control of the
Amphictyonic Council in the First Sacred War. In
the Persian Wars, Phocis was forced to take the side
of the Persians, but fought against them at the battle
of Plataea (479 BC). The Phocians regained Delphi in
the Second Sacred War in 448 BC. They supported
Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) but
joined the Boeotian Confederacy c. 380 BC.
In 356 BC Phocis seized the temple at Delphi,
leading to the outbreak of the Third Sacred War.
The Phocian leader Philomelus was killed (354 BC),
and Onomarchus was defeated and killed by Philip II
of Macedonia in 352 BC. Phocis surrendered in 346
BC and was considerably weakened, with the Pho-
cian votes on the Amphictyonic Council transferred
to Philip II. Phocis fought against Philip II at the
battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC and against Antipater
in the Lamian War (323 BC). In 279 BC the Phocians
assisted in defending Thermopylae against the
invading Gauls, and again became subject to Mace-
donia. In 196 BC they belonged to the Aetolian Con-
federacy, and after its dissolution by the Romans in
189 BC, they formed a Phocian Confederacy that
lasted into the Roman period.
Phoenicia
An area largely equivalent to modern Lebanon (Map
8), Phoenicia (Phoinikia) became part of the Persian
Empire, but surrendered to Alexander the Great,
except for Tyre, which was captured after a long
siege (332 BC). The region was then fought over by
the Ptolemies and Seleucids. In 200 BC it was part of
the Seleucid kingdom of Antiochus III, forming part
of Coele-Syria. It later became part of the Roman
province of Syria.
Phrygia
A plateau region of Asia Minor, with Lycia and Pisidia
to the south, Mysia and Lydia to the west, and Gala-
tia and Lycaonia to the east (Map 11), Phrygia came
under the control of Lydia and then Persia. It was
later occupied by Alexander the Great (333 BC),
becoming part of the Seleucid Empire in 301 BC. The
area to the east of the Sangarius River fell to the
Gauls c. 275 BC and became Galatia, while western
Phrygia became part of the Pergamum Kingdom.
The northwest part of Asia Minor was sometimes
called Phrygia Minor or Hellespontine Phrygia. The
mountains were heavily forested.
Pisidia
An inland mountainous region of southern Asia
Minor, bounded by Phrygia, Lycaonia, Lycia and
Cilicia (Map 11), it was a lawless area that resisted
defeat by Lydia and Persia. Although it surrendered
to Alexander the Great, it remained effectively
independent.
Pontus
A region of northern Asia Minor including the
southern shore of the Black Sea (Map 11), Pontus
(Pontos, sea) was originally regarded as part of Cap-
padocia, later termed Pontic Cappadocia, then just
Pontus. In the 7th century BC Miletus established
colonies along the coast at Amisus and Sinope, which
established their own colonies. Pontus resisted
Seleucid domination in the Hellenistic period, and
Pharnaces I (186–169 BC) strove to expand the state
all around the Black Sea coast. Mithridates V became
the most powerful king in Asia Minor, and the king-
dom reached its greatest extent under Mithridates

VI. He came into conﬂict with the Romans, causing
three Mithridatic wars.
Scythia
The name Scythia (Skythia) was used by the Greeks
for the entire area between the Carpathians and the
Tanais (Don) River, extending as far as the Caspian
Sea (Map 8). Scythians were nomadic people of cen-
tral Asia, who traded with the Greek colonies of the
northern Black Sea coast. They were expert horse-
men, and with the use of mounted archers, they even
defeated a force under Alexander the Great’s general
Zopyrion c. 325 BC.
Sicily
This is the largest island in the Mediterranean with
9,830 sq mi (25,458 sq km) (Map 7). From c. 735 BC
there was extensive Greek colonization of the island,
beginning with Naxus and Syracuse (ﬁg. 4.8). The
western part of the island was controlled by Phoeni-
cians from Carthage. In the Archaic period Gela and
Syracuse dominated Sicily. In 480 BC Gelon and
Theron defeated the Carthaginians at Himera, and
in 474 BC an Etruscan ﬂeet was destroyed by Hieron
I off Cumae. Syracuse was now the greatest power in
the Greek world. The indigenous Sicel people had
been gradually displaced; in the 460s BC they unsuc-
cessfully rebelled under their Sicel leader Ducetius.
During the Peloponnesian War, Athens intervened
in Sicily against Syracuse, but its expedition of
415–413 BC ended in disastrous defeat.
Dionysius I of Syracuse (406–367 BC) undertook
four wars against the threatening Carthaginians. He
ultimately controlled most of the island, and became
the most powerful leader in the Greek world. On his
death there were dynastic struggles. Syracuse
appealed to Corinth for assistance against Dionysius
II, and Timoleon was sent in 345 BC to repair the sit-
uation. However, after Timoleon’s death, Agathocles
became tyrant (to 289 BC). In 278/276 BC Pyrrhus of
Epirus invaded Sicily, after which Hieron II estab-
lished control. Syracuse supported Carthage in the
First Punic War against Rome (264–241 BC), and
Sicily came under Roman control, becoming the ﬁrst
Roman province in 211 BC.
Sogdiana
This region of central Asia between the Jaxartes and
Oxus Rivers, forming part of Tajikistan and Uzbek-
istan (Map 8), was a satrapy in the Persian Empire,
and was conquered by Alexander the Great in
328/327 BC. He founded Alexandria Eschate (the
farthest) on the Jaxartes River. Sogdiana later became
part of the Seleucid Empire, but in the 3rd century
BC it became part of the independent state of Bactria.
Syria
In ancient times Syria did not reﬂect the borders of
modern Syria but was the whole fertile strip between
the eastern Mediterranean and the desert of north-
ern Arabia (Map 8). The Greeks often called it
Coele-Syria (literally, hollow Syria) to distinguish it
from “Syria between the Rivers” (Mesopotamia).
Within Syria the Phoenician cities of Byblus, Tyre

of the 6th century BC. The legend stands for Acragas. On

and Sidon were established (an area known as
Phoenicia), as well as the Greek trading stations of Al
Mina and Poseidium. Syria became a satrapy of the
Persian Empire c. 539 BC. In 332 BC Alexander the
Great conquered Syria. After the battle of Ipsus (301
BC), Syria was split between Seleucus I in the north
(Syria Seleucis) and Ptolemy I in the south (Coele-
Syria, with the name now being used for just the
southern region of Syria). Many cities were founded
in the north by the Seleucids, including their capital
Antioch by Daphne.
In Coele-Syria, the Ptolemies retained the exist-
ing system of local government. Syrian Wars were
fought over this area, and in 217 BC the Seleucid king
Antiochus III was defeated by Ptolemy IV at the bat-
tle of Raphia. In 200 BC Antiochus III won a victory
over Ptolemy V at the battle of Panion, and ﬁnally
took over Coele-Syria. Antiochus IV attempted to
hellenize Judaea (part of Coele-Syria), which led to it
becoming an independent state after an insurrection.
After his death other states in Syria achieved inde-
pendence, such as Ituraea and Commagene. In 83 BC
the Armenian king Tigranes I occupied Syria until it
was made a Roman province in 64/63 BC.
Thessaly
A region of northern Greece, south of Macedonia, east
of Epirus and bordering the Aegean Sea (Map 10),
Thessaly (Thessalia) was a tetrarchy, divided into four
regions: Thessaliotis, Hestiaeotis, Pelasgiotis and
Phthiotis. There were two large plains surrounded by
mountains. From the 7th century BC there was a
Thessalian Confederacy under an elected military
leader (tagos). During the 6th century BC Thessaly
became the major power in northern Greece,
although the people were regarded as backward. Dur-
ing the Persian Wars they supported the Persians. At
the end of the 5th century BC a powerful uniﬁed state
was created by the rulers of the city-state of Pherae.
Jason of Pherae (tyrant c. 385–370 BC) took control
of all Thessaly. He was succeeded by Alexander, but
most Thessalian cities refused to recognize him as
tagos. He came into conﬂict with Thebes, by whom
he was defeated. In the Third Sacred War, Thessaly
acted against Phocis, but Philip II of Macedonia
defeated Phocis and Pherae at the battle of the Cro-
cus Field in 352 BC. Thessaly then came under the
domination of Macedonia, for whom the Thessalian
cavalry became very important. In 196 BC the
Romans created a new Thessalian Confederacy
detached from Macedonia, and in 146 BC it became
part of the Roman province of Macedonia.
Thrace
Originally the area in the northern Balkans as far as the
Danube, Thrace (Thrakia) was later regarded as the
region of southeastern Bulgaria and European Turkey,
with a western border at the Nestus River (Map 8).
The inhabitants were Indo-Europeans but not Greek
in origin. From the 8th century BC the Aegean coastal
areas were extensively colonized by the Greeks, form-
ing independent city-states, but the interior was
untouched. In 513 BC a large part of Thrace became a
Persian satrapy until Xerxes retreated in 480 BC, when
a dynasty of kings from the Odrysae tribe ruled. In 342
BC, Philip II of Macedonia took over Thrace and
established Greek and Macedonian colonies. Lysi-
machus, a successor of Alexander the Great, recon-
quered the country and founded Lysimachia as a new
capital in 308 BC. In 297 BC Gauls invaded Thrace, but
were overthrown by the Thracians near the end of the
3rd century BC. In 201–200 BC Philip V of Macedonia
overthrew the Thracian tribal states and occupied the
Greek coastal cities. He was forced to retreat after
being defeated by the Romans in 197 BC. Antiochus III
then attempted to take Thrace. After the battle of
Pydna (168 BC), western Thrace became part of the
Roman territory of Macedonia, and the rest was ruled
by native kings until the Roman province of Thrace
was formed (AD 48).

PLACE-NAMES
Following is a list of major place-names in the Greek world (Maps 14–20). The ancient name by which the
place is usually known today is given ﬁrst, generally the later latinized or anglicized version. A transliteration
of the ancient Greek name is given next, if known. This is followed by the modern place-name, which is often
a transliteration of the modern Greek or Turkish. Many variant spellings are available for these transliterations,
such as Eleusis, Elefsis and Elevsis. In addition, many modern places have changed their name to the ancient
place-name in recent years. The ﬁnal column provides the name of the country (or island in the case of Sicily
and Crete) where the place is located.

Seas
The name Adriatic (Adrias) described the gulf sepa-
rating Italy and the Balkan Peninsula, including the
sea east of Sicily. The term Ionian Sea (Ionios) was
often used synonymously for the Adriatic, although
later it came to mean just the sea from western
Greece to Sicily and southern Italy. The Adriatic Sea
was also described as the Ionian Gulf. The Aegean
Sea (Aigaios pontos) was between Greece and Asia
Minor down to Crete (or down to Thera, according
to some ancient writers). The Euxine Sea was Pontos
Euxeinos, from euxeinos (hospitable), a euphemistic
name for the stormy Black Sea, which some authors
called axeinos (inhospitable). The Bosphorus (or
Bosporus) is a narrow strait joining the Euxine to the
Propontis. This was different from the Cimmerian
Bosphorus, which linked the Black Sea to the Sea of
Azov (Lake Maeotis, Maiotis). The name Mediter-
ranean is not found in ancient Greek times. The
early Greeks thought that a great river, the Ocean,
surrounded the world, and that all rivers ﬂowed from
this Ocean.

ECONOMY
AND INDUSTRY
The ancient Greek economy (from the Greek word
oikonomia, the management of a private household)
was primarily rural and agricultural from at least the
Bronze Age (when evidence is sparse). There was an
expanding economy and increasing trade that lasted
until the Dark Age disrupted this prosperity. From
the 8th to the 3rd centuries BC the Greek world
expanded greatly in geographical size, total popula-
tion and total wealth. With some states richer than
others and a large gap between the richest and poor-
est members of society, the expansion was uneven.
The people who had least were the slaves.
The growth of towns and cities also affected the
economy, encouraging crafts and trade. In many
states endemic warfare also stimulated an expansion
of the economy. Industry in the modern sense did
not exist. Most goods were produced by local crafts-
men, and industries were like large well-organized
crafts. Crafts were labor-intensive, often very skilled
and usually localized. Industries varied in their orga-
nization, from large-scale production for goods that
were traded extensively to very small-scale produc-
tion to meet local needs. Many of the population
would have been involved in food production in
some way. Although quantity of output may not have
been high, the quality of goods was often very high.
Very little is known of the working population.
Slaves undertook a variety of work, including that of
skilled craftsmen, but free citizens, metics and peri-
oeci might also have been craftsmen, perhaps work-
ing in small family businesses. It is thought that some
skilled craftsmen, such as construction workers on
large public buildings, traveled from job to job. A
large proportion of labor was slave labor, but with a
few exceptions, both slave labor and free labor were
engaged in the same occupations. Throughout the
Greek period there was extremely little technical
innovation that affected economic output, and labor-
saving devices were rarely introduced.
Agriculture
The varied landscape determined the location of
agriculture. The climate was similar to that of today.
The mountains of mainland Greece with prevailing
westerly winds caused the highest rainfall to be in
the west. Eastern Greece and the islands between
Greece and Turkey were relatively arid, but the west
coast of Turkey and nearby islands, such as Rhodes
and Samos, were less so. Rainfall was often in the
form of heavy downpours rather than steady light
rain, making agriculture difﬁcult, particularly cereal
growing. Eighty percent of the country was moun-
tainous, so agriculture was practiced in the plains and
the small pockets of lower land between the moun-
tains. Colonies were generally established in areas
with good agricultural land, especially for growing
grain. Agriculture was a major industry and was car-
ried out by the inhabitants of towns and cities, as well
as people living in isolated farms and villages. Market
gardening also appears to have been widespread. The
staple food was grain, wine and olive oil—not meat,
fish or dairy products. Communities usually prac-
ticed mixed agriculture, although occasionally there
was an emphasis on particular crops or animals.
CROP PRODUCTION
Grain was the most important crop, although the cli-
mate and terrain meant that yields were never very
great. Crops were not cultivated on behalf of city-
states, but by individual farmers on their own land,
and there were no public granaries. Wheat was often
imported, but never barley. Wheat (emmer and later
durum) and barley were cultivated, and sowing was
normally in the autumn, although some spring sow-
ing took place for fast-ripening crops or as an emer-
gency measure when the autumn sowing had not
taken place or had failed. Millet was also grown, and
from the Classical period oats and rye. A crop rota-
tion leaving land fallow for a year between crops
appears to have been practiced, especially in the drier
areas, allowing some fallow land to preserve mois-
ture. The fallow land was plowed several times in the
months before sowing took place. Seed grain was
sown by hand from a container such as a sack or bas-
ket, and the seed could be covered by hoeing.
Between sowing and harvesting some hoeing and
weeding took place. With the variations in land and
climate, there must have been great variations in the
yield of cereal crops.
Another important crop from Mycenaean times
was the vine. The grapes were mainly used for wine

5.1 Olive grove at the foot of Mt. Parnassus at Delphi
production, although some were eaten and some
appear to have been dried as raisins. Once a vineyard
was established, grapes were a perennial crop. The
vines were tended throughout the year with pruning
in winter and spring. Vines were either freestanding
or were supported by stakes or other trees. The
ground between the vines was often planted with
other crops such as barley or beans.
The third most important crop was olives (ﬁg. 5.1)
It is uncertain how olive trees were initially grown—
probably by cuttings and/or grafting. Olive trees live
for a long time, and once established they produce a
regular crop with relatively little effort. Old trees
could be rejuvenated by cutting them down and
allowing shoots from the stump to form a new tree.
Olive trees required pruning, but apparently not
annually, and the ground around them was tilled.
The olives were picked from autumn until early
spring (ﬁg. 5.2).
Various other fruit and nut trees were cultivated.
Apples, pears, plums, pomegranates, figs, almonds
and quinces were grown in orchards, but there is lit-
tle detailed evidence about their cultivation. Some
fruits such as ﬁgs, apples and pears were sometimes
dried to preserve them for storage. Nuts from wild
hazel, walnut and chestnut trees also seem to have
been harvested.
A variety of other crops were grown, such as peas,
beans, lentils, cabbage, onions, garlic, celery, cucum-
bers, lettuces, leeks, artichokes, carrots, pumpkins,

beets and turnips, but it is unclear whether they were
grown on a large scale or as market garden crops.
Herbs appear to have been gathered mainly from the
wild rather than cultivated in the garden.
PLOWING AND HOEING
Plowing was usually done with an ard, which was a
simple plow without a coulter or moldboard. It was
drawn by one or two draft animals, normally oxen,
but in Homer’s Iliad plowing with a team of mules is
mentioned. Such plows scratched a furrow, rather
than turned the soil over, and cross-plowing (plow-
ing a second time at right angles) would have been
needed to provide a good seed bed. There is evi-
dence that fields (particularly fallow fields) were
plowed several times to break up and air the topsoil
and to destroy weeds.
Land was also tilled using hoes, of which there
were several types, including two-pronged hoes and
broad-bladed hoes. Heavy hoes could be used
instead of, or in addition to, the plow to break up the
topsoil, while lighter hoes were for weeding and till-
ing after the crops had been sown. Little evidence
exists for the use of spades.
OTHER TOOLS
Tools such as saws, hammers, knives, sickles, reaping
hooks and bill hooks were also used in agriculture,
and various containers, particularly baskets, were
used in harvesting crops. As today, the division
between agricultural tools and general-purpose tools
is often difﬁcult to deﬁne.
HARVESTING
Grain was harvested with a sickle or reaping hook.
These were like curved knives, and it is sometimes
difficult to distinguish them from pruning knives.
Once cut, the crop was transported to a threshing
ﬂoor, a circular area with a hard surface, often care-
fully paved with stones and with a low raised rim.
The crop was threshed by being trampled by draft
animals to break the grain from the husks. Usually
the animals were hitched to a pole set in the center of
the threshing ﬂoor, around which they walked as the
crop was strewn under their hooves. The resulting
grain and chaff were separated by winnowing, using
a basket or shovel to throw the mixture into the
wind, so that the grain fell and the chaff blew away.
Other crops were harvested by hand, perhaps aided
by a knife.
ANIMAL HUSBANDRY
Ancient authors do not provide a great deal of infor-
mation about farm animals, and evidence from other
sources is also sparse. Goats and sheep appear to
have been common in many areas, providing milk,
cheese and meat. Sheep also provided wool. Pigs
were raised for their meat, and poultry provided
eggs. Horses were a luxury and a status symbol and
were used only in battle, for racing and sometimes for
transport. Oxen, donkeys and mules were bred as
draft and transport animals. Cattle were mainly used
for producing oxen and not for milk, since the Greeks
preferred milk and milk products derived from sheep
and goats. Bees were kept to provide honey, which
was also gathered from hives of wild bees.
Because of the varying terrain, some areas were
much more favorable to animal husbandry than others
with larger animals more commonly reared in the less
arid north and western parts of Greece. Sheep, goats
and, to a lesser extent, pigs were found almost every-
where. Thessaly and the Peloponnese were particu-
larly known for horses, oxen, sheep and goats, while
Euboea and Boeotia were noted for oxen, and Arcadia

for sheep and mules. Transhumance was practiced,
with herds of cattle and sheep exploiting mountain
pastures in summer and lowland pastures in winter,
although keeping to the boundaries of the polis so as
not to generate disputes between neighbors over
rights to pasture. However, there is little indication of
the extent to which transhumance was practiced, or
the areas in which it took place.
Sick animals were usually treated by the farmers,
but there were veterinarians (hippiatrikoi) who could
provide medical and surgical treatment to animals if
required.
Hunting
The meat element in the diet was supplemented by
hunting, but there is little evidence of its importance.
Hunting was also regarded as a sport and entertain-
ment, with apparently little or no restriction on who
could hunt and what animals could be hunted. Vari-
ous types of hunting are depicted in vase paintings
and are described by ancient authors. Packs of dogs,
nets, snares and bows and arrows were all used to
catch wild animals, including birds, hare, deer and
wild boar.
Fishing
Fish and other seafood were an important source of
food, and a great variety of fish were consumed,
especially by those in coastal communities, but ﬁsh
was never a staple of the diet. The majority of ﬁsh
eaten were from the sea; freshwater ﬁshing was rela-
tively unproductive, although Lake Copais in Boeo-
tia was known for its eels. Predictable shoals of ﬁsh
were not present in the Mediterranean, and so
catches could be haphazard. Because of the difﬁcul-
ties in keeping fish fresh, there was no wholesale
trade in fresh ﬁsh. Coastal ﬁshermen supplied only
their local markets. Some fish, particularly tunny,
was preserved by salting, drying and pickling, and
this preserved fish (opson) could be traded over a
wider area. Some ancient authors give the impression
that the Greeks were averse to ﬁsh, preferring roast
meat, but this probably reflects the fact that roast
joints of meat were a more expensive luxury.
Food Processing
MILLS AND BAKING
The milling of grain into ﬂour was initially a house-
hold occupation. Saddle querns were originally used.
Grain was placed on a flat quernstone and was
crushed by rubbing another stone back and forth over
it. Rotary querns and mills were later developed.
Rotary hand querns consisted of an upper concave
stone and a lower convex one. Grain was fed through
an aperture in the upper stone, which was simultane-
ously rotated. Although household milling and baking
continued throughout the Greek period, commercial
milling and baking were separate occupations by the
6th century BC. By the 2nd century BC these two
occupations had merged. Large rotary mills powered
by donkeys and mules became increasingly common.
To separate the ﬂour from the bran, the meal was
sieved. Flour that was ﬁnely sieved produced the best
quality bread; coarsely sieved or unsieved ﬂour pro-
duced lower-quality breads. The dough was kneaded
in troughs, and there are records of bakers taking
measures to prevent the slaves who were kneading
the dough from contaminating it. Baking was done
in simple ovens of ﬁred clay, supported on legs, leav-
ing room for a fire underneath. Various types of
bread (both leavened and unleavened), biscuits, cakes
and pastries were produced.
WINE PRODUCTION
Wine production was a major industry, giving rise to
an export trade throughout the Greek world. Much
of the grape harvest was used for wine. The grapes
were collected in large wickerwork baskets and were
either trodden in a vat or squeezed on a pressing
board. The latter was a ﬂat hard wood or stone sur-
face with a spout, on which an open basket or sack of
grapes was placed. This was trodden and squashed,
so that the grape juice was separated from the grape
skins and seeds; the grape juice ran down from the
spout and was collected in a container. Juice recov-
ered by treading made the best quality wine. More
juice was then removed by using a simple mechanical
press like that used for pressing olives. Juice from a
second pressing, mixed with water, produced an infe-
rior wine that was drunk only by the very poor.

The grape juice was fermented in large storage
jars (pithoi), and the resulting wine was transferred to
wine jars (amphorae). Perfumes and unguents were
added to some wines to make them more highly ﬂa-
vored and increase their price.
OLIVE OIL PRODUCTION
To produce olive oil the ﬂesh of the olives had to be
crushed without crushing the kernels, which would
give the oil a bitter taste. At some time during the
Greek period a mill was invented for crushing olives,
but it is not referred to by writers until the Roman
period, when it is called a trapetum. It consisted of a
large stone saucer with a central pillar, which sup-
ported the pivot for one or two millstones that could
be rolled around the saucer to crush the olives (ﬁg.
5.3). How olives were crushed before the invention
of this mill is unknown, although the use of a roller,
a mortar and pestle, or trampling with heavy shoes
are all possibilities.
After crushing, the olives were pressed to extract
the oil. This could be done by various means, such as
placing a heavy weight on bags or baskets of olives. A
simple mechanical press was also used, consisting of a
large wooden beam that was anchored at one end and
acted as a lever. Crushed olives were placed in a per-
meable container (possibly of cloth) on a hard surface
beneath the lever, and the other end of the lever was
forced downward to squash the container and its con-
tents. This was done by ropes and levers, or a screw
mechanism in Hellenistic times. The pressing was
usually done on a wooden or stone pressing bed, with
a channel and spout to collect the oil. Olive oil was
used for various purposes, including food, lighting
fuel, medicaments and skin oils. Olive oil was trans-
ported in skin containers or in amphorae.
Salt
Salt was obtained by evaporating sea water or water
from inland salt springs, since Greece has no
deposits of rock salt that can be mined. The salt
water was evaporated by the sun in shallow lagoons
and was collected from the resulting salt pan. Megara
specialized in salt production, and the best quality
salt was produced there, as well as in Crete and
Euboea. Salt appears to have been produced on the
coasts of many other states. In addition to being used
locally, it was traded inland to areas where salt pro-
duction was not possible. Salt was used largely for
preservation of foods.
Leather
Leather was produced from animal skins by a series
of processes known collectively as tanning. The exact
combination of processes depends on the type of
leather. The raw hides had to be treated to prevent
bacterial decay before they reached the tanyard. This
was usually done by salting, but sometimes hides
were merely sun dried, or they might be salted after
drying. At the tanyard the hides were soaked in a
solution, such as a mixture of urine and mulberry
leaves, to make them more receptive to the tanning
liquids and to loosen wool and hair, which were
removed by scraping off the top layer of the hide
(epidermis). Similarly, fat was scraped from the inner
surface of the skin to leave the corium or derma that
is made into leather. The hide was then tanned by
soaking in a solution of wood and bark or a solution
of alum and salt. A third method of tanning was
treating the hide with oil or fat.
After tanning, leather underwent various pro-
cesses, known collectively as finishing, to produce
leather of the desired color, texture and surface
appearance. Leather was an important material
throughout the Greek world, used for a wide range
of articles, such as saddles, shoes, harnesses, shields
and some clothing. Leather articles were decorated
in several ways. The leather could be cut into pat-
terned shapes, such as on openwork sandals. Patterns
5.3 A diagram of a trapetum (olive mill), with stone
saucer and two millstones

could also be made with stamps and punches to pro-
duce pierced or relief designs, and leather could be
colored by dyeing or painting. The supply of
cowhide in particular was limited, and all leather was
expensive. Parchment was also made from the skins
of cattle, sheep and goats (see chapter 7).
Textiles
Most textiles were produced by women in the home,
and spinning and weaving had signiﬁcant symbolic
meaning for women. One of the principal occupa-
tions of women was making clothes, blankets, spreads
and other cloths for the family, and this included
spinning the yarn and weaving it into cloth. How-
ever, some processes of textile manufacturing, such as
fulling, were carried out on a commercial basis by
men, and some textiles, such as cloaks, ﬁne fabrics
and cheap clothing for slaves, were produced com-
mercially as well. Miletus was well known for its tex-
tiles, especially high-quality wool, and Megara for the
production of cloaks.
Wool (erion) seems to have been the first fiber
used for textiles, and it was by far the most impor-
tant. Linen made from ﬂax is known from Linear B
tablets around 1200 BC in the southwest Pelopon-
nese, and it was of note in Ptolemaic Egypt. By the
time of Alexander the Great (and possibly as early as
the 5th century BC) silk garments and cocoons of raw
silk were being imported from the Far East. The
manufacture of cloth consisted of three basic pro-
cesses: ﬁber preparation, spinning and weaving.
FIBER PREPARATION
Raw wool sheared from the sheep was washed, and
then the matted ﬁbers were pulled apart and impuri-
ties removed by hand to produce a loose mass of
ﬁbers. Women did this over their knees with their
feet propped up on a footstool, using a semicircular
terra-cotta shield (epinetron) to protect their knees
and thighs.
Flax was harvested in high summer by pulling up
the complete ﬂax plant by hand. The ﬂax was retted
by soaking it in stagnant or slow-ﬂowing water for
about three weeks, after which it was dried, pounded
with a wooden mallet, and scutched. In scutching,
the ﬂax was bent over a narrow object and beaten
with a wooden sword to loosen and separate the
ﬁbers. The ﬁbers were combed (hackled) to remove
impurities.
Cultivated silk imported from the Far East was a
single fiber which did not need spinning. In the
Hellenistic period mulberry trees were planted on
the island of Cos, and wild silk was produced. It is
likely that this silk was in short lengths and would
have been spun, but otherwise no preparation was
needed.
SPINNING
Spinning was a labor-intensive occupation, but the
quality of the ﬁnished yarn could be almost equiva-
lent to modern machine-spun yarn. Spinning was
done with a spindle and a distaff, which was held in
the hand. In its simplest form, the distaff was a
forked stick supporting a mass of unspun fibers,
which was held in a woman’s or girl’s left hand. To
spin yarn, ﬁbers were drawn out from this mass and
twisted into a thread, which was tied to the top of the
spindle, which could have a hook for fastening. The
spindle (atraktos) was a tapering wooden or bone rod
up to 8 in (200 mm) long, thicker toward the lower
end to hold tight a spindle whorl (sphondylos). Spindle
whorls were of various materials, commonly stone,
bone or cut from a pottery sherd. They were circular
in shape with a hole through the center. They acted
as ﬂywheels to aid the rotation of the spindle. The
spindle was set spinning with the girl or woman
seated, standing or even walking, and fibers were
drawn out by hand to add to the lengthening thread.
When the spindle reached the ﬂoor, the thread was
wound onto it, and the process was repeated.
WEAVING
The warp-weighted vertical loom (ﬁg. 5.4) consisted
of two wooden uprights about 6.5 ft (2m) high, with a
horizontal cloth-beam across the top and a shed rod
farther down to separate even and odd-numbered
warp threads. This created the gap (shed) through
which the horizontal weft thread was passed. A hed-
dle-rod brought the odd-numbered warp threads
back and forth to alternate the shed, so that the weft
thread could be passed through as a single movement.
E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E
A N D T R A N S P O R T
191

The vertical warp threads were weighted with stone
or baked clay weights (loomweights). The loom was
not stood upright, but was leaned at an angle, perhaps
against a wall or a roof beam.
DYEING AND FULLING
It was more usual to dye unspun ﬁber than it was to
dye yarn or ﬁnished cloth. Vegetable dyes were com-
mon, but the highly prized and expensive purple dye
came from two species of sea snail ( purpura and
murex brandaris), which were native to the coasts of
Syria and Phoenicia. Yellow, also a popular color, was
derived from saffron and red from madder. Violet
could be obtained from an insect similar to the Mex-
ican cochineal insect. If dyed, ﬂax was usually done
after spinning, as yarn.
Cloth was finished by fulling, which involved
removing grease and dirt by treading it in a tub con-
taining a solution of natron (natural soda from a
deposit near Cairo in Egypt) or more commonly
decayed urine. Fulling was then completed with
fuller’s earth, and the cloth was subsequently washed
in clean water. Some cloth was ﬁnished by raising the
nap with teasels and cropping it with shears.
Woodworking
WOOD
Good timber was scarce in Greece, and most timber,
especially for shipbuilding, was imported. Wood-
working skills were highly developed, and specific
types of wood were deliberately selected for different
purposes. Wood was used in buildings (particularly
for roofs), fortiﬁcations, boats, ships, carts, pit props
and scaffolding. It was also used for smaller objects,
such as furniture, boxes, tools, weapons and decora-
tive carvings, including cult statues and figurines.
There is evidence that wood was widely used for
large sculptures and panel painting. Carved wooden
objects are known from the Mycenaean period, but
few survive from any period, although they were
probably widely used—wood only survives in partic-
ular conditions, such as in waterlogged deposits.
TOOLS
From the Iron Age the range of woodworking tools
was similar to the range of hand tools available today,
and a high standard of craftsmanship was attained.
What little is known of Bronze Age woodworking
tools suggests that the range of tools was similar, but
some would have been less effective and become
blunt more frequently than iron tools.
Frame saws were of various kinds, the simplest
being the bow saw. This had a saw blade ﬁxed to the
ends of a piece of wood that had been bent into a
semicircle, so that the stress in the wood kept the
saw blade taut. More commonly, an H-shaped
wooden frame was used; the saw blade was fixed
across the bottom of the “H,” while a cord was ﬁxed
across the top and was tightened to keep the saw
blade taut.
Axes, adzes and draw-knives were used for shap-
ing wood, and planes for smoothing wood are men-
tioned by ancient authors. Chisels and gouges were
used for the same purposes as they are used in mod-
ern carpentry and joinery. The lathe was probably
introduced in the Bronze Age, and was employed for
turning wood to produce objects such as parts of fur-

niture. Holes in wood were made by bow drills or
augers, and joinery techniques included mortise-
and-tenon and dovetail joints. Pieces of wood were
joined with wooden pegs, glue or iron nails.
Bone and Ivory
It is not known if specialist craftsmen made bone and
ivory objects. It is more likely that bone and ivory were
used as raw materials by a variety of craftsmen so that,
for example, ivory pins were made by jewelers. There
do not appear to have been any specialized tools used
in the working of bone and ivory, which was generally
cut, carved and shaped in a similar way to wood.
Animal bone was used for objects such as pins,
seals, beads and other jewelry, and a variety of small
tools and implements. It was also used for parts of
other articles, such as hinges, handles and inlays.
Pieces of boars’ tusks were used as a protective inlay
on some Bronze Age helmets (ﬁg. 3.7).
Ivory working was very skilled in Minoan and
Mycenaean times up to c. 1200 BC. In the later 8th
century BC ivory carving was again borrowed from
the Near East. Ivory was imported from Syria from
the Bronze Age, but after the conquests of Alexander
the Great much of it came from India. It was mainly
from elephants, though some came from hippopota-
muses. Ivory was used for figurines, as decorative
inlay for furniture and boxes (including plaques with
relief carvings), and in seals, jewelry, hinges, cosmetic
boxes, mirror handles, gaming pieces, combs, and a
variety of small tools and implements such as those
used with toiletries and cosmetics. Ivory was also
used in inlays to provide ﬂesh-colored parts of chry-
selephantine (gold and ivory) cult statues, and was
often combined with gold and silver. Ivory was some-
times tinted with colors.
Extractive Industries
QUARRIES
Most stone was quarried from opencast workings, but
occasionally it was mined in underground galleries,
especially good-quality stone such as in the marble
quarries on Paros (where a vein of special marble was
exploited by tunneling), the limestone quarries in
Syracuse and the selenite quarries in Spain. Early
quarries usually worked isolated rock outcrops, but
later quarries exploited specific types of stone for
their appearance and could be very deep. Quarrying
is known from the 7th century BC. Generally stone
was cut from the parent rock in rectangular blocks. A
piece of stone larger than the required block, but the
same shape, was marked out by a channel or groove
cut in the rock with a chisel. This groove was deep-
ened with a pick to the required depth, and the result-
ing block was broken away from the rock face with
wooden wedges. The wedges were ﬁtted into pre-
pared holes and saturated with water to make them
swell, thus splitting the block from the rock face.
Some rocks needed different techniques. Basalt
blocks, for example, were cut from the parent rock by
driving in iron wedges with heavy hammers rather
than using wooden wedges.
Some stones had natural planes of cleavage and
could be split, often into thin sheets. Other stones
could be cut with saws, sometimes using an iron saw
with teeth, but more often using a saw comprising a
“blade” of taut wire. The latter saw used sand as a
cutting agent: the sand was pressed into the cutting
groove by the wire, which was moved back and forth
to cut through the stone.
Limestone was the most common stone of the
Greek world. It was readily available in many areas,
and was used for buildings and sculpture. The gen-
eral term poros described limestone and other soft,
easily worked stones that were used in a similar way,
such as calcareous tufa. The most famous limestone
quarry was at Syracuse, which appears to have
yielded over 112 million tons of stone.
The Greek word marmaros was used for stones
that could take a high polish, including porphyry and
granite, as well as the various types of marble. Major
sources of marble were Mount Marpessa on Paros,
Mount Pentelicus, Mount Hymettus and Spilia in
Attica, and Naxos. Marble was also quarried at
Doliana near Tegea in the Peloponnese, and green
marble (actually porphyry) came from Croceae near
Gythium in the Peloponnese. Other sources of mar-
maros were the island of Chios, and Thebes in Egypt.
There were also various marble quarries in Asia
Minor that served the needs of the cities on the west
coast. Marmaros stone was generally chosen for the
E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E

color of its ﬁnished surface: Parian marble was a glis-
tening white, Naxian marble was gray and Hymettan
marble was gray or bluish gray. Pentelic marble had
traces of iron and acquired a golden patina as it
weathered.
Blocks of stone were transported from the quarry
to a stone yard near the building site for ﬁnal dress-
ing. The extra stone (apergon) left on the block
helped to protect it during transport to the stone-
yard. The architect appears to have been responsible
for ordering the stone from the quarry and ensuring
its suitability; there is evidence for blocks being
returned to quarries at Eleusis and Didyma because
they were not what had been ordered.
Blocks of stone were transported in wagons
drawn by teams of oxen, which was adequate for
blocks weighing up to about 12 tons. Column drums
above this weight were pulled by rolling. In Sicily
there is evidence that very heavy blocks had huge
wooden wheels built around them so that they too
could be rolled along.
MINES
Apart from a few mines for stone, most mining was
to exploit metal ores. Three types of mining were
used: placer, opencast and deep vein mining. The
general word for a mine or quarry was metallon.
Placer mining was the recovery of mineral grains
from alluvial deposits. Gold and silver were recov-
ered by this method in suitable rivers. Greasy sheep
ﬂeeces were pegged in the river, and heavier grains of
gold and silver stuck to the grease on the ﬂeece and
were recovered. Lighter materials were carried away
by the water.
The Greeks had no detailed knowledge of geol-
ogy, so they located sources of minerals by looking
for surface outcrops of suitable rock. It was then
exploited by opencast mining, usually in the form of
simple pits. Deep mining, following veins of miner-
als, probably developed from some opencast work-
ings. Opencast pits were often abandoned when the
ore was exhausted, but sometimes mine passages
(adits) were dug into a hillside to follow a vein of ore.
The technique of digging adits was also adopted as
an exploratory measure; if the adit failed to ﬁnd ore,
it was abandoned, but if ore was found, a gallery was
dug to remove it.
Where ore was known to be present, vertical
shafts could be dug to reach the vein of ore, and then
a gallery would be dug to exploit it. At Laurium in
Attica over 2,000 mine shafts are known, the deepest
being 390 ft (119 m). Here the shafts were square or
rectangular, averaging 6 ft by 4 ft (1.83 m by 1.22 m).
They were dug in stages until the ore was reached.
Holes in the sides of the shaft were apparently for
insertion of horizontal pieces of wood, which could
be climbed like a ladder.
At the bottom of the shaft, a gallery was dug to
remove the ore. Occasionally this would follow the
vein of ore exactly, but usually galleries were rectan-
gular, square or trapezoidal. The height of the gal-
leries was no more than 3 ft 4 in (1 m), and could be
as little as 2 ft (0.6 m), with a width of 2–3 ft (0.6–0.9
m). Shoring was not often necessary, but pit props
and lintels were used in some mines.
Tools used in mining included picks, hammers
and chisels for breaking up the rock. A kind of mat-
tock or shovel was used for raking up the rock after it
had been dislodged, and rock was collected in baskets
or other containers (fig. 5.5). Torches of resinous
wood, and stone and pottery lamps burning olive oil
were used for lighting. The ore appears to have been
removed from the workings by boys and was either
hauled up the shaft in containers or passed to the
surface by a chain of miners.
Most information about how mines were oper-
ated comes from the Laurium mines, which were
owned by the city-state of Athens, and it is usually
assumed that most or all mines were state owned.
The Laurium mines are estimated to have produced
around 20 tons of silver a year. The miners (met-
alleutai) were mainly slaves, who were leased to work
in often terrible conditions in the mines by their
owners (Athenian citizens and metics). These own-
ers received an obol for each day’s work by a slave.
Finds of skeletons with iron fetters on their legs
show that at least some miners were chained. A
workforce numbering around 11,000 people is esti-
mated to have been employed in silver production at
Laurium.
Although the approximate locations of some mines
are known from ancient authors, the Laurium mines
have provided the greatest amount of historical and
archaeological evidence. Silver was the main product
of the Laurium mines, although some of the lead (a

T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
194

byproduct of silver production) was also used, and to
a lesser extent copper and iron were also mined here.
Evidence of ore processing has been found in the area
immediately surrounding the mine shafts.
Stoneworking
Stone was used for a large number of purposes, par-
ticularly in public buildings (see chapter 6). It was
also used for objects such as statues, ﬁgurines, boxes,
lamps, vessels, altars, tombstones and other monu-
ments. Many different stones were used for their
decorative effects. Amber and various precious and
semiprecious stones were used in jewelry, for rings,
beads, pendants and inlays, and various stones were
used for making seals, many of which were mounted
as ﬁnger-rings. Limestone was predominantly used
in buildings and for carvings, as was marble, and all
were painted in bright colors.
Masons used a wide range of tools. Points,
punches and chisels were commonly employed in
sculpture, with the bow-drill for ﬁner details, such as
on seals. Small Bronze Age vessels were made by
chiseling and drilling the interior and hammering
the exterior, polishing with the abrasive emery or
sand. Large stone statues were probably ﬁrst mod-
eled in clay by master sculptors, and then copied in
stone by their assistants. See also MASONRY WALLS,
chapter 6.
Metalworking
Converting ores into metal involved several
processes, including smelting with charcoal in a ﬁre
or furnace. Smelting was usually undertaken as close
as possible to the mines, unless charcoal was unavail-
able nearby. Iron ore smelting required more sophis-
ticated techniques, using bowl furnaces and shaft
furnaces. Silver was obtained from lead by a further
process known as cupellation.
The smelted metals were poured into molds to
form ingots, which were transported to manufactur-
ing centers for the production of artifacts. In the
Bronze Age, distinctive “oxhide” ingots of copper (so-
called because of their shape) were traded throughout
the central and eastern Mediterranean and to Crete.
Some came from Cyprus, but the majority came from
elsewhere, possibly from Anatolia.
GOLD
Gold is the only metal that occurs in usable form in
reasonable quantities. It was extracted by crushing
the rock and washing the resultant powder in a
stream of water to separate the gold from impuri-
ties—similar to the collection of alluvial gold. Gold
is generally found as an alloy with silver or copper. If
silver formed a large proportion of the alloy, it was
regarded as electrum. Gold could be reﬁned by heat-
ing it with lead in a porous clay crucible. A current of
air across the top of the crucible oxidized the lead
and the impurities, which became attached to the
walls of the crucible, leaving a residue of gold or
electrum. This process was called cupellation, and
others separated silver from gold.
Most objects were made from sheet gold, which
was formed by hammering a gold ingot on an anvil.
Other techniques included ﬁligree—thin gold wire
for manufacturing decorative objects such as chains
and earrings. Occasionally, gold objects were cast.
Granulation involved globules of gold (or silver) sol-
dered onto jewelry. Jewelry was the main product of
gold, including necklaces, rings, signet rings,
bracelets, earrings, pendants and pins. Gold was also
used for death masks, wreaths, vessels, seal mounts,
and coins, as well as for gilding in the form of gold
leaf. Gold was used with ivory and silver (chrysele-
phantine) for cult statues. Decorative gold work was
particularly common at Mycenae in the Bronze Age,
and from the later 4th century BC in the Hellenistic
period, it became widely used due to exploitation of
the Thracian mines. Gold jewelry in particular
became common among the wealthy, with many new
shapes being manufactured.
SILVER
Silver was derived mainly from the ore galena, which
was crushed, washed and sieved. It was then roasted to
remove some of the sulphur content, and smelted to
produce a mixture of lead and silver. The silver could
then be puriﬁed by cupellation in the same way as
gold. Techniques of silver working are similar to those
used today. Silver could be hammered into shape, with
E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E
A N D T R A N S P O R T
195

all traces of hammering removed by polishing. Deco-
ration was done by repoussé work, engraving, granu-
lation, chasing and gilding, and niello inlay.
Silver was used for jewelry, wreaths and vessels,
and the same range of objects was probably made in
silver as in gold. Silver was also used for coins and
for some luxury tableware. As with gold, few large
objects have survived, because they tended to be
melted down.
BRONZE
Copper was obtained from smelting copper-bearing
ores, such as malachite, in a simple furnace. Copper
and tin were most commonly used together as the
alloy bronze. Tin is a relatively rare metal occurring
in the ore cassiterite and can also be recovered by
smelting the ore in a simple furnace. Bronze was
used for a diverse range of objects, including table-
ware, coins, weapons, figurines, statues, tripods,
cauldrons and jewelry.
Bronze was sometimes worked cold but was usu-
ally cast, lead being added to increase its fluidity.
Solid objects were cast in stone molds, and open ves-
sels were formed by casting in stone molds or by
hammering and shaping sheet bronze around a mold.
Early votive offerings were made by being cut from
bronze or copper sheet. Some early cult statues were
made of bronze plates fixed to or beaten over a
wooden core. Solid objects could also be made by
the lost-wax (cire perdue) method: A beeswax model
was covered in clay and fired, melting the wax;
molten bronze was poured into the hollow, and when
solidiﬁed, the clay was removed.
Later on, particularly from the 6th century BC,
larger hollow objects were made by core casting (hol-
low casting), similar to the lost-wax method. One
method was to make a rough shape in clay with a
sculpted wax model around it, which was covered with
clay. Bronze pins were inserted so that the clay core
remained in place after the wax was melted in the ﬁr-
ing. Molten bronze was poured into the gap left by the
wax. The outer clay mold was removed, sometimes in
pieces so that it could be reused as a piece mold. The
clay core could be left in place or removed through a
hole, which was then sealed with bronze. Very large
objects might be cast in several pieces in molds set in
pits, which were soldered or riveted together.
ENAMELING
Enamel is a vitreous material fused to a metallic sur-
face (mainly gold and electrum, occasionally silver)
as a means of decoration in various bright colors.
Areas of metal were cut out or cast as hollows, ﬁlled
with glass powder and heated so that the glass pow-
der fused with the metal to form enamel.
LEAD
Lead was mainly obtained as a byproduct of the
process of obtaining silver. Various objects were
made of lead, such as anchors, sheathing for ships’
timbers, joining materials in building, figurines,
cheap jewelry and weights.
IRON
Iron was obtained by smelting iron ore in a furnace.
Unlike the other metals used by the Greeks, iron did
not become molten at the temperatures achieved by
their furnaces. The result of smelting was a hard
spongy metallic mass that had to be repeatedly
forged (reheated and hammered while red-hot) in
order to turn it into a piece of metal.
Iron was worked by blacksmiths in forges with a
variety of tools. Anvils were roughly squared blocks
of iron. Most shaping and ﬁnishing of objects was
done with variously shaped hammers, and holes were
made with punches. Smithing was a common indus-
try, and many objects were produced, especially
tools, weapons and ﬁttings. Ancient authors refer to
specialist blacksmiths such as manufacturers of
spears, swords, knives and nails.
Jewelry Manufacture
The best quality jewelry was made from gold and sil-
ver, using precious and semiprecious stones, enamels
and glass for a variety of color and texture. Cheap
jewelry was made from bronze, iron and even lead. A
great range of jewelry was produced, including pins
and brooches for fastening clothing, rings, beads,
necklaces, bracelets, armbands, earrings, headbands
and diadems.
Most Greek jewelry was manufactured from sev-
eral parts made from sheet metal, wire and sometimes

cast metal pieces. A jeweler’s workshop had an open
charcoal ﬁre with some means of creating a forced
draft, such as a blowpipe or bellows. This heated
metal to the required temperature. There would also
be a metal or stone anvil, hammers, punches, stamps
and engraving tools, as well as formers for beating
sheet metal to shapes and molds for casting. Files,
abrasives and burnishing stones were used in the ﬁn-
ishing processes.
Sheet metal was made by a repeat process of ham-
mering an ingot ﬂat on the anvil, bringing it to a red
heat and then rapidly cooling it in water to stop it
from becoming brittle. Sheet metal was shaped by
being hammered over a former or into a mold, and
was decorated using punches and gravers. Wire was
made by hammering a thin strip of metal and rolling
it between two metal plates or two stones until it had
been reduced to the desired thickness. Jewelry work-
shops dating from the Mycenaean period have been
found. Some specialized in particular materials, such
as glass and gold.
Faience and Glass
Glass and faience are related materials using quartz
or silica. Faience consisted of crushed quartz or silica
grains covered with a layer of glaze, usually blue or
green in color. The basic paste was modeled by hand,
usually around a core that would burn away, or in
clay molds. Its use dates from c. 1900 BC in Crete
and a little later on the mainland. Faience was used
for various objects in the Bronze Age, including
beads, amulets, inlays, bowls, ﬁgurines, pendants and
vases (ﬁg. 9.10). In the Hellenistic period objects of
faience included vases and wine jugs with portraits of
Ptolemaic queens.
Initially glass in the form of ingots and glass prod-
ucts was imported into Greece, probably from Meso-
potamia and Egypt. There is a little evidence for
glassworking within Greece, and it is unclear how
much Greek glass resulted from local glassmaking and
glassworking, and how much was imported. Through-
out the Greek period, glass vessels were luxury items,
mainly because their production was a highly skilled
and slow process, and therefore costly. Glass vessels
were made by building up molten glass over a core, by
casting glass in a mold, or by grinding and carving
vessels from blocks of glass. Beads, seals and jewelry
were also made from glass. It was in use by c. 1450 BC
in Crete and on the mainland. The art of glassmaking
and faience was lost at the end of the Bronze Age, but
reappeared around the 6th century BC, when the
repertoire included ﬁgured vases of glass.
Pottery Manufacture
Pottery manufacture required clay, water, fuel, the
space for kilns and the ability to carry out a dirty,
smoky industry—usually well away from the town
center. Much pottery production was close to the
sources of clay, but at Corinth and Athens it took
place on the outskirts of both cities. Most clay in the
Mediterranean is not in its original position, but has
been moved by geological action, so this secondary
clay needed reﬁning. Clay (keramos) for pottery and
other terra-cotta objects was dug from selected
deposits and allowed to weather (ﬁg. 5.5). Clay may
then have been reﬁned by levigation or elutriation—
mixing it with water so that coarse particles sank and
organic debris ﬂoated and could be skimmed off. It
was then puddled (mixed and blended with temper
and water). Different mixes of clay and ﬁller (sand or
various sizes of crushed rock) were used for different

BC depicting the working of an ancient clay pit, possibly in
a ravine, with refreshment being lowered in the amphora

pottery vessels, with larger ﬁller added to strengthen
large and heavy-duty vessels.
The potter’s wheel began to be used in the Mid-
dle Minoan period, initially a slow wheel or turn-
table, so that the potter could now make a vessel on
a revolving platform, but soon after a fast potter’s
wheel was also introduced. The fast wheel appears to
have been a broad ﬂat wheel set near the ground,
with the potter sitting or squatting by it. The wheel
was kept spinning by an assistant. The later type of
fast wheel had a smaller potter’s wheel set on a spin-
dle attached to a ﬂywheel. This could be kept spin-
ning by being kicked by the potter. It appears to have
been introduced in the Hellenistic period. All tools
used in the manufacturing process were very simple.
Before the introduction of the wheel, all pottery
was hand made. This was done by pinching and
pulling a ball of clay into shape, forming the shape
from coils or slabs of clay and then smoothing the
sides to remove the ridges. Alternatively a slab of clay
was pounded over a pattern or former, such as an
inverted bowl. Even after the introduction of the fast
potter’s wheel, some pottery was still made by hand;
large pots in particular, such as storage jars, were built
up from coils or slabs of clay. Some intricately shaped
vessels, as well as decorative elements (such as animal
heads) for addition to vessels, were formed in molds.
Large, intricate pots were often made in pieces, such
as the neck and foot. These were later ﬁtted together
with clay, before being decorated and ﬁred.
Many pots were decorated using stamps or, when
dried fairly hard, by painting designs using clay slips
(solutions of ﬁne clay particles), which provided the
desired colors when the pot was ﬁred. See chapter 9
for pottery types and decoration.
After drying and decorating, pots were ﬁred in
kilns. Coarse-wares were sometimes ﬁred in simple
bonﬁre kilns, with the pots stacked and baked in a pit
under a bonfire. For most wares the single-flue
updraft kiln was used. The pots were stacked inverted
within an oval or circular chamber, supported on clay
ﬁre bars over the ﬁre. A stokehole or stoking tunnel
was on one side, and the hot gases rose from the ﬁre
around the pots and out a vent at the top of the kiln.
The kiln’s superstructure is uncertain, but some may
have had a temporary covering, and others a perma-
nent dome. The fuel was probably mainly wood,
including olive prunings, thorn bushes and other
brushwood, and the dry residue from olive oil pro-
duction could have been used.
Some potters may also have been traders, sailing
with their cargoes in the summer season. Not all pot-
tery was made on a commercial basis. Some would
have been made by members of a family to supply
domestic requirements, perhaps on an annual basis.
In smaller communities, potting may have been done
on a part-time basis, perhaps combining it with agri-
culture. Most potting seems to have been done by
men, although women may have carried out some of
the decoration. Except in one instance, only men are
shown in depictions of potting, and all known names of
potters are male. Little is known of potters from writ-
ten sources. Commercial pottery was made by special-
ist potters, some of whom may have been itinerant
workers, setting up a temporary production to supply
local needs, such as for the manufacture of roof tiles
or pithoi, and then moving to another community.
Most pottery was made at Athens, although much
of this was exported. It is estimated that only 1 percent
of pottery vessels has survived, and that millions of
black-ﬁgure and red-ﬁgure pots were manufactured.
Apart from pottery vessels, terra-cotta was used for
many other purposes, such as lamps, seals, relief sculp-
ture, ﬁgurines, statues, molds, model objects, votive
plaques, cult statues, cofﬁns and bathtubs.

TRADE OF GOODS
Raw materials and manufactured goods were pro-
duced both for the home market and for export over
varying distances. Trade was originally conducted as
a barter system, but goods could later be exchanged
for precious metals and eventually coinage. The sta-
tus of the land-owning aristocracy was high, but not
that of traders.
Bronze Age
Movement of goods between Bronze Age communi-
ties has traditionally been interpreted as commercial
trade. Since the earliest evidence consists only of
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E

movement of goods, the assumption that all or even
any were actually traded has been questioned. It is
quite possible that many items were transported for
reasons other than trade. For example, they may have
been carried as exchange goods for diplomatic pur-
poses, for bribes, as containers or for religious pur-
poses, and they may even reﬂect the actual movement
of peoples. However, the quantity and distribution of
some goods suggest that commercial trade was being
carried on at least as early as the First Palace Period,
and that the variety of goods and the area over which
they were traded increased from that time.
PREPALATIAL PERIOD
The distribution of various artifacts in the Aegean
area demonstrates that patterns of contact and
exchange were being established in the Prepalatial
Period. Professional merchants and traders are iden-
tifiable in Egypt by the 2nd millennium BC, and
traders could also have operated in Greece.
FIRST PALACE PERIOD
In this period there is evidence for patterns of
exchange in the Aegean involving the Cyclades and
the island of Aegina. These patterns suggest that cer-
tain sites, such as Kolonna on Aegina, acted as cen-
ters of exchange at the heart of a web of settlements
involved in exchanging goods. The various patterns
of exchange appear to have been largely independent
of each other, so that exchange of goods was usually
conﬁned within a pattern of settlements. Pottery was
the most frequently exchanged item, but probably
only certain categories of pottery. The pots were pri-
marily containers for the goods being exchanged.
Other items known to have been exchanged within
different exchange patterns include millstones
(thought to be of andesite from Aegina), silver, cop-
per and lead from Laurium, and tin, gold, ivory and
exotic stones from the Near East.
SECOND PALACE PERIOD
In this period Minoan influence throughout the
Aegean dominated exchange patterns. New centers
of wealth on the mainland also became involved, and
the Near East increased its involvement in the
Aegean area. There is also evidence for contacts else-
where in Europe at this time, with a general increase
of wealth in the Aegean area. The overall impression
is one of a widening pattern of exchange, and an
increase in the amount and variety of goods being
exchanged. Goods such as silver, lead and copper
from Laurium, and various items of bronze appear to
have circulated widely. Some ﬁne stones and metals,
including gold, seem to have originated in Laconia,
and gold, ivory and exotic stones came from the Near
East. Lapis lazuli from Asia and Egyptian alabaster
were brought to mainland Greece, and amber came
from Europe. Tin and copper were imported, possi-
bly from Anatolia. At least a portion of the goods
being exchanged seem to have been the subject of
commercial trade, particularly with the Near East.
THIRD PALACE PERIOD
Shipwreck cargoes of this period demonstrate the
very wide trading contacts. These cargoes consist of a
mixture of goods with various places of origin, such as
Egypt, Syria and Cyprus. Such a mixture of imported
goods is paralleled by ﬁnds from contemporary set-
tlement sites, and settlements in Cyprus and Syria
appear to have been centers of long-distance trade
within the Mediterranean area. Mycenaean pottery
was exported widely in the Dodecanese, Cyclades,
Near East, Sicily and other parts of the Mediter-
ranean. Some of it may have served as containers for
high-quality goods such as perfumed oil.
In the later 13th century BC trade in the Mediter-
ranean seems to have deteriorated. Trade continued
over a wide area, but not at the previous level. In par-
ticular, the eastward export of Mycenaean pottery
appears to have greatly diminished. The disruptions
at the end of the Bronze Age caused a collapse of
trading, and contact with settlements outside the
Aegean was lost or continued only intermittently.
Dark Age 
and Archaic Period
Little evidence for trade exists for the Dark Age, but
from the 8th century BC there are indications of a
gradual revival of trade. Greek colonies were founded

from the mid-8th century BC. Sites were usually cho-
sen for their ability to provide natural resources. As
colonies became established they often produced a
surplus that could be traded for other goods. Some
colonies acted as staging posts on a trade route, while
others acted as a focus for trade with their hinterland.
Greek city-states were also developing at this time.
Despite warfare between city-states, there is good evi-
dence that trade continued and probably increased.
In the second half of the 7th century BC increased
seafaring established contacts in the Black Sea area,
Egypt and on the north coast of Africa. The intro-
duction of coinage from the 6th century BC is likely
to have had a beneﬁcial effect on trade, and there
appears to have been a gradual increase of trade up to
the Classical period.
Classical and 
Hellenistic Periods
There is more evidence of trade from the Classical
period, with an impression of an overall increase in
trade and a greater diversity in the goods being
traded. Literary sources provide information mainly
about Athenian trade, but it is thought that most
others cities were similarly involved, although usu-
ally to a lesser extent. By the Hellenistic period, trade
had increased to such a level that some states
depended upon it. Merchants selling particular wares
were known by that product, such as cattle mer-
chants and leather merchants. Retail merchants of
this sort were called kapeloi, and entrepreneurs and
middlemen palinkapeloi. Merchants engaged in long-
distance trade were called emporoi (sing. emporos), and
trade was also carried out by shipowners (naukleroi).
A trading place was an emporion.
Trade Routes
Most cities of the Mediterranean world were on the
coast, and materials could be traded between them
fairly easily by sea, although in some cases it was
cheaper to transport goods overland. For example,
Thucydides records that before Decelea in Attica
was occupied by the Spartans in 413 BC, it was
cheaper to transport goods overland from Oropus to
Athens than to transport them by sea around Cape
Sounion. This was probably the situation with many
capes and headlands, where adverse winds could
cause considerable delays to merchant shipping and
so increase transport costs.
The sparse evidence suggests that Piraeus was the
busiest and most important of all the island and
mainland ports in the Classical period. Its predomi-
nance probably stemmed from the large amount of
grain that was imported through this port. Through
the hold it had on the Delian League, Athens came
to control the supply of imported grain and timber
for shipbuilding, thereby maintaining dominance
over other states.
The pattern of Greek trade routes was therefore
dominated by the need for imported grain, which
resulted in three main shipping routes—northeast to
the Black Sea, southeast to Crete, Cyprus and Egypt,
and west to southern Italy, Sicily and beyond. A
fourth main route, dominated by Corinth, was
through the Gulf of Corinth to ports in the Adriatic,
but it is uncertain whether the Adriatic was a major
trading destination. Other basic supplies, such as
metals and timber, were traded over long distances as
well, but local trade within Greece also used the
many coastal shipping routes.
In Hellenistic times trade routes to the east were
expanded. Again, these were largely shipping routes,
as land transport was still difﬁcult and expensive. The
major land routes were the two Silk Roads running
north and south of the region east of the Black Sea,
and shipping routes extended to the Red Sea, Persian
Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Trade with the coastal
cities of western Asia Minor ﬂourished, and in the 4th
century BC Rhodes became an important trading cen-
ter. Rhodes later declined and was ﬁnally eclipsed by
the establishment of Delos as a free port in 166 BC.
Increased contact led to continued development of
trade with Syria, the Middle East and beyond.
Containers
Particularly from the 6th century BC amphorae rather
than skins were used as all-purpose containers for
transporting liquid and semiliquid goods. These large
pottery jars were frequently used for transporting

E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E

olive oil and wine by sea, as well as other goods such
as olives, pitch, dried ﬁsh and a variety of preserved
and fresh foodstuffs. Different city-states made dif-
ferent shapes of amphorae, and even the amphorae of
a single state changed shape over a period of time.
Shipwreck cargoes often include a great variety of
amphora shapes, probably reﬂecting their different
origins and contents. Many amphorae were stamped
with control marks on their handles, including a
name in the genitive and the date. Stamped amphorae
were largely issued by Greek states that were impor-
tant wine producers, although some important pro-
ducers of oil may also have used stamped amphorae.
See also pp. 403–404 and ﬁg. 9.1.
Grain was generally transported in sacks. Barrels
do not appear to have been used as containers, possi-
bly because the scarcity of wood made them uneco-
nomic. At Piraeus, there would have been large
storerooms for the storage of imported wheat, and a
grain market was built in the time of Pericles.
Exports and Imports
Greece exported a number of commodities such as
olive oil and wine, as well as a range of manufactured
goods including pottery, furniture, weapons, per-
sonal ornaments and jewelry. The major imports
from farther afield were grain, timber, hides and
slaves, as well as ﬁsh and ﬁsh products, nuts, raisins,
ﬁgs, cheese and tallow. Raw materials, such as various
types of metal and stone, were also imported.
GRAIN
Grain (wheat) was the principal import of Athens
and many other states, usually transported in sacks.
While some states imported grain only when the
need arose, Athens appears to have become depen-
dent on such imports. Within Greece, the area
around Sparta and Messenia was very fertile, but did
not produce grain for export. Thessaly and Euboea
were important grain exporters, and Lemnos, Tha-
sos and Sciathus also exported grain. Other major
sources of grain were outside Greece, the main ones
being southern Russia near the Black Sea, Pontus on
the southern coast of the Black Sea, Thrace, Egypt,
southern Italy and Sicily. At times grain was also
exported from the west coast of Turkey and possibly
Cyprus. Rather than a major grain producer, Cyprus
was probably mainly an intermediate point on the
shipping route from Egypt.
Within the Athenian Empire, Athens kept a tight
control on the grain trade, laying down regulations
about who could trade in grain and who was allowed
to transport it. It was also essential for Athens and its
allies to maintain good relations with the Black Sea
region and to control the Aegean and Black Sea
approaches, in order to ensure the important grain
supply from this area. At times Athens exported grain
that it had imported. During the Peloponnesian
War, Athens attempted to intercept grain ships to the
Peloponnese, mainly from Egypt, Cyprus and Crete.
The vast majority of imported grain was wheat,
which was preferred but could not be efficiently
grown in many parts of Greece. Barley was not
imported, as it was regarded as inferior.
WINE
Wine was an important export from Greece. Many
Greek states produced wine, although not all had a
regular surplus for export, unless the harvest had been
good. The main exporters of wine included
Peparethus, Cos, Thasos, Mende, Rhodes, Cnidus,
Chios, Leucas, Lesbos, Corcyra and Paros. Thasos,
Rhodes, Cnidus, Paros and Chios used stamped
amphorae for exporting their wine, and the distribu-
tion of these amphorae adds to the evidence from
ancient literary sources about the wine trade. Wines
were traded within Greece; for example, wines such as
those from Thasos, Rhodes and Cnidus were exported
to Athens. Wines were also exported to places outside
Greece, the major destinations being southern Russia,
Egypt and Pontus.
OLIVE OIL
In Greece olive oil served as a food, fuel and lubricant,
and it was also used in place of soap. Olive oil was
exported in amphorae from various parts of Greece
including Attica. Miletus was also an important oil
producer. Although Athens generally exported oil,
there is some indication that oil was imported in some
periods of population growth when domestic demand
exceeded supply.

TIMBER
Timber, particularly that suitable for shipbuilding
and large structures such as temples, was in short
supply in Greece, and much had to be imported,
largely from places with a less Mediterranean climate
such as Macedonia. Numerous merchants were
engaged in the timber business. Various types of
wood were used in shipbuilding, including ﬁr, cedar,
pine, mulberry, elm and sometimes sycamore and
acacia. Oak or beech were often used for the keels of
warships. Cedar was imported from Crete, Cyprus,
Africa, Syria and Lebanon, and fir was imported
from Thessaly and Macedonia. Continuous efforts
were made to conciliate the Macedonian kings in
order to obtain supplies of Macedonian fir wood.
Pontus was a source of good pine wood, and various
woods were exported from western Turkey. Southern
Italy and Sicily also supplied ﬁr and pine. It is uncer-
tain how timber was transported, but it was probably
as deck cargo on merchant ships. Much woodland
was probably managed for local industries, with
charcoal and ﬁrewood being in constant demand.
FISH
Fish were often preserved by drying, salting, smok-
ing or pickling, which enabled them to be traded.
Fresh ﬁsh were only traded locally. Imports of pre-
served fish from Pontus were important, because
these provided good supplies of tunny and sturgeon.
The Black Sea coast of southern Russia was another
important exporter of preserved fish, and many
places in Greece itself were involved in this fish
trade. Miletus had a ﬂourishing ﬁshing industry, as
did many cities in the western Mediterranean, such
as Syracuse and Messana. Pickled fish were trans-
ported in pottery jars, and the trade in preserved ﬁsh
of all kinds was handled by wholesale ﬁsh merchants
called tarikhemporoi or tarikhegoi, who supplied
retailers called tarikhopolai.
HIDES
Hides were a major import into Greece where a
shortage of cattle made leather a scarce commodity.
The most important sources were southern Russia
and Cyrene. Hides were transported as deck cargo
on merchant ships.
STONE
Various types of marble were traded for decorative
use in building construction and for sculpture. White
marble from Paros was considered the best for sculp-
ture, and gray marble from Naxos was also of high
quality. The marble from Pentelicus in Attica was of
lesser quality, as was that from Hymettus. Marbles
from Thasos, Lesbos, Proconnesus and Carystus
were also used, as well as spotted and variegated mar-
ble from Chios. In the Classical period plain marbles
were generally used, but colored marbles became
popular in the Hellenistic period, particularly for
interior decoration. Because overland transport of
stone was so difficult and expensive, it was trans-
ported by sea wherever possible. Sometimes it was
more efﬁcient to open up a new quarry near a build-
ing than to transport stone from a distance. See also
quarries.
TEXTILES
Textiles were apparently an important item of trade,
but little detailed evidence is available because tex-
tiles rarely survive. Linen was made from imported
flax, which probably came from Egypt, western
Turkey and Colchis, although some may have come
from Macedonia and Thrace. Silk was introduced to
Greece before the conquests of Alexander the Great.
Cotton was probably unknown until the very end of
the Greek period. Wool was a common textile, as
sheep were common in mountainous districts within
Greece. It was also imported from western Turkey,
the Black Sea coast and Italy. Megara was famous for
the production of coarse garments for slaves, and Pel-
lene was famous for woollens (Pellene cloaks were
sometimes given as prizes at local games), but little
evidence exists for other exports of clothing. Miletus
was a wool market well known for fabrics and tapes-
tries used as wall hangings, and Amorgos was also
famous for fabrics. Carpets were imported from
Cyprus, and hemp ropes were probably imported
from the area north of the Black Sea.
METALS
The trade in various metals must have been very
important. Although there is some evidence for the
mining of metal ores and the production of metal

E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E
A N D T R A N S P O R T
203
artifacts, little is known about how metals were
traded. See also mines and metalworking.
POTTERY
Apart from amphorae and pottery vessels that were
used as containers to transport other goods, there was
some trade in pottery itself, usually high-quality ware,
ﬁnely decorated by the best artists. All the ﬁnest dec-
orated types of pottery appear to have been exported
at some time, but there is some controversy over the
nature of the pottery trade. Because many pottery
vessels were highly prized as works of art, doubt has
been cast on whether they were always objects of
commerce. When found at some distance from
Greece, they may have been used as diplomatic gifts,
tribute, bribes or they may even have been looted.
Another question has been raised concerning the
centers of pottery production, since some potters may
have traveled outside Greece making high-quality
wares. It would therefore be difﬁcult to distinguish
between exported pottery and that made locally by a
Greek potter. There seems little doubt, however, that
most ﬁne pottery was made in Greece and exported.
High-quality Greek pottery is found throughout the
Mediterranean world and in neighboring regions. It
is one of many imported luxury items found in
Scythian graves, and it is also found in Etruscan
tombs in Italy. See also chapter 9, POTTERY.
SLAVES
Slaves were an important commodity, providing
labor in many industries, as well as personal and pub-
lic servants. The main sources of slaves were captives
taken in war and piracy. In war, the victors might
enslave the defeated population, including women
and children, as well as the defeated army. Piracy is a
term that appears to have covered organized trading
in slaves who were kidnapped or captured in non-war
situations. Sometimes the difference between war-
fare and piracy is difﬁcult to distinguish. Children of
slaves were born into slavery, so providing another
supply of slaves, and some slaves were obtained from
unwanted newborn babies exposed to die. The exact
proportion of slaves that came from these three
sources is unknown. Ancient literary sources rarely
mention the slave trade, which left few recognizable
archaeological traces. It is known that a major slave
market existed at Ephesus for over 400 years. After
Delos became a free port in 166 BC, it became a
major transshipment center for slaves, who were
largely supplied by the pirate slave trade in southwest
Asia Minor.
COMMERCE
Wages
Evidence for wages in cash or kind during the Greek
period is sparse, and consists of records of particular
wages at a speciﬁc period. This makes it impossible
to see any trends in wages over time, and generaliza-
tions are difﬁcult. The ﬁrst evidence for payment—
to thetes, the poorest, landless citizens—occurs in
Homer. The surviving evidence only allows indica-
tions of wage levels. There is also little indication of
how the labor of slaves, who could be bought or
leased, and the labor of dependent tenants affected
the wages of free laborers.
In the late 5th century BC there was apparently no
distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. Each
workman received about 1 drachma a day, and an
assistant received 3 obols. Agricultural laborers
earned 4 obols and their food (valued at 2 obols).
In the 4th century BC wages seem to have risen.
At the beginning of the century the foreman of a
gang of bricklayers received 2 drachmas a day, while
at Delphi in the middle of the century, plasterers
were paid between 1 and 2 1⁄2 drachmas. Near the
end of the century, bricklayers, carpenters and plas-
terers at Eleusis received 2 1⁄2 drachmas, sawyers 2
drachmas and laborers 11⁄2 drachmas. Wages gradu-
ally became based on piecework rather than a daily
rate. At the beginning of the 4th century BC brick-
layers at Eleusis were paid at a rate of 12 to 15 drach-
mas per 1,000 bricks, but toward the end of the
century the price had risen to 17 drachmas per 1,000.
As might be expected there are indications that
professional services were paid at a higher rate. Physi-
cians, musicians, actors, hetaerae, the best teachers
and some highly rated artists received wages above
the average, but few precise ﬁgures are known.

The theorika were probably introduced by Peri-
cles. They were state allowances paid to poor Athen-
ian citizens to visit the theaters. Theoric magistrates
were in charge of its administration.
Taxation
In Crete taxes were apparently exacted during the
Minoan and Mycenaean periods, probably in the
form of produce and forced labor, but as yet the evi-
dence is unclear and has been disputed. There is little
other evidence for systematic tax collection before the
Archaic period. With the introduction of coinage and
increasing economic sophistication of the city-states,
taxes began to be levied on a regular basis. Although
some tyrants levied heavy taxes to pay for mercenary
troops, taxes appear to have been relatively light
before the Persian Wars (early 5th century BC).
In the Classical period taxation became the main
method of raising money in city-states. The majority
of evidence comes from Athens. Direct taxation on
citizens and regular taxes on their property were
regarded as degrading, although such taxes had been
levied by some of the tyrants. However, it was con-
sidered reasonable to tax noncitizens. Metics were
subject to an annual poll tax (metoikion) of 12 drach-
mas per man and 6 drachmas for a woman without a
working husband or son.
Food and goods sold in the market were subject to
a market tax, which fell heavily on metics. An excise
tax (eponia), effectively a sales tax, was levied on some
transactions, mainly those conducted in the agora.
The tax varied according to what was being sold. The
general level of this tax was around 1 percent of the
value of the goods, although some goods were taxed
more heavily. Evidence from other city-states shows
that taxes were also levied on foreigners trading in
the agora, on the right of unloading, on ﬁshing rights
and on anchorage. Cities often had gate tolls as well.
Brothel keepers paid an excise tax called pornikos telos.
Although direct taxation of citizens was not
approved of in Athens, some direct taxes did exist
One means of raising revenue at Athens was through
the liturgy (leitourgia), a burdensome public duty that
wealthier individual citizens discharged entirely at
their own expense. These public duties were numer-
ous and were associated particularly with festivals.
They included the choregia (khoregia: production of a
chorus at a drama festival), hippotrophia (maintaining a
horse for military purposes), arkhitheoria (leading a
state group to foreign festivals) and hestiasis (provid-
ing a public banquet for the tribe). The trierarchy
(acting as trierarch for a year) was a liturgy for naval
purposes. Originally a voluntary honor, by the early
4th century BC liturgies were effectively compulsory.
The eisphora was a direct property tax levied on
citizens and metics in times of emergency, such as
war. It was reformed in 378/377 BC, and a ﬁxed rate
was levied on all but the poorest class of citizens. The
tax was levied intermittently, apparently well into
Hellenistic times.
The epidosis was a voluntary contribution to state
revenues, particularly in time of war, usually follow-
ing an appeal for funds. Wealthy citizens felt it their
duty to contribute, and in the 5th century BC such
contributions seem to have been genuinely voluntary;
in the 4th century BC they were virtually compulsory.
In the Hellenistic period, with the establishment
of Empires by the successors of Alexander the Great,
tribute from cities and other political bodies within
the Empires became a major source of revenue. New
taxes were introduced, such as a tax on salt, which
was a government monopoly in both the Seleucid
and Ptolemaic Empires, and on other goods such as
leather, spices and perfumes. Within Greek cities
there was little change to the existing tax system
apart from the increased use of liturgies. The chore-
gia was replaced by the sitonia, which obliged rich
citizens to purchase grain for the city. When the city
was not rich enough for liturgies to operate prop-
erly, money for grain, olive oil and ﬁsh was raised by
subscriptions called epidoseis. Technically voluntary,
these subscriptions were effectively a compulsory tax.
Taxes were generally collected by tax farming.
The right to collect a tax was auctioned to the high-
est bidder. The state set the tax at a ﬁxed rate or a
percentage of the value of the contract. The amount
that the tax farmer managed to collect in addition to
what he paid in the auction and his expenses was
proﬁt. The system was open to corruption and abuse,
and tax farmers were generally feared and hated.
Customs
Because Greek states imported only the goods that
they needed but could not manufacture, customs

duties were not protectionist in the modern sense of
protecting home industries from rival imports. The
straightforward purpose of customs duties was to make
money for the state, and several Greek cities became
very rich from this source of income. Corinth bene-
ﬁted from its position on the isthmus by controlling
commerce between mainland Greece and the Pelo-
ponnese. Ports regularly exacted a toll on all incoming
goods, and some if not all cities apparently imposed a
tax on goods leaving the port as well as entering it.
Customs duties varied, but most commonly they
were about 2 percent of the value of the goods. This
was the case in Athens after the disastrous Sicilian
expedition of 413 BC. At this time the tax for allies of
Athens was 5 percent on their imports and exports,
replacing the tribute previously paid to Athens by
members of the Delian League. When Athens con-
trolled the Hellespont, a 10 percent tax on trafﬁc was
introduced in 410 BC, which was later abolished,
reimposed, and ﬁnally withdrawn in 386 BC. Under
Roman domination Delos became a possession of
Athens and a free port in 166 BC. It was a thriving
trading center for a century, but it declined after dev-
astation by pirates in 69 BC.
Markets
Retail goods were generally sold in markets and in
areas (quarters) of cities occupied by speciﬁc crafts-
men. In these city quarters, craftsmen lived and car-
ried on their business, and specialized quarters for
retailers such as honey sellers, cheese sellers and tan-
ners are known. Some craftsmen’s quarters were out-
side the city walls, such as the Kerameikos (potters’
quarter) outside the walls of Athens. Sometimes it is
difﬁcult to distinguish between a craftsman’s quarter
and a market, since in Athens and probably many
other cities specialized markets existed for different
commodities, including wine, olive oil, bedding,
cheese and even soft cheese. The agora evolved from
a meeting or assembly place to a market area, where
shops and temporary booths and tables were present.
Markets were probably not all held within the agora,
but ones in the agora were probably divided by spe-
ciality into separate spaces within the market area. In
many states ofﬁcials were elected by lot as overseers
of the market (agoranomoi). They kept order in the
market, collected market dues, and inspected the
quality and correct weight of goods on sale. In
Athens there were 10 agoranomoi, five for the city
itself and ﬁve for Piraeus.
In Athens and other large port cities, deigmata
(sing. deigma, literally “sample”) were specialized
market halls, set up by the state to enable foreign
merchants to display samples of their wares. This
was effectively a wholesale market where city mer-
chants could test samples of foreign goods before
buying them for resale. It is uncertain whether city
merchants could also display samples of their own
wares for foreign merchants to buy. However, it is
likely that foreign merchants generally purchased a
return cargo so that their ships did not return home
empty. At Athens it is thought that the deigma was
located in a part of Piraeus accessible to the sea.
Rural markets and fairs took place alongside reli-
gious festivals in the Hellenistic period, and probably
existed at an earlier date as well.
Weights and Measures
There was a variety of standards of weights and mea-
sures. Pheidon of Argos apparently ﬁxed the stan-
dard measures used by the Peloponnesians, and
Solon ﬁxed the Attic standards of weights and mea-
sures. Most measures of length were named after
parts of the human body, the basic unit being the
foot. The foot measure (hekatompedos) was men-
tioned by Homer, but its length is unknown. In his-
toric Greece there were many foot standards, such as
12.6 in (320 mm) at Olympia, 13.1 in (333 mm) at
Aegina and 12.9 in (330 mm) at Pergamum, while
the Attic standard was 11.6 in (295.7 mm). The main
units of measurement were:
2 ﬁngers (daktyloi) = 1 kondylos (middle joint of ﬁnger)
4 ﬁngers = 1 palaiste (palm)
12 ﬁngers = 1 spithame (span of all ﬁngers)
16 ﬁngers = 1 foot (pous)
18 ﬁngers = 1 pygme (short cubit, elbow to knuckles)
20 ﬁngers = 1 pygon (short cubit, elbow to ﬁrst joint)
24 ﬁngers = 1 pekhys (normal cubit, elbow to ﬁngertips)
2.5 feet = 1 bema (pace)
6 feet = 1 orgyia (fathom: stretch of both arms)
100 feet = 1 plethron (also used for “acre”)
600 feet = 1 stadion (stade)
30 stades = 1 parasanges (parasang, adopted from Persia)
E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E
A N D T R A N S P O R T
205

Area measurements were based on speeds of
plowing and sowing. A strip of land that could be
plowed by oxen in one day in Greece was a plethron.
One square plethron was 10,000 square feet.
There were dry and liquid measures of capacity or
volume. The smallest unit was a kyathos (about 0.08
pints, 0.4 liters), possibly originally a gourd. The
main measurements of capacity were:
1.5 kyathoi = 1 oxybathon
3 kyathoi = 1 hemikotylion
6 kyathoi = (in Attica) 1 kotyle (a kind of cup)
6 kyathoi = (elsewhere) 1 tryblion or hemina
Liquid measures continued as:
6 kotylai = 1 hemikhous
12 kotylai = 1 khous
12 khoes = 1 metretes
The metretes was the measure of the large wine
amphorae, containing 8 gallons 5 pints (38.88 liters).
Dry measures continued as:
4 kotylai = 1 khoinix (at Athens, one person’s daily
grain ration)
4 khoinikes = 1 hemiekton
8 khoinikes = 1 hekteus or modios
48 khoinikes = 1 medimnos
The Attic medimnos contained 11 gallons 4 pints
(51.84 liters), the Spartan 15 gallons 6.5 pints–17
gallons (71.16–77.88 liters).
Weighing was done using a balance scale (stath-
mos), in use from the Bronze Age. Actual weights in
the Bronze Age were usually ﬂattened stone or metal
cylinders, inscribed with a symbol denoting the
weight, and various weight standards were in use. In
historic times the main weight standards were Aegi-
netic (apparently introduced by Pheidon of Argos)
and Euboic (or Attic-Euboic), adopted in Attica and
Corinth. Many weight standards were used in the
various city-states, connected with gold, copper and
silver. Actual weights were usually square and of lead
or bronze, inscribed with a symbol denoting the
weight, and sometimes the name of the city and the
denomination. The most common Attic weights used
the astragal symbol (stater), dolphin (mina, Greek
mna), amphora (one-third stater) and tortoise (one-
quarter stater) (ﬁg. 5.6). See also COINAGE, below.
Trade between states was complicated by the
many weight standards used in different cities, which
also had to be correlated with the eastern system of
staters and minae. Solon adopted a system of weights
for coinage at Athens comprising 1 obol (12 measures
of barley, 0.72 gm), 1 drachma (6 obols, 4.31 gm), 1
mina (100 drachmae, 431 gm) and 1 talent (60 minae,
25.86 kg). In the Aeginetic standard, a talent was 83 lb
(37.8 kg). A talent represented a person’s load. The
stater was another common standard of weight.
Coinage
ARCHAIC
Early civilizations undertook trade by barter or
exchange based on units of value such as weighed sil-
ver. In Homer, money mainly took the form of axes.
Other metal objects were also used as currency, such
as tripods, cauldrons, nails and rings, while values of
objects could be expressed as, for example, oxen and
wine. Particularly well known is the use of currency
based on the iron cooking spit, obelos or obolos, about
3 ft (1 m) long. In Sparta, spits were the only permit-
ted currency until the 3rd century BC, long after
other states had introduced coinage. Coins were a
development from the use of objects, and were
minted with a regulated weight.
The first coins were probably minted in Lydia
from the mid-7th century BC and were ﬂat pebble-
shaped staters of electrum (a gold and silver alloy

found in Lydia and which the Greeks called white
gold). The ﬁrst ones had a grooved surface on one
side and an incuse punch mark on the other, and later
ones were of pure gold and of pure silver. The early
coins of Lydia were copied in mainland Greece and,
the islands, although silver coins were preferred, and
the spread of coinage was rapid. They were struck by
hand using two dies or a die and a punch, and initially
had an obverse design (with a symbol or badge of the
issuing city) and a deep punch mark on the reverse.
Aegina was probably the ﬁrst Greek state to mint
coins in the mid-6th century BC, with the badge of a
sea turtle (the city’s emblem) on one side and an
incuse punch mark on the other. Around the same
time one-sided coins were minted in Athens. The
ﬁrst Athenian coins used a diverse series of heraldic
devices, such as animals or objects like an amphora
or wheel, possibly all related to the particular person
responsible for issuing the coins. These one-sided
6th-century BC Athenian didrachms are termed Wap-
penmünzen (heraldic coins). From the late 6th cen-
tury BC Athens minted in huge quantities new
double-sided coins termed “owls,” which replaced
the one-sided coins. On the obverse was the hel-
meted head of Athena, and on the reverse the sacred
owl of Athena, the city’s name and an olive branch
(ﬁg. 5.7). These early owls, from 510 to 480 BC, are
termed unwreathed, as Athena’s helmet was not then
decorated by a laurel wreath. They had a wide distrib-
ution, from India to Spain. The tetradrachm
(tetradrakhmon) began to be struck, and the didrachm
(didrakhmon) was no longer regularly struck at Athens.
The ﬁrst coins of Corinth were much thinner and
appeared c. 575 BC; they were silver staters (stateres,
sing. stater), with the initial letter of Korinthos
(archaic koppa) and the winged horse Pegasus in low
relief. On the reverse the punch mark was a swastika
design. Toward the end of the 6th century BC they
became double-sided coins, with the head of Athena
in a Corinthian helmet on the reverse. These coins
were commonly called “colts.”
Minting spread rapidly throughout the Greek
world, including the city-states of Italy and Sicily, and
most city-states minted coins by 500 BC, though
adopting different weight standards. In northern
Greece silver was available from the many mines, and
coins were minted by many non-Greek peoples. They
were very large, such as the one-sided octodrachm
(eight-drachma piece) of the Macedonian Orrescii
tribe. Many designs related to the cult of Dionysus. In
Italy in the late 6th century BC, many colonies issued
coins that had a thin metal ﬂan or disk, with the main
design in relief on the obverse and the same design in
intaglio (incuse) on the other. This unusual method of
minting has been ascribed to Pythagoras, but no evi-
dence supports this theory. Examples include the bar-
ley ear on coins of Metapontum. The more normal
double-sided coins were adopted in Italy and Sicily.
CLASSICAL
Coins from the early 5th century to the late 4th cen-
tury BC were usually double sided, with the head of a
deity on one side and a related design on the other.
There were some very ﬁne designs throughout the
Greek states and colonies, particularly in Sicily. How-
ever, in cities like Aegina, Corinth and Athens, the
types (the design, indicating the origin of the coin)

changed little for centuries. Athens retained its archaic
design of the head of Athena (obverse) and owl
(reverse); with only small variations in design such as
the introduction of the laurel wreath to Athena’s hel-
met, this coin lasted to the Roman period. Most coins
had designs relating to a deity, either an oblique refer-
ence, such as a deity’s favorite animal, or the head or
ﬁgure of the deity (ﬁg 5.8). In the mid-5th century BC
in Aegina, the turtle was replaced by the tortoise. The
Spartans still did not use coins.
There was an increase in the production of small
change from c. 450 BC. For domestic use at Athens
there was a great range of denominations, and copper
coins known as chalkoi (khalkoi) were introduced in
the late 5th or early 4th century BC. Circa 449 BC
Athens issued a decree that Athenian coinage and
weights and measures should be adopted by all allies
within the Delian League, and that they should not
strike their own silver coins, although other coinage
continued to ﬂourish. In Macedonia the coinage of
individual cities ceased once they fell to Philip II. He
himself extensively issued silver tetradrachms with the
head of Zeus and a racehorse reverse, and also gold
staters with the head of Apollo and a chariot on the
reverse (ﬁg. 5.9). The gold staters found their way into
western Europe, and were even copied by the Celtic
coinage of Gaul and Britain in the 1st century BC.
HELLENISTIC
The coins of Alexander the Great had worldwide cir-
culation, and he adopted the Euboic-Attic standard
for both gold and silver. His coinage was minted in
gold, silver and bronze. Gold coins were primarily
staters, with the head of Athena on the obverse and
Nike on the reverse. The tetradrachm was the main
silver coin, with the head of Heracles on the obverse
(similar to the head of Alexander the Great), and an
enthroned Zeus on the reverse (ﬁg. 5.13). These were
minted in great quantities and became as widespread
as the old Athenian owls. Bronze coins had Heracles’
head and club and bow symbols. Alexander’s main
mints were in Macedonia, but mints were also estab-
lished to produce this uniform coinage throughout
his empire, at places such as Miletus, Tarsus, Side,
Cyprus and Babylon. In Egypt, bronze coins were
minted with the head of Alexander the Great. Coins
of Alexander were still produced after his death, until

the end of the 4th century BC, when his successors
began to produce their own individual coinage,
though many continued to be based on Alexander the
Great’s coin designs, and many depicted his portrait.
With the rise of Hellenistic kingdoms, coins were
rarely minted by individual city-states, but by much
larger regions, such as the Aetolian and Achaean Con-
federacies and kingdoms. Athens and Rhodes were the
only two major city-states to mint continuously to the
1st century BC. Only bronze coinage was produced by
individual city-states. The ﬁrst portraits of Alexander
appeared on coins after his death. Portraits of other
rulers also began to appear, such as Philip V and his
son Perseus on Macedonian silver tetradrachms. At
the end of the 4th century BC, portraits of rulers
appeared on Egyptian coins, initially of Ptolemy I, and
portraits of the deiﬁed royal family were also used,
particularly the veiled head of the deiﬁed Arsinoë II.
The numerous smaller Hellenistic kingdoms,
including those that broke away from the Seleucid
Empire (such as Bactria), produced coins with very
ﬁne regal portraits, especially on silver tetradrachms.
Greek-type coinage was gradually eliminated with
the expansion of Roman power, initially in Italy and
Sicily, then mainland Greece and Asia Minor.
COIN DENOMINATIONS
Early coin values were mainly of high denominations,
little better than ingots, and so were too large for
domestic usage. They may have been used when large
payments were needed, such as in trade between
rulers, and in payment for taxation and mercenaries.
Smaller denominations in the form of very small silver
coins gradually appeared, and in the 4th century BC
bronze and gold coins became more common. The
value of coins depended on the value of the metal
from which the coins were made. The ratio of silver to
gold was 1:13 in 6th-century BC Lydia and 1:10 in
Athens during the Peloponnesian War, while the ratio
of bronze to silver was 1:110 in the 5th century BC,
and 1:50–70 in the late 4th to late 3rd centuries BC.
Trade between states was complicated by the
many weight standards in different cities, which also
had to be correlated with the eastern system of
staters and minae. The two main standards were
Aeginetic (used from Thessaly to the Peloponnese)
and Euboic-Attic, the latter being more complex.
Units of money had the same names as units of
weight, because they denoted weights of metal.
Despite the differences in weight standards, the same
money values were used in the different city-states,
based on the obelos (iron spit). The values of coins
were not stated on the actual coins.
The smallest silver coin was the obol (obolos,
equivalent to one spit), and six obols constituted a
drachm(a); the name of the drachm (drakhme) was
apparently derived from drax (handful) of six iron
spits (obeloi)—as many spits as could be held in one
hand. In Sicily the drachma was not divided into six
obols, but ﬁve litras (litrai, sing. litra), (ﬁg. 5.10). An
obkia was an ounce, one-twelfth of the Sicilian
bronze litra. Large sums of money were represented
as weights in silver, sometimes gold. A talent (talen-
ton) was about 57 lb (26 kg) in the Euboic-Attic sys-
tem. The main Greek money values were:
12 chalkoi = 1 obol
6 obols = 1 drachma
1 stater= 2, sometimes 3, drachmas
100 drachmas = 1 mina (mna)
60 minas = 1 talent
Common coins included a two-drachma piece
(didrachm, fig. 5.11) and four-drachma piece (tetra-
drachm). Also known are a half-drachma (hemi-
drachm), three-drachma (tridrachm), five-drachma
(pentadrachm), eight-drachma (octodrachm), ten-
drachma (decadrachm), twelve-drachma (dodeka-
drachm), quarter-obol (tetartemorion—a very thin
coin), one-and-a-half tetartemorion (trihemite-
tartemorion), three-tetartemorion coin (tritarte-
morion), half-obol (hemiobol), one-and-a-half obols

coin (triobol), four-obol coin (terobol), three-onkia
coin (trias), two-litra coin (dilitron), and a half-litra
bronze coin (hemilitron).
MINTING
Coins were almost always struck with dies, never cast
in molds. A design (device or type, from the Greek
typos, meaning the impression of a blow) was
engraved on the obverse die, which was situated in a
recess on the anvil. A ﬂan or blank of the required
weight was heated and shaped to ﬁt the die. It was
placed on the die by tongs, and a short stout bar (a
punch) was hit by a hammer, which then struck the
blank on the die (ﬁg. 5.12). The coin received the
design in relief on the obverse and an incuse impres-
sion on the reverse. Although the coin may have been
uneven, it was of a precise weight. By the late 6th cen-
tury BC, the punch also carried the reverse die, so
double-sided coins could be produced. Dies were
usually of bronze or iron, and were cut in intaglio. A
variety of subjects was produced, and some die-
engravers were highly accomplished. Artists’ signa-
tures are found on some designs, especially those of
Italy and Sicily of the 5th and 4th centuries BC.
Most coinage was produced by the state rather
than privately. Each state usually appointed a magis-
trate for one year in charge of the mint, and his
name or monogram appeared on many of the later
coins (fig. 5.13). The presumed artists’ signatures
may possibly be those of the mint ofﬁcial. Overstrik-
ing is found, where new coins were struck on existing
coins—usually a foreign coin or one that had been
withdrawn, including coins of defeated enemies. Evi-
dence of the previous coin is often visible.

century in Acragas from the end of the 6th century BC.

Banking
Banking could not properly develop before the
invention of coins. At ﬁrst, temples such as that of
Artemis at Ephesus effectively had regional monop-
olies on banking, storing valuables and providing
loans. Between 433 and 427 BC the temple of Athena
at Athens lent the city-state finance at an interest
rate of 6 percent. In the Classical period much of the
banking trade was taken over by private individual
bankers (trapezitai), many of whom were money
changers, operating at temples and markets. Such
bankers were usually metics. In addition to changing
money, they held deposits and provided loans. Often
banking was an adjunct to other business. Pasion
(died 370 BC) was a famous banker in Athens who
also had a ﬂourishing shield manufacturing business.
Bankers took cash deposits, on which interest was
paid, and provided safekeeping for valuables, mainly
for merchants in foreign cities. Most citizens kept
their wealth hidden at home rather than at a bank.
Loans were made to individuals (but apparently not
to the state) for various commercial ventures, such as
mortgages, and as a form of shipping insurance called
bottomry loans. These loans had a high rate of inter-
est and were repayable only if the voyage was suc-
cessful, but not if the ship or cargo was lost through
accident. The terms of such loans were set out in a
written contract, and interest rates varied according
to the particular voyage. For example, in the 4th cen-
tury BC the interest on a bottomry loan for a voyage
from Byzantium to Athens was about 10–12 percent,
whereas from Athens to Pontus and back it was about
30 percent. There are a few recorded instances where
other types of insurance were provided by banks.
Money changing (conversion from one currency
to another) was a high-risk business, which appears
to be one of the reasons why money changers took
up banking, although banking also had its risks. A
panic among depositors could cause a run on a bank,
resulting in bankruptcy for the banker.
Despite the rise of individual bankers, temples
continued to operate as banks, some being controlled
by city-states. Some cities established public banks
which performed some of the functions of a private
bank, but primarily handled the money from the city’s
taxes and spent it in accordance with the city’s budget.
In Hellenistic times, temples, private banks and cities
continued their banking businesses with little change,
but in the region controlled by the Ptolemies a pub-
lic banking system was created. A network of royal
banks spread throughout Egypt, with a central bank
at Alexandria. Branches in outlying areas were leased
to private bankers under the control of the state bank.

Maps and Itineraries
Little evidence survives for ancient Greek maps, per-
haps because they may have been normally drawn on
perishable materials. The evidence suggests that they

were usually painted on wood but occasionally
engraved on bronze. The Greeks thought that the
ﬁrst mapmaker was a philosopher, Anaximander of
Miletus (c. 611–546 BC). Ancient authors record him
making a map of the known world, although their
descriptions do not provide an idea of its appearance.
It was drawn on a pinax (pl. pinakes), a term meaning
a painted panel and sometimes a bronze panel. Other
world maps are mentioned by authors such as
Herodotus, and it appears that many were circular,
with the land masses of Europe and Asia surrounded
by ocean. Greece seems to have been at the center of
these early maps, with Delphi at the center of Greece.
Delphi is near the center of the Greek mainland, but
more importantly it was the religious center and main
religious meeting place of the Greeks. Delphi
claimed to be the omphalos (navel) of the world.
The reference by Herodotus to maps implies that
when he was writing (c. 444–430 BC) maps were not
a rarity. The overall impression given by ancient his-
torical sources is that the position of countries
around Greece was known, and the approximate size
and shape of islands. Although the coasts of Europe,
Asia and Africa were known, the extent of these land
masses remained unknown, and there was generally
little detailed information about any particular place.
Alexander the Great regarded his expedition against
the Persians as not only a military campaign but also
an exploratory one. Before setting out, his secretaries
gathered all available information, and Alexander took
with him various scholars and technicians to record
new discoveries. It is not known if these people made
maps, but the group did include two “road measurers”
whose job was to record distances between places,
geography, soil, vegetation and wildlife.
Eratosthenes (c. 280–c. 194 BC) greatly improved
the potential accuracy of world maps by estimating
the circumference of the Earth, from which lines of
latitude and longitude could be calculated. He drew
his main axes of latitude and longitude to intersect at
Rhodes. Eratosthenes wrote On the Measurement of
the Earth and Geographica, neither of which have sur-
vived. He drew a map of the world that was pre-
sented to the Ptolemaic court of Egypt. This was the
ﬁrst properly scientiﬁc Greek map and greatly inﬂu-
enced world maps in succeeding centuries.
A periplus (a sailing round, pl. periploi) was the
name given to records of coastal voyages. These were
verbal instructions or textual records rather than
maps, and fragments have been preserved in the
works of ancient Greek and Roman authors. The
surviving fragments are from journeys of exploration
on the edges of the Greek world and so are probably
exceptional. Most sea journeys were coastal, or island
to island, with ships traveling from point to point
and generally keeping within sight of land. Most
periploi probably covered frequently traveled routes,
listing landmarks, distances and hazards.
Land Transport
The landscape of Greece and the poor state of the
roads did not encourage travel or transport by land.
Travelers by land often went on foot or horseback,
and pack animals were frequently used for carrying
loads. Horses were luxury items, status symbols
affordable only by the rich. Horses could not in any
case travel difﬁcult terrain as they were unshod, and
stirrups and saddles were unknown. Apart from
horses used for cavalry or in sports such as chariot
racing, a few were used for riding, but rarely for
transport. Porters were sometimes used for light
loads of around 50–60 lbs (23–27 kg) over very short
distances. Transport of goods by land was insigniﬁ-
cant in comparison with sea transport.
ROADS
Unlike the Romans the Greeks did not systematically
build networks of roads, but built for local needs only.
Most roads in ancient Greece were little more than
tracks or paths that followed the lay of the land. Very
occasionally, a rock face was cut back for a roadway,
but generally few traces of them survive. The road sur-
face was often the surface of the natural limestone, but
parts of a road might be paved where the underlying
rock was not suitable. Some stretches of paved road
have survived, particularly near important sites such as
Delphi, and some date to the Mycenaean period. River
beds could be used as roads in the dry season, as they
provided a naturally gravelled road surface, and river
gorges gave access through mountainous areas.
Some roads had cartwheel ruts, which may have
been worn into the rock surface by trafﬁc. Many ruts,
however, were deliberately cut in the surface of roads
to facilitate the passage of vehicles, although erosion
may have subsequently deepened them. Without the

E C O N O M Y,  T R A D E
A N D T R A N S P O R T
213
extra grip and stability provided by these ruts, it is
thought that many roads would have been impass-
able to wheeled trafﬁc. They are found particularly
on sloping grades and where the rock surface was
uneven. The average distance between wheel ruts is
4.6 ft (1.4 m), although there is some variation.
These roads appear to date from the Archaic period,
although some roads with wheel ruts may be Myce-
naean. The use and construction of this type of road
continued into the Roman period.
Some paved roads with wheel ruts were sacred
roads, usually leading from a city to a nearby reli-
gious sanctuary. They provided easy passage for pil-
grims, and were also processional ways. Many
processional ways followed routes believed to have
been taken by particular deities, and their main pur-
pose was for the vehicles carrying statues of gods and
other sacred objects that accompanied processions.
“Wagon roads” are occasionally mentioned in
ancient sources, presumably meaning all the roads
with cartwheel ruts. But such roads were in the
minority. Most roads were designed for pedestrians,
horses and pack animals, and were generally impass-
able for wheeled vehicles.
One particular road for which there is good evi-
dence is the diolkos across the Isthmus of Corinth.
This road ran from Schoinous on the Saronic Gulf
across the isthmus to the Gulf of Corinth. It was
built speciﬁcally for the transport on carts of ships
and cargoes, mainly merchant ships, across the Isth-
mus. Paved with stone slabs, it was 11.8–13.8 ft
(3.6–4.2 m) wide. It had two parallel ruts 4.9 ft (1.5
m) apart for the wheels of the vehicle that trans-
ported the ships. This road was built in the 6th cen-
tury BC and was still in use in the 9th century AD.
BRIDGES
Little is known about bridges, but it is assumed that
timber ones were used from an early date. Some
bridges with corbeled stone arches have been found
associated with Bronze Age roads. It is thought that
bridges with this type of construction continued in
use into the Classical period. Bridges supported on
stone pillars spanned by stone lintels were used from
the 5th century BC, and Hellenistic bridges were
sometimes supported on masonry piers designed to
disturb the ﬂow of water as little as possible. Some
bridges were constructed with removable wooden
roadways rather than permanent stone ones.
Masonry bridges using true arches, rather than lin-
tels or corbeling, do not seem to have been con-
structed until the Roman period.
MILESTONES
Very few milestones have survived, which no doubt
reﬂects the poor state of ancient Greek roads. Mile-
stones were probably never common. Even after
absorption into the Roman Empire, there were fewer
milestones in Greece than elsewhere. Milestones
appear to have been simple in form, inscribed with the
names of places and relevant distances. Hipparchus,
the son of Peisistratus, is recorded as having set up
herms in Attica marking the halfway point between
Athens and each surrounding village. It has been esti-
mated that there must have been around 100 of these
herms, although only one has been discovered.
PACK ANIMALS
Donkeys were probably the most common method
of transporting goods and could probably carry loads
of 220 lbs (100 kg). Mules (a cross between a male
donkey and a female horse) were hardier, stronger
and more sure-footed than horses, and could carry
loads of 198–441 lbs (90–200 kg). Both mules and
donkeys were also used for riding.
Loads could be secured onto a mule or donkey
with ropes, or a pack saddle could be used. Pack sad-
dles had a wooden frame covered with cloth or
leather to which the load could be secured. Panniers,
usually made of soft basketry, were probably often
used. They are shown in ancient artistic representa-
tions and are still used in parts of Greece today. Slings
to carry a pair of pottery jars or other vessels were
also common. Pack animals could cope with the
poorest of tracks and roads, and the majority of goods
transported by land were carried by pack animals.
WHEELED VEHICLES
The date of the introduction of chariots into Greece
is uncertain. They were probably introduced from
Syria and were used from at least the Mycenaean
period. Very few actual remains of chariots have sur-
vived, and most evidence comes from texts of ancient
authors and from artistic representations. Chariots

H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
214
were light vehicles with two spoked wheels, usually
drawn by a pair of horses (sometimes four) and
designed to travel fast. They carried only one or two
people, usually standing (ﬁg. 5.14), and were proba-
bly not greatly used for general transportation except
for short distances. They were mainly for warfare
and later for racing (see chapter 3).
Two-wheeled carts were for the transport of goods
too heavy or bulky for pack animals. Four-wheeled
wagons were for even heavier or more unwieldy
loads. Both types of vehicle were of relatively simple
wooden construction and had solid, spoked or cross-
bar wheels, also of wood. They were usually drawn by
a pair of mules or oxen, with a neck yoke and a har-
ness to keep the yoke in place. This type of harness is
more suitable for oxen than mules. It is very inefﬁ-
cient if used with horses as it tends to obstruct their
windpipes. The continued use of this type of harness
and the failure to develop a more efﬁcient type are
sometimes taken as a measure of the lack of impor-
tance of land transport in Greece. Both carts and
wagons were all-purpose vehicles and might carry
passengers or a variety of types of load (ﬁg. 5.15).
ROBBERS
Many inland areas, especially uplands, were infested
with robbers and brigands, and their activities were
condoned by some city-states, so travel by land beyond
the boundaries of city-states was always hazardous.
Shipping
TYPES OF MERCHANT SHIPS
Sailing ships were introduced to the Aegean around
2200–1950 BC, when they are first depicted on
Minoan seals. The ships would have sailed between
islands and would have revolutionized sea transport,
which was previously dependent on longboats.
Transport by sea was much more common than by
land. Little is known about merchant ships before
the 5th century BC, and even then the evidence is
sparse. There were undoubtedly various shapes and
sizes of merchant ships, but relatively little evidence
about their design has survived. Few ancient repre-
sentations of merchant ships exist, although evidence
has recently come from surveys and excavations of
shipwrecks. Unlike warships (see chapter 3), the
design of merchant ships does not appear to have
greatly changed during the Greek period, except that
later ships tended to be larger than earlier ones. Greek
merchant ships relied on sails for power. They usually
carried some oars, but there were generally not
enough oars or crew to move the ships much distance,
as the maximum space was needed for the cargo.
Sailing ships were known as strongyla ploia (sing.
strongylon ploion, round ships) or holkades (sing. holkas,

merchant ship). Holkas comes from a word meaning
“tow,” because these ships relied almost completely
on sails and were generally towed in and out of har-
bors. They were broad, deep vessels with a curved
prow, unlike the characteristic ram on warships. Also
unlike warships, they could carry large amounts of
cargo, maintain better stability in bad weather, and
continue sailing both day and night over long dis-
tances without intermediate stops. The few repre-
sentations depict merchant ships with differing deck
arrangements, but they all had decks and usually
some kind of housing on the deck. The earliest ships
appear to have had a single mast, but by the Roman
period two and three masts had been developed.
The merchant galley was a hybrid of the sailing
ship and warship. They were used to carry dispatches,
passengers and cargo, in particular, cargo needing
rapid transport. Ploia (sing. ploion, ship) was a general
term for merchant ships and merchant galleys. The
galleys were wider than warships and had a curved or
straight prow, although some had a prow similar to a
warship. Smaller galleys probably relied wholly on
oars, but larger ones relied more on sails, using oars
only when needed. There were many more merchant
ships than oared galleys, but the latter often had an
auxiliary role in warfare. There is therefore more
information about them in the texts of ancient authors,
who mention various types of galleys.
Merchant ships were not built for speed and could
be rather slow, but they were generally cheaper and
quicker than land transport. They could not make rea-
sonable progress without a following wind and could
be substantially affected by an adverse wind, making
journeys take three or four times longer than those
with favorable winds. If a contrary wind was met, a
sailing ship would set its sails as close to the wind as
possible and proceed by a zigzag course. Few people
in Classical Greece owned more than one ship. Most
were independent shipowners who sailed the one ship
that they owned, trading whatever was suitable.
SHIP CONSTRUCTION
A passage in Homer’s Odyssey describes Odysseus
building a ship on Calypso’s island and has been
interpreted as a reasonably accurate account of the
construction of a merchant ship, apparently con-
firmed by excavated shipwrecks. A hull-first (shell
sequence) of construction was used, in which the
watertight shell was built or partly built before the
internal timbers were inserted for support. Later
ships had a keel, but probably not earlier ships.
In shell construction the longitudinal planks
(strakes) were fastened to each other edge-to-edge by
mortise-and-tenon joints to form a complete hull or
shell. The mortises were cut into opposing edges of
planks, which were held together by tenons and ﬁxed
ﬁrmly in place by wooden pegs. The frames (ribs)
were then shaped and inserted in this hull. Each
frame was secured to the planking of the hull with
treenails, which were themselves held in place with
bronze spikes that were hammered into them. A lin-
ing of wooden planks was then nailed over the frames.
The hull was waterproofed by smearing the seams
and sometimes the entire exterior with pitch. Gener-
ally, little waterprooﬁng was necessary due to the
tightness of the mortise-and-tenon joints. The under-
water surface of the hull was then often sheathed in
lead as protection against marine worms, with thin
lead plates nailed over a tarred fabric layer. As mer-
chant ships were normally kept aﬂoat, not hauled
ashore, they would have been especially vulnerable to
worms without the lead sheathing. In some cases a
false timber keel was nailed onto the hull over the lead
sheathing, presumably to provide protection if the
ship was beached.
Most merchant ships apparently had a main deck
that ran from stem to stern. Larger ships probably
had a lower deck as well, but whether this was a full
or partial deck is unknown. A deckhouse at the stern
appears to have had a ﬂat roof, which could be used
as a raised afterdeck. The ships were steered by long
oars operated by a tiller.
SIZE OF SHIPS
Evidence for physical dimensions of ancient Greek
ships is rarely available, but records indicate the size
of cargoes. The smallest seagoing ships appear to
have been able to carry 70–80 tons of cargo, and from
the 5th century BC 100–150 tons were commonly car-
ried. Even at this early date cargoes of 350–500 tons
were not rare, although they were considered very
large. Hellenistic merchant ships were even larger,
and the largest recorded ship was built in the 3rd cen-
tury BC for Hieron II, king of Syracuse. It was so large

H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
216
that Archimedes was required to devise the method of
launching. This ship was apparently unique. It was a
massive grain carrier with three decks and three masts
and an estimated carrying capacity of 1,700–1,900
tons. The carrying capacity of a ship was only loosely
related to its physical size. A vessel designed to carry
bulky but relatively light types of cargo would obvi-
ously be much larger than one carrying the same
weight of denser material such as stone.
SAILS
Merchant ships had sails, rarely using oars because
far too many crew members would be needed for
rowing. The two types of sailing rigs were square rigs
and fore-and-aft rigs. With square rigs the mainsail
was a broad square sail on a single central mast, with
occasionally a topsail above. Some ships also had a
foremast with a square foresail. In representations of
ships the foremast is shown sloping forward rather
than upright. Some Hellenistic ships may also have
had a mizzenmast, with sails behind the mainmast.
Square rig was the usual method of rigging, with sails
at right angles to the axis of the hull, gaining full
power when the wind was directly astern.
With fore-and-aft rigs the sails were set in line
with the hull, which enabled the ship to tack and
therefore sail into the wind. Fore-and-aft rigs were
not commonly used until the medieval period.
Sails (histia, sing. histion) were usually made of
square and rectangular pieces of linen cloth sewn
together, the edges protected by a boltrope and the
corners reinforced by leather patches. Ropes were of
ﬂax, hemp, papyrus or esparto grass.
PASSENGERS AND CREW
Compared with warships, merchant ships had a rela-
tively small crew. The smallest ships might have only
three or four men, although larger ships would
require more. Unlike warships, crews on merchant
ships were often slaves. Late Greek and Roman
authors provide names for some types of men con-
trolling merchant ships. The most important was the
naukleros (shipowner or charterer). If the cargo
belonged to the naukleros, he or his representative
probably sailed with the ship. A professional captain
(kybernetes, literally “helmsman”) was hired to run
the ship, although occasionally the naukleros would
take the role of captain. The actual working of the
ship was carried out by sailors (nautai, sing. nautes).
No ships were speciﬁcally passenger ships. Any-
one wanting to travel by ship went to the harbor and
made inquiries, until they found a merchant ship
going to their required destination. Most ships were
designed for cargoes only and had little accommoda-
tion other than for the captain, although there were
sometimes a few cabins for important passengers,
such as the shipowner, and for those who could afford
them. Passengers (like most of the crew) generally
lived on deck or under tentlike shelters and ate food
they had brought with them. Water was generally
provided for passengers, who were allowed use of the
galley for cooking food. Only the humblest people
traveled without at least one servant. These servants
took turns using the galley to prepare food for their
masters. A small all-purpose boat was usually towed
behind the ship, but there were no lifeboats. Because
merchant galleys tended to travel close to the shore,
they were regarded as safer for passengers than the
ships that sailed across open water.
NAVIGATION
Throughout the Greek period navigation was by
observation of the sun and stars. Stars seem to have
been mostly used, and captains of ships presumably
had a good working knowledge of astronomy. They
must also have had a good knowledge of winds, since
in the Mediterranean winds blow from different
directions at various times of year, or in some places
at various times of day. This knowledge would have
been crucial for merchant shipping, which relied on
sail power.
It is likely that some charts existed, although none
have survived. For coastal navigation periploi provided
lists of landmarks, with distances, to assist a ship’s cap-
tain in plotting a course. The only instrument avail-
able as a navigational aid was a lead line, which was a
lead weight on the end of a line used to measure the
depth of water beneath the ship. Wax in a hollow on
the bottom of the lead weight could pick up material
from the seabed to give an idea of the ship’s position.
Because of the weather conditions in the Mediter-
ranean and the limitations of the vessels, sailing and
therefore trade took place only between four to six

months of the year. Sailing did continue in winter
months, but it was unwelcome, as was sailing by night.
RIVERBOATS
River transport was much less important than sea
transport within Greece, because of the lack of easily
navigable rivers. River transport increased in impor-
tance in the Hellenistic period when inland water-
ways, such as the Nile in Egypt, came under Greek
control. Indeed, most evidence for river craft relates
to those used on the Nile. All types of merchant gal-
leys were used on this waterway, and the smaller types
were probably used on other rivers. The Nile also
had a variety of river craft, ranging from canoes to the
large thalamegoi (cabin carriers), which were expen-
sive barges for transporting the nobility and ofﬁcials.
A particularly grandiose thalamegos was built by
Ptolemy IV and was effectively a ﬂoating palace. Sim-
ple small boats powered by paddles, oars or a single
sail, as well as boats and barges towed by other ves-
sels, were probably commonly used on many rivers.
HARBORS
It is assumed that early ships were beached when not
in use, propped upright with timber and stones. For
winter storage they might be covered with coarse
cloth or branches for protection from the weather.
Some possible Bronze Age harbor works have been
found in Crete, but the evidence is inconclusive.
Enclosed harbors began to be developed in
Greece from the 6th century BC. At this time a har-
bor at Samos was enclosed by a mole about 1,310 ft
(400 m) long, built out into water about 100 ft (30 m)
deep. Other harbors are not precisely dated, but
appear to have been developed during the 6th to 3rd
centuries BC. At Mytilene on Lesbos a citadel was
located on a peninsula that provided a natural harbor
on either side. A similar situation occurred at Cyzi-
cus and Smyrna. At Aegina harbors were formed by
building thick stone walls out from the shore, with
towers on the end to protect the harbor entrance.
On the north side of Piraeus was a large inlet, which
became the commercial harbor (Map 6), and at other
places, such as Syracuse, Nisaea or Cnidus, offshore
islands, reefs and projecting headlands were adapted
to form harbors.
In Hellenistic times many ports were expanded
and new ones created. In many cases, such as Alexan-
dria in Egypt, the port had been established before
the Greek period and continued in use through the
Roman and Byzantine periods to the present day. In
such cases the archaeological remains of Hellenistic
harbors are often inaccessible, and any remains are
often difﬁcult to interpret or date accurately.
LIGHTHOUSES
As early as the 5th century BC the harbor at Piraeus
was marked at night by ﬁres on columns, and beacon
towers were apparently used at other harbors. The
first true lighthouse was at Alexandria in Egypt.
Known as the Pharos, its name derives from the
island of Pharos in front of the harbor. It was appar-
ently begun under Ptolemy I in the late 3rd century
BC, and was a three-tiered polygonal structure about
328 ft (100 m) in overall height. The light was pro-
vided by a huge ﬁre in the base, which was said to be
reﬂected by mirrors (probably of burnished bronze)
at the top of the structure, which increased the
intensity of the light. The Pharos came to be
regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the World
and was the model for later Hellenistic and Roman
lighthouses.
Pirates
Piracy (leistes, the same word used for brigandage on
land) was endemic in the Greek world. In the works
of Homer, piracy is accepted as natural, and from the
Archaic period the distinction between acts of war
and acts of piracy was often not at all clear. Pirates not
only attacked shipping, but also sometimes attacked
coastal towns and operated as wreckers. A major part
of their occupation was kidnapping people for ran-
som. At various times Greek city-states with an inter-
est in protecting shipping and possessing a powerful
navy made attempts to suppress piracy, but piracy was
never completely eradicated. In the 5th century BC,
Athens with its triremes seems to have tried to sup-
press piracy and so assist trade, but with no evidence
that the enterprise was successful. Piracy certainly
continued, and in the Hellenistic period piracy was
rife, with a thriving slave market on Delos.

The attention of archaeologists and historians has
tended to focus on urban centers, particularly in the
Classical and Hellenistic periods, because of the large
amount of evidence readily available. Until recently
features of the countryside have been neglected. This
has resulted in much more information about urban
life than about rural settlements, although rural vil-
lages and farms must have been a constant feature of
the Greek landscape from the Bronze Age.
The surviving history of the Classical period is
dominated by the often hostile relations between the
major city-states (poleis). However, the poleis were
largely conﬁned to central and southern Greece, the
Aegean islands, Italy, Sicily and the colonies on the
west coast of Turkey. In other areas political and
social structures were not always based on the con-
cept of the polis, and many areas were effectively
nonurbanized. The polis was a city-state or citizen-
state, a political unit, with an urban center and sur-
rounding territory. The urban center (or even the
upper town) was the asty.
The terms “town” and “city” are used synony-
mously by most authors, and the two terms do not
necessarily imply different types of government or
reflect different sizes. The term town planning
(rather than city planning) is common usage.
TOWNS AND
THEIR PLANNING
A variety of settlements developed throughout the
very long history of the Greek world. These included
the palaces and associated settlements of the Minoan
and Mycenaean periods, the poleis and the colonies.
Alexander the Great and his successors founded a
large number of new towns. Numerous Classical and
Hellenistic towns continued to ﬂourish throughout
the Roman period.
Unplanned Towns
BRONZE AGE
Towns and cities originated in Mesopotamia many
centuries before they developed in Greece, but evi-
dence of Eastern inﬂuence on the development of
Greek towns and cities is minimal. Towns that were
not deliberately laid out to a pattern, but were the
product of unrestricted or partially restricted devel-
opment, had a variety of plans. Settlements recog-
nizable as towns are evident during the Bronze Age,
particularly on Crete and some other Aegean islands.
Bronze Age towns show a degree of controlled devel-
opment, with a fairly regular plan to the main streets
that divide the towns into blocks of buildings. The
impression is that the towns evolved and developed,
rather than being originally subject to a detailed
plan. The blocks of buildings were irregular and
were divided by alleyways, small open spaces and
squares. Some apparently had a public square as their
focus, some centered on an important building or a
citadel, and others appear to have been a ribbon
development, following a street line that served
much of the settlement. Buildings were separated by
a basic network of main streets and many small alley-
ways, which often provided routes for drainage chan-
nels as well. Buildings in these towns varied in size
and complexity, but generally had several rooms and
two ﬂoors. On the mainland it appears that towns
were often fortiﬁed, but evidence for this is lacking in
Crete.
DARK AGE
With the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, the
settlement pattern seems to have changed. Although
recent evidence suggests that the concentration of
population in towns was not as great during the later
Mycenaean period as was once thought, there still
seems to have been a move toward a less dense set-
tlement pattern during the Dark Age. Easily
defended hills were fortiﬁed and surrounded on the
lower slopes by scattered villages, some of which
later developed into towns and cities. Villages were
linked by a network of paths that became the basis
for city streets. They gradually developed into
unplanned towns with irregular streets and unre-
stricted development clustered around a citadel. A
good example of this type of development is Athens,
where sporadic settlement around the Acropolis
eventually resulted in a cramped and overcrowded
city, with irregular blocks of buildings divided by
narrow winding streets.

Synoecismus (synoikismos) was the amalgamation
of villages into a single city-state, which the Greeks
regarded as a single act or event. For example, the
synoecismus of Athens was allegedly performed by
Theseus. In reality such amalgamation of villages
took place over a considerable period of time. The
term syneocismus was also applied to the bringing
together of a rural population into a fortiﬁed town,
or the amalgamation of two cities by a superior force
(usually a Hellenistic king). In such cases the word
referred to the actual movement of the population.
Town Planning
ORIGINS
There is controversy over the origins of Greek town
planning, but there is no doubt that by the 5th cen-
tury BC town planning was firmly established in
Greece, and on mainland Greece there is evidence
for a grid layout in streets from the 6th century BC.
In the Near East, town planning occurred earlier and
despite the lack of direct evidence, the Near East was
probably the source of inspiration for town planning
in Greece. Greek colonization of the western coast
of Turkey began in the 11th century BC, and many of
the early towns established here were on elevated,
easily defended sites. Of these towns, Smyrna and
Miletus provide the earliest evidence for Greek
planned towns. After destruction by an earthquake at
the end of the 8th century BC, Smyrna was rebuilt
with a completely new layout. The peninsula on
which it was built was divided into strips by a system
of parallel streets. Little evidence for streets at right
angles has been discovered, but lanes and alleys most
likely provided access into and through the building
blocks, within which houses were generally free-
standing and aligned in the same direction. At the
north end of the town the existing public area was
enlarged to create a religious and civic zone. The
development at Smyrna took place over several cen-
turies; new fortiﬁcations were built near the end of
the 7th century BC, just before the town was sacked
by Alyattes in 600 BC.
At Miletus evidence of the early layout of the
town is fragmentary, but there seem to have been
deliberately planned districts with regular street
plans. The dating of these planned districts is
unclear, but their development may have begun
before the end of the 8th century BC. However, the
street plans of these different districts were not on
the same alignment, implying that the town was not
built to a uniﬁed plan at that date.
The imposition of town plans on existing settle-
ments could be carried out only during rebuilding
after destruction, as at Smyrna. However, increasing
colonization from the 8th century BC enabled town
planning to be more frequently used. Colonies were
generally laid out in an orderly way, but not all con-
formed to a preconceived pattern. The superimposi-
tion of plans on existing settlements was often based
on one or two main streets running across the site,
which formed the axis for new development, whereas
planned towns had one or more grids of streets
dividing the town into blocks or insulae. Paestum in
Italy is an example of the developed form of town
planning (ﬁg. 6.1). The colony was established in the
7th century BC, but the town planning probably
dates to the end of the 6th century BC. Here an east-
ern and a western residential area were separated by
an area for public use, containing temples (ﬁg. 8.13)
and civic buildings. The residential areas were
divided into parallel strips of land by three regularly
spaced avenues running east-west right across the
site. They were also divided by more than 30 regu-
larly spaced cross streets running north-south across
the site, creating insulae 115 by 984 ft (35 by 300 m).
Similar gridded town plans are found in many
colonies, and the use of a regular street grid and dif-
ferent zones for different functions became the most
important features of town planning.
CLASSICAL
While the political unit of the polis remained rela-
tively unchanged, the urban center continued to
develop. Town plans were not conﬁned to a particu-
lar system of planning but were adapted to each situ-
ation, and sometimes the opportunity for planning a
city was not adopted. For example, after Athens was
destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC, it was rebuilt on
the old irregular pattern rather than on a new
planned grid of streets. In the 5th and 4th centuries
BC there was a great increase in the number of cities
in Greece, most of which had regular plans.

Little is known about Greek town planners and
surveyors. It is likely that town planners were usually
architects, and they were probably responsible for
overseeing a number of surveyors who actually laid
out the pattern of the town on the chosen site. Con-
sidering the amount of work in which they would
have been involved, it is likely that there would have
been a large number of surveyors (geometrai, sing.
geometres; literally, “land measurer”). The Greeks
claimed they learned surveying from the Egyptians,
but it is likely they owed a debt as well to the Baby-
lonians. Their main instrument was the dioptra (a
measuring rod used for levelling and measuring
angles), but none has been found.
The ﬁrst recorded town planner was Hippodamus
of Miletus, who lived in the 5th century BC and has
come to dominate the history of Classical town plan-
ning. His native city of Miletus was destroyed by the
Persians in 494 BC, and the new city was rebuilt with
a grid layout. It was once thought that Hippodamus
invented this system of planning, but this has been
disproved, and it is unlikely that he was responsible
for the new layout of Miletus. Relatively little is
known about Hippodamus, and there is even contro-
versy over the planning of Piraeus. Aristotle states
that Piraeus was planned by Hippodamus, but there is
disagreement over the date when the city was laid
out. Hippodamus is deﬁnitely associated with only
three cities, Piraeus, Thurii and Rhodes, although it
has been conjectured that he was involved with the
planning of other cities. It is more likely that the sim-
ilarity between cities such as Miletus and those with
which Hippodamus was associated arose from his
knowledge of the new layout of Miletus.
Despite their plans being adapted to local needs,
cities of this period had certain common characteris-
tics, such as the division of the city into large areas
demarcated by wide main roads or avenues (plateiai).
These areas were subdivided by a grid system of nar-
row streets (stenopoi). In most grids the streets inter-
sected at right angles (orthogonal grids). In addition,
cities associated with Hippodamus display an inte-
grated design beyond the simple use of zoning, not
usually evident in other cities; different districts were
designated for speciﬁc purposes, such as commercial
districts, residential districts, public and religious

zones, and in the case of ports, harbor areas. Even
within districts there is evidence for an integrated
plan, such as the way public buildings were grouped
together. Hippodamus appears to have based his
plans on theoretical and mathematical principles, and
at Rhodes, at least, the plan was made up of square
areas of land of uniform and predetermined size. This
rigidly geometrical approach goes beyond the more
pragmatic methods of land division used elsewhere.
In the later Classical period, town planning con-
tinued to be based on a grid system, but remained
essentially functional. The ideas of Hippodamus do
not seem to have greatly inﬂuenced the plans of later
Classical cities. Town planning was not conﬁned to a
particular rigid system, and plans continued to be
adapted to meet local conditions (ﬁg. 6.2). The dis-
tance between avenues (plateiai) was reduced, and
often town plans were laid out to give insulae of
equal dimensions. One element that may have origi-
nated with Hippodamus was the attempt to use land-
scape for visual effect. In some cities built on sloping
terrain, public buildings were not merely situated in
commanding positions, but were positioned for
visual effect.
HELLENISTIC
The conquests of Alexander the Great transformed
Greece and the East. He and his successors founded
many cities as centers of control and administration
and as a means of spreading the Greek way of life.
The element of propaganda was also important and
not only were new cities founded, but established
cities were also transformed with new designs and
monumental architecture to provide visually impres-
sive townscapes. Deinocrates of Rhodes was Alexan-
der the Great’s architect, responsible for building the
new city of Alexandria in Egypt. Little else is known
about him; indeed, Deinocrates and Hippodamus are
the only two ancient Greek town planners whose
names are known.
Hellenistic town plans continued to use a grid sys-
tem as the quickest and most convenient method of
establishing a new city, which resulted in a greater
degree of uniformity in town plans. There was much
greater exploitation of topography and careful placing
of monumental buildings to produce an impressive
city landscape. The most spectacular example was
Pergamum in Turkey, which was greatly expanded
from the time of Eumenes II (early 2nd century BC).
Situated on the summit of a steep hill (ﬁg. 4.7), com-
plex and extensive terraces were needed to accommo-
date the city. The result was a uniﬁed plan of
buildings, rising in tiers, that was visually extremely
impressive. Pergamum is often regarded as the high
point of Hellenistic town planning.
PALACES
Bronze Age
In Bronze Age Crete, sites that have been identiﬁed
as “palaces” were built from the end of the 3rd mil-
lennium BC. The term “palace” has been used indis-
criminately to describe both large establishments and
also buildings that might be better described as
“mansions” or “villas.” The term palace is now gen-
erally used for very large sites, giving rise to what has
been called the “palace economy.” Palaces appear to
have been at the center of an economic and adminis-
trative system that was at ﬁrst local but eventually
extended beyond Crete. These palaces were at the
heart of towns and were often repeatedly rebuilt on
the same site, making them difficult to interpret.
Although palaces were administrative centers, the
identification of the administrators is uncertain.
Some palaces’ were originally assumed to be the
royal residence of possible kings, but as yet no evi-
dence supports this.
FIRST PALACE PERIOD
Palaces of this period are known at Knossos, Mallia,
Phaistos and Chania, all built around a central court-
yard. The best preserved example is Phaistos, which
had a monumental paved courtyard crossed by raised
walkways and ﬂanked on the north by stepped stone
benches. The courtyard was surrounded on other
sides by buildings, beyond which there were other
paved courts.
SECOND PALACE PERIOD
Palaces of this period provide more evidence for
their structure and layout. The largest was at Knossos

and covered approximately 15,550 sq yds (13,000 sq
m). A central courtyard was again a major feature,
surrounded by a continuous range of buildings and
with a courtyard to the west. The ground ﬂoor of the
west wing was used for storage (fig. 6.3), and the
remains of the upper floor show that there were
more imposing rooms above. Other important
rooms opened off the west and north sides of the
courtyard, and to the south the building may have
had three or four ﬂoors.
The construction of the building was high quality,
with carefully dressed stone used for foundations.
The walls were strengthened by timber beams. Many
walls were faced with large sheets of gypsum or were
ﬁnished with plaster, and they were often decorated
with elaborate frescoes. Other architectural features
included the use of light wells and monumental stair-
ways, frequent use of supporting pillars, and multiple
doorways to form partitions. In a chamber off the
“Queen’s Megaron” was a bathroom and toilet, and
the site was drained by channels and baked clay
pipes. Some clay pipes possibly supplied water to the
site. The building produced evidence for religious
and ceremonial functions, but the use of many rooms
is purely conjectural.
The other palace sites of this period, such as at
Phaistos and Mallia, were generally similar to Knos-
sos, but differed in architectural detail and were not
quite so magniﬁcent. The palace at Zakros differed
most from that at Knossos. It had a central court-
yard, but none to the west, and evidence for upper
ﬂoors is sparse. It also seems to have been separated
from the surrounding town by a wall. Around the
palaces (particularly Knossos) were other buildings
of a much smaller scale, but showing the same archi-
tectural quality.
Later writers located the legendary labyrinth (the
maze-like building made by Daedalus for King
Minos of Crete) at Knossos or at Gortyn, and it has
sometimes been suggested that this identification
was inspired by the complicated ruins of Knossos.
Other possible connections with later legend include
the use of the bull motif (echoing the half-man, half-
bull Minotaur) and paintings of young men and
women leaping over the horns of charging bulls.
Although many objects and painted scenes from
Knossos and other Minoan sites are believed to be of
religious significance, virtually nothing is certain
about Minnan religion or its place within the palace

oil and grain. Lead-lined stone chests set in the ﬂoor held
more valuable goods.

sites. What does seem certain is that the palaces con-
trolled production of manufactured goods and food,
and there was sufﬁcient wealth for the production of
luxury goods as well.
THIRD PALACE PERIOD
Palaces of this period continued on Crete, and are
also found on mainland Greece at such places as
Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos. They are Mycenaean
rather than Minoan, but like the Minoan palaces,
they were surrounded by towns. Much smaller than
the palaces on Crete, Tiryns is 76.5 by 65.6 yds (70
by 60 m), and Pylos is only 59 by 32.8 yds (54 by 30
m), which is about the same size as the central court-
yard at Knossos. The main element of these palaces
was the megaron (pl. megara), a large hall, often with
a central hearth. It was entered from a smaller room
or vestibule, which was itself entered from a porch.
All three rooms shared the same side walls. This sim-
ple building unit often formed the basic structure of
temples, and it has been identiﬁed as an element of
other Greek buildings, from the later palace at Knos-
sos to a Hellenistic town house at Priene.
While some of these identifications may be cor-
rect, the form of the megaron is so simple that it is
relatively easy to discern approximations to it
within many complicated building plans. The
megaron halls in Mycenaean palaces measured
about 14.4 sq yds (12 sq m) and had a central hearth
and four columns to support the roof. Those at
Pylos and Tiryns had a base for a throne. The porch
of the megaron opened onto a courtyard, which was
surrounded by a portico with wooden columns at
Tiryns. Despite differences in architectural detail,
the approach to the megaron in all these palaces was
designed to be impressive.
The best-preserved palaces at Tiryns, Pylos and
Mycenae had elaborate frescoes and stuccoed and
painted ﬂoors. Wall foundations consisted of well-
laid rubble set in clay, and walls were built of mud
brick or rubble strengthened with timber beams.
The buildings may have had two or three ﬂoors. As
with Minoan palaces, the Mycenaean ones were
administrative centers. In addition to providing evi-
dence for storage rooms, Linear B clay tablets also
give an idea of the control of some industries and of
various classes of workers.
Hellenistic
Although a few tyrants are known to have built palaces
for themselves while they held power, palaces were not
commonly used again until the Hellenistic period, as in
Macedonia and at Alexandria under the Ptolemies.
Evidence for the palaces of Hellenistic rulers is lim-
ited, because only plans of the buildings have survived
in the few excavated examples. These palaces were rel-
atively simple, with rooms arranged around one or
more courtyards. They are similar in plan to houses of
the period, and it is only their size and the remains of
rich decorative features that distinguish them from
houses of the wealthy. They contained rooms for
feasting, as well as administrative areas.
RURAL
SETTLEMENTS
Until recently towns and cities have been the focus of
study by historians and archaeologists. Relatively lit-
tle is therefore known about settlements in the coun-
tryside. Surveys have revealed the existence of many
villages, country houses and farmsteads, but few have
been studied in detail, even though they must have
performed an important function.
Villages
Surveys and excavations of Bronze Age sites in Crete
suggest that there were a few large settlements with
estimated populations of several hundred people, and
many more small villages with populations of proba-
bly less than 100 people. The economy was essen-
tially agricultural, and these villages would have
played an important part in food production. Many
inhabitants of the larger settlements were probably
also engaged in farming. Surveys elsewhere in Greece
suggest that this settlement pattern was prevalent
during the Bronze Age, but at present there is insuf-
ﬁcient evidence to present a coherent picture.
The situation regarding Archaic and later villages
is to some extent less clear. Villages are mentioned by

some ancient authors, and the impression is of towns
and cities surrounded by a network of villages, with
farming carried on by people from both the villages
and towns. Surveys have located village sites, but
very few have undergone even partial excavation.
Many other village sites appear to lie beneath mod-
ern villages, so that opportunities for investigation
are greatly reduced.
Country Houses and Farms
BRONZE AGE
During the Bronze Age on Crete there were a num-
ber of large structures that have sometimes been
called “villas,” because they were thought to be a
type of country house for the wealthy. But recent
work has provided evidence for settlements associ-
ated with some of these sites, so their exact status
and function are unclear. These “villas” often have
high-quality architecture with features such as fres-
coes and rooms for storage and ceremonies, which
demonstrates close similarities with palace sites.
They appear to have been high-status residences;
they were possibly local administrative centers rather
than country houses for wealthy individuals. How-
ever, these two functions are not incompatible, and
the sites may also have served as religious centers or
performed other functions. These sites do not seem
to have been used during the Third Palace Period,
and there are no similar contemporary sites on main-
land Greece.
CLASSICAL AND LATER
As a result of the distorted view given by ancient
authors and the modern attention centering largely
on towns, it was previously thought that from the
Classical period the population was concentrated in
towns, or in surrounding villages closely connected
to towns. It now appears that there were many coun-
try houses and farmsteads, with surveys revealing a
large number of such sites. Relatively few have been
studied in detail, and it is often hard to distinguish
between a country house and a farmstead: both were
probably agricultural establishments. Differences
may result from the varying wealth or status of the
occupants (free people or slaves). Many structures
usually termed “houses” rather than “farms” are
broadly similar to contemporary town houses. For
example, a late 5th-century BC house 7.45 miles (12
km) northwest of Athens, called the Dema house,
was built around a courtyard and had a colonnaded
porch ( pastas) on its north side (fig. 6.4). On the
ground floor the various rooms included a men’s
room (andron) and kitchen, with the women’s quar-
ters (gynaikonitis) and bedrooms above.
Another type of structure that is more often iden-
tiﬁed as a farmstead rather than a country house is
the “tower and court complex.” All towers were once
regarded as military installations, but evidence sug-
gests that many were part of a farmstead that con-
sisted of a tower, courtyard and house (fig. 6.5).
Towers were either round or rectangular in plan and
may have served as places of refuge, among other
functions. Some sites with towers appear to have
been very simple, but elsewhere towers formed part
of a structure with a courtyard, pastas and other fea-
tures associated with country houses. The tower
structure and the country house sometimes share
many features and display numerous variations,
demonstrating the difﬁculty in trying to differentiate

between such sites. The current evidence does not
allow a full interpretation of these rural sites.
TOWN BUILDINGS
AND STRUCTURES
Much information in towns is derived from publicly
ﬁnanced and prestigious buildings, such as temples,
stoas, theaters and fortifications. Little is known
about private houses and industrial complexes, which
nevertheless formed an essential element of towns.
Some buildings found in towns, such as theaters
and hippodromes, were also constructed in rural
sanctuaries.
Acropolis
The acropolis (akropolis, literally “highest part of the
city”) was originally a citadel. It was the most easily
defended and most highly fortified part of a city,
often providing the last place of refuge in a siege.
Because of constant warfare in the Greek world, the
majority of cities were divided into an acropolis and
a lower town. The acropolis was sometimes a garri-
son for foreign troops when a city was under foreign
control. During the Classical period the military
importance of the acropolis in cities gradually dimin-

ished, and it became a location for religious build-
ings. The most well-known acropolis is that at
Athens, which lost its military importance; in the 5th
century BC it was transformed by the rebuilding of
old temples and the construction of new ones, which
made it the most magniﬁcent in Greece.
Agora
This open space within the city provided a focal
point for civic life. Agoras varied in size and shape,
although they were often square or rectangular, and
a city might possess more than one. In its simplest
form an agora was an open space with roads leading
into it, but in its developed form it contained struc-
tures such as honorific statues, fountain houses,
shrines and even small temples (ﬁg. 6.6). These were
usually sited on the periphery of the agora so as not
to impinge too much on the open area. The agora
provided space for political and legal business and
public gatherings, as well as for commerce. It was
often used for markets and could also be used for fes-
tivals and athletic events. It was sometimes demar-
cated by boundary stones (fig. 7.12), and was
surrounded by public buildings such as the bouleu-
terion, prytaneion and stoas. In the Hellenistic
period stoas commonly surrounded agoras (ﬁg. 6.8).
Public Buildings
BOULEUTERION
The council (boule) of a Greek city usually met in a
bouleuterion (council house). The bouleuterion was
generally an uncomplicated rectangular (often square)
building. It had a single chamber or auditorium for
council debates, with tiers of seats around three sides
and probably internal columns supporting the roof.
Earlier ones were apparently simple buildings without

distinctive architecture and with wooden seats. The
New Bouleuterion built at Athens in the late 5th cen-
tury BC for the boule of 500 members had wooden
seats. These were later replaced by a semicircle of
marble seats, and a porch was also added (ﬁg. 1.11),
possibly in the late 4th century BC. Several excavated
examples from the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC also had
porches. The 2nd-century BC bouleuterion at Miletus
was more elaborate and had over 1,200 seats. It was a
large rectangular hall with a porch. The tiers of seats
were arranged in a semicircle at one end, behind
which staircases were ﬁtted into the two corners, and
the roof was supported by pillars or wooden posts.
PRYTANEION
The prytaneis, an executive committee of the boule
(council), met in a building called a prytaneion (pl.
prytaneia). In effect, it was the headquarters of the
city administration. It had ofﬁces for the magistrates,
and ambassadors were entertained there. Somewhere
within the prytaneion a communal hearth (the koine
hestia) sacred to the goddess Hestia was always kept
burning, since the prytaneion was the symbolic
“home” of the city-state. A ﬂame from the sacred ﬁre
was taken to kindle the ﬁre in the prytaneion of a
new colony. It is not known whether early examples
had a distinctive architecture, but excavated exam-
ples seem modest, while some Hellenistic ones
resembled a type of private house with an inner
courtyard surrounded by rooms, while that at Athens
was circular (a tholos, ﬁg. 1.11).
THOLOS
Tholos (pl. tholoi) was the name given to a circular
building (ﬁg. 6.7). Most known tholoi had a circular
roof supported on pillars in a style very similar to that
of temples, but usually with more elaborate decora-
tion. The purpose of these tholoi is not always
known, although some housed statues. At Athens a
tholos was constructed in the agora c. 465 BC next to
6.7 Tholos at Delphi of c. 375 BC. The architect may have been Theodorus of Phocaea, who apparently wrote a book on
this tholos. There was an outer ring (pteron) of 20 Doric columns and an internal circular wall of a cella, with a ring
of 10 adjoining Corinthian columns. The diameter of the entire building was 49 ft (13.5 m) and of the cella 28 ft
(8.41 m). Its dedication and purpose are unknown.

the New Bouleuterion (ﬁg. 1.11), to replace an earlier
structure. This tholos appears to have been a larger,
simpler, more utilitarian building, where the prytaneis
dined at public expense and made sacriﬁces and liba-
tions. It therefore had to accommodate about 50 din-
ers. There was a kitchen annex to the north. The
ofﬁcial weights and measures were kept in this tholos.
STOA
This was a long roofed colonnade with a wall on one
long side (sometimes with rooms behind) and an
open single or double row of columns on the other.
Sometimes a short projecting wing was added to
both ends. Athough stoas are known from the mid-
7th century BC, they became a standard civic build-
ing from the 5th century BC. They were situated near
temples or gymnasia or most commonly around the
sides of an agora, with the colonnade opening onto
the agora itself. Walls of stoas were often decorated
with paintings or inscriptions. In the Hellenistic
period, stoas were built to be architecturally impres-
sive, and some had two ﬂoors (ﬁgs. 6.8, 6.9). Stoas
were sheltered places in which to walk and talk, teach
or hold meetings. The philosopher Zeno and his fol-
lowers were named the Stoics because they fre-
quented stoas.
BALANEIA
Baths (balaneia, sing. balaneion) were used from at
least the 5th century BC, but the Roman concept of
public baths as social centers was alien to the Greeks.
The evidence from literature suggest that steam baths
were common by the mid-5th century BC. However,
evidence from artistic representations and excavations
of baths suggest that bathtubs were more commonly
used. Bathtubs were made of terra-cotta or of stone,
waterproofed either with stucco or with a surface of
glazed brick cubes. The ﬂoor of the tub might be at
two or three different levels, providing differing
depths of water. In public baths, bathtubs were set in
a regular pattern, often in parallel rows, or around
the wall of a circular room, with the axis of each bath-
tub aligned with the center of the circle. Running
water could be supplied at shoulder height for some-
one sitting in a tub, and water was sometimes heated.
There were also footbaths and high spouts to provide
showers. By the 3rd century BC some houses in many
cities had their own bathroom complete with bathtub
and sometimes a wash basin and toilet.
TEMPLES AND ALTARS
Religious structures, such as temples and altars, were
often situated on the acropolis or near the agora.
Large religious sanctuaries were also situated away
from cities. In addition to temples and altars, these
rural sanctuaries had a variety of buildings, such as
theaters, stoas and gymnasia. For temples and altars,
see chapter 8.

with two aisles and rooms behind. Below are Doric
columns; above, Ionic columns. It was restored by its
American excavators.

THEATERS
Theaters (theatra, sing. theatron, literally “a place for
watching” or “seeing space”) were built from the 6th
century BC. Most religious sites had a theater, origi-
nally designed for festivals of Dionysus (ﬁg. 7.14),
from which Greek drama eventually developed.
Early theaters could consist of a temporary structure
of wooden scaffolding. In Athens performances took
place in such a structure in the agora until a collapse
c. 497 BC. Performances were then transferred to the
site of the theater of Dionysus, which was then just a
hillside with wooden benches.
Because theaters were constantly rebuilt, their
earliest form is uncertain. They were built into the
slope of a hillside or natural hollow, or else a deliber-
ately built bank of earth provided support for the
tiers of seats. Theaters were generally D-shaped, or
just over half a circle in plan. All theaters (other than
odeia) were open-air structures. Originally spectators
stood on the hillside or sat on wooden seats, but from
the 4th century BC theaters were provided with tiers
of permanent stone seats (ﬁg. 6.10). Honoriﬁc seats
(prohedriai) were in the front rows.
Three main components of a theater were the
koilon (or theatron), orkhestra and skene. The koilon
was where the spectators (theatai) sat. The row of
seats nearest the orchestra was reserved for priests
and ofﬁcials. The tiers of stone seats were divided
into two by a horizontal walkway (diazoma), provid-
ing access for the audience, as did a walkway at the
very top of the tiers of seats. The orchestra was a
level circular area of hard earth at the foot of the tiers
of seats, where the chorus and actors performed. On
either side of the orchestra was a passage called a
parados, which provided access for spectators and
performers. On the opposite side of the orchestra
from the seating was the skene (literally, “hut” or
“tent,” from which the word scenery derives). This
was originally a wooden building providing storage
and changing rooms for the performers, but it devel-
oped into a low wooden stage about 3 ft (1 m) high
with changing rooms behind and a proskenion in
front. The skene wall was adapted to take different
paintings to show the setting of the action. The
proskenion was a kind of portico that provided a back-
drop for the action in the orchestra. Later the stage
was enlarged and incorporated into the performing
area, so that actors had more scope with their roles.
ODEION
An odeion (music hall) was a small roofed theater for
musical recitals and contests, poetry readings and
similar performances. The term is used in a general
sense for any small theater, most of which were
roofed, but it may have originated with the odeion

ﬂoor. At least two rooms had couches for dining. The stoa was constructed at the end of the 5th century BC.

built at Athens by Pericles in the 5th century BC.
This was a large, distinctive, rectangular building
with a wooden pyramidal roof supported by a great
number of internal columns.
Athletics and Sports Facilities
See also chapter 10, ENTERTAINMENT.
GYMNASIUM
The gymnasium (gymnasion) was a school that
derived its name from the fact that men and boys did
physical exercises naked (gymnos—the word also
means “lightly clad”). The Greek idea of education
was that of combined intellectual and physical train-
ing, usually in preparation for war. Gymnastics were
practiced by all ages, so the gymnasium catered to
the education of boys and men taking exercise. A
public institution run by the state, the gymnasium’s
focal point was an open court for wrestling and sim-
ilar sports, and a running track. Architecturally, the
buildings of the gymnasium were largely established
by the late 4th century BC, varying little after that
date. The open space of the gymnasium was often
bordered by one or more stoas and a covered running

track very similar to a stoa in appearance. There
might be provision for jumping practice and throw-
ing ranges, and there were various rooms where ath-
letes oiled or dusted themselves, bathrooms, rooms
for ball games, and lecture rooms. Some gymnasia
became famous centers of philosophy, and by the
Hellenistic period the gymnasium was an essential
part of Greek culture. Quite often they were sited
near rivers so that athletes could bathe in the water.
PALAESTRA
This institution was somewhat similar to the gymna-
sium. The Latin word palaestra is sometimes used
loosely for gymnasium, but in reality the Greek
palaestra (palaistra, wrestling school) was quite dif-
ferent. A school that taught boys athletics (mainly
wrestling and boxing), it was, unlike the gymnasium,
often privately owned. The palaestra usually con-
sisted of an open courtyard covered in sand, which
provided a practice area, surrounded by a rectangular
colonnade behind which were changing rooms and
bathrooms (ﬁg. 6.11). A palaestra often formed part
of a gymnasium.
STADIUM
The stadium (stadion) was a running track primarily
for foot races, although other athletic events also took
place there. The track was straight, just over 200 yds

(183 m) long and about 30 yds (27 m) wide. The foot
race called the stadion was one length of the track, but
other races involved several lengths, with competi-
tors having to turn around a pillar at each end. The
sides of the track were embanked, and the banks were
held in place by retaining walls. Later stadia had tiers
of stone seats for spectators (ﬁg. 6.12).
HIPPODROME
A track or stadium for chariot and horse racing was
called a hippodrome (hippodromos). Chariot and horse
racing were usually the most prestigious of the ath-
letic contests at festivals, but little is known about
hippodromes until the Roman period. Earlier hip-
podromes were apparently little more than a track,
possibly with some structures from which important
spectators could view the races. No actual hippo-
drome has been identified in Greece, and only at
Olympia is there reasonable evidence of where a hip-
podrome was situated. The Roman circus (a stadium
for chariot racing) is thought to have been modeled
on the Greek hippodrome and perhaps gives an idea
of what Greek hippodromes were like. The Roman
circus was U-shaped, with a barrier down the middle
and tiers of seats for spectators. The starting line was
at the open end of the U, and races consisted of sev-
eral laps around a central barrier.
Fortiﬁcations
Evidence for Bronze Age fortifications before the
Third Palace Period is relatively rare and consists
mainly of the remains of town walls and watchtow-
ers. From the Third Palace Period fortiﬁed settle-
ments became increasingly common, and many
towns and cities had fortiﬁcations throughout much
of their history. For fortiﬁcations, see chapter 3.
Gateways
A dipylon was a double gateway in a city wall with
gateways side by side. The most famous example was
at Athens, where it was the principal gateway on the
northwest side of the city (ﬁg. 4.4). A propylon (also
referred to by its Latin name propylaeum) was a mon-
umental gateway that formed the entrance to a city
or a sacred precinct. At Athens the most famous
example of this type of gateway is the entrance to the
Acropolis, usually referred to in the plural as the
Propylaia (fig. 6.13). It was constructed as part of
Pericles’ building program between 437 and 432 BC.
Town Houses
Available evidence for Bronze Age town houses is
uneven because extensive excavation of house sites
has rarely been undertaken; excavation has largely
concentrated on more spectacular sites. The resulting
evidence for houses does not allow many generaliza-
tions, because the excavated houses vary in size, com-
plexity and to some extent architectural quality.

6.12 Stadium at Delphi, constructed in the 5th century
BC and refurbished in the 2nd century AD. It is the best-
preserved stadium in Greece. It had seating for 7,000.
The course was 525 ft (160 m) long.

Houses usually had many rooms on two ﬂoors. In
what are assumed to be the poorer houses, the plan of
rooms is extremely irregular, with curving walls meet-
ing at any angle. The well-preserved houses at
Akrotiri on Thera show that walls could be of mud
brick, roughly faced stone, or rubble reinforced with
timber (ﬁg. 6.14). Mud-brick walls were sometimes
reinforced with stone blocks at the corners, and win-
dow frames were of stone or timber. Elsewhere it can
be difﬁcult to be certain which rooms formed a single
structure or which structure was a town house rather
than some other type of building, particularly where
only foundations survive. Except where evidence
exists for storage, it is often impossible to do more
than make conjectures about the function of rooms.
Little evidence exists for town houses during the
Dark Age. In the Archaic period, some houses are
very similar to those in Mycenaean towns, while oth-
ers are an early version of the courtyard house that
became prevalent in the Classical period: the most
regular version of this type of courtyard house is seen
in houses of Olynthus in northern Greece, which
were built from the late 5th century BC (ﬁg. 6.15).
The town was founded in 432 BC and was subse-
quently abandoned after being destroyed by Philip II
in 348 BC. In a new part of the town planned on a
grid system of streets, houses were built in blocks of
10. Each block consisted of two parallel rows of ﬁve
adjoining houses, and each house occupied a plot
approximately 20 by 20 yds (18 by 18 m). Although

usually led into a courtyard, which had a colonnaded
porch (pastas) on at least its north side, facing south
for maximum sunlight. Also at ground level was a liv-
ing room (oikos) with a central hearth. This was adja-
cent to the kitchen and bathroom. A men’s room
(andron) could usually hold about seven couches for
dining, and there were also storage rooms. Shops or
workshops faced the street. On the upper ﬂoor above
the northern half of the house were the women’s
quarters (gynaikonitis) and bedrooms. These houses
at Olynthus were built of mud brick and roofed with
baked clay tiles. Burglaries were often carried out by
knocking holes through the mud walls of houses.
The earth ﬂoors of houses were sometimes surfaced
with pebbles or a patterned mosaic. Walls were
sometimes stuccoed and painted with bands of color.
Rectangular houses of similar type were built in
other cities, but the evidence is far less extensive than
at Olynthus. Most houses, though, seemed to have a
single entrance and a single courtyard, though some
had two courtyards. A few larger houses had a court-
yard with a colonnade on all four sides. There is
some evidence for staircases rising from the court-
yard. For those who could afford the materials, there
were wooden doors and shutters.
Crowded apartment blocks, synoikiai, were pre-
sent in places such as the port of Piraeus, and were
inhabited by the poor.
The courtyard house continued into the Hel-
lenistic period, when more elaborate house types also
appeared. Wealthier Hellenistic houses were more
often of the peristyle type, having a colonnade on all
four sides of the courtyard (fig. 4.6). There was a
greater use of stone in their construction, and ﬂoors
of main rooms might be covered with elaborate
mosaics. Walls were stuccoed and painted to resem-
ble high-quality masonry such as marble. These
wealthier houses existed alongside poorer ones. At
Priene there is evidence for a late Hellenistic house
that included a feature resembling a megaron. In this
house the main room opened off a porch with two
columns (probably wooden posts) between side walls,
giving a plan similar to a megaron. No other town
houses with such a feature have yet been found.
Members of a household could be extensive, and
so living conditions even in wealthy houses were
probably cramped.
Water Supply and Drainage
Although springs and wells were used as water
(hydor) sources throughout the Greek period, water
was supplied to settlements from distant sources,
with evidence for this at least as early as the Myce-
naean period. Very little evidence exists for water
supply or drainage during the Dark Age. The sophis-
ticated provisions for water supply and drainage that
are common from the Classical period appear to
have developed during the 8th–6th centuries BC.
Classical cities obtained their water from springs,
wells and aqueducts. Apart from drinking, water was
used for such activities as washing, bathing, laundry,
cooking, cleaning and industrial manufacturing
processes. Public baths had bathtubs and showers,
and some houses had bathrooms with a bathtub and
wash basin. Basins in kitchens were also used for
washing and for laundry.
WELLS AND CISTERNS
Private domestic water supplies came mainly from
wells and cisterns outside the house. Cisterns were
large waterproof underground tanks for water stor-
age, often storing rainwater. Even when cut in rock,
they usually needed to be lined with cement to make
them waterproof. In suitable areas wells were dug.
Well heads gave access to both wells and cisterns and
prevented people and animals from falling into the
well shaft. They were stone or terra-cotta cylinders
about 2 ft (0.6 m) high, set over the opening of a well
or cistern. Many surviving well heads have deep
grooves caused by friction from the ropes that hauled
up vessels of water. Some well heads had a super-
structure supporting a pulley, making it easy to haul
up a vessel on the end of a rope. In some cities pri-
vate cisterns were supplied with water from pipes.
AQUEDUCTS AND PIPES
In the Bronze Age, places such as Mycenae and
Tiryns had tunnels cut through rock to reach sources
of water, probably as a precaution against sieges;

elsewhere, aqueducts conducted water from springs
to nearby settlements. They were usually con-
structed by lining a ditch with stone slabs to form a
channel, which was itself roofed over with stone
slabs. It is possible that baked clay pipes were also
used for water supply, but it is sometimes unclear
whether excavated pipes were for water supply or for
drainage. Clay pipes and channels were certainly
used for drainage as early as the First Palace Period
at Knossos, and clay pipes of the Second Palace
Period at Knossos may have supplied water and been
used for drainage. Clay pipes and rock-cut conduits
to take water from springs are also found from the
Archaic period. In the 6th century BC a sophisticated
tunnel was cut by the engineer Eupalinos through
rock on Samos to transport water to the city. In Clas-
sical cities aqueducts often brought water from dis-
tant sources. In the Hellenistic period aqueducts
were increasingly used to supply water to cities, and
the use of clay pipes to distribute water continued
from the Classical period. Some Hellenistic cities
had large reservoirs on their outskirts.
FOUNTAIN HOUSES
Fountain houses providing a public water supply
appear to have been built around springs as early as
the 6th century BC. The main element of fountain
houses was a stone tank or tanks ﬁlled by water from
a spring. In many cases the facade of the fountain
house had an appearance similar to a temple, with a
gable roof and supporting columns. The water
ﬂowed from ornamental bronze spouts, or in some
cases water could be taken by dipping vessels into
open water tanks. Some fountain houses were sup-
plied by aqueducts. There are also examples of
underground public water sources, reached by ﬂights
of steps, either in a cistern or where there was access
to an underground spring.
WASTE WATER
Drains were used as early as the First Palace Period
and reemerged with planned cities in the 4th century
BC, when Greek cities developed a system of drains
to get rid of surface water, wastewater and overﬂows
from springs and fountain houses. These drainage
systems became increasingly sophisticated and com-
plex, with clay drainpipes and open drainage chan-
nels feeding into larger drains and sewers. Public toi-
lets or latrines are known to have existed, from which
wastewater was carried away in large drains. Houses
often had some kind of toilet or latrine; at Olynthus
a surprisingly modern-looking terra-cotta toilet pan
has been found, apparently connected to the local
drainage system, and it was found in a house dating
to the 4th century BC. Elsewhere at Olynthus, bath-
tubs and drains belonging to houses are known. In
Athens toilets in 5th-century BC houses emptied into
stone-lined cesspools, and in the 4th century BC they
were connected to the drainage system. By Hellen-
istic times many houses in towns had latrines linked
to covered drains.
In houses without any toilet it is assumed that
some kind of chamber pot was commonly employed.
They are seen in representations of symposia, and
would have been emptied into open drains in the
street. Drainage systems may not have been com-
mon, even at Athens: all too often the disposal of
sewage and garbage was poor; it would have ﬁlled
the streets, and the stench and filth in cities must
have been considerable.
ARCHITECTURE
AND ARCHITECTS
Civil and domestic architecture generally developed
late in Greece. Most architectural excellence was lav-
ished on temples and related religious buildings.
This has resulted in temple sites being the best sur-
viving examples of the architectural orders, and it is
largely from temples that the development of Greek
architecture has been reconstructed. Apart from the
different architectural orders, the various plans of
Doric and Ionic temples demonstrate the diversity of
Greek architecture from the Archaic period. See also
TEMPLES in chapter 8.
Architectural Orders
From the 6th century BC the three major Greek
architectural orders gradually developed: Doric, Ionic
and Corinthian. There is slight evidence for an origin
T O W N S
A N D C O U N T R Y S I D E
241

in the 7th century BC, but many examples once
thought to be of an early date have been redated.
Before this date, no recognizable architectural orders
are visible in the excavated buildings and surviving
models. Sometimes only two major orders (Doric and
Ionic) are recognized, because Corinthian is a later
variation of Ionic. The styles of these three orders are
most easily distinguished by their columns.
DORIC
Doric columns had no base and rose directly from
the ﬂoor, with a maximum diameter of about one-
ﬁfth or one-sixth the column height. The column
had 20 wide shallow flutings or flutes (vertical
grooves) on earlier buildings, though 16 became the
standard number. The column tapered slightly from
about one-quarter of its height from the ﬂoor. At the
top of the column was a capital consisting of a basin-
shaped circular molding and a plain square slab.
The Doric order evolved in the 6th century BC,
possibly from wooden columns, but this remains
uncertain, and became the normal style in mainland
Greece, Sicily and Magna Graecia. The main ele-
ments of a Doric building (ﬁg. 6.16) were the foun-
dation and leveling course (euthynteria), three steps
up to the platform on which the structure was built,
and the columns and their capitals supporting the
architrave (plain stone blocks spanning the gaps
between the columns), above which was the frieze.
The most characteristic element of the Doric order
is the frieze, consisting of alternating triglyphs and
metopes, possibly derived from carpentry patterns.
The triglyphs were divided into three bars by vertical
grooves. The metopes were square slabs, set back
from the surface of the triglyphs. The architrave and
the frieze made up the entablature, on top of which
was the cornice, the gutter and the eaves of the roof.
At the gable ends of the building, a horizontal cor-
nice was at the same level as the cornice on the sides,
but above that there was a pediment surmounted by
slanting cornices under the edges of the roof.
IONIC
The Ionic column had a maximum diameter of one-
eighth or one-ninth of the column height, giving it a
more slender appearance, than a Doric column. It also
had deeper ﬂuting, 24 in all, stood on a base, and had
a capital decorated with spiral scrolls (ﬁgs. 6.17, 6.18).
The Ionic order developed in the late 6th century
BC (ﬁg. 6.19) from Near Eastern architectural styles.
The main differences between an Ionic and Doric
building are the columns with bases and different
capitals. These supported an entablature in which the

k) horizontal cornice; l) metope; m) pediment; n) sima; 
o) slanting cornice; p) steps; q) stylobate; r) triglyph

architrave consisted of three bands, each one project-
ing a little from the one below. Above this was an egg-
and-tongue molding. The triglyphs and metopes of
the Doric order were now replaced by a row of small
projecting blocks called “dentils”, and/or by a contin-
uous frieze of sculptured decoration.
A variant on the Ionic capital was the Aeolic cap-
ital (ﬁg. 6.20), which appears to have developed ear-
lier than the true Ionic capital, in the early 6th or
even late 7th century BC. This type of capital is sim-
ilar to the usual Ionic capital, but is more ornate and
shows distinctive Eastern inﬂuence. Similar capitals
have been found in Palestine, Phoenicia and Syria
dating to the 8th–7th centuries BC. The use of the
Aeolic capital was largely confined to Aeolia in
northwest Turkey.
CORINTHIAN
The Corinthian order developed from the Ionic in
the later 5th century BC and became very popular in
the Hellenistic period; the main change was to the
capitals of the columns, which became an inverted
bell shape, decorated with acanthus leaves (ﬁg. 6.21).
Corinthian became the dominant architectural style
in the 1st century BC.

with its ﬂuting survive.

Architects
An architect (arkhitekton) had the role more of a mas-
ter builder than an architect. After he served an
apprenticeship and worked as a master craftsman, he
would eventually be selected to draw up a design (syn-
graphe) and supervise the construction of a building.
Most building commissions were for public rather
than private buildings, and the majority were ofﬁcial
commissions on behalf of the state. Even when a pri-
vate individual paid for a building, it was mostly on
behalf of his city. Until the rise of Macedonia most
patrons of architects were therefore city-states, after
which Macedonian and Hellenistic rulers became the
main patrons.
Architects working for city-states were closely
controlled. In some places two or three architects
were elected to oversee repairs and regulate building
work. For large projects architects might have to
compete by submitting estimates for programs of
work drawn up by the city-state. Projects such as the
Parthenon had more than one architect. Historical
sources show that the architect and building contrac-
tors were bound by detailed regulations, and in some
cases rules were laid down to deal with conflicts
between the architect and contractors. The architect
was also bound by other restrictions; complex regula-
tions often governed the possession of sacred ground
and what could be done with it. Architects also had to
take into account the foundations of earlier buildings.
Material from earlier buildings often had to be reused

to reduce costs. Even in the choice of architectural
order, architects had to take into account traditional
local preferences. The names of some architects are
known from historical sources: Callicrates, Hermo-
genes, Hippodamus, Ictinus, Mnesicles, Philon,
Pythius and Scopas (see chapter 9).
BUILDING
TECHNIQUES
Greeks generally built in stone wherever it was readily
available, and dressed stones were held together using
a number of techniques. Where good stone was
unavailable, stone rubble was used or walls were built
of mud brick. In the 2nd century BC the Romans began
using concrete, and it was only under Roman inﬂu-
ence at the very end of the Greek period that mortar
and some concrete were used in Greek buildings.
Foundations
From the Minoan period most buildings had stone
foundations, irrespective of the materials used for the
walls. Mud brick walls, used throughout the Greek
period, were generally set on a foundation of a few
courses of stone rubble as a precaution against damp.
For the same reason walls of mud brick were set on
foundations of well-dressed masonry in some Hel-
lenistic buildings. Structures built of stone rubble
were set on foundations of the same material. Mon-
umental buildings constructed from large masonry
blocks needed substantial foundations, not only
because of the weight of the masonry, but also
because even minor subsidence could cause serious
problems. Such foundations were built on rock or
undisturbed subsoil and were usually one-and-a-half
or two times the width of the walls that they sup-
ported. Foundations were usually provided only for
individual walls; buildings constructed on solid rafts
of masonry were rare. On top of the foundation was
a more carefully laid leveling course of stone blocks
called the euthynteria. The top of this course was
dressed as accurately as possible to provide a guide
for the walls or columns above it.
Walls
The three main materials used for wall construction
were masonry, mud brick and stone rubble, but some-
times a mixture of materials was used. For example, a
building might have stone walls for rooms at ground
level and mud brick for upper floors. Some wide
walls, such as those in early fortiﬁcations, had two
parallel wall faces of dressed stone with a core of
stone rubble. Walls were constructed on foundations.
MUD-BRICK WALLS
In many areas suitable stone was not readily avail-
able, and mud brick was the normal building mater-
ial. The bricks were made from a mixture of clay,
water and a suitable tempering material such as

straw, which was worked into a malleable consistency
and pressed into molds. The finished bricks were
turned out of the molds and dried in the sun. A few
rare Bronze Age examples of fire-burnt bricks are
known. When dry, mud bricks were laid in courses to
form a wall. The surfaces of the wall were smoothed
and sealed with clay or plaster in order to prevent
water seeping into the wall, causing it to disintegrate.
The top of the wall was kept dry by the overhanging
eaves of the roof. These walls were often reinforced
with timber. Walls of mud brick were commonly
1.5–2 ft (0.5–0.6 m) thick.
RUBBLE WALLS
These walls were made with locally available stone. If
it was easily and neatly split, walls were less uneven
than in areas where the stone broke into irregular

pieces. The stone was rarely shaped after quarrying,
apart from specific pieces such as bases for posts.
Larger pieces could be used in the lower part of a
wall, but stones were generally around 0.5–1.5 ft
(0.15–0.46 m) long. Each stone was placed so that its
best side formed one face of the wall. Individual
stones rarely showed on both faces of the wall. Gaps
in the wall were ﬁlled with earth and smaller stones.
MASONRY WALLS
Citadels of the Mycenaean period had masonry walls
that have been labeled “Cyclopean,” from the later
Greek explanation that these walls had been built by
the Cyclops. Cyclopean walls have ﬂat surfaces built
with close-ﬁtting irregular stones, using no mortar
(fig. 1.4). An exception is around gateways, which
were often made more impressive by using more
massive blocks or (as at Mycenae) stones dressed into
rectangular blocks (ﬁg. 6.22). On average the blocks
weighed 5 or 6 tons, but they could weigh up to 10
tons. For thicker walls, the gap between two outer
layers of facing blocks was ﬁlled with earth and rub-
ble. Such walls were used for fortiﬁcations to enclose
large citadels, settlements, small forts and apparently
large areas of land.
From the 7th century BC carefully dressed stone
replaced rubble and mud brick in the construction of
temples and important public buildings. This method
of using such dressed stone is sometimes called mon-
umental masonry, because it formed a large part of
the monumental system of construction that is asso-
ciated with the characteristic forms of Greek archi-
tecture. In the centuries following its introduction,
this type of masonry was adopted for most other types
of building.
Monumental masonry required each block to be
quarried separately, so that it could be dressed to the
required size for its position in the building. A
masonry wall was constructed on the top course of
the foundation (euthynteria). The first course was
usually two blocks thick, set upright. These rectan-
gular blocks each measured about 1 yd (0.9 m) long
and were called orthostatai (sing. orthostates). On top
of these orthostats, stone blocks of the normal
smaller size were laid in approximately regular
courses. Before a block was laid, all the faces except
the top were given the ﬁnal dressing. The top of the
block was not given a ﬁnal dressing until its entire
course was completed. The course was then dressed
to provide a continuous surface on which to lay the
next course of blocks.
Masonry blocks were raised into position using
hoisting gear with a system of pulleys. The rope
from the pulley system was attached to the block by
various means (fig. 6.23). Holes were sometimes
drilled into the top of the block. For example, ropes
could be passed through U-shaped holes or attached
to a lewis iron wedged into lewis holes with packing
materials. A lewis iron was an iron plug shaped like
half a dovetail, with the bottom end wider than the
top. Similar holes could also enable lifting tongs to
achieve a grip. In some cases projecting pieces of

block and being hoisted by a rope; d) a stone block being
lifted by a sling attached to projecting pieces of stone

stone were left on the sides of the block to help
secure a sling for lifting. They were usually removed
after the block was built into the wall, but some
walls still have these handling bosses in place (ﬁg.
6.24). Once a block had been hoisted onto the top of
the wall, it was levered into position with crowbars.
The earliest buildings had no pegs or clamps
holding the blocks together, but from the second half
of the 6th century BC, buildings in Ionia and on some
Aegean islands used wooden dowels in holes in the
blocks, which were usually held in place by pouring
molten lead around them. These dowels were used
to join blocks above and below and for strengthening
corners. Dowels continued to be used in Ionia and
the Aegean islands until the Hellenistic period, but
were rarely used elsewhere.
The earliest type of clamp for holding two blocks
of stone together was the dovetail clamp, made of
wood or lead and shaped like a bowtie. At the end of
the 6th century BC, an iron clamp shaped like an H,
but with an elongated central bar, came into use (ﬁg.
6.25). This became the main shape of clamp on
mainland Greece during the 5th century BC. Other
shapes of iron clamp were also used (fig. 6.26).
Clamps were set in holes in the tops of blocks and
were held fast by being set in lead.
Walls were constructed with masonry blocks
according to one of several possible systems (fig.
6.27). The most regular was the isodomic, in which
all courses above the orthostats were of equal height,
and the vertical joints of alternate courses were on
the same vertical alignment. This system was popular
from the 6th century BC, particularly in mainland
Greece and the western colonies. Another com-
monly used system was the pseudoisodomic, which
differed from the isodomic in having alternating
deep and shallow courses in a regular pattern, rather
than all courses having a uniform depth.
6.24 A lifting boss on a stone block on the Megarian Treasury at Delphi

For fortiﬁcation walls and retaining walls, other
systems were sometimes used, including trapezoidal
masonry. In walls built from trapezoidal rather than
rectangular blocks, the blocks were still laid in
courses, but the vertical joints were sloping rather
than absolutely vertical. Polygonal masonry was also
popular for this type of wall (ﬁg. 10.4); there were no
courses, and the polygonal stones were dressed to ﬁt
their position in the wall. Lesbian polygonal was a
particular type of polygonal masonry, with curved
rather than straight joints between blocks.
Columns
With the introduction of monumental masonry in
the 7th century BC, stone columns replaced wooden
ones. Columns were built in sections (drums), the
blocks for which were cut roughly to shape at the
quarry and then transported to the stone yard for
ﬁnal dressing. Columns were assembled by stacking
drums on top of each other (ﬁgs. 8.25, 8.27). To pre-
vent columns moving sideways and toppling, the
drums were joined together. This was often done
with wooden pegs about 2–2.75 in (50–70 mm)
square, which ﬁtted into sockets cut in the center of
the top and bottom of the drums. Round rather than
square pegs were sometimes used. In the second half
of the 5th century BC an improved system of joining

drums came into use in Athens. Instead of a square
peg, a roughly cubical plug (empolion) was hammered
into the central sockets of the drums. Holes were
then bored in the plugs, into which a cylindrical peg
( polos) was fitted, joining the two drums. At first
plugs and pegs were of wood, but later they were
made of bronze, with the empolia being sealed in
place with lead. From the 4th century BC this type of
joining was reinforced by adding extra metal dowels,
usually of square or ﬂat sections, set in other holes in
the drums.
Roofs and Vaults
Evidence for Bronze Age buildings suggests that ﬂat
roofs were common. They were probably of the
same construction as used later in Greece; timber
beams supporting the roof were covered with brush-
wood, which in turn was covered with clay packed
hard to make it waterproof. Thatched roofs may also
have been used, and at least one example exists of a
roof covered with baked clay tiles. All these types of
roofs continued in use, but from the Archaic period
thatch was used mainly for temporary buildings. Flat
clay roofs continued where the climate was suitable,
but tiled roofs became common.
Tiled roofs did not require as steep a pitch as
thatched roofs to remain watertight—generally a
slope of 10 to 15 degrees. The wooden framework of
beams, rafters and battens was covered with two
types of tile. Large, fairly ﬂat pantiles were laid edge
to edge, with the bottom of a tile overlapping the top
of the one below to allow rainwater to run off. Small
gaps between the edges of adjacent tiles were pro-
tected from the weather by narrow cover tiles. Pan-
tiles were usually 2–3 ft (0.65–0.95 m) long and 1.5–2
ft (0.50–0.65 m) wide, and the cover tiles were made
the same length as the pantiles, but were only 8–10 in
(0.2–0.25 m) wide.
The two main forms of tiled roof were known as
Laconian and Corinthian (ﬁg. 6.28). The Laconian
had slightly concave pantiles with convex cover tiles,
while the Corinthian had flat pantiles with raised
edges and angular cover tiles. The names of these
roofs reflect their places of origin. Because the
Laconian type was easier to manufacture, they were
generally used for houses, whereas the Corinthian
type was preferred for public buildings. A combina-
tion of the two types, using Corinthian-type pantiles
and Laconian-type cover tiles, was used on some
buildings in Sicily.
Special tiles covered the ridge, eaves and gable
ends of roofs. These tiles were often decorated archi-

e) polygonal; f) Lesbian polygonal

tectural features, used to enhance the appearance of
the roof. Some roofs, such as conical or hipped, also
required special forms of tiles. Except at the eaves,
tiles were rarely ﬁxed to roof timbers. The tiles inter-
locked and were held in place largely by their own
weight, although sometimes clay was laid between
the tiles and the roof timbers to help secure them.
Vaults were not extensively used by the Greeks,
and most vaults were underground rather than inte-
gral parts of buildings. The Greeks made little use of
the masonry arch, preferring to use massive stone lin-
tels for spanning gaps in buildings, even when it
proved necessary to reinforce such lintels with iron
rods. This may have been because arches would not
readily suit their architectural styles, and also because
they were unsure about counteracting the lateral
forces produced by arches. Nevertheless, arches were
used underground, where the pressure of earth coun-
teracted all lateral forces and the style of architecture
was not on view. Barreled vaults were commonly used
for tomb chambers in Macedonia from the 4th cen-
tury BC, and earlier examples are known. Corbeling
was also used for arches and vaulting. The Bronze
Age tholos tombs are some of the best surviving
examples of underground vaults constructed using
the corbeling technique. Above ground, the most
common use of both true arches and corbeled arches
was for small gateways through fortiﬁcation walls.
Doors and Windows
The surviving evidence for doors and windows in
Minoan buildings appears to show that they were
were simple rectangles or squares. Doorways appear
to have been rectangular, with a timber or stone
frame. Doors were made of wood, and the usual
method of installing them was by wooden pivots that
projected at the top and bottom of the inner edge of
the door. The pivots ﬁtted into sockets in the lintel
and threshold of the door frame, allowing the door
to open and close as the pivots turned in the sockets.
The bottom pivot, which took the weight of the
door, was sometimes encased in bronze. In Minoan
palaces, double doors were apparently common.
Windows generally had timber frames, and
faience plaques from Knossos depict house fronts
with two types of windows. One type is rectangular
with vertical long sides and with a central beam
dividing the window into two lights. The other type
is square, with a horizontal and a vertical beam form-
ing a cross to divide the window into four lights.
Some windows possibly had wooden shutters, but no
deﬁnite evidence exists for them or for translucent
window coverings; windows appear to have just been
framed openings in walls. Doors and windows in
Mycenaean buildings were apparently very similar to
Minoan ones.
In the Classical period doors and windows con-
tinued to be rectangular openings, with wood or
stone frames. Windows in houses often had wooden
shutters, and in public buildings bronze lattices were
sometimes used as screens in windows and doors,
allowing ventilation and light. Similar grilles or lat-
tices may also have been made of wood. Glass was
not used for windows until the Roman period, but in
winter windows may have been covered with an oiled
cloth or some other translucent material. Doors were
still generally made of wood, but in public buildings
some doors were wood covered with bronze.

The exterior door was secured by a bolt passing
through staples on the inner side of the door. This
was locked from the outside by pulling the bolt into
position with a strap that passed through a hole in
the door. The door was unlocked by passing a key (a
bent metal rod or bar) through another hole in the
door and engaging the end of it in a groove in the
bolt. Pulling the key released the bolt and unlocked
the door. Later reﬁnements improved the security of
such locks, but the type of lock where the key is
rotated to withdraw the bolt was not invented until
the Roman period. Decorative bronze key plates
were sometimes ﬁtted around keyholes in doors, and
other ornamental door ﬁttings included discs, nail
heads and door knockers.
Floors
Various materials were used for ﬂoors in Bronze Age
buildings, the most common being packed earth
ﬂoors, particularly in houses. In palaces, ﬂoors were
sometimes paved with stone, and sheets of white
alabaster or gypsum were used in the ﬁnest rooms.
Some ﬂoors were made of plaster or cement, usually
where they needed to be water resistant. These ﬂoors
might be decorated by painting or have inset colored
pebbles, but not to form a pattern as in a mosaic.
Wood was probably used for upper ﬂoors.
With the introduction of monumental masonry
in the 7th century BC, stone was commonly used for
ﬂoors of temples and other public buildings. Packed
earth ﬂoors continued to be used in most houses, but
mosaic ﬂoors began to be used for some rooms from
about 400 BC (see chapter 9). Wood continued to be
used for most upper ﬂoors.
INTERIORS AND
EXTERIORS
Mosaics
Apart from a few wall mosaics that might be very late
Hellenistic in date (or possibly Roman), Greek
mosaics were ﬂoor mosaics. In addition to their dec-
orative function, these ﬂoors were smooth, cool and
water-resistant. They were most commonly used for
ﬂoors of dining rooms. The earliest mosaics, made
from pebbles, date mainly to around 400 BC,
although pebbled ﬂoors had been used in earlier con-
texts, such as the Bronze Age. In the early or mid-3rd
century BC, pebble mosaics were replaced by tesse-
lated mosaics. See also chapter 9, MOSAICS.
Painted Decoration
Interior rooms of Minoan palaces were highly deco-
rated, possibly using the fresco technique. Paint, usu-
ally earth pigments, was brushed onto plaster before
it had dried (although it is thought that much may
have been painted on dry). Some of the painting, par-
ticularly details, was probably added afterwards.
Some rooms had walls painted in one or more colors,
while others had life-size scenes or miniatures, or a
mixture of scenes and solid color. Some painting imi-
tated stonework, and ﬂoors could be painted. Myce-
naean palaces were also highly decorated with wall
paintings. Evidence from both Crete and the main-
land suggests that some larger houses also had wall
paintings. Although paintings on wooden plaques are
known from the Archaic period, little evidence of wall
paintings of this period has survived. They were cer-
tainly a feature of interior decoration from the 5th
century BC to the Roman period, and a number of
painters’ names are known from historical sources,
but virtually no evidence of the paintings has sur-
vived. See chapter 9, WALL PAINTINGS.
From at least the 7th century BC paint was also
used to enhance the exterior of public buildings, for
example to pick out details above the columns of
temples and as a colored background to sculptural
elements such as friezes. Because little direct evi-
dence has survived, it remains unclear exactly how
much of the exterior of these buildings was painted.
It is thought that a great deal of exterior architecture
was painted in bright colors.
Sculpture and Stucco
The exterior of masonry buildings was often deco-
rated with sculpture and moldings. While moldings
were used on all types of buildings, sculpture was

used only on religious buildings such as temples and
treasuries. On Doric-style buildings the pediments
on the gable ends were sometimes decorated with
sculpture; on Ionic and Corinthian-style buildings,
the pediments and the frieze were often decorated
with sculptures and carved moldings. The blocks for
such moldings and sculptures were not completely
finished before installation—usually a certain
amount of surplus stone was left on these blocks until
they were in position on the building. This helped to
protect them against damage during handling and to
ensure that carvings continuing over two or more
blocks matched properly. Any necessary adjustments
to achieve continuity of carving could be made dur-
ing the ﬁnal ﬁnishing of the blocks.
Some types of stone were given a stucco coating in
which any ﬁne detail was picked out, but marble was
usually just given a final smoothing of its surface.
Columns were treated in a similar way, with the ﬂut-
ing being cut after the column was assembled, since
any minor inaccuracies in the ﬂuting from badly ﬁt-
ting drums would be immediately apparent. A partic-
ular form of column, the caryatid, was decorated with
sculpture. The columns were sculpted in the form of
draped females, the most famous examples being
from the Erechtheum at Athens (fig. 8.30). Other
examples are known from Delphi. Much architectural
sculpture and stucco were painted in bright colors.
See also chapter 9, ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE.
Stucco (decorative plasterwork) was also used for
interior decoration. Patterns and pictures were raised
in low relief from a flat plaster background, the
designs being either formed in molds or done free-
hand.
Roofs on religious buildings were often decorated
with ornamental tiles. The edges of the roof tiles at
the eaves were finished off with antefixes with
molded decoration, such as animal heads or foliage
patterns. There were decorative water spouts (akrote-
ria, sing. akroterion) at the corners of roofs, and dec-
orative ridge tiles were also used.
Heating
Throughout the Greek period the most common
method of heating was with braziers, generally made
of baked clay or bronze. In Minoan palaces braziers
and portable hearths of baked clay are known, and
there were a few ﬁxed hearths. Hearths were a central
feature of the megaron in Mycenaean palaces, but
houses of later periods had hearths conﬁned mainly
to the living room and kitchen area, the latter more
for cooking than heating. Sometimes wood was used
as fuel, but charcoal was apparently more common
and probably more effective. Smoke was left to ﬁnd
its own way out through windows and gaps under the
eaves, since buildings did not have chimneys.
Lighting
Braziers were apparently used as a source of light as
well as heat, but the most common source of artiﬁcial
light from the Bronze Age was the simple oil lamp
(ﬁg. 6.29). These were made in many sizes and many
forms, but were essentially an open bowl for the oil,
with a handle, and a nozzle for the wick. Body shapes
changed in time, and later types of lamps were

enclosed rather than having open bowls. From the
3rd century BC lamps were made in two-piece molds,
often with decoration.
Open lamps were of pottery, stone or bronze, and
the enclosed type mainly of pottery. Lamps burned
olive oil and could be placed on flat surfaces, on
tripods or suspended from wall brackets. Torches,
made from a burning branch or bundle of twigs,
were mainly used for outdoor lighting.
Furniture and Furnishings
Little evidence for furniture and furnishings has sur-
vived from the Bronze Age. Much of the evidence is
associated with the palaces and is unlikely to be rep-
resentative of most houses. Decorative ivory inlays
from boxes have been found, and boxes and chests
are shown in some artistic representations; remains of
wooden chests have also survived. Inlays for furniture
are known, including ivory and faience, and possible
ivory chair legs have been recognized. Furniture
inlaid with ivory and precious metals is mentioned in
Linear B texts, but most furniture must have been of
perishable materials, such as wood and textiles.
Smaller household items of the Bronze Age included
lamps and braziers, bathtubs and stone basins for
washing, and bronze vessels such as cauldrons.
By the time of the Classical period much more is
known about furniture and furnishings. Walls of
rooms might be painted in single colors or with elab-
orate designs, or pictures painted on wooden panels
might be hung on the walls. Furniture was sparse by
modern standards and generally simple in design,
although little survives because of the nature of the
materials used (such as wood and leather). Most
houses had chairs with backs and armrests, four-
legged and folding stools, benches, and easy chairs
with curved backs. Beds and dining couches were
made of wood and had mattresses and pillows. Soft
furnishings such as mattress covers, cushions, rugs
and bedspreads were often woven with richly colored
patterns or dyed in solid bright colors. Dining
couches were frequently accompanied by small rec-
tangular tables, generally with three legs to give sta-
bility on uneven ﬂoors. Three-legged round and oval
tables are also known. Lamps were sometimes sup-
ported on special stands or tripods, or hung from wall
brackets, and there were braziers for heating. Chests
and boxes of various sizes were used for storage, as
there were no cupboards. Items such as containers and
utensils were hung on walls when not in use. Interior
doors were not common, and doorways to bedrooms
usually had a curtain. The average household would
have had a selection of pottery and bronze containers
for storing, cooking and serving food.
Hellenistic houses appear to have been more
richly furnished than earlier ones, and those of the
wealthy might have had sculptures and portrait
paintings, as well as pools, gardens and orchards.

GREEK LANGUAGE
Dialects
Apart from Linear A, there exists some evidence
for languages earlier than Greek through many
words in the Greek vocabulary whose etymology is
unknown—they appear to be loan words from an
earlier language, as are many place-names that do
not appear to be Greek in origin.
In the Classical period, Greek was spoken in
mainland Greece, the Aegean islands and in the
Greek colonies. Although Greece was divided into
numerous regions and states, the same language was
spoken, distinguishing Greeks from barbarians (bar-
baroi, a word they applied to all non-Greek-speaking
people, meaning all those who spoke in an inarticu-
late tongue, especially the Persians in the 5th century
BC). Greeks were therefore monoglots, although
there were numerous dialects, and the Greeks them-
selves mention four ethnic groups of Athenians,
Ionians, Dorians and Aeolians. There was no break
between ancient and modern Greek, and so it is the
longest-attested European language, a language that
changed over time. Greek is an Indo-European lan-
guage related to language groups such as Italic, Ger-
manic, Indo-Iranian and Armenian, originating in
the later 2nd millennium BC with the migrations of
Indo-European people into Greece. During the 17th
and 16th centuries BC the Greek language began to
develop and is recognizable in the Linear B script
written on clay tablets in the Mycenaean period. It is
unclear whether the Mycenaean language was a
dialect of Greek, but it does have close links with
Arcado-Cyprian.
It was once thought that the different dialects
were due to different waves of invaders from about
1200 BC, when there were widespread movements of
people throughout Europe, including a Dorian inva-
sion into parts of Greece by Greek people who spoke
a Doric dialect and came from northwest Greece
(Epirus and Macedonia). Some settled in the region
known as Doris, and others moved into the Pelo-
ponnese via Delphi and Naupactus. In the central
Peloponnese the Arcadian dialect was similar to pre-
Dorian Greek, so the Dorians probably failed to
penetrate much of Arcadia. During the Dark Age
people migrated from Greece to other parts of the
Greek world. This included the migration of Ionian
Greeks to western Asia Minor.
These events may have resulted in the distribu-
tion of various dialects in historic Greece, although
the invasion theories are not universally believed.
The movement of people bringing their individual
dialects may not have been real, although no other
good evidence as yet exists to explain the dialects.
The differences between the dialects were fairly
small, and speakers of one dialect could probably be
understood by speakers of another. The basic vocab-
ulary of the different dialects is shared, with few dif-
ferences. As the Greeks tended not to learn foreign
languages, loan words from other languages are
rarely found until contact with the Romans.
The main dialects were Doric, Attic-Ionic,
Aeolic, North-West Greek and Arcado-Cyprian.
North-West Greek was spoken in Phocis, Locris,
Elis and Aetolia, and Doric was spoken throughout
the Peloponnese and places colonized from there,
such as the southern Aegean islands, Crete, south-
west coast of Asia Minor, Rhodes and parts of Sicily
and Italy. Other dialects are categorized as East
Greek: Ionic was spoken in the Ionic colonies of Asia
Minor (Ionia), Euboea and some Aegean islands,
with its offshoot, Attic, spoken in Attica and Athens.
Aeolic was spoken in Lesbos and neighboring Aeolis,
with a variant in Thessaly and Boeotia (actually a
mixture with North-West Greek). Linear B is recog-
nizable as East Greek. The dialect of epic poetry is
an artiﬁcial dialect based on Ionic, but with funda-
mental differences such as ¯e being used instead of ¯a.
Arcado-Cyprian (a modern term) was an archaic
dialect used in Arcadia, Pamphylia and Cyprus that
possibly preserved Mycenaean Greek; it is not found
in extant literature. Aeolic and Arcado-Cyprian have
many common elements and are classed as Achaean.
They are similar to the language of Linear B texts.
The Attic dialect later predominated.
Dialects used by authors were not necessarily
their native tongue or that of the city in which they
wrote, but that of the literary genre. For example,
choral lyric poetry originated in a Doric-speaking
region, and so all such poetry was composed in a lit-

erary form of Doric. While tragedy and comedy at
Athens were written in Attic, the choral lyric parts
were written in Doric. The earliest literary Greek
was by Homer, who wrote in an artiﬁcial mixed com-
bination of Ionic and Aeolic, as did later epic writers.
The Macedonian language was probably a dialect
of Greek, related to North-West Greek, but there is
a possibility of it being a different Indo-European
language. With the uniﬁcation by conquest of many
parts of Greece by Philip II of Macedonia, and many
parts of the east by Alexander the Great, local
dialects declined, certainly for inscriptions, and a
new uniform Greek dialect emerged known as koine
or koine dialektos (common dialect). It was based on
the Attic dialect rather than the semibarbarous
Macedonian dialect. Its use spread throughout the
Greek Empire, and Xenophon was the ﬁrst writer to
use the koine.
Lexicons of ancient Greek dialects were compiled
by scholars at Alexandria in the 3rd and 2nd cen-
turies BC to aid the study of poetry.
Basic Rules of Greek
In English and other Romance languages, the pro-
nouns I, you, we and they are used with verbs to make
the sense clear, and the deﬁnite and indeﬁnite arti-
cles, the, a/an, are used with nouns. Only the deﬁnite
article is used in Greek. The use of pronouns is not
essential, as verbs have personal endings to indicate
their meanings. Pronouns such as I and you are used
only for special emphasis or to make a meaning
clear. The sense of a sentence depends on a combi-
nation of word endings and word order. Greek is an
inflected language so that what matters is not the
word order, but the ending of individual words, such
as nouns and adjectives; the basic stem of the word
remained the same, but the ending changed accord-
ing to its use.
VERBS
Verbs can be classiﬁed into two groups (called conju-
gations), depending on whether the ﬁrst person pre-
sent tense ends in -¯o (omega) or -mi. Most verbs
belong in the ﬁrst group, such as lu¯o (I set free), pher¯o
(I carry) and graph¯o (I write). The second group
forms a small class, such as ph¯emi (I say). When con-
jugated, lu¯o becomes:
lu¯o
I set free
lueis
you (singular) set free
luei
he/she/it sets free
luomen
we set free
luete
you (plural) set free
luousi(n)
they set free (the n is used before a
vowel or at the end of a sentence)
Different forms of the verb can indicate different
tenses, and there are numerous modiﬁcations to the
stem, such as adding -so to a stem for a future tense.
There are also verbs with irregular patterns. In the
case of lu¯o, the stem is lu. Examples are:
eluomen
we were setting free
lus¯o
I will set free
lusousi(n)
they will set free
elusas
you set free
leluka
I have set free
elelukei
she had set free
luein
to set free
luomai
I ransom (passive present, with slight
change of meaning)
NOUNS
Greek nouns have various endings (called cases) that
demonstrate their role in a sentence. The various
cases in the Classical period are:
Nominative:
The subject of the verb.
Vocative:
Calling to or addressing a person or,
thing, such as “Oh Muse!”.
Accusative:
The direct object of the verb.
Genitive:
Denotes possession, such as “the altar
of the god”—“of the god” is genitive.
It is also used where Latin uses the
ablative, to denote separation with
prepositional phrases such as “away
from” or “out of.”
Dative:
Indirect object of the verb, translated
as “to” or “for.” For example, “The
priest gave the offering to the god”—
“to the god” is dative. It is also used
where Latin uses the ablative.

H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
260
Apart from singular and plural, there were dual
endings, when just two things were meant.
Adjectives have similar endings and agree with
the nouns to which they are attached. Greek, unlike
Latin, uses a definite article. It is declined like an
adjective and also agrees with the noun to which it is
attached, reflecting the gender, number and case.
There is no deﬁnite article for the vocative case.
Nouns belong to one of three classes, called
declensions. Nouns ending in -¯e (eta) or -a are usu-
ally first declension feminine. Examples are tim¯e
(honor), kh¯ora (country), thea (goddess), Mousa
(Muse) and stratia (army).
SINGULAR
Nominative:
h¯e Mousa
the Muse
Vocative:
¯o Mousa
O Muse!
Accusative:
t¯en Mousan
the Muse
Genitive:
t¯es Mous¯es
of the Muse
Dative:
t¯e Mous¯e
to the Muse
(actually ends
in -i, which is
usually shown
as a subscript)
PLURAL
Nominative:
hai Mousai
the Muses
Vocative:
¯o Mousai
O Muses!
Accusative:
tas Mousas
the Muses
Genitive:
t¯on Mous¯on
of the Muses
Dative:
tais Mousais
to the Muses
With tim¯e, the nominative ends in -¯e, which is
retained throughout the singular: tim¯e, tim¯e, tim¯en,
tim¯es, tim¯e, but plural: timai, timai, timas, timon,
timais. If the nominative singular ends in -a after e, i
or r (as in kh¯ora, stratia and thea), then the a is
retained throughout the singular: kh¯ora, kh¯ora,
kh¯oran, kh¯oras, kh¯ora, and plural: kh¯orai, kh¯orai,
kh¯orai, kh¯oras, kh¯or¯on, kh¯orais. If the nominative ends
in -a after any consonant except r (such as Mousa,
but not kh¯ora), then the accusative singular ends in
-an, the genitive in -¯es and the dative ends in -¯e.
First declension masculine nouns end in -as or -¯es
such as neanias (young man) and krit¯es (judge). Sec-
ond declension nouns end in -os and are masculine
and feminine. Second declension neuter nouns end
in -on, such as dendron (tree) and ergon (deed). In the
plural, neuter nouns use a singular verb. Third
declension nouns have stems that end in a consonant,
such as phylax (guard), whose stem is phylak-, and
s¯oma (name), whose stem is s¯omat-. They decline, for
example, as: phylax, phylax, phylaka, phylakos, phylaki,
and in the plural as phylakes, phylakes, phylakas, phy-
lakon, phylaxi(n). They comprise masculine, feminine
and neuter nouns.
GENDER
In English the gender of a noun is determined by its
meaning, so that “man” is masculine, “mother” is
feminine and “house” is neuter, although there is an
archaic tendency to treat things like a country or a
ship as feminine. In Greek, there were three gen-
ders of masculine, feminine and neuter, but the
gender of a noun does not necessarily reflect what it
denotes. Most specifically female words were usu-
ally feminine, and male-type words masculine, but
neuter-type words could be feminine, masculine or
neuter. For example, biblos (book) is feminine, pota-
mos (river) is masculine and dendron (tree) is neuter.
Adjectives and definite articles also carry different
endings that relate to the number, gender and case
of the noun.
WORD ORDER
In Latin the word order is much less restricted,
although the verb is nearly always at the end of a sen-
tence, but in Greek the order is very similar to that
seen in English, with words occasionally brought to
the beginning for emphasis. A genitive is usually
placed between the definite article and noun on
which it depends. For example: he tou kritou oikia is
“the judge’s house,” but literally “the of the judge
house.” The verb can be before or after the object
and subject.
LINGUISTICS
The derivation of words—etymology—was a study
pursued by the Greeks, which became subject to
speculation by sophists and philosophers. Grammar
(grammatike) was also a subject of study, initially by
sophists in the 5th century BC with a concern to
understand the origin and nature of language and to
pursue textual criticism.

WRITING
Alphabet
The ancient Greek language was written down from
the 8th century BC using the Greek alphabet. Before
that time, syllabic scripts such as Linear B are known.
LINEAR A AND B
In Minoan Crete in the 2nd millennium BC a picto-
graphic form of writing (found mainly on sealstones
or sealings) emerged, sometimes miscalled hiero-
glyphic. The small number of symbols probably rep-
resented open syllables. This writing dates to c.
1900–c. 1625 BC.
From this script Linear A probably developed
early in the Second Palace Period. Linear A was a syl-
labic script used throughout Minoan Crete and some
other Aegean islands c. 1800–c. 1450 BC, and it is only
partly deciphered. The language has not been identi-
ﬁed. It seems to have been used for administrative
documents and on religious sites, and is found on clay
tablets, as well as objects such as stone vases and dou-
ble axes (ﬁg. 7.1). There are also a number of grafﬁti.
W R I T T E N E V I D E N C E
261
7.1 Linear A and B clay tablets: a) Linear A from Haghia Traidha, Crete, seems to relate to the issuing of wine;
b) the Linear B “tripod tablet” from Pylos carries symbols relating to tripod-cauldrons. Other vessels are also shown
with their precise number of handles.

During the Mycenaean period a syllabic script
known as Linear B was used 1450–1200 BC to write
down the Mycenaean language (probably a Greek
dialect). It was written on clay tablets and has been
deciphered by Michael Ventris as an early form of
Greek. As many of the signs are similar or identical,
Linear B probably developed from Linear A at Knos-
sos during the early Third Palace Period. Thousands
of unbaked clay tablets with Linear B script have
been found at major palace sites—at Knossos in
Crete (where over 3,000 are known) and on the
mainland at Thebes, Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos
(where around 1,200 have been found). The tablets
vary in size from 25mm to 270mm, with varying
amounts of writing. The signs were written left to
right, and the script was used for ofﬁcial accounts
and inventories, mainly of the 13th century BC. The
signs consist of around 30 logograms, ideograms or
pictographs, representing an object, person or ani-
mal, followed by one of the signs representing
weights or numerals (decimal based). There were
also about 70 signs representing syllables and vowels
that could spell out words, with a spacer or divider
between words. It seems that writing was not wide-
spread, but done mainly by bureaucratic officials
associated with palaces; it was not used for, or suit-
able for, literary purposes. Virtually all the inscrip-
tions relate to administration (lists of people,
produce and manufactured goods); only 1 percent
relate to other matters, such as some possible per-
sonal inscriptions on vases. A few storage stirrup jars
have painted Linear B inscriptions, denoting the ori-
gin or producer. Some jars have been found on the
mainland, but analysis of the clays shows that they
were made on Crete.
In Bronze Age Cyprus, Cypro-Minoan syllabic
script was used from the 15th century BC. It was
derived from Linear A and was probably an ancestor
of the later Classical Cypriot Syllabary. It was used on
baked clay tablets, bronze votives, ivories and seals.
LATER ALPHABETS
After the Mycenaean period the art of writing using
the syllabic script was lost. Evidence suggests that it
reappeared by about 750 BC in all parts of the Greek
world (but probably existed earlier than this), with an
entirely new alphabet derived from a Semitic alpha-

bet (Phoenician script). The word for letters was
phoinikeia (Phoenician things). The letters alpha to
tau were the same, although some characters were
adapted as vowels (the Semitic alphabet wrote only
consonants). In Greek the names of letters were
merely labels, but in Phoenician they had meaning
(such as aleph, ox, and beth, house). Initially there
were several local variants of the alphabet to suit the
local Greek dialects (ﬁg. 7.2). All share similar errors,
such as using wrong Phoenician names for letters.
This implies a common origin, possibly as a conse-
quence of early trading with Syria. The earliest
Greek writing was right to left, but this changed to
left to right (see INSCRIPTIONS).
Local alphabets lasted for centuries. Some dialects
had an extra letter resembling F between epsilon and
zeta (called vau and later digamma, double gamma); it
was pronounced like an English W, but the sound
disappeared from the Attic-Ionic dialect before 1000
BC and a little later from other dialects. Its use is sup-
ported in Homer’s poetry. Other letters were added,
such as those to represent the sounds ph and kh. The
Euboean and Corinthian alphabets used a C-shaped
letter for g (gamma), which the Greek colonists in
southern Italy passed to the Romans.
Differences also existed in the way letters, such as
sigma, lamda and gamma were written.
The letters from alpha to chi were used by the
Athenians to the end of the 5th century BC (Attic
script). At this time in Athens epsilon was used for all
types of e, and omicron for all types of o. Eta was
used for the aspirate h. In 403 BC Athens ofﬁcially
adopted the more developed Ionic (East Ionic or
Milesian) alphabet (ﬁg. 7.3), which ultimately pre-
vailed throughout Greece and is still used today. The
Ionic alphabet distinguished between long and short
o sounds by using omicron and omega (the latter an
open letter o). Similarly, short and long e sounds were
distinguished in that alphabet by epsilon and eta.
Diphthongs (double sounds) were also used. The let-
ter eta was not used in Ionic dialects as an aspirate,
which was ignored in writing. Occasionally the left
half of the uppercase eta (|–)was used to express the
aspirate, and the right half to express absence of the
aspirate, known as “rough breathing” and “smooth
breathing.” From these signs developed the later
signs ‘ and ’, and the aspirate is transliterated as h.
There was no speciﬁc letter for h.
The Cypriot Syllabary (or Classical Syllabary) is
the system of writing used in Cyprus from the early
7th to the end of the 3rd century BC. It consisted of
56 signs, including five vowels. It represented the
Cypro-Arcadian dialect and the unintelligible Eteo-
Cypriot dialect. More than 800 texts are known, and

A cursive script was developed for everyday let-
ters and accounts, which made use of lowercase let-
ters. Otherwise there was no distinction between
lower- and uppercase letters until the 9th century
AD. Papyri mainly used a majuscule (large letters)
script known as uncial, with very little change over
that time. There was little, if any, division between
words, little punctuation and no enlarged initial let-
ters. Even lyric poetry was written as if prose. A
rough breathing sign was sometimes added if a mis-
understanding might arise. From the 4th century BC
a short stroke (paragraphos) was placed below the line
to indicate a break, and the same symbol was used in
drama to indicate a change of speaker.
Manuscripts at the Library at Alexandria were
largely copies rather than original texts, and so
inevitably contained errors. The librarians and schol-
ars there tried to restore them to the version origi-
nally intended by the authors and added various notes
(scholia) to the texts. There were difﬁculties in inter-
pretation, because of the method of writing, with few
aids to readers. They therefore invented and added
various critical signs to indicate, for example, omis-
sions or corruption in the text. Some of these critical
signs are still used today. Aids to the reader became
more common only in the Roman period.
LITERACY
Literacy rates—the ability to read and write—are
difficult to evaluate; possibly 20–30 percent, with
lower levels of literacy among slaves and women. In
the Classical period, Spartans were largely illiterate,
and so few written records were kept.
Numerals
In Linear B there was a decimal system of numerals,
using upright strokes for units, horizontal bars for
tens, circles for hundreds, circles with rays for thou-
sands, and a symbol for 10,000. Each sign could be
repeated nine times.
The later names of Greek numerals were:

There were two systems of writing numerals. The
older system used the alphabet (with a few additions)
to represent numerals. For example, 1 to 5 was rep-
resented by alpha to epsilon. This notation system is
known as “alphabetic” or “Milesian” (ﬁg. 7.4) and
may have originated in Ionia by the 6th century BC,
to judge from the obsolete signs used. For 6, a lower-
case digamma was used, and koppa was used for 90
and sampi for 900. This method of writing numbers
was used on early Attic vase inscriptions and replaced
the acrophonic system in Greek states other than
Attica in the 3rd century BC. It is virtually the only
system used in papyri and other manuscripts. An
acute accent is usually added to letters representing
numerals up to 999. Higher numerals in the thou-
sands are written with a diacritical sign on the left,
above or below the line. Multiples of 10,000 have
their multiplier written above the M. For example,
20,000 would have the letter beta written above it.
A later (acrophonic) system of expressing numer-
als used acronyms (ﬁg. 7.5), particularly on public
inscriptions in Attica when representing money. It

was used on private Attic inscriptions from the 5th
century BC. The system seems to have been current
to c. 100 BC and occasionally later on, but was other-
wise replaced by the alphabetic system. It was also
used in other Greek states from the 5th to 3rd cen-
turies BC, when it was replaced by the alphabetic sys-
tem. Apart from the unit I (representing 1), other
numerals were represented by the initial letters of the
numeral words. Quintuples of 10, 100, 1,000 or
10,000 were a combination of their own signs with the
sign for 5. Other multiples were expressed by repeat-
ing these signs. When expressing money, drachmas
were understood if no other symbol was used.
A zero sign is found in astronomical papyri and
manuscripts. There was also a system for expressing
fractions, with 1 as the enumerator. There were spe-
cial signs for one-half and two-thirds, but there were
no special symbols for ordinal numerals such as dates.
Archimedes used an artiﬁcal system for expressing
very large numerals.
Writing Materials
CLAY TABLETS
Linear A and B scripts have been found on thousands
of unbaked, sun-dried clay tablets (fig. 7.1). The
signs were written on damp clay with a sharp instru-
ment. Records other than accounts and inventories
may have been on more perishable materials, but the
evidence is slight.
PARCHMENT AND PAPYRUS
Skins or parchment may have been used for writing
from an early date (possibly for the earliest versions
of Homer and Hesiod), although one story relates
that in the 2nd century BC an embargo was placed on
the supply of papyrus to Pergamum, and so parch-
ment (or vellum) was invented there. Parchment
(pergamene) was made from skins of cattle, sheep and
goats, and manufacture may certainly have been
improved at Pergamum. It was made up into leather
rolls known as diphtherai. Its use may never have
been as widespread as papyrus.
The earliest papyrus roll is Egyptian, dating to c.
3000 BC. In Greece papyrus was probably in general
use from the early 7th century BC (ﬁg. 7.6), imported
from the Phoenician town of Byblos (from which the
Greeks took their name biblos for papyrus, hence
bible). Papyrus was made from the pith of a water
plant growing mainly in the Nile River. The pith was
sliced vertically into thin strips, and one layer of
strips with fibers running vertically was superim-
posed on another layer with ﬁbers running horizon-
tally. The two layers were hammered together and
adhered by means of the plant’s natural gum. The
sheet was dried and the surface polished. The sheets
were about 16 in (0.4 m) wide and 9 in (0.23 m) high
and were pasted side by side to form a continuous
roll (khartes) (as papyrus does not fold well). In good-

for 1,000 from khilioi and for 10,000 from myrioi.

quality rolls seams were barely visible. Papyrus pro-
duction was later organized by the Hellenistic kings.
Writing was usually done on the side with hori-
zontal ﬁbers, but sometimes the back was also used.
Writing was done in vertical columns 2 to 4 in (55 to
100 mm) wide, with a margin between the columns
and a broader margin at top and bottom. Titles were
written at the end of the papyrus roll (the part least
liable to damage), and the roll was usually identiﬁed
by a label (sillybos) of papyrus or vellum. A roller
(omphalos) could be attached to the end of the roll. A
roll of papyrus seems to have cost the equivalent of
one or two days’ wages (possibly six days for a
laborer). Papyrus has survived mainly in Egypt, with
a few ﬁnds elsewhere.
Skytales were a secret method of communicating
between Spartan magistrates in times of war. Each
magistrate had a stick of equal size. A message was
written on a strip of leather wound around one stick.
The leather strip was then detached, and the message
could be read only if wound round the other stick.
Wooden Tablets
From the time of Homer the wooden tablet (deltos or
pinax) was used. Tablets consisted of two or more
pieces of wood, hinged on a ring or leather thong.
They were used for notes or letters and could be
used with an ink pen (kalamos). They were secured
with thread or tape and sealed with wax and the
impress of a seal. Alternatively they could be hol-
lowed out and ﬁlled with wax, which was incised with
a sharp pen (graphis); the wax could be smoothed
again with the blunt end of the pen for reuse. From
the 5th century BC wooden tablets whitened with
gypsum (leukomata) were used for temporary public
notices.
METAL AND STONE
Inscriptions of various kinds could be written on
stone or metal. See INSCRIPTIONS, below.
INK
There were two types of ink. One was made from
carbon mixed with a thin vegetable gum to give it
adhesive properties. Most writing on papyrus rolls
was done with this type of ink. As it was water solu-
ble, papyrus surfaces could be cleaned and used
again. Parchment could also be cleaned in this way,
but palimpsests of previous writings could survive.
Later, iron-tannin inks were used. Pens were made of
reed, and a stylus was used for wax tablets.
SEALS
The word for a seal was sphragis. Seals were used for
administrative purposes on documents and other
items from earliest times in Greece; they provided
authentication, identiﬁcation, privacy and security.
Seals were cut in intaglio from various materials,
usually stone, precious metal, precious stones, some-
times ivory and glass, and possibly wood. Most seals
were used by stamping a wax or soft clay sealing to
the object being secured, for example a box. The clay
sealing could not be broken without detection. Often
the sealing survives, but not the original seal. From
the Archaic period, sealings for documents were of
lead or wax, while clay was used for larger commer-
cial items.
Although seals were used for decorative purposes
since Neolithic times, their uses in the Aegean from
the Bronze Age Prepalatial Period were also admin-
istrative; they were used for monitoring the storage
and movement of goods. Seals are among the most
common small artifacts of the Bronze Age, in the
Minoan and Mycenaean periods, and are usually less

than 0.78 in (20 mm) in size (rarely more than 1.18 in
[30 mm]). The two main types were the cylinder seal
and the stamp seal (ﬁg. 7.7). A cylinder seal had a
design or inscription carved on a cylinder, which was
rolled across the sealing, producing a single or
repeated impression of the design. A stamp seal was
pressed into the sealing rather than being rolled
across it. The shape of stamp seals varies, but the
most common is lentoid. The designs range from
geometric patterns to extremely detailed groups of
animals and humans. The ﬁnest examples are from
the Second Palace Period.
Seals reappeared in the Archaic period, and the
scarab form adopted from Egypt was popular in the
late 6th century BC, with their backs carved in the
shape of the sacred scarab beetle of Egypt. Seals were
usually worn as signet rings, though they were some-
times hung from the neck or kept in a case. The main
design (device) was usually a deity, hero or animal,
and Greek cities had civic seals for documents.
Engraving of sealstones was a ﬁne art, and the use of
seals was commonplace.
See also SEALSTONES under Art, p. 409.
BOOKS
The ﬁrst literature was composed and handed down
orally, even after the development of the alphabet
from the 8th century BC. The tyrant Peisistratus in
the mid-6th century BC apparently initiated an ofﬁ-
cial written text of Homer, and prose works must
have been written down from the late 7th century
BC, as it would have been difﬁcult to transmit them
orally. Books (papyrus or parchment rolls) were not
common until the 5th century BC, and a book trade
developed at Athens from the middle of that century
and was ﬂourishing by the beginning of the 4th cen-
tury BC; books could then be bought in the agora for
less than one drachma each, and personal libraries
could be formed. Some books were illustrated, par-
ticularly scientiﬁc treatises, but also literary works.
Book rolls were themselves depicted on Attic vases
from the early 5th century BC. Books on papyrus
rolls could be stored vertically in boxes, buckets,
shelves or pigeon holes, with the rolls themselves
placed in a vellum cover (diphthera).
By the 4th century BC private reading (that is,
reading aloud) of books was well established. From
the 3rd century BC many educated slaves were used
for copying vast numbers of books, a process facili-

tated by the improved organization of the papyrus
and parchment trade. It is unknown if scribes copied
by sight or by dictation, but both methods may have
been practiced. Most surviving works of literature
are copies that date from the 9th to 15th centuries
AD. A few surviving texts date back to the 5th century
BC, but most Greek texts date to the Roman period.
Libraries
Early owners of collections of books included the
tyrants Polycrates of Samos and Peisistratus (both 6th
century BC). Euripides also owned books. Books read
by people, other than by performers such as actors and
singers, probably did not exist until the end of the 5th
century BC. Owning books continued to be uncom-
mon, and Aristotle in the 4th century BC may have
been the ﬁrst to collect books and arrange them sys-
tematically in a library at the Lyceum at Athens. His
library provided a model for the great library at
Alexandria, which was founded around 300 BC by
Ptolemy I (ruled 323–283 BC) in conjunction with a
museum—not, in this case, a temple for the worship
of the Muses, but a place to encourage the arts that the
Muses themselves cultivated. It was greatly extended
by Ptolemy II (ruled 285–246 BC), who is often con-
sidered to be the real founder. It contained between
100,000 and 700,000 volumes (papyrus rolls), and
numerous scholars became head of the library or else
worked there. It became a center of Hellenistic schol-
arship, and classiﬁed catalogs (pinakes) of its contents
were compiled under Callimachus. A second smaller
library was founded at the Serapeum. The main
library may have been destroyed in 47 BC by Julius
Caesar, though some say it was only damaged.
By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, many
other libraries existed. Another great library was
established at Pergamum by Eumenes II (197–159
BC), which apparently contained 200,000 volumes in
the 1st century BC. Pliny states that Ptolemy V
(205–182 BC) prevented the export of papyrus in
order to restrict the growth of the rival library at
Pergamum. The Seleucid king Antiochus the Great
(223–187 BC) had a library at Antioch, and the Mace-
donian king Perseus also owned a library at Pella. A
public library was only established at Athens in the
2nd century BC by a gift of a Ptolemy, and was called
the Ptolemaion. There are likely to have been
libraries in other main Hellenistic towns, and spe-
cialist libraries were attached to institutions, such as
those at Asclepieia. There is little mention of private
libraries by ancient authors, but ﬁnds of papyri sug-
gest that they certainly existed.
Archives
The Greek word for archives (arkheion) derives from
the term for “magistrates’s ofﬁce.” From the Archaic
period temple ofﬁcials kept records of dedications and
property. From the 6th century BC secular records
were kept, a practice that reached its greatest extent in
Hellenistic times. In Athens records of magistracies
were kept on pinakes (writing tablets), leukomata
(whitened boards) or papyri. At the end of the 5th cen-
tury BC these archives were housed in the metroon.
INSCRIPTIONS
Epigraphy is the study of the form and content of
inscriptions. It generally deals only with inscriptions
cut, scratched or impressed on durable materials
such as metal and stone, either in an ofﬁcial form or
casually by an individual (a graffito). The Greek
word for inscription is epigraphe. The term epigraphy
does not usually include coin legends, painted
inscriptions (such as on pots) and texts written in ink
(such as on papyrus). Paleography is the study of
handwriting on manuscripts such as papyri, parch-
ment and writing tablets. Papyrology is the study of
papyri and writing tablets.
Unlike literature, which could have been copied
many times with the original version no longer
extant, inscriptions provide an original record of writ-
ing. Many provide additional information on con-
temporary historical events. They have been found
on various types of monuments throughout the
Greek world, although most are no longer in situ or
were reused in ancient times (incorporated into city
walls, for example). Many inscriptions are fragmen-
tary and mutilated, and new ones are constantly dis-
covered. Tens of thousands of Greek inscriptions
survive. Many were inscribed for public display, as
there was no other way of disseminating information.

Dating
The earliest inscriptions are those in Linear A and B.
Inscriptions using the Greek alphabet date from the
later 8th century BC and continue through the
Roman period. The earliest of these inscriptions are
on potsherds of the later 8th century BC. More formal
inscriptions occur from the early 7th century BC,
either on gravestones or as dedications to deities.
Greek inscriptions are difﬁcult to date with accuracy,
quite often only to the nearest century or to the
Roman period. Some can be dated by reference to
known events or people, and some inscriptions do
incorporate a precise date, with a record of the day,
month and year, primarily in ofﬁcial decrees and lists.
Many cities identiﬁed the year by the name of the
chief magistrate: in Athens the eponymous archon
dated the year (see chapter 10, CALENDAR). An inscrip-
tion can be dated if the name of the archon was
included and if he can be identiﬁed. Some inscrip-
tions in the Ptolemaic Empire can be dated by the
inclusion of the regnal year of the particular Ptolemy.
At times an inscription can be dated only by the style
of lettering and writing, but this is unreliable.
Writing
Greeks originally wrote from right to left (retro-
grade), and most (but not all) early inscriptions fol-
low this pattern. Later on, if a second line was
required, it was done from left to right like a hairpin
bend. The earliest examples of Greek inscriptions
have these alternate lines running from right to left,
then left to right, known as boustrophedon (as the ox
turns—signifying the ox pulling the plow in succes-
sive furrows). Even the letters are turned around to
face the appropriate direction (ﬁg. 7.8). This pro-
vided an easy method of reading. Some 7th- and 6th-
century BC inscriptions were vertical, such as those
written on vases to identify ﬁgures. The boustrophe-
don style of writing persisted to the 5th century BC,
such as in the Gortyn law code.
A left-to-right system of writing was virtually uni-
versal by the 5th century BC. In the 6th century BC
the Athenians in particular adopted a system of writ-
ing inscriptions known as stoikhedon (in a line). The
letters were aligned exactly, both vertically (in
columns) and horizontally, irrespective of their width
(ﬁg. 7.9). Virtually all Athenian inscriptions in the
Classical period were cut in this way, but the system
went out of use by the end of the 3rd century BC.
Ligatures (combining letters) were not used until
Roman times.
There was no spacing between words, clauses and
sentences in inscriptions, although in dedications and
epitaphs a natural break between words often
occurred at the end of a line. In inscriptions of public
documents, though, the wording was continuous.
Some punctuation was used, especially in the Archaic
period, such as a colon or three superimposed dots to
divide a group of words (not individual words), but
the practice died out and was not revived until Roman
times. Uppercase letters were mainly used, although a
cursive type of writing developed for everyday use,
with lowercase letters increasing the speed of writing.
Stone-cut inscriptions were often colored with
paints (which rarely survive). These were usually red,
but sometimes alternate lines were colored in red
and black, a practice that was possibly widespread.
Types of Inscriptions
There were numerous types of inscriptions, both
public and private, but they are rarely found before
460 BC. Public ones recorded ofﬁcial transactions of
the state, including law codes, treaties with cities,
7.8 Hairpin bend type of boustrophedon inscription. It
was written on a block of sandstone at Olympia and reads
Bubon teterei kheri hyperkephala m’hyperebaleto
ho ph . . . (Bubon threw me over his head with one
hand.) It dates to the mid-6th century BC. The last 
letters are missing.

decrees of the assembly, war memorials, financial
accounts, items dedicated in temples, lists of magis-
trates, lists of epheboi, winners of competitions, and
Athenian tribute lists. The most numerous public
documents come from Athens. Private documents
largely consist of gravestones, but also include con-
tracts and other legal documents, manumissions,
dedications to gods, wills, property contracts, and
grafﬁti.
Many inscriptions were on stone slabs and bronze
plaques, and their purpose was to display informa-
tion to the people of a city-state, particularly in
democracies. Not all were permanent records; many
were temporary notices written in charcoal on
whitened boards (leukomata) and displayed in the
agora or else on whitened plastered walls. In Athens
some records were on papyrus and were stored in the
metroon, which served as a public record office.
Athens used marble for many inscriptions, but where
marble was not readily available, cities used bronze
plaques, often with holes so that they could be
attached to a wall (ﬁg. 7.10). The most famous Greek
inscription is on the Rosetta Stone, which also con-
tains translations into the hieroglyphic and demotic
Egyptian scripts.
Athens in particular recorded a good number of
decrees of the Assembly and boule on stone slabs and
displayed them on the Acropolis or elsewhere in the
city. The decrees used a standard formula, including
an introduction, the name of the prytany tribe, the
names of the archons and other ofﬁcials, the date and
the proposer of the decree. After democracy was
reestablished at Athens in 307/306 BC, annual tablets
were inscribed listing all 600 members of the boule,
each with patronymic and deme.
Many inscriptions recorded honors awarded to
men in their own lifetimes, often in the form of hon-
orary decrees issued by the council or in the name of
the people. Large numbers of these honorary decrees
survive. In time the wording became increasingly
verbose. It was also an annual custom in Athens in
times of war to commemorate those who had died in
battle.
Didaskaliai were ofﬁcial records of dramatic per-
formances, giving the festival name, the eponymous
archon, names of plays and dramatists (in order of
success), best actor, khoregoi and (in the case of
dithyrambic competitions) the name of the victorious
tribe and best ﬂute player. In the 4th century BC Aris-
totle compiled a book of didaskaliai, which has not
survived, but some inscriptions on stone do survive.
One class of inscription includes inventories, cat-
alogs, building accounts and financial accounts.
These mainly consisted of lists with ﬁnancial infor-
mation. For example, inventories were maintained
of the contents of temple treasuries. At Athens valu-
able gifts were regularly given to Athena, and annu-
ally appointed commissions of citizens were

responsible for the treasures. Each year an inven-
tory was taken before handing over responsibility to
the next commission. Every four years the lists seem
to have been recorded permanently on stone. They
were very repetitive, with each year’s acquisitions
added at the end, and contained many examples of
the acrophonic system of numerals (ﬁg. 7.5). Similar
in format are building records, which listed expendi-
ture item by item for a particular year; information
about the building of public monuments can be
gained from such records.
Dedicatory inscriptions to deities can be very
simple, such as “of Zeus.” Many dedicatory inscrip-
tions contain the word anetheke (dedicated), although
the verb can be omitted (ﬁg. 7.11). Dedications nor-
mally contain the dedicator’s name (in the nomina-
tive), object being dedicated (in accusative, although
this is not always present) and the recipient’s name
(in the dative). A reason for giving the dedication
may also be included. Some are in verse and some in
prose. Where inscriptions record the dedications of
buildings, such as a temple, a list of the officials
involved in the construction may be included. Unlike
other inscriptions, dedicatory inscriptions often use
spacing between words and symmetry in layout,
rather than continuous unspaced text.
7.10 Inscription on a bronze plate dating to c. 500 BC and found at Olympia. It records in the local script of Elis a treaty
of 100 years between Elis and Heraea, stating that any offender should pay one talent of silver to Zeus at Olympia. It
contains various archaic features of the dialect, including use of digamma and rhotacism (use of rho for sigma).

Inscriptions on boundary stones are of various
types; they record the limits of a sanctuary, public
area or privately owned property (ﬁg. 7.12); some are
mortgage stones, which mark private property
pledged as security on a dowry or mortgage.
Funerary inscriptions on the numerous types of
gravestones form the largest class of inscription—
around two-thirds of surviving Greek inscriptions.
Epitaphs give little information and commonly con-
sist only of a person’s name (usually in the nomina-
tive, sometimes in the genitive, occasionally dative).
The deceased person’s deme and patronymic may
also be mentioned. For women, the father’s name
and deme might be added and, if married, the hus-
band’s name and deme as well. The exact age of the
deceased is rarely mentioned—more important, the
person’s status might be reﬂected in the sculpture. In
the Hellenistic period the name was often accompa-
nied by khaire (farewell) and an adjective might be
added, the most common being khrestos (khreste if
female; good or upright). In some parts of Greece it
was common for the deceased to be described as
heros (deceased). Longer epitaphs also occur, some
with a long account in verse of the life of the
deceased. Prose eulogies were not used. Painted
commemorative inscriptions occur on cinerary urns
(Hadra vases) from Alexandria in Egypt.
Manumission inscriptions record the means by
which a slave was liberated. They are sometimes
fairly brief but can be lengthy. Numerous “freedom
by dedication” manumission inscriptions are known
at the sanctuary at Delphi (ﬁg. 10.4).
The earliest surviving inscriptions occur scratched
on potsherds from the later 8th century BC and are
found across the Greek world (Magna Graecia to the
Black Sea). They consist of names or brief personal
comments. Inscriptions scratched or incised on pots
or potsherds after manufacture are known as grafﬁti,
while painted ones done before or after firing are
called dipinti. The latter usually represent commercial

information, such as indication of quantity and qual-
ity of contents, and are on the underside of pots; they
are usually too faint to read. Thousands of such infor-
mal inscriptions on pots and potsherds are known,
including the simple practice of writing the alphabet,
names of owners, shopping lists and complicated
messages. Many contain obscene remarks and sexual
insults. Ostraka record the names of politicians a per-
son wished to ostracize (ﬁg. 1.12). Inscriptions could
also be painted on pots during manufacture, before
ﬁring, such as signatures of potters and painters, the
names of the ﬁgures portrayed on the pot and some-
times even the words spoken by the ﬁgures.
Modern Conventions
In printing Greek inscriptions today, the text can
either be written continuously or with a division of
lines corresponding to that of the actual inscription.
The following conventions are used to represent var-
ious aspects of the inscription, especially when it is
being published for the ﬁrst time:
[ ]
Brackets represent restoration of lacunae and
enclose letters that are illegible or totally lost.
[[ ]]
Double brackets indicate letters that were
erased in antiquity.
abc
Letters once visible, but no longer so.
<<>>
Double angular brackets enclose letters that
were inscribed over letters that were erased.
( )
Parentheses are used to expand an abbrevia-
tion, or more commonly to provide a word
needed to make sense of the Greek original.
For example, “Cimon of Miltiades” means
“Cimon (son) of Miltiades.”
< >
Angular brackets enclose letters that were
omitted in error by the original stonecutter.
{ }
Hooked brackets indicate duplicated (too
many) letters or words done in the original
inscription.
A•
A dot placed beneath a letter indicates that it
is not fully legible, due to decay or erasure,
but identiﬁcation is reasonably certain.
+
The letter is too badly damaged to identify.
|
A vertical stroke indicates the beginning of a
fresh line on the inscription.
||
Two vertical strokes can indicate the begin-
ning of every fifth line, sometimes with a
number in the margin (5, 10, 15 etc.).
. . . .
The number of dots on or below the line indi-
cates the precise number of missing letters.
– – –
Dashes can indicate where an uncertain num-
ber of letters is missing.
vvv
The number of vs indicates the precise num-
ber of uninscribed letter spaces.
Arrows are used to indicate the direction of writing.
PERSONAL NAMES
Men and women usually had only one personal
name, given at birth. On marriage women did not
change their names. It was customary for the eldest
son to be named after his father’s father. In Homer
7.12 An inscription on a boundary stone reading “I 
am the boundary of the Agora.” It is inscribed in Attic
lettering and dates to c. 500 BC. It marked the boundary
of the sacred precinct.

a hero was often called not by his own name 
but by a form of his father’s name (patronymic)—
Agamemnon is sometimes called Atreides (son of
Atreus).
If identiﬁcation needed to be clariﬁed, the father’s
name in the genitive (the patronymic) could be added,
such as “Cimon of Miltiades” (a practice of the histo-
rians Herodotus and Thucydides), or in Athens the
deme name or city, such as “Pericles, of Xanthippus,
Cholargeus” (son of Xanthippus, from the deme of
Cholargos). These additions were not used as a form
of address. Slaves could be given ordinary names, but
more commonly received names indicating their place
of origin, appearance or qualities.
Thousands of names are known, particularly at
Athens where over 30,000 citizens are known by
name (more than in any other ancient state). Most
names were a compound of two honorific words,
such as “Megacles” (of great fame), or a shortened
version, such as Nicias (victorious), while some names
reflected personal characteristics, such as Plato
(broad-shouldered). Many names incorporated the
name of a deity (theophoric), such as Apollodorus,
Dionysius and Demetrios. In these names, deities of
ill-omen (such as Pluton) and ones of insufficient
dignity were excluded. Boys could be named after
goddesses and girls after gods. It is also possible to
identify those names that are foreign in origin. By
the Classical period, patronymics had become actual
personal names, such as Miltiades. A patronymic
was sometimes added to indicate the clan (genos) of a
person, so Philiades indicated someone from the
clan of the Philaidae. Nicknames were not heredi-
tary. They were often given to Hellenistic rulers,
along with honoriﬁc surnames, such as Philadelphus
and Soter.
Prosopography (from the Greek prosopon, person,
and graphein, to write) is the listing in alphabetical
order of names of people, usually derived from
inscriptions.
EDUCATION
Although writing was reintroduced from the later
8th century BC, there is no evidence for schools until
at least the mid-7th century BC. Up to then training
must have been given to certain parts of the commu-
nity in numeracy, poetry and religious ritual.
Sparta
From the 7th century BC a militaristic type of educa-
tion (agoge, “raising”) was established at Sparta,
adapted entirely to maintaining military strength.
Between the ages of 7 and 20, boys were removed
from their families and housed in state barracks,
where the emphasis was on sports and physical edu-
cation, as well as dancing and music (because of their
military uses), but only basic reading and writing (see
also chapter 3, TRAINING). Girls, as future mothers
of warriors, also undertook physical training, gym-
nastics, dancing and music.
Classical Athens
Early education may have been for priests, scribes
and poets. Evidence for general literacy occurs from
the introduction of ostracism, when citizens wrote
names on potsherds (ﬁg. 1.12), and by the 5th cen-
tury BC most male citizens seem to have been liter-
ate. Schools existed from the end of the 6th century
BC. Boys attended school from the age of six or
seven; fees were relatively low because teachers were
poorly paid. Most teachers were slaves, but were
sometimes freedmen, with the head teacher usually
being a freedman. Boys were accompanied to school
by a slave called a paidagogos.
The three main branches of education were writ-
ing, music and gymnastics, although it is uncertain if
they were taught in one or more buildings. Reading,
writing, arithmetic and literature were taught by a
grammatistes (teacher of letters); literature involved
reciting and memorizing passages from poets, espe-
cially Homer, for moral training. Music and lyric
poetry were taught by a kitharistes (lyre player), and
physical education by a paidotribes (trainer).
Girls could receive the same sort of education,
although it is unclear if they attended the same
schools or received education in the seclusion of
their homes. Girls tended to be taught domestic
skills at home by their mothers. Most girls were

I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E

denied any sort of education other than the running
of a household. 
In the 5th century BC no organized system of
higher education existed. Sons of wealthier parents
usually continued their children’s education to the age
of 18 with specialist teachers in medicine, law,
rhetoric or the increasingly popular courses given by
the sophists. In the late 5th century BC sophists
(sophistes) were itinerant intellectuals, mainly from
Ionia and southern Italy, who went from city to city
giving instruction and lectures in a wide range of sub-
jects for a fee. These included the new subjects of
geography, mathematics and science. Many sophists
concentrated on language and literature and trained
their pupils in public speaking. Sophists met a need
for higher education, and some amassed large for-
tunes. The word “sophist” does not refer to a school
of thought but to professional teachers.
Later on the best-known schools at Athens were
Plato’s Academy (Akademia, founded c. 385 BC), Aris-
totle’s Lyceum (Lykeion, founded 335 BC) and Iso-
crates’ school of rhetoric and philosophy (founded c.
392 BC). At Plato’s Academy on the northwest out-
skirts of Athens by the river Cephissus, the instruc-
tion was mainly in science and philosophy, with no
ﬁxed curriculum or ﬁxed age. Its goal was the pursuit
of knowledge. It was the site of a public gymnasium
and sanctuary outside the city walls dedicated to the
Attic hero Academus (or Hekademus), surrounded by
gardens and groves. Here Plato’s school lasted until
AD 529.
Aristotle’s Lyceum or Peripatos (the Walk) was a
research establishment to the east of Athens, with a
grove or sanctuary and gymnasium. It was estab-
lished in a grove sacred to Apollo Lyceius (the Wolf-
Apollo), from which it took its name. It was founded
to systematically collect, organize and preserve
human knowledge. Its library was an essential ele-
ment of the establishment. The scholars were called
Peripatetics, probably from peripatos, a shaded or
colonnaded walk. It was modeled on Plato’s Acad-
emy, but in the 3rd century BC the ﬁeld of study was
reduced to biography and literary criticism.
Isocrates’ school concentrated on rhetoric, which
was reputedly developed in Sicily in the mid-5th cen-
tury BC and was reﬁned by the sophists. It was the
learning of the art of oratory, and it became essential
for men embarking on a political career, particularly
in Roman times. Isocrates ran his school for 50 years
and charged 1,000 drachmas for a course of three or
four years. See also chapter 9, PHILOSOPHY.
Hellenistic
By c. 335 BC at Athens young men (epheboi) of age 18
spent two compulsory years attending an ephebic
college (ephebia) in physical and military training.
After 305 BC military service was no longer compul-
sory, and the ephebia became an educational estab-
lishment for the wealthy. By the end of the 2nd
century BC it had become a school primarily of liter-
ature and philosophy. From c. 332 BC annual lists of
epheboi undergoing military training were produced,
and these lists continued into the Roman period even
after military training had ceased.
In the Hellenistic period education remained
private, but it was under greater state control. Edu-
cation was now split into three main groups: paides
(up to the age of 14), epheboi (up to the age of 18)
and neoi (over 18), with girls apparently receiving
the same education in the same establishments. At
Athens the term epheboi was used for those over 18;
there were no neoi. Elementary education remained
unchanged, but a system of secondary education
emerged. Most cities had at least one gymnasium
with an attached public library, supervised by a gym-
nasiarkhos, a public official elected for one year. At
the gymnasia, physical training was taught as well as
philosophy, literature, music, mathematics and sci-
ence, forming a general education (enkyklios paideia),
which was a forerunner of the medieval Seven Lib-
eral Arts.
After the age of 18 some education continued in
schools, but those with sufﬁcient wealth went to the
great centers of learning at Alexandria, Rhodes and
Pergamum for philosophy and rhetoric, and to Cos,
Pergamum and Ephesus for medicine.
LITERATURE
There was no ancient Greek word for literature.
Only a small amount of literature survives, including
the names of over 370 playwrights, 44 complete
plays, and titles and fragments of more than 1,600

other plays. More science exists than any other type
of Greek writing.
Poetry
Greek literature began as poetry. Originally, heroic
myths were told as oral epic poetry, and even later
Greek poetry was still generally intended to be sung
or chanted to an audience to the accompaniment of
music. Professional reciters of poetry included rhap-
sodists (from rhapsodos, song stitcher). They often
recited Homer, but also other poetry, and were espe-
cially common in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, com-
peting at public festivals and games. They originally
accompanied themselves on the lyre, but later
declaimed poems unaccompanied. Homeridae were
a guild of reciters of Homer’s poetry in Chios.
Anthologies of poems were collected from the 4th
century BC, but most have been lost. The ﬁrst known
anthology was by Meleager in 80 BC, called the Gar-
land. Anthology (anthologia) originally meant “bou-
quet,” but from Byzantine times came to mean a
collection of poems. Collections of epigrams have
survived in the Greek Anthology. Alexandrian poetry is
the term commonly given to Greek poetry (other
than the New Comedy of Athens) composed
between c. 300 BC and c. 30 BC. At that time Alexan-
dria was the literary capital of the Greek world, and
much of it was written there.
METER
Unlike English verse, which relies on stressed and
unstressed syllables, Greek verse did not rely on
accent but on quantity—the number of long and
short syllables in a line. The various meters have dif-
ferent patterns of long and short syllables, which in
analysis are indicated by the signs ¯ and ˘. For exam-
ple, there was a long ¯e (eta) and a short ˘e (epsilon),
which would form part of long and short syllables
respectively. Examples of meters include iambic,
pentameter and hexameter. The latter was the meter
of epic poetry, some hymns and bucolic poetry.
EPIC POETRY
This was secular poetry on a grand scale, relating at
length the heroic deeds of men or gods. It usually
focused on events that were believed to have taken
place in the region’s past. An epic poet (epopoios) was
literally one who composed hexameter verses (epe).
The earliest surviving Greek epic poems are
Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey (8th century BC). Epic
poetry probably had its origins in prehistoric oral
epic narrative. Such epic poetry would have been
recited or chanted by a bard to the accompaniment
of a lyre. It was written in an Ionic dialect with some
Aeolic elements.
The Epic Cycle is a collection of epic poetry
(excluding the Iliad and Odyssey) written by different
poets in the 7th and 6th centuries BC and sometimes
attributed to Homer. These poems were arranged in
chronological order of subject, extending from the
beginning of the world to the end of the heroic age.
They were well known in the 5th and 4th centuries
BC, and were a source for dramatic and lyric poets.
They were little read later on, and only 120 lines
now survive. The Epic Cycle included a Trojan and a
Theban cycle. The poetry of Panyassis (5th century
BC) represents the end of this phase of epic poetry. It
continued to be written but was no longer of the
same quality. Antimachus of Colophon (c. 400 BC)
wrote long epic poems, and in the 3rd century BC
Apollonius Rhodius wrote an epic Argonautica in four
books.
EPYLLION
This was a very small epic poem (epyllion) of a few
hundred hexameter lines, usually on the life of a hero
or heroine, particularly on the subject of love. Epyllia
were popular during Hellenistic times, from c. 300
BC (Theocritus onward).
LYRIC POETRY
This type of poetry (lyrikos) was sung to the accom-
paniment of a musical instrument, usually a lyre.
Only the poetry exists today, as evidence for the
musical accompaniment has been lost. The two types
were monody (monodia, solo song) and choral song,
both of which were known to Homer. Monody con-
sisted of short poems written in various meters. The
subjects were of a personal nature, and this type of
poetry was probably performed on private occasions.
The lyric poetry of Sappho, Alcaeus and Anacreon
was largely monody.

Scolia (skolia, sing. skolion) were drinking songs,
mainly Attic, performed at banquets or drinking par-
ties and accompanied by the lyre. A guest holding a
myrtle branch would sing and then pass that branch
to another guest. The term derives from skolios
(crooked), because the scolia were sung in random
(crooked) order. There is evidence for some choral
scolia. Terpander was traditionally the originator of
scolia. They were apparently popular in the 6th and
5th centuries BC, but then stopped being composed.
Choral lyric poetry was sung by a chorus, accom-
panied by music and sometimes by dancing (khoros
means dance, although not all choral music seems to
have been accompanied by dancing). The music was
usually the lyre, sometimes the aulos (ﬂute). It was
performed from earliest times on public religious
occasions. The poems could be quite long. There are
many types of choral lyrics, some mentioned as early
as Homer. This genre of poetry became increasingly
secular. Poets included Alcman, Stesichorus,
Simonides of Ceos, Pindar and Bacchylides. It was
written in Doric dialect.
Maiden songs (partheneia, sing. partheneion) were a
form of choral lyric; they were processional hymns
sung by a chorus of girls on religious occasions. The
earliest example is by Alcman (7th century BC). The
procession song (prosodion) existed by the mid-8th cen-
tury BC. The hyporchema (hyporkhema, pl. hyporkhe-
mata; “dance song”) was a lively form of choral lyric
accompanied by dancing with mime. A hymenaeus
(hymenaios, pl. hymenaioi) was a wedding song sung by
the attendants accompanying the bride to the groom’s
house. The epithalamium (epithalamion, literally “at
the bedroom”) was a wedding song performed by
young men and girls outside the bedroom on the
wedding night.
The dithyramb (dithyrambos, a word of unknown
origin) was a choral lyric sung to the god Dionysus. It
was developed by Arion of Corinth in the late 7th
century BC and became especially popular when it
was made the subject of competition in the festivals of
Dionysus from 509 BC. Poets composing dithyrambs
included Lasus, Simonides, Pindar and Bacchylides.
The subject matter was not necessarily connected
with Dionysus. Dithyrambs were performed by a 50-
strong chorus without masks who danced and sang in
the orchestra of the theater. At the City Dionysia at
Athens, each tribe entered two choruses (one of boys,
one of men) for the dithyrambic competitions. They
were staged at the expense of a wealthy choregos
(khoregos, pl. khoregoi) appointed from each tribe. The
winning choregos (not the poet) would receive a tri-
pod, which was then dedicated to the gods. At Athens
there was a “street of the tripods” where winning
tripods were erected (ﬁg. 7.13).
In the early 5th century BC the nature of dithy-
rambs began to change, with the music becoming
more important than the words (against which Prati-
nas protested in one poem), and lyric solos were
introduced. By 300 BC the expenses of the production
7.13 The Choregic Monument of Lysicrates at Athens,
which stood in the Street of the Tripods. It originally
supported a victory tripod won by Lysicrates who was 
the winning choregos in 335–334 BC. The monument
consists of a square base and a tall cylinder with engaged
Corinthian columns. The frieze has carvings of a
narrative of Dionysus.

were borne by the state. Dithyrambic competitions
lasted into the Roman period, although they had lost
their importance after the 4th century BC.
The nome (nomos, pl. nomoi) was originally a tune
or melody. It was a term applied to the type of melody
invented by Terpander for epic poetry. In the 5th cen-
tury BC it was used for a type of choral lyric poetry
similar to the dithyramb (such as Timotheus’ Persae).
An encomium (enkomion) was a choral hymn cel-
ebrating a person rather than a god. Encomia were
often sung at the end of banquets. A type of
encomium was the epinician ode (epinikion), a victory
or triumphal ode sung in honor of the victor at one
of the great games, such as charioteers and wrestlers.
They were usually sung when the victor returned
home. The major poets of this genre were Pindar
and Bacchylides. Another type of encomium was the
threnos, a lament for a dead person.
A paean was originally a hymn sung to Apollo in
his role as healer, but it came to be used for any
hymn to Apollo and to other gods, and was also sung
on other occasions, such as by the guests after the
libation before the symposium. In Hellenistic times,
paeans were addressed to successful individuals.
Greek armies going into battle sang a paean to ask
support from a god and to help maintain order while
approaching the enemy. A hymn (hymnos) was a song
in honor of a god or hero. The Homeric Hymns
were a collection of literary epic-style hexameter
poems addressed to various gods and relating their
deeds; they were written in the 8th–6th centuries BC
and were originally attributed to Homer. Some were
short, some very long, and they may have been
recited at the festivals of particular gods. Later,
hymns became devotional lyric poems sung by cho-
ruses; they gave the names and epithets of the god, a
recital of his deeds and a short prayer. Many cult
hymns must have existed but few survive. Poets
included Pindar, Alcaeus, Alcman and Bacchylides.
The 5th century BC marked the end of the major
phase of lyric poetry, after which the choruses in
drama became preeminent.
ELEGIAC POETRY
This verse composed in elegiacs (elegiac couplets) is
sometimes classiﬁed as lyric poetry. The word elegos
may have derived from a word meaning “flute,”
which possibly originally accompanied its recitation.
It was composed of alternate hexameter lines (the
meter of epic poetry) and pentameter lines. Elegiacs
date from the late 8th century BC and were used for
various types of poetry, such as for expressing per-
sonal sentiments, love poems, military exhortations,
laments, and inscriptions commemorating the dead
(epigrams). Elegiac poets included Tyrtaeus, Mimn-
ermus, Solon, Phocylides, Callinus and Theognis.
EPIGRAMS
The word epigram is derived from epigramma,
“inscription.” Epigrams as inscriptions commemo-
rating the dead (epitaphs) date from the 7th century
BC. They were initially written in hexameters and
then in elegiac couplets, in the local dialect. Elegiac
epigrams became popular from the mid-6th century
BC, especially in Attica, the most famous being by
Simonides. Epitaphs were often written in the ﬁrst
person, as if the dead person were addressing the
passerby, and they were inscribed on gravestones or
votive tablets. They were inscribed without the
poet’s name, so the certain attribution of epigrams to
speciﬁc poets is uncertain. They continued in use for
centuries.
From the 4th century BC the word epigram was
also used for brief poems not intended for inscription
on stone. They were usually elegiacs and usually
about a single event; themes of wine and love were
extremely popular. It was only in the 1st century AD
(Roman period) that the characteristic feature of an
unexpected or witty ending was added. The Greek
Anthology is a collection of 16 books of epigrams. It
was based on two anthologies, one of which is known
as the Palatine Anthology and contains 3,700 epi-
grams. The other was a collection made around AD
1300 and includes 400 epigrams not in the Palatine
Anthology.
IAMBIC POETRY
This poetry was mainly in the iambic meter; the
word iambos is of unknown derivation, but was ﬁrst
used by Archilochus for his satirical poems (7th cen-
tury BC). The rhythm was apparently closest to
speech, and poems were often satirical, abusive,
political or moral in tone, spoken or chanted, but not
sung to music. It became the standard meter for the
spoken dialogue in tragedy and comedy.

BUCOLIC POETRY
The genre of bucolic or pastoral poetry (boukolika)
was first used by Theocritus (3rd century BC),
although it probably had earlier origins. The name is
derived from boukoloi (herdsmen). This type of
poetry continued to be written by minor poets
throughout the Hellenistic period. It was similar to
the earlier epic poetry, as it was written in hexame-
ters, but was short in length. It described the life of
ordinary country people, such as herdsmen and
laborers, rather than the heroes of epic.
Drama
Drama had its origins in choral lyric, and although
actors were used, the chorus remained a major ele-
ment, playing the role of groups of people within the
play (such as people of the city) or the role of narra-
tors. The chorus both danced and sang, and Greek
tragedy and comedy were musical productions. All
the actors were men, even though there were female
parts, and much of the audience was male, although
priestesses are known to have been present in the
audience. The presence of other women remains
contentious. Plays were performed in theaters, in a
large circular area (orchestra) surrounded by seats.
They were staged as competitions in religious festi-
vals. Most comic poets wrote only comedies, and
tragic poets only tragedies. Preﬁxed to each play was
a hypothesis, an introductory note giving an outline of

The word tragedy is from tragoidia, meaning goat
song, possibly because the chorus wore goat skins, or
a goat was sacriﬁced or there was a prize of a goat. It
possibly means “song for the sacrificial goat”. It
derives from tragos (goat) and oide (song). Only
tragedy written in Athens (Attic tragedy) survives,
and what was once termed Classical Greek tragedy is
now termed 5th-century Athenian tragedy. Tragedy
seems to date from the mid-6th century BC, and the
earliest surviving play is Aeschylus’ Persians (472 BC).
Tragedy may have developed from the productions
of dithyrambs, and it was believed to have had an
Attic or Peloponnesian origin. The inventor of
tragedy was allegedly Thespis (c. 535 BC), who intro-
duced an actor to deliver prologues and converse
with the chorus, marking a change from choral pro-
ductions to drama. Another view held in antiquity
was that tragedy evolved from satyr plays, although
any link with goat skins is unlikely.
Tragic plays consisted of choral song in lyric
meters (accompanied by the ﬂute) interspersed with
dialogue, mainly in iambic trimeters. Little is known
of the type of dancing performed. By the end of the
5th century BC the role of the chorus had diminished.
Early choruses may have been large (possibly 50
members, although this is disputed), but in most plays
there were 12 or, later, 15 singers in the chorus. Cho-
ruses continued to be used in tragedy throughout the
5th century BC and part of the 4th. At ﬁrst only a sin-
gle actor (protagonist) was used (introduced by Thes-
pis), so that the spoken parts were monologues.
Aeschylus added a second actor (deuteragonist), and
Sophocles a third (tritagonist). There were rarely
more than three actors in tragedies, although an actor
could play several parts. The word for an actor was
hypokrites (one who answers, or an interpreter). Poets
occasionally acted in their own plays. 
All actors and the chorus wore masks appropriate
to the part, probably borrowed from masks worn in
Dionysiac rituals, but the flute player was not
masked. The masks were made of glued pieces of
linen, sometimes wood or cork, and could cover the
entire head. They had lifelike hair. Masks depicting
women were painted white, as female complexions
were generally much paler as they spent so much
time indoors. The holes for the eyes and mouth were
a little exaggerated so that they could be seen clearly
by the audience. Female parts were played by men.
Nonspeaking actors or “extras” were called spear
carriers (doryphoremata).
The theme of the plays was tragic, though the
plays themselves were not necessarily sad, and nearly
all were based on a limited number of myths, rarely
on contemporary themes or recent history. Very
occasionally there was a happy ending, but these
were regarded as inferior. Performances were con-
fined to competitions at the festivals of Dionysus
until the Hellenistic age, so that tragedies were per-
formed on only a few occasions each year. Any par-
ticular play was performed only on one occasion.

The most important festivals for staging tragedies
were the City Dionysia and the Lenaea (ﬁg. 7.14).
Some plays could be produced for a second time at
the Rural Dionysia, but at the City Dionysia they
could be produced for a second time only if they had
been previously unsuccessful and had been revised.
After the death of Aeschylus an exception was made
with a decree that anyone could produce his plays at
the City Dionysia. From 386 BC, earlier tragedies
were allowed to be produced.
Festivals were organized by the state, with the
City Dionysia under the control of the eponymous
archon. Three tragic poets were selected by the
archon and were allocated an actor, but the main costs
of the chorus were the responsibility of the choregos.
The tragic poets each submitted three tragedies, orig-
inally a trilogy of closely related themes, but later,
three distinct themes. They were also required to
submit a satyr play (p. 283), the four plays being
known as a tetralogy. The winning poet received a
wreath, and from 449 BC the best protagonist actor
also received a prize. Money prizes were probably
also given. The judges (kritai; sing. krites) of the con-
test were drawn by lot from each tribe. The arrange-
ments at the Lenaea and Rural Dionysia were similar,
although metics could also participate. Tragedy was
introduced to the Lenaea c. 432 BC, held under the
auspices of the archon basileus. Two poets competed
with two plays (there was no satyr play).
Tragic plays normally consisted of a prologue
(prologos), with a monologue or dialogue introducing
the play before the entrance of the chorus. Earlier
tragedies began with the entrance of the chorus who
provided the prologue. Next came a parados, a song
performed by the chorus as it entered. This was fol-
lowed by epeisodia (sing. epeisodion), scenes or episodes
with the actors (tragoidoi) and chorus. These were
divided by stasima, songs performed by the chorus

“standing in one place” in the orchestra. After the
last stasimon came the ﬁnal scene or exodos. By the
4th century BC tragedy was declining, and old
tragedies tended to be revived for festivals. Very little
is known of later tragic poets. At Alexandria in the
3rd century BC a Pleiad of seven tragic poets was at
the court of Ptolemy II (including Homerus,
Lycophron, Philicus, Sositheus and Alexander).
At the end of the 4th century BC, Lycurgus at
Athens ordered that one copy of every tragedy of
Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripidies should be
deposited in the archive, and many of these were
studied by later scholars.
COMEDY
The word comedy is from komoidia, derived from
komos, a procession of revellers singing and dancing.
Only Attic comedy—that written in Athens—sur-
vives and is divided into three phases: Old Comedy
(486–400 BC), Middle Comedy (400–323 BC) and
New Comedy (after 323 BC). Comedy seems to date
from at least the 6th century BC, and the earliest sur-
viving play is Aristophanes’ Acharnians (produced in
425 BC). Comedy may have developed from the cho-
rus of men who accompanied the phallic symbols in
the Dionysiac festival processions at Athens, but the
date at which this evolved into drama is uncertain.
Comedy may also have had early roots in Sicilian and
Megarian drama. Early comedy was composed in
Sicily, but the earliest Attic comedy is known as “Old
Comedy” (or Aristophanic Comedy), which refers to
plays produced in the 5th century BC. The only sur-
viving complete plays of this period are by Aristo-
phanes, but there were earlier comic poets, and
fragments and records survive of 32 other comic
writers. Other authors of Old Comedy include Crat-
inus, Crates, Pherecrates, Eupolis and Plato.
Old Comedy plays consisted of choral song alter-
nating with dialogue, but with a less regular pattern
than tragedy. The chorus was composed of 24 men,
and there were three or, more often, four actors and
several extras. The chorus was of particular impor-
tance, often characterized as animals and birds, and
many plays took their titles from the chorus, such as
Babylonians, Birds and Wasps. The actors wore
grotesque costumes with artiﬁcial exaggeration.
The plays were humorous and uninhibited, with
many of the jokes based on sex and excretion. Unlike
tragedy, they did not rely on myths for themes.
Instead, they ridiculed, parodied and exaggerated
contemporary characters and issues, as well as gods,
myths and religious ceremonies. Performances were
staged at competitions at the City Dionysia under a
magistrate from 488/487 or 487/486 BC (and possi-
bly staged by volunteers before then). At the Lenaea
they were ﬁrst included just before 440 BC. Origi-
nally five comedies were produced at the City
Dionysia and Lenaea, but only three during the
Peloponnesian War. Comedies were also performed
at the Rural Dionysia in the 4th century BC.
Old Comedy plays could consist of a prologue
(prologos), before the entrance of the chorus, followed
by a parados, a song performed by the chorus as it
entered. Next came the agon (contest), a debate or
physical ﬁght between the two adversaries (the main
hero and the opponent), punctuated by choral songs.
The actors then left the stage, and in the parabasis the
chorus came forward and addressed the audience,
often on subjects of no relevance to the plot. There
followed various epeisodia, scenes or episodes, and
then the ﬁnal scene or exodos.
Middle Comedy is Athenian comedy from c. 400
to c. 323 BC, developing from the end of the Pelo-
ponnesian War. It was a time of experimentation,
and no single play represents the type. The role of
the comic chorus diminished greatly, and the paraba-
sis disappeared, as did the grotesque padded costume
and enlarged leather phallus that the actors wore.
Plots based on mythology and political satire gradu-
ally gave way to less abrasive humor concerned with
ordinary lives and issues, including mistaken iden-
tity, and they were more cosmopolitan in nature. No
complete play from Middle Comedy survives.
Authors (many non-Athenian) included Antiphanes,
Eubulus, Anaxandrides, Timocles and Alexis. From
339 BC comedies that had been previously staged
only once at competitions were allowed to be pro-
duced again.
New Comedy is Athenian comedy from the death
of Alexander the Great (323 BC) to the death of Phile-
mon (c. 267/263 BC). They were performed all over
the Greek world. Plays were divided into ﬁve acts,
with unconnected choral interludes. They were set in
Athens, but writers were drawn to Athens from other
cities. Actors still wore masks, but otherwise wore
everyday dress. Themes were no longer political, but
probably developed from Middle Comedy, which was

concerned with family relationships, including love,
mistaken identity, intrigues of slaves and long-lost
children. Plays had stock characters, such as pimps,
courtesans, soldiers, young men in love, genial old
men and cross old men. They continued to be popu-
lar into the Roman period, but little New Comedy
has survived, although there have been recent
papyrus discoveries of Menander’s plays. Dramatists
included Menander, Diphilus and Philemon.
SATYR PLAYS
Less is known about satyr plays than any of the other
types of play. Each tragedian was required to submit
a satyr play with three tragedies for the City
Dionysia. They were short, almost comic pieces, but
only one has survived complete—Euripides’ Cyclops.
They were farces, with a chorus of satyrs, led by a
Silenus, wearing horses’ trunks, tails and an erect
phallus. From the mid-4th century BC the satyr play
was largely dropped, with just one being performed
at the beginning of each festival.
History
The ﬁrst written prose consisted of laws, dating from
the 7th century BC, but from the mid-6th century BC
other prose works developed. The writing of history
(historiography) began in Ionia in the late 6th cen-
tury BC, coinciding with the development of science
and philosophy. The word history derives from the
Ionian word historie. Prose works were therefore
written in Ionic. These early historians of the 6th
and 5th centuries BC were called logographers
(logographoi). They were prose writers, as distinct
from poets, the most notable being Hecateus of
Miletus of c. 500 BC. The term logographer was also
used for those who wrote speeches for others to per-
form. Very little work of these historians survives.
They created a historical science, writing in prose
about local history and more general history, partic-
ularly mythology and the traditions of poetry. In
order to compile a chronological framework, they
also kept lists of annual magistrates, Olympian vic-
tors, priests, priestesses and other similar regular
occurrences.
Throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BC local
histories continued to be written. Those writing about
Attica were called atthidographers. A history of Attica
is called an Atthis (pl. Atthides), literally, Atthis historia
(history of Attica). This type of history was particu-
larly popular from c. 350 BC to c. 250 BC, in an
attempt to relive the glories of Athens’ past.
Greek history proper (historiai, inquiries) began
with Herodotus (“father of history”) c. 450 BC, and
other major historians included Thucydides and
Xenophon. As written by Herodotus, history
included other topics, such as archaeology, ethnogra-
phy, religion and geography. From c. 300 BC the
Hellenistic historians aimed at being popular rather
than accurate. From the time of Polybius in the 2nd
century BC, Roman history preoccupied Greek his-
torians.
Biography
Some earlier historians undertook partial biogra-
phies or sketches of notable people, such as in the
writings of Thucydides and Xenophon, but the
whole life of a person was not explored. The ﬁrst
work approaching true biography was Isocrates’
Evagoras (c. 365 BC). The writing of biography
proper developed under Aristotle in the 4th century
BC, when he encouraged the writing of bioi (lives, or
ways of life). There was particular interest in infor-
mation about authors, because of the light it could
throw on their writings. Alexandrian scholars contin-
ued this tradition in the 3rd century BC.
Letters
A letter (epistole) was written to someone either on
wooden tablets or papyrus. It had to be carried by a
private messenger. The earliest letters survive in
Egypt on papyrus from the 3rd century BC. They
have an address mark on the back, and begin and end
with formulas that varied little over the centuries.
Surviving letters before the Roman period are usu-
ally either private or concerned mainly with adminis-
trative details. They were not letters possessing
literary merit, nor were they intended for subsequent
publication. Letters were also used to express ideas,
such as ideas on philosophy by Epicurus and on sci-
ence by Archimedes. Surviving letters attributed to
famous Greeks are nearly all spurious.

Novels
Greek novels were long, romantic, fictional prose
compositions, which developed from Hellenistic
times. They may have originated in rhetorical train-
ing, where imaginary situations were used in decla-
mation, although other origins are possible. Novels
could extend to several books. Several papyrus frag-
ments have survived. The genre flourished in the
Roman period.

MUSIC AND DANCE
Information on music comes from surviving remains,
mentions in literature, and depictions in art such as
frescoes and pottery vases. Music (mousike, art of the
muses) was an essential element of everyday life, pre-
sent in literature, religion, festivals, funerals, marriages
and symposia (where prostitutes played music). Music
and dance were vital components of a child’s education,
especially lyre playing. The value of music was empha-
sized by philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.
There were also professional musicians. Until the mid-
5th century BC Sparta was the musical center of
Greece, and Terpander is said to have founded a school
of music there, where the ﬂute and lyre were taught.
The main function of music was as an essential
accompaniment to poetry and dance. Most poetry,
such as epics, lyrics and the choruses in tragedy and
comedy, was sung or chanted to the accompaniment of
some sort of music. The words were as important as
the music, which was composed by the poet. Leading
composers were Archilochus, Sappho, Pindar and
Sophocles, but little is known of their compositions.
Homeric poetry was chanted to the accompaniment of
a lyre, lyric poetry was sung to the lyre, and choral
lyric was accompanied by dancing and music. Solo lyre
playing and duets of ﬂute and lyre were also practiced.
Virtually all of the games, but especially the Pythian
Games, had music competitions as well as athletic
ones. These included instrumental solos and singing
to the accompaniment of an instrument. Winners of
such contests were honored as much as athletes. Peri-
cles built the Odeum at Athens to house the musical
contests of the Panathenaic Games. At the Dionysia
and Thargelia festivals, choirs of 50 men from the 10
Attic tribes competed, mainly in singing nomes.
In the 4th century BC music became more impor-
tant than the words in lyrical performances, a trend
that met with opposition. Likewise, the songs of the
chorus in tragedies were replaced with musical inter-
ludes only.
Instruments
A few musical instruments (organa) have survived,
dating from the Late Bronze Age onwards. The main
ones were the lyre and ﬂute. The two types of lyre
were the lyra and kithara, the latter a more substan-
tial instrument. The lyre was considered to be the
superior instrument and mainly accompanied lyric
poetry. Unlike a harp, the lyre and cithara (ﬁg. 7.15)
had seven vertical strings of equal length, which were
plucked with the left hand and with a plectrum held
in the right hand (no bow was used). The lyre rested
against a person’s body. The strings were stretched
over a bridge to a crossbar where there were pegs for
tuning. The pitch was regulated by the tension and
possibly the thickness of the strings. The sound box
was originally a tortoise shell, later replaced by a box
7.15 A marble relief of a Muse playing a cithara

made of wood and ox hide. Sappho and Alcaeus used
a type of lyre with longer strings and lower pitch
known as a barbitos (or barbiton). Homer used a sim-
ple lyre with only three to ﬁve strings, known as a
kitharis or phorminx. Minoan and Mycenaean citha-
ras had seven strings or more, and seven strings were
apparently reintroduced by Terpander in the 7th
century BC.
The now misnamed flute (aulos, pl. auloi) was
actually an instrument with a double pipe with a dou-
ble reed mouthpiece, which was held out in front,
similar to a clarinet or oboe, allegedly invented by
the goddess Athena. The cylindrical or conical pipes
were made of reed, wood, bronze, bone or ivory,
originally with three holes, which had increased to
six by the early 5th century BC. By the late 5th cen-
tury BC a longer pipe with up to 16 holes was used.
The aulos was mainly used to accompany dithyrambs
and dramatic choruses of tragedy and comedy. It was
also used to accompany Pindar’s odes. It was played
mainly in pairs by one person, possibly at the same
time or separately. The pipes were not always of the
same length.
The syrinx (Pan pipes) was an instrument of seven
or fewer reed pipes bound together and blown with-
out the reed mouthpiece of the aulos. The pipes were
of the same length but were stopped internally at
graduated intervals. The familiar stepped shape is
Etruscan and Roman. Based on the same principle
was the water organ (hydraulis) with rows of gradu-
ated pipes; this instrument was invented in the 3rd
century BC by Ctesibius of Alexandria. The plagios
aulos was a ﬂutelike instrument—a single pipe played
sideways.
There were also percussion instruments, such as
cymbals (kymbala), a hand drum (tympanon), rattles
and castanets (krotala). “Brass instruments” (made of
bronze) were used mainly for military purposes, such
as the salpinx (trumpet) and keras (horn).
Scores
Music was based on a large number of scales or
modes (harmoniai), with names such as Aeolian, Ion-
ian and Dorian. The modes were associated with
particular emotions. Music was almost all melodic,
with virtually no harmonization. Choruses, for
example, sang in unison, with no deviation from the
melody, although the accompanying musician may
sometimes have deviated from the melody. Surviving
scores (mainly on papyrus, but also on pottery and
stone) are very fragmentary, 46 in all, but the
rhythms seem to have reflected the meter of the
poetry. There were two types of alphabetic notation,
one for the voice and one for the instruments. Trea-
tises on music have survived, the earliest being part
of a 4th-century BC treatise on music theory by Aris-
toxenus of Tarentum.
Dancing
The art of mousike included poetry, dancing and
music. Dancing was a popular form of entertainment
from at least the time of Homer, taking place at wed-
dings, funerals, harvests and religious occasions.
Public religious festivals were accompanied by music
and dancing, with simple rhythmical movements
performed by a chorus (khoros, dance). The word
khoros can mean chorus, dance or dancing-ground.
By Archaic times the male chorus sang as well as
danced in performances of choral lyric poetry, usu-
ally under the direction of a leader. Choruses also
had a role in tragedy and comedy. Dithyrambs were
also sung and danced in honor of Dionysus.
Dancing was part of a child’s education and also
part of gymnastic training as preparation for war,
particularly in Sparta. War dances with weapons
were performed, the best known being the Pyrrhic
dance. Dancing was for groups of people, not cou-
ples. Professional dancers (usually slaves and prosti-
tutes) often entertained at dinner parties. More than
200 names of dances have survived, including partic-
ular dances in tragedy and comedy, such as a lewd
kordax in comedy and a stately emmeleia in tragedy.

critics regarded him as one of the ﬁve great tragedi-
ans. The philosopher Menedemus believed his satyr
plays second only to those of Aeschylus. He possibly
wrote 44 plays; titles of 19 are known.
Acusilaus of Argos (Akousilaos):
He lived just
before the Persian Wars, c. 500 BC. His three books,
called Genealogies or Histories, were accounts of epic
heroes.
Aeneas Tacitus (Aineias, Aeneas, the Tactician):
Fourth century BC. A writer of handbooks on military
practice, of which one survives on besieging cites. He
is sometimes identified as Aeneas of Stymphalus,
leader of the Arcadian Confederacy in 367 BC.
Aeschylus (Aiskhylos):
525/524–456/455 BC, born
at Eleusis. The earliest Greek tragic poet whose
work survives. He fought in the battle of Marathon
(490 BC) and possibly at the battle of Salamis (480
BC). He was said to have been unsuccessfully prose-
cuted for divulging the secret rites of the Eleusinian
Mysteries in one of his plays. He visited Syracuse to
produce plays for Hieron I and died at Gela. He
wrote 80–90 plays (including satyr plays), of which
over 70 titles are known. He won at least 13 victories
(the ﬁrst in 484 BC) in the competitions at Athens,
and had the unique honor, after his death, of having
his plays produced with a chorus.
Aeschylus is believed to have been the real founder
of Greek tragedy, responsible for increasing the num-
ber of actors and reducing the role of the chorus. He
added a second actor, and Sophocles a third, seen in
his later plays. Seven plays survive: Persians (Persai,
produced in 472 BC and his only surviving tragedy on
an historical subject), Seven against Thebes (467 BC),
the Oresteia trilogy of 458 BC (Agamemnon, Choephori
[libation bearers] and Eumenides), the Suppliants (or
Suppliant Women, possibly 463 BC) and Prometheus
Bound (uncertain date; possibly not by Aeschylus).
Some fragments of satyr plays also survive. Aeschylus
took the leading role in many of his own plays (nor-
mal for that time) and was himself portrayed as a
character in Aristophanes’ Frogs.
Aesop (Aisopos):
A slave from Thrace who lived on
Samos in the early 6th century BC. Ancient tradition
made him the inventor of fables, a short story in
prose or verse ending in a moral, and a collection of
fables was attributed to him.
Agatharchides of Cnidus (Agatharkhides):
Second
century BC. He was a historian, geographer and gram-
marian, and served as a private secretary in the court
of Ptolemy VI. He was also a proliﬁc writer, and his
surviving works include Events in Asia, Events in Europe
(histories) and On the Red Sea, a collection of ﬁve
books. He was forced to ﬂee Alexandria because of the
persecution of scholars by Ptolemy VIII in 145 BC.
Agathon (Agathon):
c. 447–c. 401/400 BC. One of
the most important Athenian tragedians, though less
than 40 lines of his poetry survive. He was the ﬁrst to
construct an imaginary subject with imaginary char-
acters, rather than use mythology. He also intro-
duced changes in the music, making choral odes
mere interludes not essential to the plot. His ﬁrst vic-
tory in the dramatic competitions was at the Lenaea
in 416 BC. Toward the end of the Peloponnesian War
c. 407 BC, Agathon (like Euripides) abandoned
Athens for the Macedonian court of Archelaus,
where he died. Agathon appears as a character in
Plato’s Symposium, which represents a feast held at
Agathon’s house to celebrate his ﬁrst victory, and in
Aristophanes’ Thesmophoriazusae.
Alcaeus (Alkaios):
Born c. 620 BC, date of death
unknown. A lyric poet from Mytilene in Lesbos (ﬁg.
7.16), Alcaeus was closely involved in the politics of
Mytilene when, allied with Pittacus, his brothers
overthrew the tyrants there and later fought the
Athenians for possession of Sigeum (a key strong-
hold on the Hellespont) c. 606 BC. Pittacus turned
against them, forcing Alcaeus into exile in Egypt. He
was apparently allowed to return to Lesbos. Alcaeus
mainly wrote lyrical songs about contemporary poli-
tics, and also love songs, drinking songs and hymns
to the gods. He used a variety of meters that were
later adapted to Latin poetry by Horace. His work
survives only as fragments.
Alcaeus of Messene (Alkaios):
c. 200 BC. He was
an epigrammatist, and composed some biting epi-
grams on Philip V of Macedonia, one of which was
apparently repeated all over Greece. Fifteen epi-
grams survive in the Greek Anthology.

Alcidamas (Alkidamas):
Early 4th-century BC sophist
and rhetorician from Elaea in Aeolis. He taught
rhetoric mainly at Athens. A pupil and follower of
Gorgias, he opposed the theories of Isocrates. He
emphasized the importance of improvisation. One
speech survives (On Those Who Write Written
Speeches, or On the Sophists) and fragments survive of
his textbook on oratory (Mouseion).
Alcman (Alkman):
A lyric poet of c. 610 BC, he
was probably Laconian (but possibly from Sardis)
and lived in Sparta. His work consisted mainly of
choral lyrics for festivals. His poems appeared in six
books, all lost except for some fragments. His
partheneia (maiden songs) were especially popular,
and the longest surviving fragment (and the earliest
piece of choral lyric poetry) is from a partheneion.
Alexander Aetolus (Alexandros):
Born c. 315 BC,
he was from Pleuron. A versatile poet, known partic-
ularly as a tragic poet, he was contemporary with
Aratus at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas (c. 276
BC), and also worked for Ptolemy II sorting out the
tragedies collected for the Alexandria Library. Of his
own tragedies, only one title survives (Dice-players).
Alexander Polyhistor (Alexandros, very learned):
c. 105–c. 50 BC. A historian, born at Miletus and
brought to Rome as a prisoner of war, he was freed by
the Roman general Sulla c. 80 BC and took the
Roman name Lucius Cornelius Alexander, becoming
a pedagogue. He wrote copiously on a wide range of
subjects. He died in a ﬁre at Laurentum in Italy.
Alexis (Alexis):
c. 375–c. 275 BC, from Thurii. He
was a comic poet at Athens, spanning Middle and
New Comedy. He apparently wrote 245 plays, and
his popularity continued into the Roman period
when his plays were adapted by Roman comedians.
Anacreon (Anakreon):
Born c. 570 BC. A lyric poet
from Teos, Ionia. He may have moved with colonists
to Abdera and later moved to the court of Polycrates,
tyrant of Samos. At the fall of Polycrates (523 BC) he
was brought to Athens, where he had many patrons.
He wrote lyric songs to be performed at symposia, as
well as elegiac and iambic poems, collected in ﬁve
books. Only a few poems survive. He is believed to
have died at a great age at Abdera.
Anaxandrides (Anaxandrides):
Possibly of Rhodes,
active c. 380 to after 349 BC as a Middle Comedy
poet. He won ﬁrst prize 10 times from 376 BC, three
times at the Lenaea. He apparently wrote 65 plays, of
which 41 titles and many fragments survive.
Androtion (Androtion):
c. 410–340 BC. An Athen-
ian politician, he was exiled to Megara where he
wrote in eight books a history of Attica (Atthis) down
to 343 BC. His history, now lost, was the major
source for the Atthis of Philochorus and for Aristo-
tle’s Constitution of Athens.
Anticleides (Antikleides):
Floruit early 3rd century
BC. He was from Athens and wrote a history of
Alexander the Great, a mythological and historical
account of homeward journeys (Nostoi) and an
account of Delos.
Antigonus of Carystus (Antigonos):
Late 3rd
century BC, from Carystus. He was apparently a
bronzeworker and a biographer of contemporary
philosophers (for which he gained popularity). He
also wrote about works of art.

BC, probably from Paros. He is the earliest Greek
lyric poet. Little is known of his life, but he colonized
Thasos and fought there and was later apparently
killed in battle. He quarreled with Lycambes over
marrying his daughter Neobule, and his invective
poems allegedly led to their suicide. He wrote short
poems, often innovative in nature, in a variety of
meters (elegiac, iambic, trochaic), many on the sub-
ject of his own affairs. He was a great poet, and much
survives in quotations by later writers and in some
papyrus fragments, but no single complete poem

Polybius and extensively used by Strabo and
Diodorus.
Epicharmus (Epikharmos):
A 6th–5th-centuries
BC comic poet from Sicily (probably Syracuse). He
worked at the court of Hieron I. Some titles and
fragments of plays survive, indicating a burlesque
treatment of myths. Several plural titles suggest that
he used a chorus. He wrote in the Sicilian Doric
dialect. Epicharmus was later regarded as author of
several philosophical and quasi-scientific works,
which is unlikely.
Eratosthenes (Eratosthenes):
c. 280–c. 194 BC.
From Cyrene, the first to call himself philologos
(scholar). He became head of the Alexandria Library
(after Apollonius Rhodius), and was a versatile
scholar in astronomy, geography, mathematics,
poetry, philosophy, grammar and chronography.
Only quotations from his work survive, which
included On Ancient Comedy (in at least 12 books),
the Chronographia (in which he presented dates of lit-
erary and political history free of myth), On the Mea-
surement of the Earth (in which he fairly accurately
calculated the circumference of Earth) and Geograph-
ica (a scientiﬁc geography).
Erinna (Erinna):
Probably 4th-century BC poetess
from the island of Telos near Rhodes who died at the
age of 19. She was famous for The Distaff (Elakate) of
300 hexameter lines, of which fragments survive. It
was written in memory of her friend Baucis.
Euhemerus (Euemeros):
c. 300 BC, from Messene.
Author of an inﬂuential novel Sacred Scripture (Hiera
anagraphe) about an imaginary journey to utopian
islands in the Indian Ocean, chief of which was Pan-
chaea. The mythological gods, such as Zeus, Cronus
and Uranus, were once great kings of this island, dei-
ﬁed by their grateful people (hence, “euhemerism”).
This theory was very relevant to Hellenistic rulers of
the time. Only fragments survive.
Eumelus (Eumelos):
Floruit c. 730 BC. An epic
poet from the ruling Bacchiad family in Corinth. He
wrote Corinthiaca, in which he describes mythical
and heroic ﬁgures of Corinth’s history, and a famous
Prosodion (procession song) for the Messenians to
sing at the festival of Apollo on Delos. Other works
are doubtfully attributed to him.
Euphorion (Euphorion):
Fifth century BC. He won
four victories in the drama festivals with tragedies
written by his father Aeschylus, but not produced in
his lifetime; he defeated Sophocles and Euripides in
431 BC.

Euphorion (Euphorion):
Born c. 270 BC. A poet
from Chalcis in Euboea. He became wealthy
through a liaison with the widow of Alexander of
Corinth (died c. 245 BC) and subsequently took up
the post of librarian to Antiochus the Great at Anti-
och. He mainly wrote epic-type poetry on mytho-
logical subjects, especially the hexameter epyllion.
His works were much praised at Rome by poets in
the 1st century BC.
Eupolis (Eupolis):
Active c. 429–412 BC; died 405
BC. One of the most famous Old Comedy poets,
along with Aristophanes and Cratinus. He produced
his ﬁrst play in 429 BC and won three victories at the
Lenaea and at least one at the City Dionysia. Nine-
teen titles and over 460 fragments survive. He was
killed during the Peloponnesian War.
Euripides (Euripides):
c. 485–c. 406 BC. This
Athenian tragedian is regarded as one of the greatest,
but little is known of his life (ﬁg. 7.17). He was not
active in politics, although he went on an embassy to
Syracuse. His family came from Phyle and was prob-
ably wealthy. He was apparently acquainted with
Anaxagoras, Socrates and Protagoras. He used to
compose in a cave on Salamis, and in 408 or 407 BC,
allegedly embittered by lack of success, he went to
the court of Archelaus of Macedonia to produce
plays, where he died c. 406 BC.
Euripides wrote 92 plays, of which about 80 titles
are known. He competed 22 times at the City
Dionysia (the ﬁrst time in 455 BC). He won ﬁrst prize
only in 441 BC, in 428 BC (with Hippolytus), twice
more and posthumously (possibly 405 BC). Nineteen
plays survive, of two groups. The following group of
10 was selected c. AD 200 for use in schools, accom-
panied by notes:
Alcestis (438 BC, second prize)
Medea (431 BC, third prize)
Hippolytus (428 BC, ﬁrst prize)
Andromache (c. 426/425 BC)
Hecuba (c. 424 BC)
Trojan Women (415 BC, second prize)
Phoenician Women (c. 409 BC; concerning the sons of
Oedipus)
Orestes (408 BC)
Bacchae (405 BC; notes lost; posthumously produced)
Rhesus (probably not genuine)
Other plays are from an alphabetic group (letters
E to K in Greek survive):
Helen (412 BC)
Electra (c. 417 BC)
Children of Heracles (Heracleidae) (c. 430/428 BC)
Madness of Heracles (c. 417 BC)
Suppliant Women (c. 422 BC; on the burial of the
Seven against Thebes)
Iphigeneia in Aulis (405 BC; posthumously produced)
Iphigeneia in Tauris (c. 414/413 BC)
Ion (c. 410 BC)
Cyclops (a satyr play, not a tragedy; date unknown,
probably late)

of a Greek sculpture

Some other plays survive as papyrus fragments,
which are at times substantial.
Hecateus (Hekataios):
c. 550–490 BC or later, from
Miletus. One of the earliest Ionian logographers,
writing about the past in prose. Initially he opposed
the Ionian revolt against Persia (499–494 BC), know-
ing the extent of the Persian Empire from his travels,
but was later one of the leaders of the revolt. He
wrote a Periegesis (a guide) to illustrate a map he had
compiled (possibly of the world); over 300 fragments
survive, and it was used extensively by Herodotus.
He also wrote Genealogies (or Histories), tracing fam-
ilies back to mythical times, only fragments of which
survive.
Hecataeus of Abdera (Hekataios):
Floruit c.
315–285 BC (?). He trained as a philosopher and lived
in Egypt under Ptolemy I. He wrote a history of
Egypt, a large part of which is preserved in book one
of Diodorus Siculus.
Hegemon (Hegemon):
Fifth-century BC parodist
from Thasos, probably the ﬁrst to establish parody as
a literary genre.
Hegesias of Magnesia (Hegesias):
Third-century
BC orator and historian. His speeches do not survive,
but he was criticized in the Roman period by Cicero
and others. Fragments remain of his History of
Alexandria.
Hellanicus (Hellanikos):
Traditional dates 490–405
BC. A logographer from Lesbos who wrote proliﬁ-
cally on various subjects. Twenty-four titles and
extensive fragments are known. His work included
the genealogies of epic heroes, various regional and
local histories, the ﬁrst history of Athens (Atthis), a
list of the priestesses of Hera at Argos and a list of
victors at the Carnea in Spartan.
Hermagoras of Temnos (Hermagoras):
Floruit c.
150 BC. The most inﬂuential rhetorician of Hellenis-
tic times, who compiled a lost handbook on rhetoric.
Hermesianax (Hermesianax):
Early 3rd-century BC
poet (born c. 300 BC) from Colophon. He was a pupil
of Philetas. His works included Persica, as well as
Leontion in three books, which were erotic love ele-
gies named after his mistress Leontion.
Hermippus (Hermippos):
Active c. 436/435–c. 415
BC. Athenian comic poet and brother of Myrtilus.
Ten titles and 100 fragments survive. Hermippus
won one victory at least at the City Dionysia (435 BC)
and four at the Lenaea (the ﬁrst c. 430 BC).
Hermippus of Smyrna (Hermippos):
Late 3rd-
century BC biographer of lawgivers, famous writers
and philosophers. He worked in Alexandria and was
imaginative rather than historically accurate.
Herodas or Herondas (Herodas/Herondas):
c. 300–
250 BC, from Cos or Miletus. Writer of literary
mimes (mimiamboi) in the iambic scazon meter. Eight
mimes and the beginning of a ninth are known from
papyrus discoveries: The Bawd, The Pimp, The School-
master, The Women Worshippers, The Jealous Mistress,
The Private Conversation, The Shoemaker, The Dream
(mutilated) and Women Breaking a Fast (fragmentary).
Herodotus (Herodotos):
Traditional date 484–420
BC. Historian, son of a distinguished family from
Halicarnassus (ﬁg. 7.18). He withdrew or was exiled
to Samos in the political troubles of the 460s BC and
then traveled extensively before joining the Athenian
colony at Thurii (founded 443 BC) where he died.
He spent some time in Athens, including much of his
latter years. He is author of Histories (Historiai)—nine
books on the Persian War, with numerous digressions
on various topics. It covers the struggle between
Greece and Asia from the time of Croesus (mid-6th
century BC) to the withdrawal of the Persians from
Greece after their defeats at Plataea and Mycale.
Herodotus was regarded as the “father of history” by
Cicero and others.
Hesiod (Hesiodos):
c. 700 BC. Epic poet, one of the
earliest known Greek poets. His father gave up
unprofitable seafaring business and left Aeolian
Cyme for Ascra, a village near Mount Helicon in
Boeotia. Hesiod tended sheep on Mount Helicon
where he heard the Muses call him to write poetry
and sing of the gods. He won a tripod at the funeral
games of Amphidamas in Chalcis with a hymn (pos-
sibly the Theogony). Hesiod was author of Theogony

(dealing with the origin and genealogies of gods) and
Works and Days (advice on undertaking honest work,
including much practical instruction on agriculture).
The Shield of Heracles is probably not by him, but by
an imitator in the 6th century BC. Other poems (now
lost) have been ascribed to him.
Hieronymus of Cardia (Hieronymos):
c. 364–260
BC. Historian from the death of Alexander the Great
(323 BC) to the death of Pyrrhus (272 BC) or perhaps
to 263 BC. He was a general and statesman for
Eumenes of Cardia, and after his death in 316 BC,
Hieronymus served Antigonus I, his son Demetrius
and his grandson Antigonus II Gonatas. He had ﬁrst-
hand knowledge of many of the events he related,
and his history (now lost) was much used by later
writers. He died at the age of 104.
Hipponax (Hipponax):
Floruit c. 540–437 BC.
Iambic poet from Ephesus, probably from a noble
family; exiled to Clazomenae. He wrote satirical,
scurrilous and even abusive poetry, and invented the
scazon meter. He has been credited with the inven-
tion of parody. His poems survive only in fragments.
A story relates that he quarreled with the sculptors
Bupalus and Athenis, who made a caricature statue of
him; he abused them with such offensive poetry that
they hanged themselves.
Homer (Homeros):
Probably 8th century BC. Epic
poet, generally regarded as the greatest and earliest
Greek poet. Nothing is known of Homer. His place
of origin and date were disputed by the Greeks. It is
now thought that he cannot be earlier than the 8th
century BC or later than c. 700 BC. He may have
originated from Chios (home of the Homeridae, a
guild of reciters) or Smyrna; he certainly came from
an Ionian-speaking region. He is regarded as the
author of the epic poem Iliad and its sequel the
Odyssey, although there is a possibility that they were
written by different people; perhaps they were the
result of oral tradition. The title of the Iliad is
derived from Ilion (Troy); it is about a single episode
in the Trojan War—the wrath of Achilles and the
disastrous consequences. The poem is divided into
24 books, as is the Odyssey (Odysseia). The latter is
not the story of a war, but of a lone hero and records
the return of Odysseus to his homeland, Ithaca, from
the Trojan War. Other epic poems were sometimes
attributed to Homer in antiquity, including Margites
and Batrachomyomachia.
Ibycus (Ibykos):
Sixth century BC (floruit 564 or
536 BC). A lyric poet from Rhegium. He apparently
refused to become tyrant and went to work at the
court of Polycrates on Samos. Originally his work
was collected in seven books, mainly choral songs,
encomia and personal love songs in various meters.
Fragments survive. He was allegedly killed by rob-
bers and buried at Rhegium.
Ion of Chios (Ion):
c. 490/480–c. 422 BC. Poet and
prose writer who spent much time in Athens. He was
known mainly for tragedies, but also wrote other types
of poetry and possibly comedies. He was defeated by
Euripides’ Hippolytus (428 BC) but later won ﬁrst prize
at the City Dionysia for tragedy and dithyramb. He
was variously reported as having written 12, 30 or 40
plays, and a few titles are known. He also wrote some
W R I T T E N E V I D E N C E
297

prose works, including Epidemiae (Visits), Founding of
Chios and Triagmos (on Pythagorean philosophy).
Isaeus (Isaios):
c. 420–c. 350 BC. Attic orator, pos-
sibly from Chalcis (Euboea). He was a logographer,
composing speeches for others to deliver. Fifty
speeches were known, of which 11 and part of a 12th
survive, all on issues of inheritance.
Isocrates (Isokrates):
436–338 BC (died at the age
of 98). Athenian orator of importance. He was from
a respectable but poor Athenian family. He played no
direct part in politics, but for a living wrote speeches
as a logographer for others to perform in the courts
(ﬁg. 7.19). He opened a school at Athens c. 392 BC to
train others in rhetoric; it became famous, attracting
pupils from all over the Greek world, including
Androtion, Hyperides, Isaeus, Ephorus, Theopom-
pus and Timotheus. Several of his political writings
and rhetorical exercises survive, as well as six
speeches and nine letters. They include Against the
Sophists (391 or 390 BC) and Antidosis (353 BC), both
on education; Panegyricus (festival oration, published
in 380 BC); Plataicus (written as a plea for retaliation
after Thebes destroyed Plataea in 373 BC); On the
Peace (denouncing imperialism and advocating a
Common Peace and colonization of Thasos, written
in 355 BC just before the end of the Social War);
Philippus (346 BC, written after the Peace of
Philocrates, calling on Philip II of Macedonia to
unite the entire Greek nation against the Persians);
and Panathenaicus (339 BC, comparing the achieve-
ments of Sparta and Athens).
Ister (Istros):
c. 250–200 BC. Historical researcher
and atthidographer, possibly from Cyrene. He was a
pupil of Callimachus. His main work was Attika in 14
books, which dealt only with mythical Attic history.
His Atakta also dealt with Attic history.
Lasus (Lasos):
Born c. 548–545 BC, from Hermione
(Argolis). An early lyric poet and musician. He
worked under the patronage of Hipparchus (brother
of the tyrant Hippias). He wrote hymns and founded
Athenian dithyrambic poetry. He exposed Ono-
macritus as a forger of oracles of Musaeus. Most of
his poetry is lost.
Leonidas of Tarentum (Leonidas):
First half of
3rd century BC (possibly later). Writer of epigrams
who apparently led a poor wandering life. He was
one of the best and most imitated poets of his time.
About 100 epigrams survive, most of which are
highly pessimistic; some were genuine dedications
and others imaginary. He wrote about the poor
rather than love and feasting (about which his con-
temporaries Asclepiades and Posidippus wrote).
Lycophron (Lykophron):
Born c. 320 BC. Tragic
poet from Chalcis who went to Alexandria c.
285–283 BC to work in the library, initially sorting
the comedies. He was author of 64 or 46 tragedies, of
which 20 titles are known. His only surviving work is

Alexandra, a dramatic monologue of 1,474 lines in
iambic trimeters, although its authorship is disputed.
Lycophron was one of the Pleiad of tragic poets.
Lysias (Lysias):
Traditional dates 459–380 BC.
Attic orator (ﬁg. 7.20). Son of a rich Syracusan living
at Athens, he went to Thurii for some years with his
brothers. Returning to Athens, they ran a successful
shield-manufacturing business but were proscribed
by the Thirty Tyrants in 404 BC. Lysias escaped to
Megara but returned in 403 BC. From then on, he
became a professional speechwriter (logographos) and
reputedly wrote over 200 speeches for others to per-
form. He could not speak in court, being a metic
and not a citizen. Thirty-ﬁve speeches survive (23
complete).
Machon (Makhon):
Mid-3rd century BC. New
Comedy poet who moved from Corinth or Sicyon to
Alexandria, where he staged comedies. He also wrote
in iambic verse a book of anecdotes (Chreiai) about
notorious Athenian prostitutes and their associates.
Manetho (Manethon):
Floruit c. 280 BC. Historian
and Egyptian high priest at Heliopolis under
Ptolemy I and II. He wrote a history of Egypt (pos-
sibly dedicated to Ptolemy II) from mythical times to
323 BC. He is the ﬁrst native Egyptian known to have
written in Greek. He divided the kings into dynasties
and kingdoms. Parts of his work are preserved by
later historians and are valuable for establishing bib-
lical chronology.
Megasthenes (Megasthenes):
c. 350–290 BC. An
Ionian envoy of Seleucus I, sent on several occasions
to the court of the Indian king Sandracottus. He also
spent time at Sandracottus’ capital at Pataliputra.
He traveled widely in northern India and was the
ﬁrst Greek to write about India authoratively. His
Indika was a history in four books, including geogra-
phy, peoples, cities, government, religion, history
and legends.
Melanippides (Melanippides):
c. 520–after 450 BC.
Dithyrambic poet from Miletus who died at the
court of Perdiccas II of Macedonia. He changed the
structure of dithyrambs by introducing lyric solos.
Little of his work survives.
Menander (Menandros):
342/341 to 293/292 or
290/289 BC. The leading writer of New Comedy
poetry. He was of a good Athenian family, a pupil of
Theophrastus and acquainted with Demetrius of
Phalerum. His ﬁrst play Orge (anger) was in 321 BC
(now lost). He wrote over 100 plays, and nearly 100
titles (some possibly alternatives) are known. In the
7th and 8th centuries AD his plays were lost: they had
been excluded from the school curriculum of the 5th
century AD and later because they were written in
dialect, not Classical Attic Greek. Over 900 quota-
tions did survive. In the 20th century numerous ﬁnds

of papyri have yielded one complete play, Dyskolos (The
Bad-Tempered Man) and many substantial fragments
from Samia (The Samian Woman), Epitrepontes (The
Arbitrants), Perikeiromene (The Shorn Girl), Aspis (The
Shield), Sicyonios (The Sicyonian), Georgos (Farmer) and
Dis exapaton (Twice a Swindler). He won only eight vic-
tories, including Dyskolos in 317/316 BC. His plays
were set in contemporary Greece, usually Athens or
Attica, and most were written in iambic trimeters.
Mimnermus (Mimnermos):
Floruit 632–629 BC.
An elegiac poet and musician from Colophon or
Smyrna. He mainly wrote love poems in elegiacs,
which were collected in two books; the book called
Nanno (possibly after a ﬂute player he loved) con-
tained a collection of poems on various themes, pos-
sibly including his Smyrneis (historical poem on
Smyrna). He became famous for his love poetry.
Moschus (Moskhos):
Floruit c. 150 BC. A poet
from Syracuse. A pupil of Aristarchus of Samothrace
and possibly also a grammarian. Five short hexame-
ter poems survive; three are from his Bucolica, one
comparing the pleasures of the countryman with the
hard life of the ﬁsherman. An epyllion in hexameters
called Europa is also attributed to Moschus. The
Lament for Bion is unlikely to be by him.
Nicander (Nikandros):
Second-century BC didactic
poet from Colophon (or nearby). Two didactic poems
in hexameters survive complete: Theriaca (on poiso-
nous snakes and other creatures, with bite remedies)
and Alexipharmaca (on miscellaneous poisons and
their antidotes). Fragments of other poems also sur-
vive. There is confusion between this poet and the
mid-3rd-century BC epic poet Nicander of Colophon.
Nossis (Nossis):
Early 3rd-century BC poetess from
Locri Epizephyrii. Her lyric poetry has not survived,
but several epigrams still exist; in one she compares
herself to Sappho.
Onesicritus (Onesikritos):
Floruit 320s BC. A his-
torian and seaman who accompanied Alexander the
Great’s expedition to India. He wrote a work on the
campaign in India and won a reputation as a liar.
Onomacritus (Onomakritos):
Late 6th-century BC
poet and oracle editor. An Athenian who lived at the
court of Peisistratus, he collected and edited the ora-
cles of Musaeus and was exposed by Lasus for
forgery. On the expulsion of the Peisistratids, Ono-
macritus went to Susa and presented Xerxes with
oracles favorable to an invasion of Greece. He was
later thought to have been author of other poems.
Oxyrhynchus Historian: A historian of unknown
name (possibly Cratippus), fragments of whose work
were discovered on papyri at Oxyrhynchus in 1906
(Hellenica Oxyrhynchia). The fragments cover in
detail the years 396–395 BC.
Panyassis (Panuas[s]is):
Fifth-century BC epic poet
from Halicarnassus. He was uncle or cousin of
Herodotus and author of Heracleia (14 books on
Heracles) and Ionica (on the foundation of the Ionian
cities). A few fragments of the Heracleia survive. He
was executed in the 460s or early 450s BC for his
political activities.
Phanodemus (Phanodemos):
Fourth-century BC
historian from Athens. He wrote a history of Athens
(Atthis) in at least nine books, and a history of the
island of Icus. He played a prominent part in public
life and was a member of the Athenian boule.
Inscriptions record the granting of civic crowns for
his services. He was a supporter of Lycurgus and was
connected with the restoration of the cult of
Amphiaraus.
Pherecrates (Pherekrates):
Mid-5th-century BC
Athenian comic poet. He was the rival of Aristo-
phanes and won his first victories at the City

Nineteen titles of plays survive and 250 fragments,
one being a speech adversely criticizing contempo-
rary musicians.
Pherecydes (Pherekydes):
Early 5th-century BC
logographer from Athens who wrote a mythological
and genealogical history in 10 books, of which frag-
ments survive. He is sometimes confused with
Pherecydes of Syrus, a philosopher.
Philemon (Philemon):
c. 368/360–c. 267/263 BC.
New Comedy poet, probably from Syracuse. He
became an Athenian citizen before 307 BC. More than
60 titles of his 97 comedies are known, and more than

200 fragments survive. He won three Lenaean victo-
ries after 320 BC, and his ﬁrst victory at the Dionysia
was in 327 BC. He won more victories than Menander,
but his popularity diminished after his death.
Philetas or Philitas (Philetas):
Born before 320
BC. A poet and scholar from Cos who became tutor
to the future Ptolemy II. Other pupils were Zen-
odotus and Theocritus. Philetas wrote love poems
and was particularly famous for his elegies. His
works included Demeter, Hermes (an epyllion), Tele-
phus, Epigrammata and Paegnia (Playful Poems). He
also wrote the prose work Miscellaneous Glosses, a lex-
icon of rare words. Very little of his work survives.
Philicus (Philikos):
c. 275 BC. A tragic poet from
Corcyra who lived at Alexandria. He was one of the
“Tragic Pleiad” and a priest of Dionysus. He wrote 42
tragedies, but not even one title survives. A papyrus
fragment of his Hymn to Demeter is in the choriambic
hexameter meter, which he claimed to have invented.
Philistus (Philistos):
c. 430–356 BC. Historian and
statesman from Syracuse who helped Dionysius I
become tyrant but later quarreled with him and was
exiled. He was recalled by Dionysius II. Philistus
exiled Dion (uncle of Dionysius II) and became
admiral. However, he was defeated in a naval battle
by Dion and committed suicide. Philistus is best
known for an unﬁnished history of Sicily in 11 to 13
books from earliest times to 406 BC, written when he
was exiled. It became a major source for later histori-
ans and was much praised by Cicero and others.
Philochorus (Philokhoros):
Before 340 BC–c. 262
BC. An atthidographer (the best and most famous).
He was of a distinguished family and held official
religious posts. Twenty-seven titles are known, the
most important being Atthis (Attic History) in 17
books. The last seven books are lost. It was a history
of Athens to the Chremonidean War. Philochorus
was executed by Antigonus II Gonatas for supporting
Ptolemy II.
Philoxenus of Cythera (Philoxenos):
435/434–
380/379 BC. Dithyrambic poet who worked at the
court of Dionysius I of Syracuse. His most famous
dithyramb was Cyclops, in which the Cyclops sang a
solo to the lyre, an innovative feature parodied by
Aristophanes. He is often confused with a Philox-
enus who wrote a lyric poem The Banquet (Deipnon).
Phocylides (Phokylides):
Possibly mid-6th century
BC or earlier. An elegiac and hexameter poet from
Miletus, known particularly for gnomic couplets
with a moral observation.
Phoenix of Colophon (Phoinix):
Third-century
BC iambic poet who wrote moralizing choliambics
and Coronistae, a version of a beggar’s song.
Phrynichus (Phrynikhos):
Athenian tragic poet,
6th–5th centuries BC. Ancient authors regarded him
and Thespis as the originators of tragedy. His ﬁrst
victory for a tragedy was between 511 and 508 BC.
He was the first to use contemporary events as
themes. Only a few fragments of his plays survive.
They included one on the capture of Miletus by the
Persians (probably produced 492 BC), for which
Phrynichus was heavily ﬁned for upsetting the Athe-
nians at the Dionysiac festival. Another historical
play was Phoenician Women (Phoenissae), possibly 476
BC. There were also plays on mythological subjects.
He was apparently the ﬁrst tragic poet to introduce
female characters (by using a female mask).
Phylarchus (Phylarkhos):
Late 3rd-century BC his-
torian who wrote several works, of which only the
titles are known, and also a 28-book History. It cov-
ered the period between the death of Pyrrhus (272
BC) and the defeat of Cleomenes III (222 BC). It was
not arranged chronologically and survives only in
quotations. He was a supporter of Cleomenes and
apparently displayed a bias in the history.
Pindar (Pindaros):
522–518–after 446 BC, possibly
442 BC. A lyric poet from Cynoscephalae in Boeotia.
Little is known of his life, but he was a member of
the aristocratic Aegeidae clan. He was particularly
known for his Epinician (victory) Odes written to
celebrate victors at the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean
and Isthmian Games. His earliest known poem was
in 498 BC, and the last datable ode celebrates a vic-
tory in 446 BC. Pindar traveled in various parts of
the Greek world and in 476 BC went to Sicily, later
writing odes for Hieron I. He became famous in his
lifetime, and wrote many poems in all the main types
of choral lyric. They were grouped into 17 books by

Alexandrian scholars, who divided them by type:
epinicians, encomia, dirges, hymns, paeans, dithyra-
mbs, prosodia, hyporchemata and partheneia. Only
the four books of Epinician Odes survive (45 odes)
and other fragments, mostly from paeans.
Plato (Platon):
Floruit c. 420–c. 390 BC. Athenian
comic poet who won his first victory at the City
Dionysia c. 410 BC; a rival of Aristophanes. Thirty
titles and 270 fragments of his plays survive, which
were apparently political in nature.
Polemon of Ilium (Polemon):
c. 190/180 BC. A
geographer and antiquarian. He traveled throughout
the Greek world, recording monuments, inscriptions
and artistic material, especially at Sparta, Athens and
Delphi.
Polybius (Polybios):
c. 200–after 118 BC. Born at
Megalopolis, he was among 1,000 Achaeans taken to
Rome after the Roman victory at the battle of Pydna
in 168 BC. He was author of Historiai, a 40-volume
history from 220 to 146 BC. The ﬁrst ﬁve volumes
and fragments of others survive.
Polycleitus or Polyclitus of Larissa (Polykleitos):
Floruit 320s BC. A historian of Alexander the Great
who probably accompanied his army. He wrote a
Historiai that was used by Strabo and Eratosthenes.
Poseidippus or Posidippus (Poseidippos):
Floruit
275 BC. An epigrammatic poet from Pella who lived
on Samos and later at Alexandria. With Asclepiades
and Hedylus, he published an anthology called Soros
(the Heap). He wrote erotic poems.
Pratinas (Pratinas):
A poet from Phlius, 6th–5th
centuries BC, who was the ﬁrst writer of satyr plays.
Thirty-two of his 50 plays were satyric, and he also
wrote tragedies, dithyrambs and hyporchemata. He
competed at Athens at the beginning of the 5th cen-
tury BC. In one substantial fragment a chorus attacks
ﬂute players who drown the words of the dithyramb.
Praxilla (Praxilla):
Mid-5th-century BC lyric poet-
ess from Sicyon who wrote dithyrambs, hymns and
drinking songs. Little survives, but one line in a
Hymn to Adonis was proverbial for its silliness.
Rhianus (Rhianos):
Born c. 275 BC. Poet and
Homeric scholar from the town of Bene on Crete
who may have originally been a slave in charge of a
wrestling school. He wrote epigrams and epic
poems. His historical epics include Achaica, Thessal-
ica, Eliaca and Messeniaca. Most of the epigrams are
pederastic. Rhianus also produced an edition of
Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Only fragments of his
poems survive.
Sacadas (Sakadas):
Early 6th-century BC musician
and elegiac poet from Argos who won three flute
competitions at the Pythian Games of 586, 582 and
578 BC. He also wrote elegiac poems set to tunes and
was connected with the music school at Sparta.
Nothing survives of his work.
Sappho (Phsappho):
Born c. 612 BC. A lyric poet-
ess, possibly the greatest in antiquity, from Lesbos
(ﬁgs. 7.16 and 7.21). As a child she lived in exile in
Sicily but eventually returned to Mytilene. She men-
tions three brothers, one of whom, Charaxus, was
involved with a courtesan in Egypt. Sappho married
Cercylas and had a daughter Cleis. Little is known of
Sappho’s life. She apparently committed suicide for
love of Phaeon but this may have been an invention
of New Comedy. Sappho was a contemporary of
Alcaeus, and seems to have been the leading ﬁgure of
a group of women and girls who formed her audi-
ence. She knew them intimately and wrote about her
love for them (and sometimes her hate). Despite no
certain evidence for physical intimacy, the poet
Anacreon later accused the island of female homo-
sexuality, from which the terms lesbianism and sap-
phism derive. Sappho’s poems were divided into nine
books according to meter, nearly all monody, sung to
the lyre accompaniment and of an intimate nature.
Semonides (Semonides/Simonides):
Mid-7th cen-
tury BC. An iambic and elegiac poet. Although from
Samos he is associated with Amorgos (being part of
the Samian colony). He wrote two books of elegiacs
on the history of Samos. Another piece of elegiac
verse is on the brevity of life. He apparently wrote
one book of iambic verse, but very little survives.
Simias or Simmias of Rhodes (Simias):
c. 300 BC
poet who wrote four books of miscellaneous poems,

including epyllia, epigrams and lyrical poems. Three
tekhnopaegnia survive (Wings, Ax and Egg), poems
that imitated the shape of the object on the page.
Simias was also a grammarian and wrote three schol-
arly books.
Simonides (Simonides):
557/556–468/467 BC. A
lyric and elegiac poet from Ceos who was uncle of
the poet Bacchylides. He worked as a poet through-
out Greece: at the court of Hipparchus at Athens, in
Thessaly (from c. 514 BC), at Athens (by 490 BC) and
at the court of Hieron I of Syracuse (c. 476 BC until
his death). He wrote hymns, scolia, encomia, epini-
cians and elegies, but he was especially famous for his
dirges and sepulchral epigrams (possibly nearly all
written for tombstones and other monuments). He
wrote an epitaph on the Athenian dead at the battle
of Marathon, which was preferred to that of Aeschy-
lus. Simonides won 56 victories in dithyrambic com-
petitions. His poetry is now largely lost.
Sophocles (Sophokles):
c. 496–406/405 BC. An
Athenian tragedian from a wealthy family. He wrote
123 plays (over 110 titles are known). He won 24
victories with 96 plays; 18 victories (72 plays) were
at the City Dionysia and the rest at the Lenaea. In
the other contests he was second, never third. His
first victory was in 468 BC, when he defeated
Aeschylus at the City Dionysia. Sophocles may have
introduced the third actor and increased the chorus
from 12 to 15. Seven plays survive: Ajax, Antigone
(possibly 441 BC), Women of Trachis (Trachiniae),
Oedipus Tyrannus (Oedipus Rex), Electra, Philoctetes
(409 BC) and Oedipus at Colonus (produced posthu-
mously 401 BC). A satyr play Ichneutae (trackers)
concerned the infant Hermes. Sophocles also wrote
paeans to Asclepius and Herodotus, an elegiac poem
to the philosopher Archelaus, and a prose work On
the Chorus. He abandoned the idea of connected
plays; instead, each play had a self-contained plot.
He took an active part in public life and refused invi-
tations to work away from Athens. After his death he
was honored as a hero because he had received the
sacred snake representing Asclepius in his house
until the temple was ready.
Sophron (Sophron):
Fifth-century BC writer of mimes
on events of everyday life. He was from Syracuse.
Sotades (Sotades):
c. 280 BC. An iambic poet from
Maronea. He invented a ﬂexible “sotadean” meter
that was used for centuries. Most of his work is lost,
including a rewritten Iliad. He wrote moralizing
sotadeans for the education of Greek children in
Egypt. His abusive attack on Ptolemy II’s incestuous
marriage with Arsinoë (276/275 BC) may have led to
his imprisonment and death.
Stesichorus (Stesikhoros, choir-setter):
c. 560 BC,
possibly 632–629 to 556–553 BC. Lyric poet whose
real name was Teisias—Stesichorus may have been a
title. Born at Mataurus or Locri Epizephyrii, he lived
at Himera. He was a choral poet, writing long narra-
tive lyric poetry where singing was accompanied by a
lyre. He was even credited with inventing this type of
poetry. His poems were collected in six books, but
W R I T T E N E V I D E N C E

only fragments survive. They included Geryoneis
(more than 1,800 lines), Oresteia (in two books),
Funeral Games of Pelias, Boarhunters, Eriphyle, Iliuper-
sis (sack of Troy) and Helen. His most famous poem
was Palinode, in which he denied that Helen ever went
to Troy and asserted that she went to Egypt instead.
Stesimbrotus (Stesimbrotos):
Fifth-century BC soph-
ist and biographer from Thasos who taught at
Athens. He wrote about Homer and the Mysteries
of Samothrace, as well as a work On Themistocles,
Thucydides and Pericles. A few quotes from the latter
work survive, but none concern Thucydides (son of
Melesias).
Suda (he Souda, fortress):
The name of a lexicon
not an author; a historical and literary encyclopedia
compiled at the end of the 10th century AD. It con-
tains works of various authors, including texts with
scholia, as well as many later abridgments of authors.
It made use of other encyclopedias, including the
Palatine Anthology. Nevertheless, it preserves in some
form many works of ancient Greek authors.
Susarion (Sousarion):
Sixth-century BC iambic poet,
believed by ancient writers to be from Icaria in Attica
(but possibly from Megara) and the inventor of com-
edy. He may be a ﬁctitious ﬁgure.
Telesilla (Telesilla):
A 6th–5th-centuries BC lyric
poetess from Argos. Nine fragments of hymns sur-
vive. The Telesilleion meter is named after her. She
was famous for saving her city by arming its women
after the defeat of the men by Cleomenes III.
Telestes (Telestes):
Floruit c. 400 BC. A dithyram-
bic poet from Selinus. He won a victory at Athens in
402/401 BC. His dithyrambs included Argo, Asclepius
and Hymenaeus.
Terpander (Terpandros):
Mid-7th-century BC poet
and musician from Antissa in Lesbos. Nothing cer-
tain is known of his life; he won a musical competi-
tion at the Carnea 676–673 BC and founded the
“First School” of music at Sparta. He added a sev-
enth string to the lyre (cithara). He composed nomes
(epic poetry set to lyre music, using his own or
Homer’s lines) and also scolia (drinking songs).
Thaletas (Thaletas):
Seventh-century BC poet and
musician from Gortyn in Crete, allegedly called to
Sparta by the Delphic oracle to rid it of a plague by
appeasing Apollo with his poetry. At Sparta he estab-
lished a Second School of music and the Gymnopae-
dia festival (665 BC), and composed paeans and
hyporchemata. None of his work survives.
Theagenes of Rhegium (Theagenes):
Floruit c.
525 BC. A scholar and rhapsode. He wrote a book
on Homer and was the first to give allegorical
interpretations.
Theocritus (Theokritos):
Possibly c. 300–c. 260 BC.
A poet from Syracuse but who subsequently lived in
southern Italy, eastern Aegean and then Alexandria
during the reign of Ptolemy II. His poems are known
collectively as Idylls (short poems), but his fame rested
on those of a bucolic or pastoral nature (hence, “idyl-
lic”). The bucolic poems may have been written in
Cos, where he may have been studying medicine, and
contain references to numerous plants. He also wrote
epyllia, epithalamia, hymns, love poems and epi-
grams. His poetry was written mainly in hexameters.
Of his surviving poems, about seven are bucolic, and
they influenced Virgil and later European poetry.
Thirty poems, fragments and epigrams survive.
Theodectes (Theodektes/Theodektas):
Active c. 375–
334 BC. A tragedian and orator from Phaselis. He
studied under Plato, Isocrates and Aristotle and
became famous as an orator, as well as a writer of
tragedies, of popular riddles in verse and of prose
work on rhetoric. He wrote 50 tragedies and won
eight victories at 13 competitions (seven at the City
Dionysia). They included Lynceus, Mausolus and
Philoctetes. He died at the age of 41.
Theognis (Theognis):
Sixth century BC, possibly
floruit 544–541 BC. An elegiac poet from Megara
with 1,389 lines surviving in a manuscript. Divided
into two books of short poems, the work’s authentic-
ity is disputed. The two books are probably an
anthology based on and around poems of Theognis.
Those addressed to Cyrnus appear genuine.
Theopompus (Theopompos):
c. 377–320 BC. A his-
torian from Chios from where he was banished by
H A N D B O O K

304

Alexander the Great with his father Damasistratus c.
334 BC for supporting Sparta. He was later restored,
but fled to the court of Ptolemy I in Egypt after
Alexander died. Theopompus wrote numerous
books, although only fragments survive from Hel-
lenica and Philippica. The former was in 12 books and
continued Thucydides’ history from 411 BC to the
battle of Cnidus (394 BC). Philippica, a world history
in 58 books, described events during the time of
Philip II of Macedonia (359–336 BC), with numerous
digressions.
Thespis (Thespis):
c. 535 BC. A poet from Icaria
(Attica), famed as the inventor of tragedy and also
credited with introducing an actor to deliver pro-
logues and converse with the chorus (a change from
a choral production to a drama). He may also have
invented the mask. Surviving fragments from his
plays may not be genuine.
Thucydides (Thoukydides):
c. 460–455 to c. 400/
399 BC. Historian. Between 430 and 427 BC he
caught the plague but recovered. In 424 BC he was
strategos and lost Amphipolis to the Spartan Brasidas;
for this he was exiled, returning 20 years later. He
was probably related to Cimon and to Thucydides
the politician, and he owned property in Thrace. He
wrote an incomplete history in eight books of the
Second Peloponnesian War between Athens and
Sparta (431–404 BC). It stops in mid-sentence in win-
ter 411/410 BC, but was intended to go as far as 404
BC. It was later completed by Theopompus and
Cratippus.
Timaeus (Timaios):
c. 356–260 BC. Historian from
Tauromenium who lived in exile at Athens for 50
years from c. 317 BC, probably returning under
Hieron II. He wrote a history of Sicily (called Histo-
riai or Sicelica) in 38 books from earliest times to 264
BC. It also dealt with events in Italy, north Africa and
elsewhere.
Timocreon (Timokreon):
First half of the 5th cen-
tury BC. A lyric and elegiac poet from Rhodes who
was banished, apparently for supporting the Persians
when they occupied the island. He was an enemy of
Themistocles and Simonides. Only fragments of his
work survive.
Timotheus (Timotheos):
c. 450–c. 360 BC. A poet
from Miletus famous for his nomes and dithyrambs.
He was innovative and unpopular. Most of his 18
books are lost, but a 4th-century BC papyrus has pre-
served over 200 lines of his lyric nome Persae (Per-
sians), describing the battle of Salamis and ending
with a defense of his own music. Euripides (his
friend) wrote the prologue.
Tyrtaeus (Tyrtaios):
Seventh-century BC elegiac
poet, possibly (but unlikely) originally an Athenian
schoolteacher. By the Second Messenian War he was
living at Sparta, and encouraged the Spartans with
war songs and exhortations in elegiac verse to cap-
ture Messene. His poems were collected in five
books. He wrote for the Spartan upper classes and
was the founder of Spartan war poetry.
Xanthus (Xanthos):
Fifth-century BC historian who
wrote a four-book history of Lydia (Lydiaka).
Xenophon (Xenophon):
c. 428/427–c. 354 BC. His-
torian and soldier, born of a wealthy Athenian family
and associated with Socrates. He was regarded in
antiquity as a philosopher. He joined the army of
Cyrus the Younger and campaigned in Asia Minor.
He was exiled c. 399 BC and became a soldier under
Agesilaus II of Sparta, being present at the battle of
Coronea against Athens in 394 BC. His family was
given an estate at Scillus near Olympia, and he was
elected Spartan proxenos, responsible for entertain-
ing Spartans visiting Olympia. Elis claimed Scillus in
371 BC, and Xenophon went to live near Corinth.
He returned to Athens in 366/365 BC after the
decree of his banishment was lifted.
Xenophon was very proliﬁc and wrote on numer-
ous topics. Hellenica was a history of Greece from
411 to 362 BC in seven books (mostly written in the
350s BC). Anabasis was an account of the Greek mer-
cenaries under Cyrus the Younger (401–399 BC).
Cynegeticus was a treatise on hunting. Spartan Consti-
tution was written c. 388 BC in praise of Sparta. Apolo-
gia was a defense of Socrates. Oeconomicus was a
conversation with Socrates on agriculture and the
correct way to organize a household Memorabilia
were recollections of Socrates in four books. Sympo-
sium was an imaginary party with Socrates as a guest.
Vectigalia gave advice to Athenians on increasing

their revenue. On Horsemanship is the oldest such
treatise to survive, written c. 380 BC. Cryopaedia was
an imaginative work in eight books on Cyrus the
Great. Hieron was a dialogue between Hieron I and
Simonides on tyranny. Hipparchicus (Cavalry Com-
mander) was on the duties of an Athenian cavalry
commander. Agesilaus was written in praise of the
Spartan king. Ways and Means offered a policy of
peace through strength. The Constitution of Athens
was a pamphlet possibly written by Xenophon.
Zenodotus (Zenodotos):
Born c. 325 BC. Scholar
from Ephesus who became royal tutor and ﬁrst head
of the Alexandria Library c. 285 BC. He undertook
the classiﬁcation of epic and lyric poets and wrote a
Homeric Glossary. He apparently divided both the
Iliad and Odyssey into 24 books.

CHRONOLOGY
AND DEVELOPMENT
Concept of Religion
The Greeks had no word for religion. Gods were
thought to be everywhere, and religion was part of
everyday life: it was not divorced from mundane
activities, and therefore no word categorized it. It was
believed that the gods could see all human activities,
provide for all human needs, protect against danger
and heal the sick. In return, they were worshipped
according to their functions and spheres of inﬂuence.
People offered sacriﬁces, votive offerings and prayers,
and looked after the gods’ sacred places. Except for a
few speciﬁc cults, the Greeks did not expect the gods
to provide salvation after death (as in the Christian
sense), but rather rewards and favors during life in
return for piety, service and sacriﬁce to the gods.
Religious observance accompanied all important
private and public events and transactions. During
the Classical period no signiﬁcant private or public
undertaking was started without consulting a god,
and no successful outcome went without a votive
offering, vow of thanks or public dedication. In
Athens religious observance was usually further
organized within membership of groups, such as a
deme, professional organization, phratry or family.
Minoan Religion
In mainland Greece evidence for religion is uncom-
mon before the Late Helladic, but evidence exists,
mainly on Crete, for religion in the Minoan period.
The archaeological evidence was once interpreted as
representing a uniﬁed religion based on the worship
of one or more mother goddesses, and ﬁnds of female
ﬁgurines were interpreted as images of deities. It is
now recognized that this did not take account of
other archaeological evidence, particularly ﬁgurines
representing human males and various animals.
Some ﬁgurines also represented people worshipping
a deity, not the deity itself. The idea of a single uni-
fied religion based on worship of one or more
mother goddesses is no longer valid.
A reassessment of religion in early Crete has led to
a picture of greater diversity in religious practice (and
probably belief ). Some religious practices were possi-
bly more like those in the Near East than in later
Greek religion. In particular it seems that individual
communities tended to recognize different, very local
gods and were not part of a uniﬁed and fairly uniform
religion. The evidence is still undergoing detailed
reappraisal, and so the present picture of early reli-
gion is necessarily incomplete and to some extent
confused.
Although some artifacts from the Prepalatial
Period are interpreted as having religious signifi-
cance, more evidence from the First and Second
Palace Periods gives the ﬁrst real indications of how
religion was developing. Priests and priestesses are
represented, and rituals appear to have included pro-
cessions and dances, offerings, sacriﬁces and practices
apparently designed to cause the immediate appear-
ance of a deity. Religious practices were conducted in
outdoor settings, where a tree or rock was apparently
of central importance in the ritual, but rituals also
took place in caves and buildings. Religious sanctuar-
ies on or near mountain peaks were possibly impor-
tant communal religious centers, but other sites show
the diversity of religious practice. One common reli-
gious practice was the offering of clay artifacts:
Human figurines are often in poses of worship or
invocation, while animal ﬁgurines and models of food
on plates may represent sacriﬁces. Anatomical mod-
els, such as heads and limbs, may have been votive
offerings to healing deities. Also commonly associ-
ated with religious practices are models of double-
headed axes and horns (sometimes called “horns of
consecration”), as well as cylindrical ceramic objects
labeled “snake tubes,” decorated with other religious
symbols. Symbols such as snakes and horns found on
“snake tubes” also decorated some ﬁgurines.
Evidence for Minoan religious practices has been
found at Aegean sites other than Crete. In the Third
Palace Period there were major changes in religious
practice, with the increased Mycenaean inﬂuence.
Mycenaean Religion
How Mycenaean religion developed is unclear, but
some continuity from Minoan religion is evident.
Earlier evidence is sparse, but by the later Myce-

naean period a distinctive religion had developed.
Mycenaean religion was polytheistic, and the names
of some gods are known: Zeus, Poseidon, Enyalios,
Paean, Eileithyia, Hera, Dionysus and Hermaias
(Hermes). There were also numerous goddesses,
many of whom had the title potnia (lady). A goddess
whose name translates as “Lady of Athana” may be
the same as the goddess Athena.
The evidence for worship of gods in Mycenaean
times suggests some similarity to the forms of wor-
ship practiced later in the Classical period; offerings
were made to the gods, and similar commodities and
animals were sacrificed. Religion of the Classical
period is generally regarded as having roots in
Minoan and Mycenaean religion, but it is apparent
that great changes in ritual (and perhaps belief) took
place during the intervening Dark Age.
Dark Age Religion
In the Dark Age there still appears to have been some
religious continuity, although evidence for the contin-
ued use of a sacred site from Mycenaean times
through the Dark Age and into the Classical period is
extremely rare. The open-air altar and temple with
cult image are features of Classical religion that appear
to have arisen during the Dark Age. Some authorities
do regard Classical religion as a development from
Minoan and Mycenaean religion, with inﬂuences
from the Near East, but there is insufﬁcient evidence
to trace its development through the Dark Age.
Classical Religion
In the Classical period there were numerous deities,
and every locality, river or spring had its own god or
nymph. Gods were anthropomorphic, regarded as
essentially like humans in their motives and behavior,
but differing from humans in their superior power
and their immortality. A complicated mythology
developed around the gods, and many myths and
legends were concerned with relationships between
gods and other gods, and between gods and mortals.
The Greeks tried to rationalize some of the myths,
and some myths were adjusted or invented in order
to create genealogies for particular peoples, because
of the prestige in being descended from a god. This
often resulted in differing versions of particular
myths, or conﬂict between two or more myths.
Worship of deities was generally done outdoors,
and hymns, prayers, sacriﬁces, vows and votive offer-
ings all played a part. There were religious festivals
in honor of the gods, sometimes accompanied by
sporting and artistic contests. As city-states expanded
and admitted foreigners, foreign gods became estab-
lished and accepted, often being equated with exist-
ing Greek gods. Because religion formed part of
most everyday activities, it provided virtually a com-
mon factor among all Greeks.
Hellenistic Religion
After the Classical period religion lost some of its
popularity among the educated classes, although it
still thrived among peasants. Religion was partly sup-
planted by philosophy, and after Alexander the Great
the Eastern practice of ruler worship became
increasingly common. Alexander demanded and
received divine honors from the Greeks, but his suc-
cessors and their descendants seem to have been
granted divine honors voluntarily. Kings and some-
times their families were worshipped as gods by the
cities they had founded, and other cities might enroll
a king among their ofﬁcial deities. They were wor-
shipped with temples, cult statues and festivals. In
time the monarchies of the East developed their own
ofﬁcial cults, such as that of the Ptolemies at Alexan-
dria. Ruler worship was usually political rather than
truly religious; examples of offerings dedicated to
rulers are known, but not prayers. It was generally
regarded as an expression of loyalty to the state.
GODS AND
GODDESSES
Groups of Deities
The major Greek gods and goddesses were often
thought of in groups. According to mythology these
groups formed several levels of gods, possibly an
attempt to explain the relationships of the gods.

Much evidence for the groups of deities and their lev-
els comes from the poet Hesiod. According to him
there was originally Chaos, then Gaia (Earth) and
Eros. Gaia ﬁrst bore Uranus (the heavens), and then
from a union with Uranus and Gaia, she bore the
Titans, then the Cyclopes and finally the Heca-
toncheires. The offspring of the two Titans, Cronus
and Rhea, formed another level of gods: Hestia,
Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus. Zeus led
a rebellion against his parents, and he became the
chief god in the level of gods known as the Olympians
(so-called because they lived on Mount Olympus).
According to Hesiod there were 12 Olympians: Zeus,
Poseidon, Hera, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite,
Hermes, Demeter, Dionysus, Hephaestus and Ares.
Not all sources agree with Hesiod; for example,
Hades, Hestia, Pan and Asclepius sometimes appear
to have been regarded as Olympians as well. Other
gods were chthonic (from khthon, the earth or
ground), as they lived beneath the earth, such as
Hades and his wife, Persephone.
Myths
The Greeks had no central collection of sacred texts
(such as the Bible). This role was ﬁlled by an exten-
sive collection of myths (from mythos, a spoken or
written story), which were stories about gods, heroes
and fantastic monsters that they believed as their
own history, and families would claim descent from
gods and heroes. From the 7th century BC, myths
began to be portrayed in art, such as on pottery vases
and temple sculptures. Gods were considered similar
to humans, but possessing supernatural powers and
immortality. The myths explained the origin of the
world; they also provided the Greeks with a fabulous
early history and an understanding of their gods.
Originally the stories were transmitted by oral tradi-
tion, but eventually they were written down and used
as themes and reference points in poetry and drama.
Knowledge of the myths is largely derived from
these written sources. Because they originated in oral
tradition, there were often different versions of the
same story, frequently conﬂicting. Characters com-
mon to two or more stories may be portrayed as
being in two or more places at the same time, or as
having lived in different centuries. Despite later
attempts by the Greeks to rationalize their myths,
many incongruities still exist in those that have sur-
vived to the present day. Many of the myths had their
origin in the Near East, such as in Mesopotamia.
Descriptions of Gods, Heroes
and Mythological Beings
The following descriptions are of the main deities of
Greek religion and of other main characters in Greek
myths. They are given in alphabetical order. They are
known mainly from the Classical period, sometimes
earlier. Some of these deities were adopted from
other cultures or were local deities of prehistoric ori-
gin, but all were tolerated within Greek society. The
name by which they are most commonly known is
given, with the Greek version in parentheses. For a
description of many more mythological figures in
Classical history, see Jenny March 1998.
Achelous (Akheloos):
God of the Achelous, the
longest river in Greece, now known as the Aspro-
potamo, part of it forming the border between Acar-
nania and Aetolia in northwest Greece. In mythology
Achelous was the son of Oceanus and Tethys. A sacri-
ﬁce to Achelous by the Attic deme Erchia took place
on the 27th day of the month Boedromion.
Achilles (Akhilleus):
The greatest of Greek
heroes, son of King Peleus of Thessaly and the
Nereid sea goddess Thetis (fig. 8.1). He had a
prominent role in Homer’s Iliad, and probably
because of this, he was worshipped in a hero cult
that was widespread in several regions of Greece.
See also PATROCLUS, ZEPHYRUS.
Actaeon (Aktaion):
Grandson of King Cadmus of
Thebes and son of Aristaeus and Autonoe and a leg-
endary huntsman who accidentally found the god-
dess Artemis bathing. Offended at being seen naked
by a man, Artemis turned Actaeon into a stag, and he
was killed by his own pack of hounds.
Adonis (Adonis):
A god of vegetation and fertility,
whose cult originated on Cyprus and was generally
connected with the cult of Aphrodite. In mythology
Adonis was a beautiful youth loved by Aphrodite, but
he was killed by a boar while hunting after incurring

the wrath of Artemis. The rites of his cult included
women mourning his death, and subsequently rejoic-
ing at his rebirth. However, the idea of his resurrection
seems to have been absorbed from another cult, prob-
ably that of Osiris. Festivals of Adonis (Adonia) were
held mainly at Athens and in the Hellenistic period at
Alexandria, and were celebrated especially by women.
Adrastus (Adrastus):
This mythological king of
Argos took part in the “Seven Against Thebes,”
which was the failed attempt to restore Polynices,
son of Oedipus, to the throne of Thebes.
Aeacus (Aiakos):
The son of Zeus and Aegina
(daughter of the river god Asopus), father of Peleus
and grandfather of Achilles and Ajax. He was king of
the island of Aegina. In some legends Aeacus is one
of the judges of the dead in the underworld.
Aegaeon (Aigaion):
One of the Hecatoncheires,
and also known as Briareus.
Aegeus (Aigeus):
In mythology, an early king of
Athens and father of Theseus. One legend describes
how the Aegean Sea was named after him. See also
THESEUS.
Aegisthus (Aigisthos):
The son of Thyestes, and
the seducer of Agamemnon’s wife, Clytemnestra, and
the killer of Agamemnon, for whose murder he was
himself killed by Orestes.
Aello (Aello, storm wind):
Also called Nicothoe.
One of the Harpies.
Aeneas (Aineias, Aineas):
A Trojan hero, son of
Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite. He plays only a
small part in Homer’s Iliad, but later legends told of
his escape from Troy and his subsequent wanderings.
He became associated with the mythical founding of
Rome, a theme developed by the Roman poet Virgil
in the Aeneid.
Aeolus (Aiolos):
God of the winds. According to
legend he lived on a ﬂoating island called Aeolia with
his six sons and six daughters, who had married each
other. He kept the winds in a sack or a cave when he
wanted to prevent them from blowing.
Aether (Aither):
In mythology the personiﬁcation
of the upper sky.
Agamemnon (Agamemnon):
The son of Atreus
and brother of Menelaus was married to Clytemnes-
tra and was the father of Orestes, Electra and Iphige-
nia. He was a king of Mycenae (or in some legends,
of Argos) and led the Greek forces in the Trojan
War. On his return he was killed by Clytemnestra’s
lover, Aegisthus. See also CHRYSEIS.
Agathos Daimon (Agathos Daimon, Good Spirit):
In Athens the second day of every month was sacred
to this deity. See also DAIMON.
Aglaurus (Aglauros):
In mythology two women
had this name. The ﬁrst was the daughter of Actaeus,
the first mythical king of Athens. She married
Cecrops and had a daughter also called Aglaurus,
who was worshipped as a deity. A sacriﬁce to Aglau-
rus by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the third
day of the month Skirophorion.
Ajax (Aias):
A hero and son of Telamon, king of
Salamis, Ajax played a major role in Homer’s Iliad.
There was a cult of Ajax in Salamis, Attica and the
Troad. A lesser hero, also called Ajax, appears as leader

of the Locrian forces in the Iliad. According to
another legend this latter Ajax dragged Cassandra
from the altar of Athena, and for this sacrilege Athena
drowned him in a storm as he sailed home to Greece.
See also CASSANDRA.
Alcestis (Alkestis):
The daughter of Pelias and the
wife of Admetus (king of Pherae in Thessaly). Accord-
ing to one legend Admetus, helped by Apollo, won
the hand of Alcestis by being the only suitor to drive a
chariot pulled by wild beasts. In another legend
Admetus offended Artemis at their wedding feast and
was condemned to die, but the intervention of Apollo
allowed someone else to die instead. The only willing
person was Alcestis, but after she died, Heracles
brought her back from the underworld as a favor to
Admetus.
Alcinous (Alkinoos):
In mythology the king of the
Phaeacians. He was grandson of Poseidon, husband
of his own sister Arete and father of Nausicaa. In
Homer’s Odyssey, Alcinous helped Odysseus on his
way to Ithaca. In another legend he entertained the
Argonauts on their return from Colchis, and refused
to return Medea, who escaped with Jason, to her
Colchian father.
Alcm(a)eon (Alkmaion, Alkmeon):
Son of Amphia-
raus and Eriphyle. After the failure of the Seven
against Thebes and the death of his father, he led the
Epigonoi (Successors) and captured Thebes. He killed
his mother in revenge for the death of his father, for
which the Erinyes made him mad and drove him
from Argos. He settled in Psophis and married Arsi-
noë, daughter of King Phegeus. When famine struck
he left this area to settle in western Greece, by the
mouth of the Achelous River. Here he married Cal-
lirhoe (daughter of the river god Achelous) and was
later killed by the brothers of Arsinoë.
Alcyone (Alkyone):
The daughter of Aeolus and wife
of Ceyx (the son of Eosphorus and king of Trachis).
On hearing of Ceyx’s death by drowning, she ﬂung
herself into the sea. Both Alcyone and Ceyx were
changed into birds and reunited. They apparently kept
the Aegean Sea calm while they were building and sit-
ting on their nest. These days of calm at the time of
the winter solstice were known as “halcyon days.”
Alexander (Alexandros):
Son of King Priam and
Hecuba, also known as Paris.
Amalthea (Amaltheia):
A nurse of Zeus, she was
sometimes regarded as a Nymph, sometimes a she-
goat, and in one legend she was transformed into the
star Capella. In another legend one of her goat’s
horns was broken off; it was filled with fruits and
given to Zeus as the original cornucopia (horn of
plenty), a frequent motif in art.
Ammon: The Greek name for the Egyptian god
Amun, who was identiﬁed with the Greek god Zeus
as Zeus Ammon. He became known to the Greeks
after colonizing Cyrene in north Africa c. 630 BC.
The cult of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa oasis in the
Libyan desert had an oracle, which was consulted by
Greeks (the most famous being Alexander the
Great), and Ammon was portrayed on Greek coins
and in Greek art, usually as the head of Zeus with the
addition of curling ram’s horns.
Amphiaraus (Amphiaraos, Amphiareos):
A prophet
who foresaw the failure of the Seven against Thebes,
Amphiaraus refused to join the expedition until
tricked by his wife Eriphyle. Previously he had
charged his children to avenge his death, later result-
ing in Alcmaeon killing Eriphyle. In the attack
against Thebes, Zeus saved Amphiaraus by opening a
cleft in the ground into which he drove his chariot.
He emerged at Oropus in Boeotia, where he founded
a famous oracular and healing shrine, later described
by Pausanias. See also ALCMAEON.
Amphitryon (Amphitryon):
In mythology the king
of Thebes, son of Acaeus (king of Tiryns), husband
of Alcmene (daughter of Electryon) and father of
Iphicles. His uncle Electryon was king of Mycenae,
and after the death of his sons, the kingdom of
Mycenae was given to Amphitryon. While helping to
recover stolen cattle, he killed Electryon and so took
refuge with Alcmene in Thebes. Amphitryon carried
out Alcmene’s wish to avenge her brothers before
marrying her. However, Zeus fell in love with her,
and just before Amphitryon’s return, he visited her
disguised as Amphitryon. Alcmene subsequently
gave birth to twins: Heracles (fathered by Zeus) and
Iphicles (fathered by Amphitryon).

Ananke (Agnagke):
A goddess who personified
necessity or obligation. She was sometimes invoked
in curses and charms. In mythology she was the
daughter of Cronus.
Anchises (Ankhises):
In mythology a Trojan prince,
known mainly for his union with the goddess
Aphrodite who bore his son Aeneas. His brother was
Laocoön.
Andromache (Andromakhe):
The wife of the Tro-
jan hero Hector and mother of Astyanax. After the
sack of Troy Astyanax was killed by the Greeks, and
Andromache was carried off as Neoptolemus’ slave.
She bore him a son, Molossus, from whom the royal
family of the Molossi in Epirus claimed descent. After
Neoptolemus’ death she became the wife of Helenus.
Andromeda (Andromede):
The daughter of Ceph-
eus (king of Ethiopia) and Cassiope, who boasted
that Andromeda was more beautiful than the
Nereids. This angered Poseidon, who ﬂooded the
land and sent a ravaging sea monster that could be
placated only by a sacriﬁce. On consulting Ammon,
Cepheus learned that Andromeda should be sacri-
ﬁced to the monster; she was chained to a rock on the
seashore but was rescued by Perseus. He fought her
uncle Phineus (who was betrothed to her) and won
Andromeda’s hand in marriage. Their children were
Perses, Alcaeus, Sthenelus, Heleius, Mestor, Elec-
tryon and Gorgophone.
Antaeus (Antaios):
A giant living in Libya, the son
of Poseidon and Gaia. He compelled all comers to
wrestle with him, killing them when they had been
beaten, until Heracles fought and killed him.
Antigone (Antigone):
In mythology three women
had this name:
1. The daughter of Eurytion (son of King Actor of
Phthia) and the wife of Peleus.
2. The daughter of King Laomedon of Troy. Hera
changed this Antigone’s hair to snakes, because
she rivaled her in beauty. Later, Antigone was
changed into a stork.
3. The best known Antigone was the daughter of
King Oedipus of Thebes and Jocasta. She appar-
ently held no significant role in the legends of
Oedipus until the works of Sophocles; in these
she looked after the blinded Oedipus in his exile
and returned to Thebes to defy her uncle Creon,
insisting on burying her brother Polynices. Con-
sequently Creon condemned her to be buried
alive, but she committed suicide instead.
Antilochus (Antilokhos):
In mythology the son of
King Nestor of Pylos. In Homer’s Iliad he is por-
trayed as a fine runner, brave warrior and skillful
charioteer. In another legend he was killed by Mem-
non while defending his father.
Antinous (Antinoos):
The son of Eupeithes and
chief suitor to Penelope. He was killed by Odysseus.
Antiope (Antiope):
In mythology the daughter
either of the Asopus River or of King Nycteus of
Boeotia. She was loved by Zeus (in the form of a
satyr) and gave birth to twin sons, Amphion and
Zethus. She ﬂed from her father to Sicyon, where
she married Epopeus. Nycteus, committing suicide,
sent his brother Lycus to punish Antiope. He killed
Epopeus and imprisoned Antiope. She was then tor-
mented by Lycus and his wife Dirce, but eventually
escaped and was avenged by her sons.
Aphaea (Aphaia):
A goddess worshipped on Aegina,
where the ruins of her temple stand. She was identi-
ﬁed with the Cretan goddess Britomartis.
Aphrodite (Aphrodite):
Goddess of love, sexuality,
beauty and fertility, and one of the Olympians (ﬁg.
8.2). She was worshipped throughout almost all the
Greek world. She may originally have been a Hel-
lenized version of the Asian goddess Astarte. She was
associated with Adonis, who was sometimes regarded
as Astarte’s consort. In Hellenistic times she was
sometimes identiﬁed with Isis. Primarily Aphrodite
was a goddess of sexual love, generation and fertility,
but some evidence suggests she was sometimes
regarded as a goddess of vegetation. Aphrodite was
also widely worshipped as a goddess of the sea and of
seafaring. She was the patron goddess of prostitutes,
and there was sacred prostitution at her sanctuary at
Corinth. Particularly in Sparta, Cyprus and Cythera,
she was worshipped as a goddess of war. Aphrodite
had close connections with Cyprus, where she had
R E L I G I O N
A N D M Y T H O L O G Y

two major sanctuaries at Paphos and Amathus. She
was associated with the hero Hippolytus, and they
had a shrine on the Acropolis at Athens.
Aphrodite had many epithets, such as Aligena (sea
born), Urania (heavenly), Pandemos (popular), Area
(like Ares, that is, armed for war), Kourotrophos
(nurse) and Epipontia (on the sea). The myrtle and
dove were sacred to Aphrodite. In mythology she has
two alternative origins. In one legend she sprang from
the foam in the sea that gathered around the severed
organs when Uranus was castrated by Cronus. In
another legend she was the daughter of Zeus and
Dione and husband of Hephaestus. Aphrodite
favored the Trojan cause in the siege of Troy, and
Aeneas was her son by the Trojan Anchises. In some
legends she was the mother of Eros by Ares, in others
the mother of Harmonia by Ares. In Athens the
fourth day of every month was celebrated as the
birthday of Aphrodite.
Apollo (Apollon, Appollon):
A god worshipped
throughout the Greek world, and the embodiment of
moral excellence and of young, but mature, male
beauty (ﬁg. 8.3). He had many diverse functions: he
was a god of music (especially the lyre), of prophecy,
healing, archery (but not war or hunting) and of the
care of herds and ﬂocks. He was also a god of light
(sometimes being identiﬁed with the Sun and with
the god Helios). Despite being a god of healing and
medicine, he was also the god of plague. He was usu-
ally associated with what were regarded as the higher
developments of civilization, such as moral and reli-
gious principles, philosophy and law.
As a god of prophecy, there were important ora-
cles at several of Apollo’s sanctuaries, such as
Branchidae and Clarus. The most important was at
Delphi. The island of Delos was sacred to Apollo.
He had many epithets, including Pythian (the name

of Apollo at Delphi), Phoebus (bright) and Nomius
(belonging to shepherds). On Cyprus there was a
sanctuary of Apollo Hylates (Apollo of the Wood-
land) (ﬁg. 8.4). Apollo Paeon was a god of healing—
Paeon was a god of healing in the Iliad.
In mythology Apollo was an Olympian, the son of
Zeus and Leto and the twin brother of Artemis.
Many legends concerned Apollo’s numerous spheres
of inﬂuence. One related how he seized Delphi by
destroying the Python, an early deity that appears to
have been absorbed by Apollo, giving rise to the
Pythian Apollo of the Delphic Oracle. Apollo was
generally regarded as politically neutral, but he is
shown favoring the Trojans in Homer’s Iliad. The
Delphic Oracle was not always neutral, however, and
favored the Persians during the Persian Wars and the
Spartans during the Peloponnesian War.
In Athens the seventh day of every month was
celebrated as Apollo’s birthday. The Pythian Games
were held every four years at Delphi in his honor. A
sacriﬁce to Apollo Apotropaeus (Apollo who averts
evil) and to Apollo Nymphegetes (Apollo who looks
after the Nymphs) was undertaken by the Attic deme
Erchia on the eighth day of the month Gamelion. A
sacriﬁce to Pythian Apollo by the deme Erchia also
took place on the fourth day of the month Tharge-
lion. In Sparta and other Doric states, the Carnea
festival was celebrated in honor of Apollo in the
month of Karneios (August–September).
Ares (Ares, Areus):
The god of war, a personiﬁca-
tion of the warlike spirit or warlike frenzy. He was
not a very popular god but was more important in
Thebes, northern and western Greece and possibly
in Athens, where the Areopagus (Hill of Ares) bore
his name. In mythology he was one of the
Olympians, son of Hera and Zeus. Ares was por-
trayed as an unchivalrous instigator of trouble and
strife. He was frequently associated with Aphrodite
(wife of Hephaestus), by whom (in some legends) he
had a daughter Harmonia or (in other legends) a son
Eros. He also fathered numerous other children,
usually sons, most of whom came to unhappy ends.
Arethusa (Arethousa):
In mythology one of the
Hesperides and also the name given to a Nymph of
Arcadia. The latter Arethusa (ﬁg. 10.6) bathed in the
Alpheus River in Arcadia; the river god (Alpheus) fell
in love with her. She ﬂed from him and became a
spring in Syracuse, but Alpheus ﬂowed under the sea
to be joined with her. In antiquity it was believed that
there was an actual connection between the two, and
that something thrown into the Alpheus River might
be recovered from the spring in Syracuse.
Arges (Arges, Bright):
One of the Cyclopes.
Argonauts (Argonautai):
Heroes who were led by
Jason in his journey to Colchis to bring back the
Golden Fleece. Their name (sailors of Argo) is
derived from their ship, called Argo. The legend of
the Argonauts is one of the oldest Greek legends and
may derive from an actual expedition from Boeotia
to the Black Sea. The Argonauts had many adven-
tures during the voyage. See also JASON.

at Curium, Cyprus. The cult was celebrated here from
the 8th century BC, but most remains date to c. AD 100.
(It was rebuilt after an earlier earthquake.)

Argos (Argos):
The names of several characters in
mythology. One was a craftsman who built the ship
Argo with the help of Athena. Another was the faith-
ful dog of Odysseus, who recognized his master after
20 years’ absence, and then died. The third Argos
was a giant with 100 eyes, used as a herdsman to keep
careful watch over Io, after Zeus changed her into a
heifer. Hermes killed Argos, and Hera placed his
eyes in the peacock’s tail.
Ariadne (Ariadne):
In mythology the daughter of
King Minos of Crete and Pasiphae. When Theseus
arrived in Crete, Ariadne fell in love with him and
gave him a ball of thread with which he guided him-
self out of the labyrinth after killing the Minotaur.
Theseus ﬂed with Ariadne but abandoned her on the
island of Naxos. In some legends Theseus left her
pregnant and she died in childbirth. In another ver-
sion Ariadne was found by Dionysus who married
her. She then became immortal or else was given a
crown of seven stars by Dionysus, and the stars
became a constellation after her death. See also
THESEUS.
Arimaspeans or Arimaspians (Arimaspoi):
A leg-
endary people whose land bordered that of the
Hyperboreans. They were one-eyed and were con-
tinually ﬁghting with grifﬁns who guarded a hoard of
gold.
Aristaeus (Aristaios):
A hero or god who was a
protector of cattle and fruit trees, and a deity of
hunting, husbandry and beekeeping. His cult origi-
nated in Thessaly, but he was also worshipped in
Boeotia, Ceos, Cyrene and elsewhere. In mythology
he was the son of Apollo and Cyrene (daughter of
King Hypseus of the Lapiths). Aristaeus fell in love
with Eurydice and pursued her; as she tried to
escape, she trod on a snake and was fatally bitten. To
avenge her the Nymphs killed all his bees. Aristaeus
tried to ascertain what was wrong from Proteus, who
told him to sacrifice all his cattle to the Nymphs.
This he did, and returning after nine days he found
bees swarming in the cattle carcasses.
Artemis (Artemis, Artamis):
A virgin goddess,
originally a deity of wildlife, wild places and fertility,
who came to be worshipped in cities as a goddess of
fertility and the chief protector of women in child-
birth (ﬁg. 8.5). Artemis was the daughter of Zeus and
the minor deity Leto and the twin sister of Apollo.
She was one of the Olympians and was usually por-

Sudden and painless deaths of women were thought
to be the result of being struck by the arrows of
Artemis. In Athens the ﬁfth day of every month was
celebrated as her birthday, and a sacriﬁce to Artemis
by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the 12th day
of the month Hekatombaion. The festival of
Munichia was celebrated in her honor at Athens on
the 16th day of the month Mounichion. She had a
major cult center at Brauron, where a festival (Brau-
ronia) was held in her honor. Artemis was sometimes
identiﬁed with the goddesses Hecate and Selene, the
Cretan goddess Britomartis, and the great mother
goddess of Ephesus (usually known now by her
Roman name “Diana of the Ephesians”). Artemis
had several epithets, including Potnia Theron (mis-
tress of wild animals), Cynthia (after her birthplace
on Mount Cynthus in Delos), Kourotrophos (nurse),
Agrotera (huntress) and Locheia (helper in child-
birth). Artemis was often invoked by women in
oaths, and it was essential to placate her in childbirth.
Asclepius (Asklepios):
A hero and god of healing
(fig. 8.6). He was worshipped throughout Greece
and had several major healing shrines (Asclepieia),
the most important being at Epidaurus. His five
daughters, Aceso, Iaso, Panacea, Aglaea and Hygieia,
were associated with his cult, although Hygieia
(health) appears to have been the most important
after Asclepius himself. His symbols were snakes
twined around a staff, crowns of laurel and pine
cones. Asclepius was the son of Apollo and Coronis
and was taught his art by Chiron. He appears to have
originally been regarded as a hero (he is a mortal in
Homer’s Iliad) but was later regarded as a god. Ascle-
pius knew how to bring the dead to life and restored
Hippolytus, but Zeus, fearing that Asclepius would
upset the natural order, killed him with a thunder-
bolt. At Athens the Epidauria (a festival in honor of
Asclepius) probably took place on the 17th or 18th
day of the month Boedromion. His cult actually
arrived in Athens on 18 Boedromion 420 BC.
Atalanta (Atalante):
In mythology daughter of
either Iasos (son of Lycurgus) or Schoeneus (son of
Athamas) and Clymene (daughter of Minyas). Ata-
lanta was a huntress and averse to marriage. She
refused to marry any man who could not defeat her
in a race, and those who failed were killed. She took
part in the Calydonian boar hunt with Meleager,
who fell in love with her. Aphrodite gave Meleager
three golden apples, which he carried in the race,
dropping them at intervals. Atalanta could not resist
stopping to pick them up, and so Meleager won and
married her.
Atargatis (Aramaic, Atar-Ata):
A Syrian earth and
vegetation goddess whose cult spread to a number of
Greek cities in the 2nd century BC. She was some-
times identified with the Ephesian Artemis. Atar-
gatis was worshipped as a fertility goddess at her
temple at Hierapolis—the greatest and holiest in
Syria. Originally her consort was apparently Dushara
or Dusares; he was regarded as subordinate to Atar-
gatis and was thought to be a king who had died and

was reborn. He became identiﬁed with Dionysus.
Later on Atargatis had a second consort called Hadad,
a Syrian thunder god (also called Baal Shamin) who
became identiﬁed with Zeus. He was also subordinate
to Atargatis.
Ate (Ate):
The personification of infatuation or
moral blindness.
Athena (Athena, Athene, Athenaia):
Patron god-
dess of Athens in Attica and of Athens in Boeotia.
She was also worshipped in many other places in
Greece (ﬁgs. 1.6, 3.11, 5.7, 5.10). In Athens (Attica)
the third day of every month was celebrated as the
birthday of Athena. A festival of Chalceia also took
place on the 30th day of the month Pyanopsion at
Athens; it was celebrated in honor of Athena in her
role of mistress of technology and in honor of Hep-
haestus, god of the smiths. The festival of Callynteria
was the spring cleaning of the temple of Athena at
Athens, which took place in the month of Tharge-
lion (probably the 24th day). On the 25th day of
Thargelion, the Plynteria (Festival of Washing) took
place at Athens, when the image of Athena (and pos-
sibly her robe) was ceremonially washed. A sacriﬁce
to Athena was undertaken by the Attic deme Teithras
on the 27th day of the month Boedromion, with
another sacrifice by the Attic deme Erchia on the
ninth day of the month Gamelion. The deme Erchia
also made a sacriﬁce to Athena Polias (Athena pro-
tector of the city) on the third day of the month
Skirophorion. Athena had three main festivals: the
Arrephoria, the Scirophoria and the Panathenaea.
In addition to being protector of citadels and
cities, Athena was regarded as a virgin war goddess, a
patron of arts and crafts and the personiﬁcation of
wisdom. She is usually portrayed in armor with a
spear and shield, often with an owl on her shoulder.
She was sometimes known as Pallas Athene, an
obscure name possibly meaning “maiden” or “bran-
disher of weapons.” She had several epithets, includ-
ing Glaukopis (owl-faced or bright-eyed), Parthenos
(virgin), Promachos (ﬁghter in the front ranks), Alal-
comeneis (repulses the enemy), Ergane (working

woman), Hippia (protector of horses), Nike (victori-
ous), Agoraia (goddess of the assembly) and Trito-
geneia (meaning unclear, but appears to link Athena
with water). As Athena Parthenos she had a major
temple on the Acropolis of Athens, now known as
the Parthenon (ﬁgs. 2.9 and 8.7). Pheidias erected
on the Acropolis a colossal bronze statue of the
armed Athena Promachos (Champion). At Corinth
she was worshipped as Chalinitis (the Bridler, fig.
8.8), and at Sparta Athena Poliachos (protector of
the city) was worshipped as Chalcioecus (living in a
brazen shrine).
In mythology Athena was an Olympian, the
daughter of Zeus and Metis (the latter being the wis-
est of all deities). Because it was destined that Metis
would ﬁrst bear Athena and then a god who would
rule Mount Olympus (and thus be a threat to Zeus),
Zeus swallowed Metis before Athena was born. This
resulted in Athena emerging, in full armor, from the
head of Zeus. Athena was identified with several
other deities including Hygeia and the Egyptian
goddess Neith. See also CASSANDRA.
Atlas (Atlas):
In mythology one of the Titans, a
son of Iapetus and Clymene. In Homer’s poetry he is
the father of Calypso, but in other legends he is the
father of the Pleiades, Hyades and Hesperides. He
was guardian of the pillars of heaven (which held up
the sky), but for his part in the revolt of the Titans
against Uranus, he was condemned to hold up the
sky by himself. He helped Heracles fetch the golden
apples of the Hesperides. See HERACLES.
Atreus (Atreus):
The son of Pelops, king of Myce-
nae and father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. He
was married to Aerope. After Myrtilus cursed Pelops,
each generation of his family met with disaster.
Pelops’ brother, Thyestes, seduced Aerope and tried
to usurp the throne of Atreus. Atreus banished
Thyestes, but later pretended to be reconciled. At a
banquet Atreus cooked and served Thyestes’ chil-
dren to him. Varying versions of this legend existed.
Atropos (Atropos, Inflexible):
One of the Fates
who cut the thread at the moment of death.
Attis or Atys (Attis):
An Anatolian god who was
the consort of the goddess Cybele. Phrygian myth
states that Attis was the son of Nana, daughter of the
river god Sangarius (a river in Asia Minor). Nana
conceived him after gathering an almond or almond
tree blossom that had risen from the severed male
organs of Agdistis (Cybele), who was born both male
and female and had been castrated by the gods.
Agdistis, now purely female, loved Attis. When Attis
wished to marry someone else, Agdistis was jealous
and drove him mad. He castrated himself and died
beneath a pine tree. Agdistis was so distressed that
the other gods granted that his body would not
decay.
In another legend Zeus, having tried in vain to
marry Cybele, let some of his semen fall on a rock,
from which the hermaphrodite Agdistis was born.
Dionysus castrated Agdistis, and a pomegranate tree
grew from the blood. Nana became pregnant by
inserting one of the fruits of the tree in her womb and
gave birth to Attis, but at Sangarius’ wish she aban-
doned Attis, who was adopted by some passersby. He
grew to be very handsome, and King Midas of Pessi-
nus wanted him to marry one of his daughters. Attis
and his attendants became very frenzied during an
argument between Agdistis and Cybele. He castrated
himself beneath a pine tree and died. Cybele buried
Attis and the daughter of Midas, who had killed her-
self in despair. Violets grew around the pine tree
where the blood of Attis and of Midas’ daughter had

fallen, and an almond tree grew over the daughter’s
grave. Zeus granted Agdistis that the body of Attis
should not decay, and that his hair would continue to
grow and his little ﬁnger move. According to legend
a festival and community of priests were founded by
Agdistis at Pessinus in honor of Attis.
Attis was a minor part of Cybele’s cult, and he was
variously regarded as a mortal or as a god of vegeta-
tion, although his status increased until, in the
Roman period, he was an equal deity with Cybele.
See also CYBELE.
Augeas or Augias (Augeias):
In mythology a king
of Elis, the cleaning of whose stables was one of the
labors of Heracles. Augeas’ treasury was said to have
been built by the legendary architects Trophonius and
Agamedes. See also HERACLES, TROPHONIUS.
Autolycus (Autolykos):
In mythology the grand-
father of Odysseus and a master of thieving and
trickery. He was taught his skills by Hermes, who,
in some versions of the legend, is said to be his
father.
Auxo: One of three goddesses of the seasons
(Horae) in Attica.
Basile (Basile):
A deity associated with the leg-
endary hero King Codrus and his ancestor Neleus.
The Attic deme Erchia sacrificed to Basile on the
fourth day of the month Boedromion. Little else is
known about this deity.
Bellerophon (Bellerophon, Bellerophontes):
In myth-
ology the son of Glaucus and grandson of Sisyphus.
He was the hero of an old legend of Corinth retold
in Homer’s Iliad. Because he repelled the advances
of Anteia (queen of Argos), she denounced him, and
her husband (King Proetus) sent him to the king of
Lycia with a sealed letter demanding Bellerophon’s
death. In Lycia he was given a number of potentially
lethal tasks, which he successfully performed, earn-
ing the right to marry the king’s daughter. Later ver-
sions of the legend relate that he was helped to
perform the tasks by a magic winged horse called
Pegasus, and that afterward he affronted the gods
by trying to ride Pegasus up to heaven. The gods
made him mad, and he died a wandering outcast.
See also CHIMAERA.
Bendis (Bendis):
A Thracian goddess, for whom
there was a festival at Athens on the 19th day of the
month Thargelion.
Biton and Cleobis (Biton, Kleobis):
In a legend
recounted in Herodotus’ history, Biton and Cleobis
were sons of a priestess of Hera. When no oxen
could be found, they pulled their mother’s chariot
several miles to the temple. She prayed for the best
possible gift as their reward, and consequently they
died in the temple. In Herodotus the story is given as
an illustration of the saying “call no man happy until
he is dead.”
Boreas (Boreas):
God of the north or northeast
wind. Like all wind gods, he was often thought to
take the form of a horse. He seems to have been par-
ticularly worshipped in Attica, and a state cult of
Boreas was established in Athens after he allegedly
destroyed the Persian ﬂeet at the battle of Artemi-
sium in 480 BC. Boreas was the son of Eos and
Astraeus. Legend says that he carried off the Nymph
Oreithyia (daughter of king Erechtheus of Athens) to
be his wife, for which he was described as “son-in-
law of the Athenians.” In Homer’s Iliad he is
described as a begetter of horses, probably reﬂecting
the speed of the wind and the common belief that
mares could be impregnated by the wind.
Briareus (Briareos, also known as Aegaeon by men,
Briareos by gods):
Son of Uranus and Gaia and one
of the Hecatoncheires. He was a giant with 100
hands who, with his brothers, helped Zeus in his bat-
tle against the Titans (Titanomachia). As a reward
he was given the task of guarding the Titans in Tar-
tarus (part of the underworld where the wicked were
punished for their evil deeds). When Zeus was about
to be put in chains by the other Olympian gods,
Thetis summoned Briareus to save him.
Britomartis (Britomartis, sweet maid in the Cretan
language):
A Cretan goddess identified with the
goddesses Artemis, Aphaea and Dictynna. In
mythology Minos fell in love with Britomartis. To
escape him, she jumped over a cliff into the sea and
made her way to Aegina, where she was subsequently
worshipped as Aphaea.
Brontes (Brontes, Thunderer):
One of the Cyclopes.

Bubastis: A cat-headed Egyptian goddess. She was
originally the local goddess of the city of Bubastis in
Egypt and became identiﬁed with Isis. The Greeks
identiﬁed her with Artemis. She was a goddess of plea-
sure and of protection against evil spirits and disease.
Cabiri or Cabeiri (Kabeiroi):
Deities of fertility
and of protection of sailors, whose cult was centered
on Samothrace. They were probably originally Phry-
gian deities, and different traditions record different
numbers of Cabiri. One tradition recorded four
Cabiri and named them as Axierus, Axiocersa, Axio-
cersus and Cadmilus. The Cabiri were part of a mys-
tery cult. Probably because of this, they were not
usually individually named but were generally
referred to as the “great gods.” See also ORIENTAL
AND MYSTERY RELIGIONS, p. 383.
Cadmus (Kadmos):
In mythology the son of King
Agenor of Tyre, brother of Europa and Phoenix and
legendary founder of Thebes. After Europa was
abducted by Zeus, Cadmus was sent to look for her,
but abandoned the search on the advice of the Del-
phic Oracle. Instead, he followed a cow in order to
found a city where it lay down. This took him to a
spring guarded by a dragon, which he killed. On the
instructions of the goddess Athena, Cadmus sowed
half the dragon’s teeth, which became ﬁghting men
who fought among themselves until only ﬁve were
left; these were the Spartoi (sown men) whom the
Theban nobility claimed as ancestors. The city of
Thebes was founded beside this spring, and its
acropolis was called the Cadmea. Cadmus married
Harmonia (daughter of Ares and Aphrodite), and
they had several children including Semele. Eventu-
ally Cadmus and Harmonia withdrew to Illyria,
where Zeus changed them into snakes and carried
them off to Elysium. Cadmus was credited with civi-
lizing the Boeotians and teaching them writing.
Calchas (Kalkhas):
In mythology a Greek seer
who took part in the Trojan War. In Homer’s Iliad,
he revealed the reason for the plague in the Greek
camp and also foretold the length of the war. In other
legends he was associated with the sacriﬁce of Iphi-
genia and with the Argonauts.
Calliope (Kalliope):
One of the Muses, thought in
late Roman times to preside over heroic epic.
Callisto (Kallisto):
A Nymph who was a daughter
of Lycaon. She was loved by Zeus and they had a
son, Arcas, who was the mythical ancestor of the
Arcadians. Callisto was changed into a bear, either in
anger by Hera or by Zeus to protect her from Hera’s
anger. She wandered as a bear until her son (or in
some versions, Artemis) pursued her with a spear. To
save her Zeus changed both into constellations, so
that Callisto became the constellation of the Great
Bear and Arcas became the Little Bear.
Calydonian boar: In mythology a monstrous boar
that ravaged the lands of King Oeneus of Calydon. It
was sent by Artemis because Oeneus had not offered
her proper sacrifice. It was hunted and killed by
Meleager during the Calydonian Boar Hunt.
Calypso (Kalypso):
A goddess or Nymph who was
the daughter of Atlas. She lived on an island called
Ogygia, where Odysseus was shipwrecked. Calypso
kept him there for seven years, promising to make
him immortal if he married her. Zeus sent Hermes to
order her to release Odysseus, and she gave him
materials to build a boat and released him. In some
legends Calypso had a son by Odysseus, called
Auson, who was the eponymous ancestor of the
Ausonians in Italy.
Capaneus (Kapaneus):
One of the heroes of the
Seven against Thebes and husband of Evadne. He
boasted that not even Zeus could stop him from scal-
ing the walls of Thebes; for this blasphemy, Zeus
killed Capaneus with a thunderbolt. Evadne commit-
ted suicide by throwing herself on his funeral pyre.
Cassandra (also known as Alexandra) (Kassandra):
In mythology a prophetess, the daughter of King
Priam of Troy and Hecuba. No mention of Cassan-
dra’s ability to prophesy occurs in Homer’s works,
but in a later legend she was loved by Apollo and was
given the art of prophecy. When she refused Apollo’s
love, he condemned her true prophecies to be always
disbelieved. When Troy fell she was found by Ajax
the Locrian clinging to the statue of Athena in her
temple. He dragged her away and raped her, for
which sacrilege the Locrians were obliged annually
to send two maidens to serve as slaves in the temple
of Athena at Troy. If the inhabitants caught them
before reaching the temple, they were killed. After

the sack of Troy Cassandra was given as a concubine
to Agamemnon, with whom she was murdered by
Aegisthus. See also AJAX.
Castor and Polydeuces (Kastor, Polydeukes):
Gods
known collectively as the Dioscuri.
Cecrops (Kekrops):
In mythology the ﬁrst king of
Athens, believed to have “sprung from the earth” as a
native of Attica. He was often represented as a human
above the waist and a serpent below, indicating his
origin, since serpents were thought to dwell within
the earth. During his reign a contest for Attica took
place between Athena and Poseidon, and Cecrops
was appointed judge; he awarded Attica to Athena.
Celaeno (Kelaino, dark):
One of the Harpies.
Centaurs (Kentauroi):
A race of monsters with the
chest, head and arms of a man, but the legs and body
of a horse (ﬁg. 8.9). They were variously described as
the offspring of Ixion and Nephele or the offspring
of Centaurus (son of Ixion and Nephele) who had
mated with mares. See also CHIRON, NESSUS and
THESEUS.
Cephalus (Kephalos):
A hero of Attica. In mythol-
ogy he was the husband of Procris (daughter of
Erechtheus). The goddess Eos fell in love with
Cephalus, causing dissension between him and Pro-
cris, but Artemis gave Procris a hound that always
caught its quarry and a spear that never missed its
target. Procris gave these to Cephalus, and the two
were reconciled. However, Eos made Procris jealous
of the amount of time Cephalus spent hunting. Pro-
cris hid in a bush to spy on Cephalus; mistaking her
for an animal, Cephalus killed Procris with his spear.
Cerberus (Kerberos):
A monstrous dog that guarded
the entrance to the underworld. It was the offspring of
Typhon and Echidna and had three (in some versions,
50) heads and a tail or mane of snakes. One labor of
Heracles was to capture Cerberus and take him back
to King Eurystheus. See also HERACLES.
8.9 This Roman mosaic from Paphos Nea, Cyprus, shows a triumphal procession in which a pair of centaurs pulls a
chariot carrying the baby Dionysus (barely visible).

Chaos (Khaos, gaping void):
In mythology the ﬁrst
being to be created. Chaos was scarcely a personiﬁ-
cation, being generally regarded as the nothingness
that existed before the rest of creation. Gaia was the
daughter of Chaos.
Charon (Kharon):
An aged ferryman who con-
veyed the souls of the dead across the rivers of the
underworld to their final resting place. He would
ferry them only if the funeral rites had been properly
performed, and if they paid a fee of one obol. The
Greeks put a coin in the mouth of the dead person
before burial as his fee.
Charybdis (Kharybdis):
A whirlpool in a narrow
channel of water (often identiﬁed as the Straits of
Messina). It was sometimes regarded as a female
monster, the daughter of Poseidon and Gaia.
Charybdis was situated opposite Scylla, creating two
hazards between which Odysseus had to choose,
since he could not avoid both. He chose Charybdis
and escaped from the resulting shipwreck by clinging
to a tree growing above the whirlpool.
Chimaera (Khimaira):
A fire-breathing monster
with a lion’s head, a she-goat’s body and the tail of a
snake. It was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna
and was killed by Bellerophon.
Chiron (Kheiron):
A centaur who was wise and
kind (unlike other centaurs). He was sometimes said
to have different parents (Cronus and Philyra) from
the other centaurs. Chiron was known for his knowl-
edge of archery, music and medicine and taught
heroes such as Achilles, Jason and Asclepius. He was
accidentally killed by Heracles and became the con-
stellation Sagittarius.
Chryseis (Khryseis):
In mythology the daughter of
Chryses (priest of Apollo on the island of Chryse,
near Troy). When the Greeks overran the island, she
was taken prisoner and given to Agamemnon as a
concubine. Agamemnon refused to ransom her, pre-
ferring her to Clytemnestra. Apollo therefore
answered the prayers of Chryseis’ father and sent a
plague to the Greek camp. Agamemnon refused to
return Chryseis unless he was given Briseis, who had
been allotted to Achilles, thus starting their quarrel.
Circe (Kirke):
In mythology a goddess and sorcer-
ess who lived on the mythical island of Aeaea. In
Homer’s Odyssey she is the daughter of Helios and
Perse. She changed Odysseus’ men into pigs, but
Odysseus managed to resist the spell, aided by a herb
given to him by Hermes. He forced her to restore his
men, and they lived on Aeaea for a year. Circe then
gave Odysseus advice about his journey to the under-
world and his return home. In other legends she had
two children (Agrios and Latinus) by Odysseus and
received Jason and Medea on their return from
Colchis. Some legends said Telegonus was the son of
Circe and Odysseus, and in other legends Circe mar-
ried Telemachus after Odysseus’ death.
Clio (Kleio):
One of the Muses, thought in the late
Roman period to preside over history.
Clotho (Klotho, spinner):
One of the Fates who
spun the thread of life.
Clytemnestra or Clytaem(n)estra (Klytaim(n)estra):
Daughter of King Tyndareus of Sparta and his wife
Leda, and sister of Helen of Troy and the Dioscuri.
She married Agamemnon and was the mother of
Iphigenia, Chrysothemis, Electra and Orestes. While
Agamemnon was at the siege of Troy, Clytemnestra
took Aegisthus as a lover. When Agamemnon
returned with Cassandra as his concubine, Aegisthus
killed them both. When Orestes reached manhood
he killed Clytemnestra and Aegisthus in revenge for
Agamemnon’s death.
Codrus (Kodros):
A legendary king of Athens,
thought to have reigned in the 11th century BC. He
was worshipped as a hero in association with Neleus
and the obscure deity Basile. In mythology Codrus
was of the Neleid family and was expelled, with his
father Melanthus, from his kingdom of Pylos by the
Dorians. He went to Attica, killed King Xanthus of
Boeotia in single combat, and was accepted as king of
Athens in place of the existing king who was of the
Theseid family.
Coeus (Koios):
In mythology one of the Titans.
Coronis (Koronis):
The daughter of Phlegyas and
mother of Asclepius. While pregnant by Apollo,
R E L I G I O N

Coronis fell in love with an Arcadian, Ischys (son of
Elatus). A crow informed Apollo, who sent Artemis
to kill Coronis; when her body was on the funeral
pyre, Apollo took the unborn child (Asclepius) to be
raised by Chiron.
Cottus (Kottus):
In mythology one of the Heca-
toncheires.
Cotys, Cotyto or Cotytto (Kotys, Koty[t]to):
A
Thracian goddess associated with Cybele. She had
an orgiastic cult that eventually spread throughout
Greece.
Creon (Kreon, Prince):
The name of several ﬁgures
in mythology, of whom two were particularly impor-
tant. One was the king of Corinth with whom Jason
and Medea took refuge. Jason abandoned Medea in
favor of Creon’s daughter; in revenge Medea killed
Creon (in some versions, Creon’s daughter as well).
Another Creon was the brother of Jocasta (wife of
Oedipus). Creon ruled Thebes on three occasions:
after the death of Laius (father of Oedipus), on the
downfall of Oedipus and at the death of Eteocles.
Creusa (Kreousa, Princess):
The name of several
ﬁgures in mythology, of whom two were particularly
important. One was the daughter of King Erechtheus
of Athens and mother (by Apollo) of Ion, from whom
the Ionians were allegedly descended. Another
Creusa was daughter of King Priam of Troy and
Hecuba. This Creusa was wife of Aeneas and mother
of Ascanius and died ﬂeeing Troy after its capture.
Crius (Kreios):
In mythology one of the Titans.
Cronus (Kronos):
One of the Titans and the
youngest son of Uranus and Gaia. He castrated
Uranus in order to gain his throne and married his sis-
ter Rhea. Their children were Hestia, Demeter, Hera,
Hades, Poseidon and Zeus. Because he was fated to be
overthrown by one of his children, he swallowed each
one after they were born, except Zeus, who was smug-
gled to Crete. Instead, Cronus was tricked into swal-
lowing a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, and later
he vomited up all those he had swallowed. In Athens a
festival in honor of Cronus was on the 12th day of the
month Hekatombaion.
Curetes (Kouretes):
The half-divine beings who
lived in Crete. The infant Zeus was given to their
care, to protect him from his father Cronus. To con-
ceal Zeus they danced around him clashing weapons
to drown his cries. They were later confused with
the Corybantes who attended the goddess Cybele.
Cybele, Angdistis or Agdistis (Kybele, Kybebe):
Anatolian mother goddess whose cult was known in
Greece by the 5th century BC. She was sometimes
identiﬁed with Demeter or with Rhea, and also with
the local “mother of the gods.” Her cult was cen-
tered at Pessinus in Phrygia, where she was known as
Agdistis. Her consort was Attis, and a great deal of
mythology surrounded them both. She was consid-
ered to be the mother of all living things—an earth
mother goddess and a goddess of fertility and wild
nature. She was often portrayed wearing a turreted
crown, seated on a vehicle drawn by lions or on a
throne attended by lions. A characteristic of her cult
consisted of states of ecstasy, inducing prophecy and
insensibility to pain. She was also said to cause and to
cure disease.
The rites of Cybele and Attis included the tau-
robolium (a ritual where a worshipper stood in a pit,
while a bull was sacriﬁced on a slatted ﬂoor above,
bathing the person in its blood), self-ﬂagellation and
castration of the priests (galloi) and ecstatic dances.
The Corybantes were priests associated mainly with
the cult of Cybele. A temple or sanctuary of Cybele
was known as a metroon (mother’s shrine, from meter,
mother). The name Cybele was little used, and the
goddess became conflated with the Greek Great
Mother or Mother of the Gods. The worship by
women of this goddess was popular. See also ATTIS.
Cyclopes (sing. Cyclops) (Kyklopes):
Gigantic
one-eyed beings, the offspring of Uranus and Gaia.
There are conﬂicting traditions about the Cyclopes.
According to Hesiod there were three Cyclopes
called Brontes, Steropes and Arges, who were crafts-
men and made thunderbolts. They were sometimes
regarded as the workmen of Hephaestus, and the
Greeks often attributed ancient fortifications to
them. However, in Homer’s Odyssey, the Cyclopes
are represented as savage, pastoral creatures and one
of them, Polyphemus (a son of Poseidon), impris-
oned Odysseus in a cave.

Daedalus (Daidalos, literally “artful” or “cunning
worker”):
In mythology an inventor and craftsman
living at the time of King Minos of Crete. Born in
Athens he was forced to leave after he killed his
nephew Perdix, who was a more skillful craftsman.
Daedalus went to Crete where he made the labyrinth
to house the Minotaur. He also made Ariadne’s
thread and the hollow wooden cow for Pasiphae.
Enraged that he had helped Pasiphae, King Minos
imprisoned Daedalus and his son Icarus, but they
escaped from Crete by ﬂying on wings of wax and
feathers. Icarus was killed, but Daedalus successfully
ﬂew to Sicily, where he made many marvelous cre-
ations. See also ICARUS.
Daimon (Daimon):
A supernatural being, interme-
diate between gods and men. A man was believed to
have a good and evil Daimon that followed him
through life and inﬂuenced his actions. It does not
appear to have been equivalent to “fate.” The term
Daimon was also applied to some minor gods. See
also AGATHOS DAIMON.
Damocles (Damokles):
In mythology a courtier of
Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse. When Damocles
excessively praised the life of luxury of Dionysius, the
latter gave a banquet during which a sword was sus-
pended by a thread above the head of Damocles to
make him understand the precarious nature of the
luxury enjoyed by the tyrant. This gave rise to the
expression “sword of Damocles.”
Danae (Danae):
The daughter of King Acrisius of
Argos. Because a prophecy foretold that Acrisius
would be killed by his daughter’s son, he imprisoned
Danae in a bronze tower to keep her away from men.
However, Zeus descended on her as a shower of
gold, and she bore him a son called Perseus. Acrisius
set Danae and Perseus adrift on the sea in a chest, but
they safely reached the island of Seriphos and were
sheltered by King Polydectes. The king persuaded
Perseus to fetch the Gorgon’s head; returning with
the head, he used it to turn Polydectes to stone for
molesting Danae. Perseus then returned to Argos
with Danae. See also PERSEUS.
Danaus (Danaos):
In mythology the son of King
Belus of Egypt and brother of Aegyptus. Aegyptus
wanted his 50 sons to marry the 50 daughters of
Danaus. There was a dispute between them, but
Danaus ﬁnally agreed to the mass marriage. How-
ever, he told his daughters to kill their husbands on
the wedding night. All obeyed except Hypermestra,
who spared her husband Lynceus. Danaus impris-
oned Hypermestra, but she was later spared (in some
versions, by Aphrodite’s intervention). Danaus mar-
ried off the other daughters by standing them at the
end of a racecourse and letting their suitors run for
them. After their deaths these daughters were pun-
ished in the underworld by being made to ﬁll leaking
jars with water. The myth of Danaus is an attempt to
establish Egyptian origins for the Danaans, a general
name for early Greek people inhabiting the Argos
region. It was sometimes used to mean the Greek
nation as a whole.
Daphne (Daphne, laurel):
A Nymph who was
daughter of the river god Ladon in Arcadia. Pursued
by Apollo she prayed to the river god Peneus for help
and was turned into a laurel tree.
Deianira (Deianeira):
The daughter of Oeneus
and Althea, sister of Meleager and wife of Heracles.
Heracles met Meleager’s spirit in the underworld,
and the spirit asked him to marry Deianira who was
without support after Meleager’s death. Heracles
won Deianira in combat with Achelous, but on the
way home Heracles trusted the centaur Nessus to
carry her across a river. Nessus tried to assault her,
and Heracles killed him with one of his poisoned
arrows. The dying Nessus gave Deianira some of his
blood (or a blood-stained shirt) telling her it was a
love charm. Years later, after Deianira had borne
Heracles several children, Heracles brought home
Iole. To regain his affection Deianira gave him a gar-
ment smeared with the blood of Nessus (which was
poison); when Heracles put it on, the poison killed
him. Deianira killed herself when she realized what
had happened.
Deidamia (Deidameia):
In mythology the mother
of Neoptolemus by Achilles.
Demeter (Demeter):
The goddess of grain crops
who presided over agriculture and the harvest, and
who was a central deity in the Eleusinian Mysteries.

The word meter is mother. She was sometimes iden-
tiﬁed with the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Phry-
gian goddess Cybele. Demeter was one of the
Olympians. Apart from her worship at Eleusis, she
was worshipped throughout Greece. A three-day fes-
tival (Thesmophoria) in her honor was celebrated
throughout most of the Greek world. At Athens it
took place on the 11th–13th days of the month
Pyanopsion. Also at Athens a fertility festival (called
Haloa) in honor of Demeter and Dionysus took
place on the 26th day of the month Poseideon. The
Stenia was a women’s festival at Athens in honor of
Demeter and Persephone. In mythology Demeter
was daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and mother of
Persephone by Zeus and of Plutus by Iasion. Most
myths concerning Demeter also relate to Perse-
phone. See also PERSEPHONE.
Deucalion (Deukalion):
The name of several char-
acters in mythology, the most important being the
son of Prometheus. When Zeus was so angry at the
crimes of mortals and decided to destroy them with a
ﬂood, Deucalion was warned by Prometheus. Deu-
calion built a boat for himself and his wife Pyrrha.
They sailed on the flood until they grounded on
Mount Parnassus. Advised by an oracle to throw
their mother’s bones over their shoulder, they real-
ized that this meant “mother earth” and threw
stones. Those thrown by Deucalion became men and
those thrown by Pyrrha became women. They later
became the parents of Hellen, the eponymous ances-
tor of the Greeks (Hellenes).
Dictynna (Diktynna):
A goddess identified with
Britomartis and Artemis. She was probably a god-
dess of Mount Dicte in Crete, but her cult is also
known from places on mainland Greece. She was
usually portrayed as a huntress. Due to confusion
over the origin of her name (from Mount Dicte,
rather than from diktyon, ﬁshing net), a myth existed
that she ﬂed from King Minos, who was in love with
her, but became entangled in ﬁshermen’s nets.
Diomedes (Diomedes):
In mythology two char-
acters were called Diomedes. One was a king of
Thrace, son of Ares and Cyrene, whose man-eating
horses were captured by Heracles as one of his
labors. The other Diomedes was a son of Tydeus and
Deipyle, the daughter of Adrastus. He took part in
the siege of Troy and, with the help of Athena, man-
aged to wound Aphrodite and Ares. He behaved
chivalrously to Glaucus, who fought for the Trojan
side. With Odysseus he raided the Trojan camp and
went to fetch Philoctetes from Lemnos. See also
GLAUCUS.
Dionysus (Dionysos):
God of nature, who became
god of the vine and of wine. He was also a god of
mystic ecstasy, and his cult was one of the mystery
religions. In mythology Dionysus was the son of
Zeus and Semele and was one of the Olympians.
Semele asked Zeus to show himself to her in all his
glory, but she was struck dead by the sight. Zeus took
Dionysus, only in his sixth month, from Semele’s
womb and sewed the infant inside his thigh. At the
proper time Dionysus emerged from the thigh, alive
and perfectly formed, to become “the twice-born
god.” Other legends describe Dionysus as driven
mad by Hera and cured by the goddess Cybele, into
whose rites he was initiated. He was said to have
descended into the underworld, where he restored
Semele to life. Hades agreed to release the shade of
Semele if Dionysus gave him something that he held
very dear, so Dionysus gave up the myrtle plant. On
his way to the underworld he had asked a man named
Prosymnus (or Polymnus) for directions, and the
man had asked for certain sexual favors from Diony-
sus on his return. When Dionysus returned, he could
not fulﬁll his promise because Prosymnus had died;
the best he could do was to plant a phallus-shaped
stick in the tomb of Prosymnus.
The cult of Dionysus reﬂected elements of these
varying myths. There were two Dionysia (festivals of
Dionysus) celebrated at Athens. The lesser festival
was the Rural Dionysia (celebrated in the month
Poseideon). The greater festival was the City or
Great Dionysia, which apparently took place
between the 10th and 17th of the month Elaphebo-
lion. Also at Athens a fertility festival (Haloa), in
honor of Dionysus and Demeter, took place on the
26th day of the month Poseideon, and a festival in
honor of Dionysus (the Lenaea) on the 12th day of
the month Gamelion. A sacriﬁce to Dionysus by the
Attic deme Erchia took place on the second day of
the month Anthesterion. The Anthesteria was a fes-
tival in honor of Dionysus, widely celebrated by Ion-
ian Greeks; at Athens it was celebrated on the
11th–13th of the month Anthesterion. A meeting of

the Attic deme Myrrhinus took place on the 19th day
of the month Poseideon on matters concerned with
Dionysus. See also LYCURGUS, SILENUS; MYSTER-
IES OF DIONYSUS (p. 384).
Dionysus Zagreus (Dionysos Zagreus):
The Greek
god Dionysus linked with the Cretan god Zagreus.
In mythology he was the son of Zeus and Demeter.
The other Greek gods were jealous of him and
arranged that he was torn to pieces. The goddess
Pallas Athene saved his heart and took it to Zeus,
who used it to create the god Dionysus. This story of
death and resurrection appears to have played an
important part in the cult of Orphism.
Dioscuri (Dioskouroi, Sons of Zeus):
The gods
Castor and Polydeuces (Pollux to the Romans) were
known collectively as the Dioscuri. It is uncertain
whether they were originally heroes who became
regarded as gods, or gods whose cult had been
diminished. The Dioscuri were sometimes identiﬁed
with the Cabiri, Oriental deities (probably of Phry-
gian origin), who promoted fertility and protected
sailors. Castor and Polydeuces came to be regarded
as gods of salvation and protectors of sailors at sea. In
mythology they were twin brothers of Helen and
sons of Leda. They were notable horsemen and took
part in the expedition of the Argonauts. They carried
off Hilaera and Phoebe (daughters of King Leucip-
pus of Messenia), whose brothers Idas and Lynceus
fought to rescue them and killed Castor. However,
Polydeuces was allowed to take Castor’s place in the
underworld on alternate days. A sacrifice to the
Dioscuri by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the
fourth day of the month Thargelion. They were
important deities at Sparta.
Dirce (Dirke):
In mythology the wife of Lycus who
was regent of Thebes. She persecuted Antiope, and in
revenge the sons of Antiope killed Dirce by tying her
to the horns of a bull. After her death she was
changed into the stream that then bore her name.
Echo (Ekho):
A Nymph who engaged Hera in con-
versation when she was trying to spy on Zeus. As
punishment Hera deprived Echo of normal speech so
that she could only repeat the words of others. Echo
fell in love with Narcissus, but when he rejected her,
she pined away until only her voice was left.
Eileithyia (Eileithyia):
Goddess of childbirth,
occasionally worshipped as a guardian deity of a city.
She appears originally to have been a Mycenaean
mother goddess. She was later identified with
Artemis and Hera, and her name was sometimes used
as a title of Hera. She was sometimes regarded as the
sister of Artemis and daughter of Zeus and Hera. She
was sometimes addressed in the plural—Eileithyiae
(Eileithyiai), who were goddesses of childbirth.
Electra (Elektra):
Three mythological characters
had the name Electra:
1. A daughter of Atlas, one of the Pleiades and
mother of Dardanus and Iasion.
2. A daughter of Oceanus, wife of Thaumus and
mother of Iris and the Harpies.
3. The best known Electra was the daughter of
Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. She was not
mentioned by Homer, but appears ﬁrst in a work
by Stesichorus and is a central figure in later
Greek tragedies, where she is represented as the
driving force behind her brother Orestes’ revenge
on their mother.
Elpenor (Elpenor):
In mythology a companion of
Odysseus who fell to his death from the roof of
Circe’s palace while sleeping and was left unburied.
He was the ﬁrst shade met by Odysseus in the under-
world, and successfully begged Odysseus to have his
body cremated and buried beneath a barrow with his
oar planted on top.
Endymion (Endymion):
In mythology a very beau-
tiful youth who was a shepherd. Selene (the moon)
fell in love with him because of his beauty while he
was sleeping on Mount Latmus in Caria. Selene (or
in some versions, Zeus) made him sleep there for-
ever. In another version Hypnos (god of sleep) fell in
love with Endymion and made him sleep with open
eyes, while another legend relates that Endymion
was king of Elis and founder of the festival at
Olympia. Selene was said to have borne 50 daughters
by him (probably corresponding to the 50 months of
an Olympiad).
Enyo (Enyo):
Goddess of war, second in impor-
tance to Ares. In mythology Enyo was also a name of
one of the Graiae.

Eos (Eos):
Goddess of the dawn, who appears to
have been a purely mythological rather than cult ﬁg-
ure. In mythology she was sister of Helios and
Selene, and each morning she drove a chariot across
the sky. Most stories about her concern beautiful
young men that she carried off to be her lovers. See
also TITHONUS.
Epops (Epops, literally a “hoopoe”):
A sacriﬁce to
Epops by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the
ﬁfth day of the month Boedromion.
Erato (Erato):
One of the Muses, thought in late
Roman times to preside over hymns.
Erechtheus (Erekhtheus):
Believed by the Greeks
to be an early king of Athens. Homer mentions that
he was worshipped with Athena on the Acropolis at
Athens (ﬁg. 8.10). In mythology Erechtheus was a
son of Gaia but was reared by Athena. Creusa and
Procris (who married Cephalus) were his daughters.
Erinyes (Erinyes):
Spirits of punishment and
vengeance, sometimes invoked in oaths and curses.
They avenged wrongs done to kindred, especially
murder of one family member by another. They
were sometimes thought to act on the conscience or
remorse of the wrongdoer, making the person mad.
They were the offspring of Gaia and Uranus.
Eros (Eros):
God of love and fertility, worshipped
in many parts of Greece. He had an ancient fertility
cult at Thespiae and a joint cult with Aphrodite at
Athens. He was sometimes worshipped in the plural
(Erotes) and symbolized all attractions that provoked
love, including heterosexual and homosexual attrac-
tions. In Athens the fourth day of every month was
sacred to Eros. In mythology he was often regarded
8.10 Ionic columns supporting an entablature in the Erectheum at Athens. This temple housed various cults, including
Athena, Poseidon and Erectheus.

as the companion and sometimes the son of
Aphrodite. In some legends he is the son of Iris and
Zephyrus. In other legends he was one of the oldest
gods, all-powerful over every god and mortal.
Eteocles (Eteokles):
In mythology the elder son of
Oedipus and Jocasta, the brother of Polynices,
Antigone and Ismene. After Oedipus went into exile,
Eteocles and Polynices agreed to rule Thebes in
alternate years, but at the end of his year Eteocles
refused to give up the throne, which led to the action
called the “Seven Against Thebes.”
Eumaeus (Eumaios):
Odysseus’ faithful swineherd
who entertained Odysseus in his hut when the latter
returned home. He recognized Odysseus and helped
him destroy Penelope’s suitors.
Eumenides (Eumenides, literally “kindly ones”):
A
euphemistic name for the Erinyes.
Europa (Europe):
A goddess worshipped in Crete.
She appears to have been a mythological ﬁgure who
became conﬂated with a Cretan goddess, and had a
festival called the Hellotia. In mythology Europa was
a daughter of King Agenor of Tyre. Zeus fell in love
with her and, disguised as a bull, carried her off to
Crete. There she had three sons by Zeus called
Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon.
Eurydice (Eurydike):
The name of several women
in mythology, including the wife of King Creon of
Thebes. The best known Eurydice was the wife of
Orpheus. While pursued by Aristaeus, Eurydice was
bitten by a snake and died. She descended into the
underworld. Orpheus followed her and persuaded
Hades to let her follow him out of the underworld.
This was on condition that Orpheus did not look
back at Eurydice before reaching the upper world,
but he broke this condition and lost her forever.
Euterpe (Euterpe,
well-pleasing):
One of the
Muses, thought in the late Roman period to preside
over ﬂutes and music.
Evander (Evandros):
A god worshipped in Arcadia,
connected with the worship of Pan. In mythology
Evander was the son of Hermes and Themis.
Fates (Moirai):
In early Greek literature fate
appears to be an impersonal concept—something
that ruled people’s destinies and was stronger than
the gods. The concept of a trio of goddesses devel-
oped (Moirai, sing. Moira), who were variously
regarded as daughters of Nyx (night), or of Zeus and
Themis (justice), but Plato made them daughters of
Ananke (necessity). The three Fates were regarded as
old women engaged in spinning: Clotho (spinner)
spun the thread of life, Lachesis (apportioner) drew
off the length of thread and Atropos (inﬂexible) cut
the thread at the moment of death.
Gaia or Ge (Latin, Gaea; Greek, Gaia or Ge):
A
goddess who personified the earth. She was wor-
shipped throughout Greece in early times, but later
was often superseded by other gods. For example,
she originally provided the oracle at Delphi, before
Apollo. A sacriﬁce to Gaia by the Attic deme Erchia
took place on the 27th day of the month Boe-
dromion. In mythology Gaia was the daughter of
Chaos and the mother and wife of Uranus (heaven).
Among her offspring were the Titans, Cyclopes,
Giants, Erinyes and Hecatoncheires.
Galatea (Galateia, literally “milk-white”):
A Nereid
wooed by the Cyclops Polyphemus. In a later legend,
she loved a Sicilian shepherd called Acis. Polyphemus
pursued them, and Galatea escaped into the sea. Acis
was crushed by a rock thrown by Polyphemus, so
Galatea changed him into the Acis River in Sicily.
Ganymede (Ganymedes):
In mythology a Trojan
prince who was son of King Tros (in some versions,
Laomedon). Because of his beauty Ganymede was
carried off to be the cupbearer to Zeus. In exchange
Zeus gave Ganymede’s father a pair of divine horses
(or in later legends, a golden vine). In other versions
Ganymede was carried off by an eagle (or by Zeus in
the shape of an eagle) because Zeus desired him. He
came to symbolize homosexuality.
Geryon (Geryones or Geryoneus):
A three-headed
(or three-bodied) monster who lived on Erytheia, an
island in the extreme west. One of the labors of Her-
acles was to steal Geryon’s herd of marvelous cattle
and drive them back to Greece. In mythology
Geryon was son of Chrysaor and Callirhoe.

Giants (Gigantes):
In mythology the sons of Gaia
(earth) conceived from the blood of Uranus that fell
to earth when he was castrated. They had great
strength and monstrous appearance and rebelled
against the Olympians. The Olympians called in
Heracles to assist them, because they learned that
they could not win without the help of a mortal.
Glaucus (Glaukos):
The name of several mytho-
logical ﬁgures. Three are of particular importance:
1. A Boeotian ﬁsherman who pursued Scylla (the sea
monster) and became immortal by eating a magic
herb. He became a sea god and continued to woo
Scylla in vain.
2. The father of Bellerophon, who kept horses at
Potniae in Boeotia and fed them on human ﬂesh.
For some reason (several explanations exist), the
horses went mad and killed and ate Glaucus.
3. The second-in-command of the Lycians, who
were allies of the Trojans at the siege of Troy. In
Homer’s Iliad, Glaucus tells the story of his
grandfather Bellerophon. Because the grandfa-
ther of Diomedes was bound by ties of hospitality
to Bellerophon, Diomedes and Glaucus (despite
being on opposite sides at the siege of Troy)
exchanged sets of armor as a sign of friendship.
Glaucus received the worst of the bargain—
bronze armor for gold.
Gorgon or Medusa (Gorgo, Medousa):
Medusa
was the name of a particular gorgon, but was also
used as a general term meaning “gorgon.” She was a
female monster that had snakes instead of hair and
eyes that could turn people to stone. In some legends
there was one Gorgon, and in others three Gorgons
(Gorgones): Medusa, Sthenno and Euryale who were
sisters. The Gorgon lived in the far west with Posei-
don. Perseus went in search of the Gorgon and killed
her with the aid of Athena. He cut off her head and it
was used to adorn the aegis of Athena (or in some
versions, the aegis of Zeus). The image of the Gor-
gon’s head was a popular charm for averting evil.
The Graiae were also sisters of the Gorgons. See also
PEGASUS, PERSEUS.
Graces (Kharites):
Goddesses personifying charm,
grace and beauty. They had various names such as
Kale (beautiful), Thaleia (flowering), Auxo (the
grower), Aglaia (radiant) and Euphrosyne (joy). Orig-
inally of indeterminate number, later there were
thought to be three Graces. They were worshipped in
various parts of the Greek world, particularly
Orchomenus, Paphos, Athens and Sparta. In mythol-
ogy they were daughters of Zeus, although their
mothers vary from legend to legend. They were asso-
ciated with many deities and played minor parts in
numerous myths.
Graiae or Graeae (Graiai):
In mythology three
daughters of Phorcys and Ceto, and sisters of the
Gorgons. The names of the Graiae were Pem-
phredo, Enyo and Deino, and they personiﬁed old
age. They had gray hair from birth, with one tooth
and one eye between them. Perseus stole their eye to
make them inform him where the Gorgon lived.
Gyes or Gyges (Gyes):
In mythology one of the
Hecatoncheires.
Hades (Haides):
A god also known as Plouton or
Pluton (meaning “rich,” since all metals are found
underground). He was brother of Zeus and god of
the underworld, ruling over the dead with his wife
Persephone. Hades was regarded as a severe pun-
isher of evil, although not himself evil (not like the
Christian devil). The underworld was thought of as
being underground. The underworld was the realm
of Hades, but was not called Hades (the term is
often incorrectly used today). See also chapter 10,
AFTERLIFE.
Harpies or Harpiae (Harpyiai, snatchers):
Origi-
nally wind spirits, they appeared in Homer carrying
people off to their deaths. In later mythology they
were winged monsters who snatched away food or
people and were generally blamed if something
could not be found. They were represented as birds
with the faces of women and were regarded as
daughters of Thaumas and Electra. Their names
were Aello (storm-wind), Ocypete (swift-flying),
Celaeno (dark) and Podarge (swift-footed).
Harpocrates (Horus the child):
The name gener-
ally used by the Greeks for the Egyptian god Horus.
He was the son of Isis and Osiris. Horus was identi-
H A N D B O O K

ﬁed with Apollo by Herodotus, but others identiﬁed
him with Heracles and Eros. His cult was closely
connected with the worship of Isis, and he became
particularly popular during the Hellenistic period. In
Egyptian myth he was a heroic ﬁgure who avenged
his father Osiris, who had been killed and dismem-
bered by the evil god Seth and then restored to life
by Isis.
Hebe (Hebe):
A goddess who was the personiﬁca-
tion of youth. Her cult was not important, although
she was sometimes worshipped in association with
other deities, such as Heracles and Aphrodite. In
mythology she was a daughter of Zeus and Hera and
cupbearer (serving nectar) to the gods. In some leg-
ends she was the wife of Heracles after he became a
god.
Hecate (Hekate):
An ancient goddess of the under-
world, later often identiﬁed with Artemis and some-
times confused with Selene. Hecate was generally
regarded as an attendant of Persephone, and associ-
ated with ghosts, demons, sorcery and black magic. At
night she sent demons and ghosts into the world and
wandered with the souls of the dead. She was wor-
shipped at crossroads and road junctions, where she
was represented as a statue with three heads or three
bodies. Dishes of food were left for her as a puriﬁca-
tory ritual at the end of each month. The animal usu-
ally sacriﬁced to her was a dog. Hecate had several
epithets and was occasionally regarded as a goddess of
women and nurturer of children, performing similar
functions to Artemis. She was thought by some to pro-
vide her adherents with a variety of blessings, such as
success in law courts, athletics and war. In mythology
she was a daughter of the Titans Perses and Asterie,
although other legends give different genealogies.
Hecatoncheires (Hekatoukheires):
Three mon-
sters each with 100 hands and 50 heads, the offspring
of Uranus and Gaia. They were called Briareus, Cot-
tus and Gyes. See also BRIAREUS.
Hector (Hektor):
A hero who had a cult in several
places, including Thebes, where his bones were sup-
posed to have been buried by the Thebans after
removing them from Troy in response to an oracle.
In mythology Hector was the eldest son of King
Priam and Hecuba, and bravest of the Trojan heroes
during the siege of Troy. He was husband of Andro-
mache and father of Astyanax. He led the Trojans in
battle and fought Ajax. In revenge for killing Patro-
clus, Hector was killed by Achilles and his body
dragged around the walls of Troy and back to the
Greek ships. Priam begged for the return of his body,
and the funeral of Hector is the closing episode of
Homer’s Iliad.
Hecuba (Hekabe):
The chief wife of King Priam
of Troy and mother of 19 of his children, including
Hector, Paris, Cassandra and Polyxena. Hecuba has
only a background role in Homer’s Iliad, as the queen
who survives the fall of Troy but loses her husband
and most of her children. She was developed as a
character in later Greek tragedies.
Helen (Helene):
A goddess associated with birds
and trees, and probably originally a goddess of vege-
tation and fertility. She was regarded as daughter of
Zeus and Leda. She was worshipped as an important
deity at Sparta, with her twin brothers the Dioscuri,
and she was worshipped elsewhere in Greece. She is
better known as Helen of Troy, wife of Menelaus,
whose abduction by Paris triggered the Trojan War.
It seems likely that Helen was originally a goddess,
but her cult dwindled, and in many legends she came
to be regarded as a mortal. In mythology, she has a
key role in Homer’s Iliad, and in the Odyssey she is
reconciled with her husband Menelaus. Other leg-
ends recount her great beauty, her abduction by
Theseus and her subsequent rescue by her brothers.
See also THESEUS.
Helenus (Helenos):
In mythology a warrior and
prophet, the son of King Priam of Troy. In Homer’s
Iliad, he was wounded by Menelaus. He was captured
by Odysseus and prophesied the fall of Troy if
Philoctetes was brought to Troy with his bow. After
Troy fell he was given as a captive to Neoptolemus,
along with Andromache who eventually became the
wife of Helenus.
Helios (Helios):
The sun god, who was particularly
worshipped in Rhodes where a festival (Halieia) was
held in his honor. Evidence of his worship elsewhere
in Greece is sparse. He was sometimes identified

with Apollo and was often invoked as a witness in
oaths because he was in the sky all day, where he saw
and heard everything. In mythology Helios was son
of the Titans Hyperion and Thea, brother of Selene
and Eos and father of Aeëtes, Circe, Pasiphae and
Phaethon. Homer occasionally called him Hyperion,
a practice adopted by other poets. Helios was gener-
ally regarded as a charioteer driving across the sky
from east to west each day and ﬂoating back on the
ocean from west to east at night in a golden cup. The
Colossus of Rhodes (one of the Seven Wonders of
the World) was a gigantic statue of Helios.
Hephaestus (Hephaistos):
God of ﬁre, particularly
the smithy ﬁre, and also of smiths and of crafts, espe-
cially those using ﬁre. He was associated with volca-
noes and may originally have been a volcanic deity
from Asia Minor. In mythology he was the son of
Zeus and Hera, and one of the Olympians. However,
because he was born lame, he was cast out of Olym-
pus and became a smith on Lemnos. He was a superb
craftsman and subsequently made various items for
the gods. He was generally regarded as the husband
of Aphrodite, but in some legends he has other wives
instead. His cult was mainly conﬁned to industrial-
ized areas of Greece (ﬁg. 8.11) and was particularly
prominent in Athens. The festival Chalceia was cel-
ebrated on the 30th day of the month Pyanopsion in
honor of Hephaestus and Athena (in her role of mis-
tress of technology).
Hera (Hera):
Wife of Zeus and queen of the
Greek gods (ﬁg. 8.12), whose symbol was the pea-
cock. Hera was a goddess of marriage and of the life
(particularly sexual) of married women, rather than
of motherhood. She was never invoked or portrayed

as a mother, although she was sometimes connected
with the birth and nurture of children. Occasionally
Hera was worshipped as patron deity of particular
cities and identiﬁed with the goddess Eileithyia (her
daughter). In mythology she was one of the
Olympians. She was the daughter of Cronus and
Rhea, making her the sister and also wife of Zeus, by
whom she had the children Hephaestus, Ares, Hebe
and Eileithyia. She often had the title Argeia (of
Argos), and Argos may have been her earliest place of
worship, although she was worshipped over much of
Greece and beyond, both in partnership with Zeus
and on her own (ﬁg. 8.13).
Sacriﬁces to Hera by the Attic deme Erchia were
undertaken on the 27th day of the month Gamelion,
and to Hera Thelchinia by the same deme on the
20th day of the month Metageitnion. At Athens a
festival (Theogamia or the Gamelia) in the month
Gamelion celebrated the sacred marriage between
Hera and Zeus. At Argos the Heraea was a festival
held every fourth year in honor of Hera, and on
Mount Cithaeron the festival of Daidala was cele-
brated every 59 years.
Heracles (Herakles):
The most popular and most
widely worshipped of Greek heroes, who was occa-
sionally worshipped as a god. Heracles was at times
identiﬁed with non-Greek gods. He was famous for
courage, strength, endurance, compassion and good
nature, but also for gluttony and lust. He had many
epithets and was commonly invoked under the epi-
thet Alexikakos (averter of evil). His other epithets
include Misogunus (womanhater) and Soter (savior).

8.12 Silver drachm of the head of the goddess Hera
8.13 Early or mid-5th-century BC Doric temple at Paestum, the best preserved in the Greek world. It was dedicated to
Hera (but traditionally called the Temple of Neptune). It measures 79.5 × 196.75 ft (24.26 × 59.98 m).

In Athens the fourth day of every month was cele-
brated as the birthday of Heracles. He was often
invoked by men in oaths.
Heracles was the son of Zeus and Alcmene, a
descendant of Perseus and of Danaus, and husband of
Megara (daughter of Creon) and later of Deianira.
There were many legends concerning him, but the
most important were those concerning the “Twelve
Labors of Heracles.” These were tasks imposed upon
Heracles by King Eurystheus of Argos to expiate Her-
acles’ guilt after he had killed his own wife and children
in a ﬁt of madness caused by Hera. The 12 labors were:
Nemean Lion: This monster was sent by Hera to
plague Nemea. It was the offspring of Echidna
and of Typhon or Orthrus. The lion’s skin was
invulnerable, so Heracles choked the lion to
death (fig. 4.2) and skinned it using the beast’s
claws (the only thing that would pierce its hide).
Heracles wore the lion’s skin as clothing, and it
was one of the symbols used in representations of
Heracles (ﬁg. 8.14).
Lernaean Hydra: This was another monstrous off-
spring of Echidna and Typhon—a poisonous
snake with many heads. When one head was cut
off, another grew in its place. It lived in the
marshes of Lerna near Argos. Hera sent a mon-
strous crab to help it against Heracles, who sum-
moned his comrade Iolaus for assistance. They
fought the Hydra together, and as Heracles cut
off its heads, Iolaus seared the stumps with burn-
ing brands until the Hydra was dead. Heracles
killed the crab by crushing it underfoot, and it
became the constellation Cancer. He dipped his
arrows in the Hydra’s poison blood, so any wound
made by the arrows was incurable.
Erymanthian Boar: Heracles had to catch this boar
alive. It lived on Mount Erymanthus in Arcadia.
He caught it by driving it into a snowﬁeld and
then throwing a net over it. While searching for
the boar Heracles was entertained by the centaur
Pholus, who gave Heracles wine in his cave.
Other centaurs were attracted by the smell of
wine. When drunk, they attacked Heracles.
Defending himself Heracles killed many of the
centaurs with his poison arrows.
Cerynitian Hind: This hind was one of five that
Artemis had seen grazing on Mount Lycaeus.
They were bigger than bulls and had gilded
horns. She captured four, but the ﬁfth took refuge
on Mount Ceryneia. Because the animal was
sacred to Artemis, it was an act of impiety to kill
it. After a chase lasting a year, which took Hera-
cles to the land of the Hyperboreans, he eventu-
ally managed to capture it alive.
Stymphalian Birds: These infested the woods around
Lake Stymphalus in Arcadia, eating the fruit and
the crops. In some versions they even killed and
ate people and animals using their bronze-tipped
feathers as arrows. Heracles killed some of them
with his arrows and drove the rest away with a
special rattle made by Hephaestus.
Augean Stables: Heracles was required, in a single day,
to clean out the stables of King Augeas of Elis,
who kept enormous herds of cattle. The stables
had never been previously cleaned. Heracles per-
formed this task by diverting the Alpheus River to
ﬂow through the stable yard.
Cretan Bull: Different legends record that this was
the bull with which Pasiphae fell in love, or the

Museums Service)

one that carried Europa to Crete (contradicting
the legend of Europa being carried to Crete by
Zeus disguised as a bull). Heracles’ task was to
bring the bull to Eurystheus alive, after which it
was released and wandered throughout Greece,
ﬁnally settling near Marathon.
Horses of Diomedes: King Diomedes of Thrace owned
four mares that fed on human ﬂesh, and the task
was to bring them to king Eurystheus alive. In
one version Heracles was attacked by local inhab-
itants as he led the mares away. Heracles
entrusted them to Abderus (son of Hermes), but
he was killed by the local inhabitants. Heracles
therefore killed King Diomedes and the local
inhabitants and founded a city called Abdera in
memory of Abderus. When he returned to Eurys-
theus the mares were released and were devoured
by wild beasts on Mount Olympus. In another
version Heracles killed Diomedes and fed him to
the mares, whereupon they became tame.
Girdle of Queen Hippolyta: The girdle given by her
father Ares was worn by Queen Hippolyta of the
Amazons. Eurystheus’ daughter Admete per-
suaded her father to give Heracles the task of cap-
turing the girdle, which she wanted. Hippolyta
was willing to give the girdle, but Hera (disguised
as an Amazon) provoked a battle between the fol-
lowers of Heracles and the Amazons, during
which Heracles killed Hippolyta and captured the
girdle. In another version Heracles captured Hip-
polyta’s second-in-command, Melanippe, and
Hippolyta exchanged the girdle for her release.
Cattle of Geryon: These lived on the mythical island of
Erytheia in the extreme west. By threatening to
shoot Helios with his arrows, Heracles obtained a
loan of Helios’ golden cup. This allowed Heracles
to cross the ocean and reach Erytheia, where he
killed the dog Orthrus and the herdsman Eury-
tion with single blows of his club. Heracles then
killed the three-headed monster Geryon with his
arrows and returned to King Eurystheus with the
cattle. On the journey back he set up two pillars
of rock on either side of the Straits of Gibraltar
(rock of Gibraltar and rock of Ceuta), which
became known as the Pillars of Heracles, to com-
memorate his journey.
Golden Apples of the Hesperides: Eurystheus ordered
Heracles to bring him the apples given by Gaia to
Hera as a wedding present. They were kept in a
garden in the extreme west, guarded by a dragon
called Ladon and three Nymphs of the evening
called the Hesperides. Heracles ﬁrst had to dis-
cover where the apples were kept. Some river
Nymphs said that only Nereus could identify the
place. Heracles fought with Nereus, who con-
stantly changed his shape, but he managed to tie
him up and force him to reveal the location of the
garden of the Hesperides. On his way there Hera-
cles fought a giant in Libya, narrowly escaped
being sacriﬁced in Egypt and killed Emathion, son
of Tithonus in Arabia. Heracles journeyed to the
foot of the Caucasus Mountains using Helios’ cup.
While climbing the Caucasus he freed Prometheus
who told him that only Atlas could collect the
apples. Reaching the country of the Hyperbore-
ans, Heracles found Atlas holding up the sky. Atlas
agreed that Heracles should take his place while
he fetched the apples. When Atlas returned with
the apples he offered to take them to Eurystheus if
Heracles continued to support the sky. Heracles
pretended to agree, but asked Atlas to take the
weight for a moment while he put a cushion on his
shoulders. Heracles then took the apples and ﬂed.
In an alternative legend Heracles took the apples
himself, without the help of Atlas.
Cerberus: The ﬁnal labor was to bring back the dog
Cerberus that guarded the entrance to the under-
world. Heracles was initiated into the Eleusinian
Mysteries and, helped by Hermes and Athena, he
descended into the underworld by a path in Laco-
nia. There he found Theseus and Pirithous, still
alive but in chains. He freed Theseus but could not
free Pirithous. Heracles met the spirit of Meleager
who asked him to marry Deianira, left without
support after Meleager’s death. Heracles eventually
encountered Hades, who let him take Cerberus if
he could overcome the dog without weapons.
Accomplishing this, he returned to Eurystheus
who was so frightened by Cerberus that Heracles
had to return the dog to the underworld.
Although in legend Heracles was killed by poison,
he was generally regarded as immortal. In later times
the legend of him successfully returning from the
underworld may have reinforced the popularity of
his cult. In art he was normally represented as

bearded, with a bow and arrows, club and lion skin.
See also DEIANIRA, GIANTS, LAOMEDON.
Hermaphroditus or Aphroditus (Hermaphroditos):
A bisexual deity worshipped in Attica and Cyprus.
He was possibly a deity invented to explain certain
marriage rites in which the different sexes exchanged
clothing. Hermaphroditus was portrayed either as a
beautiful young man with developed breasts or as
Aphrodite with male genitals. In mythology Her-
maphroditus was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.
He was loved by the Nymph Salmacis, who embraced
him and prayed to the gods to make them one body.
This the gods did, resulting in the bisexual Her-
maphroditus.
Hermes (Hermes, Hermeias):
Originally a phallic
god represented by a stone set up by the roadside,
Hermes came to be a god of fertility and good for-
tune, as well as of roads and boundaries. He was
regarded as the herald of the gods, and as such con-
ducted the souls of the dead to the underworld. Her-
mes was also a god of merchants, trade and thieves,
as well as of oratory, literature and athletics. In art he
was represented with wings on his sandals, a winged
cap or broad-brimmed hat, and the staff of a herald
(kerykeion; Latin, caduceus) on which two serpents
were entwined in an approximate figure-of-eight
shape. The god was also represented by herms (her-
mae), which were stone or bronze pillars, square or
rectangular in section; on top was the bust of Her-
mes with a beard, and lower down were carved male
genitals (fig. 8.15). Herms were set up in various
parts of Greece, especially Athens, as boundary
markers to avert evil. Later, heads of gods other than
Hermes were carved on the tops of herms.
In Athens the fourth day of every month was cel-
ebrated as the birthday of Hermes, and sacriﬁces to
him by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the 27th
day of the month Boedromion, and on the fourth day
of the month Thargelion. In mythology Hermes was
the son of Zeus and Maia, and one of the Olympians.
As a newborn baby he invented the Iyre and stole
Apollo’s cattle. Hermes placated Apollo by present-
ing him with the lyre. Hermes became messenger of
Zeus, and Zeus gave him his hat, winged sandals and
herald’s staff. Hermes generally appears in legends as
a guide conveying people to the underworld or as a
8.15 Hermes, depicted on a typical herm, with a
rectangular pillar, a bust of the god and male genitals

messenger giving mortals instructions from Zeus.
Hermaphroditus, Abderus and Pan are cited as his
offspring.
Heroes, Heroines: Dead men and women (real or
imaginary) who were worshipped as superhuman.
Their cults were usually centered on their actual (or
supposed) burial place, although sometimes a cult
proliferated because more than one place claimed to
possess a particular tomb. Exceptions included
heroes such as Heracles, whose worship was wide-
spread, often more like a god than a hero. Methods
of worship and sacriﬁce to heroes and heroines were
similar to that for gods of the underworld, so that
dark-colored animals were usually chosen for sacri-
ﬁce, and libations and sacriﬁces were performed in a
pit or on a low altar. Sometimes gods and goddesses
whose cults had dwindled came to be regarded as
heroes and heroines instead. Not all heroes and
heroines appear in myths, and any myths are often
irrelevant to their cults. Sacriﬁces to “the heroines”
by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the 19th day
of the month Metageitnion, and on the 14th day of
the month Pyanopsion.
Hesperides (Hesperides):
In mythology the Nymphs
of the evening and daughters of Nyx and Erebus,
although some legends say Atlas was their father.
The Hesperides lived in the extreme west guarding a
tree of golden apples for Hera, subsequently stolen
by Heracles. The number of Hesperides varied from
three to seven (between different legends), and their
names include Aigle, Arethusa, Erytheia, Hespere
and Hesperethusa. See also HERACLES.
Hesperus (Hesperos):
In mythology the evening star.
Hestia (Hestia):
Virgin goddess of the hearth and
the household fire. The hearth was the symbol of
home and family, and the prytaneion in many cities
had a public hearth dedicated to Hestia, with a ﬁre
kept constantly burning. If a city founded a colony,
ﬁre was taken from the public hearth to the colony.
One of Hestia’s titles was Boulaia (of the council),
and many bouleuteria had public hearths. Sacriﬁces
began with libations to Hestia, and she was generally
mentioned ﬁrst in prayers and oaths. Meals began
with small offerings thrown into the domestic ﬁre.
Pigs and occasionally cows were sacriﬁced to Hestia.
At ﬁve days old children were formally accepted into
the family; as part of the ceremony someone carrying
the child ran around the hearth. Temples dedicated
to Hestia were characteristically circular in form. In
mythology Hestia was a virgin daughter of Cronus
and Rhea.
Hippolytus (Hippolytos):
A hero whose cult was
associated with Aphrodite. They had a shrine on the
Acropolis at Athens. At Troezen (where he died), a
ritual was carried out in his honor, including laments
for him and offerings of hair from girls about to
marry. In mythology he was the son of Theseus and
the Amazon queen Hippolyta. After Hippolyta’s
death Theseus married Phaedra, but she fell in love
with Hippolytus who rejected her advances. Phaedra
told Theseus in a letter that she had been seduced by
Hippolytus and then hanged herself. Believing the
accusation, Theseus used one of three curses given
him by Poseidon. As Hippolytus was driving his
chariot, a monster from the sea terriﬁed the horses,
and Hippolytus was killed. Theseus later learned of
his error from Artemis.
Horae (Horai):
Goddesses of the seasons, wor-
shipped in Athens, Argos and Olympia. They were
associated with many deities, such as Demeter, Pan,
Apollo and Dionysus, but always as subordinate
companions. In mythology they were the daughters
of Zeus and Themis. Their numbers (generally three
or four) and their names varied from region to
region. In Attica their names appear to have been
Karpo, Thallo and Auxo.
Horus: An Egyptian god, usually known to the
Greeks as Harpocrates (Horus the child). See also
HARPOCRATES.
Hyacinthus (Hyakinthos):
An ancient god wor-
shipped at Amyclae near Sparta. In mythology he
was represented as a beautiful youth of Amyclae,
loved by both Apollo and Zephyrus. Apollo acci-
dentally killed Hyacinthus with a discus that he had
thrown; in some versions, Zephyrus blew the dis-
cus aside to strike Hyacinthus because he was jeal-
ous that Hyacinthus preferred Apollo. Where
Hyacinthus’ blood fell on the earth, a ﬂower sprang

up that was named after him. A festival at Sparta
(Hyacinthia) was held in his honor.
Hygieia (Hygieia, health):
Daughter of Asclepius.
A goddess worshipped as part of the cult of Asclepius.
Hyperboreans (Hyperboreioi):
A race of worship-
pers of Apollo living in a distant and inaccessible land
to the north. Their name has been interpreted as
“dwellers beyond the north wind” or “dwellers
beyond the mountains.” They were thought to live
in perpetual sunshine, and Apollo spent the three
winter months with them. Some offerings at the
shrine of Apollo at Delos were allegedly sent by
them. According to some legends those especially
favored by the gods might spend their afterlife with
the Hyperboreans.
Hyperion (Hyperion):
In mythology one of the
male Titans.
Hypnos (Hypnos):
God of sleep, worshipped in
Troezen. In mythology he was the son of Nyx,
brother of Thanatos and father of the three gods of
dreams: Morpheus, Icelos (or Phobetor) and Phanta-
sus. Hypnos was usually thought of as a winged
youth who poured sleep-inducing liquid from a horn
or touched the foreheads of the tired with a branch.
He appears in few legends, but apparently fell in love
with Endymion and made him sleep with open eyes.
Iapetus (Iapetos):
In mythology one of the male
Titans. He was husband of Clymene (daughter of
Oceanus) and father of Prometheus, Epimetheus and
Atlas.
Icarus (Ikaros):
Son of Daedalus the craftsman
who lived in the age of King Minos. Having con-
structed the labyrinth for Minos, Daedalus was for-
bidden to leave Crete, so he constructed wings from
wax and feathers for himself and Icarus. They
escaped from Crete, but Icarus disobeyed Daedalus
and ﬂew too near the sun. The wax melted, the wings
disintegrated and Icarus fell to his death. Daedalus
buried him on an island that became known as Icaria,
and the surrounding sea was named the Icarian Sea.
Idomeneus (Idomeneus):
In mythology the leader of
the Cretans who were allies of the Greeks in the siege
of Troy. He was grandson of Minos and distinguished
himself ﬁghting at Troy, despite being older than most
of the other warriors. A later legend (but possibly
reﬂecting an earlier Cretan legend) recounted how
Idomeneus made a vow to Poseidon to sacriﬁce the
ﬁrst living thing he encountered on reaching home in
Crete, if he was saved from a shipwreck. He ﬁrst
encountered his son, and fulﬁlled or tried to fulﬁl his
vow. Consequently a plague broke out and Idomeneus
was forced into exile by the Cretans.
Icelos or Phobetor (Ikelos):
One of three gods of
dreams who were sons of Hypnos (god of sleep). Ice-
los was responsible for sending dreams of animals.
See also MORPHEUS, PHANTASUS.
Ino (Ino):
In mythology the daughter of Cadmus
and wife of Athamas. She incurred the wrath of
Hera, who drove Ino mad so that she threw herself
into the sea, but then Ino was changed into a sea
goddess. She was identiﬁed with the goddess Leu-
cothea.
Io (Io):
A mythological Greek figure, sometimes
identiﬁed with the Egyptian goddess Isis. In mythol-
ogy Io was daughter of Inachus (legendary ﬁrst king
of Argos). She was a priestess of Hera and was loved
by Zeus. To hide her from Hera’s anger, Zeus turned
Io into a heifer, but Hera was not deceived. She made
a gadﬂy torment Io continually, so that she was not
still long enough for Zeus to make love to her.
Goaded by the gadﬂy, Io eventually wandered into
Egypt, where Zeus restored her to human form. She
bore him a son called Epaphus, the ancestor of
Danaus and Aegyptus. According to one legend Io
was worshipped as Isis in Egypt, and Epaphus was
identiﬁed with the Egyptian god Apis.
Ion (Ion):
The eponymous ancestor of the Ionian
Greeks. He was the son of Creusa, but legends give
his father as Apollo or Xuthus (son of Hellen). Ion
appears in various legends, mostly concerned with
the origin of the Ionians. These legends seem to be
products of the ethnological theories of early narra-
tors, rather than remnants of a folk tradition. In
most Ion survives various adventures and settles in
Athens. He divides the people into the four tradi-
tional Ionian tribes: Hopletes, Geleontes, Argadeis
and Aegicoreis.

Iphigenia (Iphigeneia):
In mythology the daughter
of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, and sacriﬁced by
Agamemnon. When contrary winds prevented the
Greek fleet from sailing to besiege Troy, the seer
Calchas revealed that Artemis required Iphigenia’s
sacriﬁce. She was therefore summoned, on the pre-
text that she was to marry Achilles. In some legends
Iphigenia was sacriﬁced, but in others Artemis sub-
stituted a deer as the sacriﬁce and carried her off to
the land of the Tauri (the Crimea); here, as priestess
of Artemis, Iphigenia’s duty was to prepare all
strangers for sacrifice. Her brother Orestes was
ordered by Apollo to bring to Attica the image of
Artemis belonging to the Tauri, but he and his com-
panion Pylades were captured by the Tauri and were
sent to be sacrificed. Iphigenia learned who they
were, and they all escaped to Attica with the image of
Artemis. The image was set up at Halae (or in some
versions, Brauron). Iphigenia was made priestess of
Artemis there, with the title Tauropolos.
Iris (Iris):
Goddess of the rainbow. She was appar-
ently a purely mythological ﬁgure, with no cult. She
was the daughter of Thaumas and Electra, and sister
of the Harpies. Iris was a messenger of the gods (par-
ticularly Hera), and in some legends she was mother
of Eros by Zephyrus.
Isis (Isis):
An Egyptian goddess, wife of Osiris and
mother of Horus, who had a temple at Athens by at
least 332 BC. By Hellenistic times she was an impor-
tant and extremely popular deity in the Greek world.
Isis was a mother goddess, and a goddess of fertility
and marriage, represented as loving and compassion-
ate to individual suppliants. She was identiﬁed with
Demeter by Herodotus, and was regarded as repre-
senting the female productive force of nature, but in
the Hellenistic period she was identified with
Aphrodite. Along with Osiris she was considered to
be a ruler of the underworld.
Worship of Isis was similar to a mystery religion,
including initiation ceremonies, processions, music
and dance designed to arouse religious fervor. Isis
was usually portrayed in a long garment with a char-
acteristic knot of drapery on her breast and an
ancient Egyptian headdress. Her symbol was a cow.
Isis was served by professional Egyptian priests. Her
worship was established in Piraeus by the 4th century
BC. The cult spread throughout the Greek world,
initially regarded as the cult of Sarapis, even though
it included Harpocrates, Isis, Sarapis and other
Egyptian gods. The emphasis changed by Roman
times, when it was generally known as the cult of Isis.
A shrine or temple dedicated to Isis was called an
Iseion. See also SARAPIS and ORIENTAL AND MYSTERY
RELIGIONS (p. 383).
Itys (Itys):
In mythology the son of King Tereus of
Thrace and Procne. He was killed and cooked by
Procne and served to Tereus. See also PHILOMELA.
Ixion (Ixion):
In mythology the king of the Lapiths
and the ﬁrst Greek to murder a kinsman. He married
Dia (daughter of Deioneus or Eioneus), and Pir-
ithous was their son. When Deioneus came to fetch
the bride-price for Dia, Ixion murdered him. Ixion
obtained ritual puriﬁcation from Zeus for this act,
but then attempted to seduce Hera, who complained
to Zeus. Zeus formed a cloud called Nephele in the
likeness of Hera, and the offspring of Ixion and
Nephele was Centaurus (father of the Centaurs). For
his crimes Zeus had Ixion ﬁxed to a ﬁery wheel that
constantly revolved in the underworld.
Jason (Iason):
In mythology the son of King Aeson
of Iolchus in Thessaly and leader of the Argonauts
(fig. 8.16). While Jason was still a child Aeson’s
brother Pelias usurped the throne of Iolchus. Jason
escaped and was reared by the centaur Chiron.
Returning as an adult to claim his inheritance, Jason
arrived in Iolchus with only one sandal, having lost
the other during the journey. Pelias had been warned
by an oracle that a stranger with only one sandal
would kill him, and so he sent Jason to fetch the
Golden Fleece. To accompany him, Jason assembled
a group of heroes, the Argonauts. Later legends
added other heroes to the Argonauts, because fami-
lies liked to claim descent from an Argonaut. Hera-
cles was said to have joined the Argonauts after
killing the Erymanthian boar, but then stayed at
Chios to look after Hylas.
In their quest for the Golden Fleece, Jason and
the Argonauts had many adventures, including a
long stay on Lemnos, where the women, led by
Queen Hypsipele, had murdered their husbands and
were eager to welcome the Argonauts. Sailing on,
they rescued Phoineus from the Harpies and, with
the aid of Orpheus’ music, stilled the Clashing Rocks

that guarded the entrance to the Bosphorus. At
Colchis King Aeëtes set Jason the task of sowing the
dragon’s teeth. With the help of the witch Medea
(daughter of Aeëtes), he yoked a pair of ﬁrebreathing
bulls to plow a furrow and accomplished the task. By
Medea’s sorcery he managed to take the Golden
Fleece from the dragon who guarded it and sailed
for home with Medea and the ﬂeece. The legends
then concentrate on Medea. After Medea had tricked
the daughters of Pelias into killing their father,
Medea and Jason were driven from Iolchus and ﬂed
to Corinth, where Jason was later killed as he slept
beneath his ship Argo and part of it fell on him. See
also CREON, MEDEA.
Jocasta, 
Iocaste 
or 
Epicaste (Epikaste):
In
mythology the wife of King Laius of Thebes and
mother of Oedipus. She later unknowingly became
the wife of Oedipus, and hanged herself when she
discovered the truth of her incestuous marriage. In
Homer’s Odyssey, she is called Epicaste, and Odysseus
sees her shade in the underworld. See also OEDIPUS.
Karpo (Karpo):
In Attica one of three goddesses of
the seasons (Horae).
Kourotrophos (Kourotrophos, Nurse):
A title given
to several deities, including Aphrodite, Artemis and
Hecate, but Kourotrophos was sometimes regarded
as a separate deity. Some uncertain references in lit-
erature and inscriptions have been interpreted as the
goddess Gaia, but others remain unclear. Sacriﬁces
to the deity Kourotrophos by the Attic deme Erchia
took place on the 12th day of the month Heka-
tombaion, 27th day of the month Gamelion and
third day of the month Skirophorion.
Lachesis (Lakhesis, apportioner):
One of the Fates
who drew off the length of thread.
Laestrygones (Laistrygones):
A race of cannibal
giants. They appear in Homer’s Odyssey, where they
sink all but one of Odysseus’ ﬂeet of 12 ships. The
land of the Laestrygones was said to have summer
nights so short that shepherds taking out their ﬂocks
in the morning met those returning at sunset. This
was probably the reminiscence of some traveler in
the far north, but some tried to locate their land in
Magna Graecia.
Laocoon (Laokoon):
In mythology a Trojan prince,
brother of Anchises and priest of Apollo (or priest of
Poseidon). He tried to prevent the Trojans opening
the city gates and bringing in the wooden horse, and
so two great sea serpents sent by Apollo (or in some
versions, Athena) killed him and his sons.
Laodamia (Laodameia):
A name shared by two
mythological women. One was a daughter of
Bellerophon, who had a son called Sarpedon by
Zeus. She was killed while still young, shot by
Artemis. The other was daughter of Acastus and wife
of Protesilaus (the ﬁrst Greek hero to be killed). She
begged the gods to be allowed just three more hours
with him alive. The request was granted, and at the
end she killed herself because she could not bear to
be parted from him.
Laomedon (Laomedon):
In mythology the king of
Troy and father of King Priam and Tithonus.
Laomedon was famous for his treachery. When he

failed to pay Apollo and Poseidon for helping to
build the walls of Troy, they sent a sea monster to eat
his daughter Hesione, but she was rescued by Hera-
cles. Laomedon then refused to give Heracles the
promised horses, and so Heracles sacked Troy and
killed all his sons except Priam.
Lapiths (Lapithai):
In mythology a primitive tribe
inhabiting the mountains of Thessaly (fig. 8.17).
They were related to the centaurs by common
descent from Ixion, who was king of the Lapiths and
father of Centaurus.
Leda (Leda):
The daughter of King Thestius of
Aetolia, wife of King Tyndareus of Sparta and
mother of Clytemnestra, Helen and the Dioscuri.
Leda was loved by Zeus who took the form of a swan
to mate with her (ﬁg. 8.18). Legends vary as to which
of her children were fathered by Zeus. See also
NEMESIS.

Leto (Leto):
A goddess generally worshipped in
connection with her children Apollo and Artemis,
although several temples were dedicated to Leto. In
mythology she was one of the Titans, a daughter of
Coeus and Phoebe. She was loved by Zeus and gave
birth to the twin gods Apollo and Artemis. A sacriﬁce
to Leto by the Attic deme Erchia was undertaken on
the fourth day of the month Thargelion.
Leucaspis (Leukaspis, the Deity of the White
Shield):
A sacrifice to Leucaspis by the Attic deme
Erchia took place on the 20th day of the month
Mounichion. Nothing else is known about this
deity.
Leucippus (Leukippos, literally “person who keeps
white horses”):
The name of many different char-
acters in Greek mythology, perhaps the most impor-
tant being King Leucippus of Messenia. His
daughters Hilaera and Phoebe were carried off by
the Dioscuri. Their brothers, Idas and Lynceus,
fought to rescue them and killed Castor, but Poly-
deuces was allowed to take Castor’s place in the
underworld on alternate days. See also DIOSCURI.

Leucothea (Leukothea, probably meaning “white
goddess,” or less likely “runner on white foam”):
A
goddess of the sea who was identified with Ino
(daughter of Cadmus and wife of Athamas).
Lotophagi (Lotophagoi, Lotus-eaters):
A fabulous
people who lived on the lotus fruit, which induced
forgetfulness. Anyone eating the lotus forgot about
returning to their own country and remained in the
land of the lotus-eaters. According to Herodotus
they lived in what is now western Libya.
Lycurgus (Lykourgos):
In 
mythology 
Lycurgus
attacked the young Dionysus, driving him and his
nurses forward until Dionysus took refuge in the sea.
Consequently Lycurgus was struck blind and died soon
after. In some versions Lycurgus is king of the Edones
in Thrace; for his crime he is driven mad, so that he
kills his own son and is later eaten alive by wild horses.
Maia (Maia):
In mythology the daughter of Atlas
and one of the Pleiades. She was also mother of
Hermes.
Marsyas (Marsyas):
A satyr or Silenus who was
associated with the Marsyas River, a tributary of the
Maeander in Turkey, and was possibly a local deity.
In mythology Marsyas was a ﬂute player who chal-
lenged Apollo to a music contest. Apollo won and
had Marsyas ﬂayed alive for the presumption of chal-
lenging a god (ﬁg. 8.19). The Maeander River sprang
from his blood, or alternatively from the tears of the
woodland gods and animals that mourned him.
Medea (Medeia):
In mythology the daughter of
Aeëtes (king of Colchis) and his wife Eidya, grand-
daughter of Helios, and niece of Circe. She was gen-
erally regarded as a witch, but some evidence
suggests she was possibly once worshipped as a deity.
Various legends recount how she helped Jason to win
the Golden Fleece. She returned with him to Iolchus,
and rejuvenated his father Aeson by boiling him with
magic herbs. She persuaded the daughters of Pelias
(Jason’s uncle) to try to rejuvenate their father in the
same way. However, in order to avenge the wrong
Pelias had done to Jason’s family, Medea ensured that
the process killed him. Medea and Jason were then

driven from Iolchus and ﬂed to Corinth where they
had two children. In the play Medea by Euripides,
she murders her children in a jealous rage when
hearing Jason is to leave her. Medea also appears in
other legends. See also CREON, THESEUS.
Meleager (Meleagros):
In mythology the son of
Oeneus (king of Calydon) and his wife Althaea (in
some versions, son of Ares and Althaea), brother of
Deianira and husband of Atalanta. In Homer’s lliad,
Meleager is presented as a hero of the past (dead
before the start of the Trojan War) who killed the
Calydonian boar, a monster sent to ravage Calydon
after Oeneus failed to sacriﬁce to Artemis. In another
legend the Fates decreed that he would not die as
long as a ﬁrebrand remained unburnt. His mother
kept the ﬁrebrand safe, but after Meleager killed her
brothers in a quarrel, she ﬂung it on a ﬁre and he
died. See also ATALANTA, DEIANIRA, HERACLES.
Melpomene (Melpomene, the songstress):
One of
the Muses, thought in late Roman times to preside
over tragedy.
Memnon (Memnon):
In mythology the son of
Tithonus and Eos, king of the Ethiopians, and
brother of King Emathion of Egypt. He fought with
the Trojans at the siege of Troy, killed Antilochus
and was later killed by Achilles. His body was carried
away by Eos, and Zeus made him immortal. Accord-
ing to a legend from Thebes in Egypt, he survived
the siege of Troy and ruled in Ethiopia for ﬁve gen-
erations. A colossal statue (one of two seated statues
outside the temple of Amenophis II at Luxor) was
thought to represent Memnon.
Menedeius (Menedeios, the one who stands his
ground):
A sacriﬁce to Menedeius was performed
by the Attic deme Erchia on the 19th day of the
month Thargelion. Nothing else is known about this
deity.
Menelaus (Menelaos, Meneleos):
A hero who was
occasionally regarded as a god. He was worshipped
at a shrine at Therapne, near Sparta. In mythology
he was a son of Atreus and younger brother of
Agamemnon. Menelaus was king of Sparta and the
husband of Helen whose abduction caused the Tro-
jan War. He has a prominent role in Homer’s Iliad,
where he agreed to settle the dispute by single com-
bat with Paris. He was prevented from killing Paris
by Aphrodite, and Athena then prompted Pandarus
to wound Menelaus to provoke a continuation of the
war. In Homer’s Odyssey the adventures of Menelaus
after the siege of Troy are described, with him even-
tually reaching his home, Sparta, safely with Helen.
Mentor (Mentor):
A friend of Odysseus who was
too old to take part in the siege of Troy and instead
stayed in Ithaca to look after Odysseus’ household.
Athena took the form of Mentor when she accompa-
nied Telemachus in the search for Odysseus, which
gave rise to the use of the term “mentor” for a
trusted guide or counselor.
Midas (Midas):
In mythology a king of Phrygia
(not to be confused with the historical King Midas of
Phrygia of the 8th–7th centuries BC). The mythical
Midas featured in various legends and reputedly had
wonderful rose gardens, where he entertained a
Silenus who had been left behind after a drunken
rout led by Dionysus. In gratitude Dionysus granted
him a wish, and Midas asked that everything he
touch turn to gold. On ﬁnding this also applied to
food and drink, he asked to be rid of the gift. He was
told to bathe in the Pactolus River, which thereafter
had sands containing gold. On another occasion
Midas had to judge a music contest between Apollo
and Pan (in some versions, Marsyas). He decided
against Apollo who therefore gave Midas the ears of
an ass to denote his stupidity. Midas hid these ears
under a headdress, and only his barber knew about
them, but he was sworn to secrecy. Unable to prevent
himself from telling the secret, the barber dug a hole,
whispered the secret into it and ﬁlled in the hole.
Reeds grew over the hole, and whispered the secret
as they moved in the wind.
Minos (Minos):
The son of Zeus and Europa, and
a king of Crete who became a judge of the dead in
the underworld. The legends about him vaguely
reflect the Cretan civilization that has (in modern
times) been labeled “Minoan.” His name, Minos,
may have been a title or a dynastic name. In Homer’s
Odyssey, Minos is represented as a just ruler, whereas
the Athenian legend of Theseus represents him as a
H A N D B O O K

villain. Minos was husband of Pasiphae and had
many children, including Phaedra and Ariadne. See
also DAEDALUS, NISUS, PASIPHAE, THESEUS.
Minotaur (Minotauros):
A monster on Crete, half-
man and half-bull, and the offspring of Pasiphae and
a bull. He lived in the labyrinth on Crete and was
killed by Theseus. See also DAEDALUS, PASIPHAE,
THESEUS.
Mnemosyne (Mnemosyne):
In mythology one of
the female Titans. She was mother, by Zeus, of the
Muses.
Morpheus (Morpheus):
One of three gods of
dreams who were sons of Hypnos (god of sleep).
Morpheus was responsible for sending dreams of
human forms. See also ICELOS, PHANTASUS.
Muses (Mousai):
Deities of poetry, literature,
music and dance, who later presided over philosophy,
astronomy and all intellectual pursuits. They were
worshipped throughout the Greek world. There
were generally considered to be nine Muses, but
their individual spheres of inﬂuence were not distin-
guished until the late Roman period, when each one
presided over one of the arts or sciences: Calliope
(heroic epic), Clio (history), Euterpe (ﬂutes, music),
Terpsichore (lyric poetry, dancing), Erato (hymns),
Melpomene (tragedy), Thalia (comedy), Polhymnia
(mime) and Urania (astronomy). These attributed
spheres of inﬂuence vary among ancient authors, and
some other names for Muses are known. In mythol-
ogy the Muses were daughters of Zeus and
Mnemosyne. They were born at the foot of Mount
Olympus, and Mount Helicon was sacred to them.
Narcissus (Narkissos):
In mythology the son of
Cephissus (a river in Boeotia) and the Nymph Liri-
ope. He was a beautiful youth who fell in love with
his own reﬂection in a pool. He rejected Echo, who
wasted away with grief until only her voice was left.
Narcissus also wasted away and was changed into a
ﬂower. Pausanias visited the pool on Mount Helicon
where these events allegedly took place. He related a
local version of the legend in which Narcissus was in
love with his twin sister, who died. He looked at his
own reﬂection to be reminded of her.
Nausicaa (Nausikaa):
In mythology the daughter
of Alcinous, king of Phaeacia. Nausicaa appeared in
Homer’s Odyssey, where she was told by Athena in a
dream to go to the mouth of the river with her hand-
maids to do the family washing. Afterward they
played ball, and Odysseus (who had been ship-
wrecked) found them. The handmaids ﬂed, but Nau-
sicaa gave Odysseus food, drink and clothing, and
showed him the way to her father’s city, from where
he continued his homeward journey.
Neleus (Neleus):
A legendary king of Pylos who
was worshipped as a hero in association with Codrus
and the obscure deity Basile. In mythology Neleus
was son of Poseidon and Tyro (daughter of
Salmoneus). Neleus married Chloris (daughter of
Amphion of Orchomenus), who bore him several
sons including Nestor. Because Neleus would not
purify Heracles after killing Iphitus, Heracles
attacked Pylos and killed all sons of Neleus except
Nestor.
Nemesis (Nemesis):
A goddess who personified
retribution or righteous indignation—usually retri-
bution by the gods for the presumption or insolence
(hubris) of mortals. Her main cult was centered
around her shrine at Rhamnus. A cult of Nemesis
Adrasteia (Unescapable Nemesis) in Boeotia identi-
ﬁed her with the Phrygian goddess Ida. In mythol-
ogy Nemesis assumed a variety of shapes, especially
ﬁsh, to avoid the attentions of Zeus. In one legend
she ﬁnally changed into a goose, whereupon Zeus
mated with her in the form of a swan (rather than
with Leda, as in other legends). She subsequently
laid the egg that was found by a shepherd and given
to Leda to hatch.
Neoptolemus 
or 
Pyrrhus (Neoptolemos):
In
mythology the son of Achilles and Deidamia. After
Achilles died in the siege of Troy, the Greeks sent for
Neoptolemus, as his presence was necessary for the
capture of the city. Neoptolemus was one of the
Greeks who entered Troy in the wooden horse. After
the war he returned home and married Hermione,
daughter of Menelaus. In later legends Neoptolemus
incurred the anger of the gods by killing Priam at the
altar of Zeus Herkeios. He was consequently pre-
vented from returning home and was killed.

Nereids (Nereides):
The sea Nymphs, daughters of
the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. There
were said to be 50 or 100 Nereids, the most famous
being Amphitrite (wife of Poseidon) and Thetis
(mother of Achilles).
Nereus (Nereus):
An ancient sea god. Only slight
evidence exists for his worship as a deity. In mythol-
ogy he was the son of Pontus and father of the
Nereids (by the Oceanid Doris). He lived in the
depths of the sea with the Nereids. He was thought
to have great wisdom and the power of prophecy,
and could transform himself into various shapes. In a
contest with Heracles he transformed himself into
many shapes, including ﬁre and water.
Nessus (Nessos):
A centaur who assaulted Deianira
and was killed by Heracles. His bloodsoaked shirt later
caused the death of Heracles. See also DEIANIRA.
Nestor (Nestor):
In mythology the son of King
Neleus of Pylos and Chloris. Nestor lived to a great
age. In Homer’s Iliad he is represented as an elder
statesman, full of often ineffectual advice and having
outlived two generations. In Homer’s Odyssey he had
returned safely to Pylos from Troy and entertained
Odysseus’ son Telemachus. Nestor was father of
Antilochus.
Nike (Nike):
Goddess and personiﬁcation of vic-
tory, both in war and in athletic contests. In mythol-
ogy she was daughter of the Titan Pallas and of Styx.
She is frequently portrayed in vase paintings with
wings and holding a victory wreath (ﬁg. 9.7). The
sculptor Archermus (6th century BC) is said to have
been the first to represent her with wings, which
became a common image.
Niobe (Niobe):
In mythology the daughter of Tan-
talus and wife of Amphion. She had six or seven chil-
dren and boasted of her superiority to the goddess
Leto who had only two. Leto’s children (Apollo and
Artemis) then killed all Niobe’s children with their
arrows. Niobe wept for them until she turned into a
pillar of stone, which was identiﬁed by local inhabi-
tants as a column of stone on Mount Sipylus in
Lydia. It was still visited by travelers in the Roman
period.
Nisus (Nisos):
In mythology the son of Pandion
and king of Megara. The safety of the city of Megara
depended on a lock of the red hair of Nisus. Megara
was besieged by King Minos, but was safe as long as
the lock of red hair remained unharmed among
Nisus’ white hair. For the love of Minos his daughter
Scylla cut it off, which killed Nisus. Megara fell to
King Minos, who was horriﬁed at Scylla’s deed and
drowned her (in some versions she drowned herself).
She was turned into a seabird and was forever pur-
sued by her father Nisus, who had been changed into
a sea eagle.
Nymphs (Nymphai):
Female spirits of nature, often
considered personiﬁcations of natural features, such
as trees, springs, rivers, lakes and even regions and
cities—but they were mainly associated with water.
Nymph (Nymphe) meant “young unmarried woman,”
so Nymphs were usually regarded as young and beau-
tiful, with a taste for dancing and music. Many were
regarded as the daughters of Zeus, Gaia or various
river gods, especially Achelous. They had the power
of inspiring mortals with prophetic powers and
poetry, and were mostly benevolent to mortals. As
spirits of natural features there were numerous types
and classiﬁcations of Nymphs, such as Hamadryades
(tree Nymphs), Orestiads (mountain Nymphs), Alsei-
des, Napaeae and Dryades (categories of Nymphs of
forests and groves), Leimoniads (meadow Nymphs)
and various water Nymphs such as Hydriads, Naiads,
Potameids and Creneids. The cult of the Nymphs
was widespread throughout Greece, and they were
often worshipped in caves. Sacriﬁces to the Nymphs
by the Attic deme Erchia took place on the 27th day
of the month Boedromion, and on the eighth day of
the month Gamelion.
Nyx (Nyx):
A goddess who personiﬁed night. She
was regarded more as a mythological ﬁgure than a
cult deity, but a dedication to her is known from the
temple of Demeter at Pergamum.
Oceanus (Okeanos):
A personification of the
ocean, represented in Homer as a river that encircled
the earth and from which all other rivers originated.
In mythology he was a Titan, the son of Uranus and
Gaia. He was married to Tethys. His sons were the
river gods and his daughters the Oceanids.

Ocypete (Okypete, swift ﬂying):
One of the Harpies
who were daughters of Thaumas and Electra.
Odysseus (Odysseus):
A hero and legendary king of
Ithaca. He was occasionally worshipped in parts of
Greece, although apparently not in Ithaca. In
mythology he was the son and successor of King
Laertes of Ithaca, husband of Penelope and father of
Telemachus. He played a prominent role in Homer’s
Iliad, where he fought on the side of the Greeks, took
part in the embassy to Achilles (which attempted to
reconcile Achilles with Agamemnon) and carried out
the night raid on the Trojan camp with Diomedes.
Homer’s Odyssey is devoted to the adventures of
Odysseus returning home to Ithaca after the Trojan
War. On his eventual return Odysseus killed the suit-
ors of Penelope, who had thought him dead, and
founded a shrine to appease the god Poseidon, his
last enemy. Odysseus was unwittingly killed by
Telegonus, his son by Circe, who had traveled to
Ithaca to ﬁnd his father. Apart from his roles in the
Homeric poems, Odysseus appears as a character in
works by several Greek playwrights. See also
CALYPSO, CHARYBDIS, CIRCE, CYCLOPES, DIO-
MEDES, ELPENOR, EUMAEUS, HELENUS, JOCASTA,
LAESTRYGONES, NAUSICAA, POLYPHEMUS.
Oedipus (Oidipous, swollen-footed):
A hero who
had various cults. In mythology he was the son of
King Laius of Thebes. Having taken refuge with
Pelops, Laius carried off Pelops’ son Chrysippus. As
punishment Apollo warned Laius that if he had a
son, he would be killed by that son. Laius ignored the
warning, and the unwanted newborn baby Oedipus
was left to die with a spike through his feet. The baby
was taken by a shepherd to King Polybus of Corinth
and his queen Merope, who were childless. They
reared Oedipus as their own son (his name derived
from his deformed feet). As an adult Oedipus ques-
tioned the Delphic Oracle about his true parents, but
was told only that he would kill his father and marry
his mother. Deciding never to return to Corinth, he
went toward Thebes. Meeting, but not recognizing,
his father Laius, they quarreled and Oedipus killed
him. At Thebes he destroyed the Sphinx that had
been terrorizing the city and won the throne of
Thebes and Jocasta in marriage, not knowing that
she was his mother. They had two sons, Eteocles and
Polynices, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismene.
When it was discovered what had happened, Jocasta
hanged herself and Oedipus blinded himself (or was
blinded). No longer able to be king, he went into
exile.
Orestes (Orestes):
In mythology the son of
Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, and brother of Iphi-
genia and Electra. When Agamemnon returned
from the siege of Troy with Cassandra as his concu-
bine, Aegisthus killed them both. When Orestes
reached manhood, he killed Clytemnestra and her
lover Aegisthus in revenge for Agamemnon’s death.
See also ELECTRA, IPHIGENIA.
Orpheus (Orpheus):
A mythical poet and hero
from Thrace who was the founder of Orphism, a
mystery religion connected with the mysteries of the
god Dionysus. According to legend Orpheus was a
pre-Homeric Greek poet and marvelous lyre player.
He went down to the underworld to recover his wife
Eurydice. On leaving the underworld with Eurydice
following, he disobeyed the condition imposed by
Hades that he should not look back, and so Eurydice
was lost forever. A different myth relates how he was
torn to pieces, either by the women of Thrace or by
Maenads. His mythology is complex and varied, but
the common theme is his return after death. There
are several variations in the legend, which was often
used as a theme by poets and artists. See also ORPHIC
MYSTERIES, p. 385.
Osiris: An Egyptian god, the husband of Isis and
father of Horus. Osiris represented male fertility in
nature and was identiﬁed with Dionysus. His wor-
ship was closely connected with the cult of Isis.
According to Egyptian myth Osiris was killed and
dismembered by the evil god Seth, but was restored
to life by Isis and was avenged by Horus. Along with
Isis he was considered a ruler of the underworld. A
conﬂation of Osiris and the sacred bull Apis was wor-
shipped as Sarapis.
Pan (Pan):
A god of ﬂocks, herds and fertility, and
patron of shepherds and herdsmen. He originated in
Arcadia where goats were more abundant than cattle.
Pan was usually depicted with a human body with
goats’ legs, ears and horns. He was believed capable
R E L I G I O N
A N D M Y T H O L O G Y
349

of striking terror (“panic”) among people, like that in
stampeding animals. He apparently inhabited moun-
tains, caves and deserted places, and was musical (ﬁg.
8.20). His cult spread from Arcadia in the 5th cen-
tury BC, and he was sometimes worshipped in the
plural (Panes). His cult appeared in Attica after the
battle of Marathon (490 BC), usually in association
with the Nymphs. In mythology Pan was the son of
Hermes, and most legends relate his amorous affairs
with Nymphs. The best known story is that of the
Nymph Syrinx in Arcadia, who was loved by Pan. To
escape him she begged Gaia (in some versions, river
Nymphs) to change her into a bed of reeds; out of
these reeds Pan made a set of pipes known as Pan
pipes (syrinx).
Pandarus (Pandaros):
In mythology a Trojan, son
of Lycaon. In Homer’s Iliad, Pandarus was an archer
urged by Athena to break the truce between the
Greeks and Trojans by shooting an arrow and
wounding Menelaus. He was later killed by
Diomedes.
Pandora (Pandora):
In mythology the ﬁrst woman.
She was created by Zeus to punish man after
Prometheus had created and helped mankind. She
was made by Hephaestus from clay and was brought
to life by Athena. Pandora was endowed with every
charm by the other gods, hence her name meaning
“all gifts.” She was sent by Zeus with a sealed storage
jar to Prometheus’ brother Epimetheus, who married
her. When she opened the jar all the evils and diseases
of humankind ﬂew out and spread through the world,
leaving only hope inside the jar as consolation. In
post-Classical mythology the jar became a box, possi-
bly because of confusion with another story.
Paris or Alexander (Paris, Alexandros):
In mythol-
ogy the son of King Priam and Hecuba. Paris is a
prominent character in Homer’s Iliad, where he is
held responsible for the Trojan War because he
abducted Helen. Incidents concerning Paris (related
in other legends) include the judgment of Paris,
where he was forced to judge who was the most
beautiful of the goddesses Hera, Athena and
Aphrodite. Bribed by the promise of Helen for him-
self, he chose Aphrodite and thus insulted Hera and
Athena. (In another version, he chose Helen as the
most beautiful woman in the world, in a contest
between her and these three goddesses.) Paris killed
Achilles and was himself fatally wounded by an arrow
ﬁred by Philoctetes. Oenone, a Nymph who lived on
Mount Ida and whom Paris had deserted in favor of
Helen, refused to help him. Paris died, and Oenone
was stricken with remorse and killed herself. In other
legends Paris killed Philoctetes.
Parthenope (Parthenope):
In mythology one of the
Sirens whose body was said to have been washed
ashore on the site of Neapolis (modern Naples), a
Greek colony in Italy.
Pasiphae (Pasiphae):
The daughter of Helios, wife
of King Minos of Crete, and mother of Ariadne and
Phaedra. To resolve who should be king of Crete,
Minos appealed to Poseidon to send him a victim to
sacriﬁce. He sent him a bull from the sea, thus con-
firming Minos’ right to be king. However, Minos
refused to sacriﬁce the bull to Poseidon as promised,
and so Poseidon made Pasiphae fall in love with the
bull. With the help of Daedalus, who made a hollow
wooden cow for her to get inside, Pasiphae mated
with the bull and gave birth to the Minotaur, a mon-
ster that was part bull and part man.

various gods including Pan, the Nymphs and the infant
Dionysus. This cave has an altar in the foreground and
so represents a sanctuary. The relief was dedicated c. 330
BC by Neoptolemos, son of Anticles of Milete.

Patroclus (Patroklos):
In mythology the son of
Menoetius. In Homer’s Iliad, he is the attendant and
favorite companion of Achilles (ﬁg. 8.1). Offended by
Agamemnon, Achilles retired from the siege of Troy,
taking with him his men and Patroclus, after which
the ﬁghting went against the Greeks. Patroclus then
obtained permission from Achilles to borrow his
armor and help the Greeks. Mistaken for Achilles,
Patroclus was killed by Hector. Maddened by grief
Achilles reclaimed his body and, with new armor
forged by Hephaestus, fought and killed Hector in
revenge.
Pegasus (Pegasos):
A winged horse (ﬁg. 8.21) that
was born from the blood of Medusa when she was
killed by Perseus. Bellerephon captured Pegasus with
a magic bridle given by Athena, while Pegasus was
drinking from the spring of Pirene in Corinth. Pega-
sus was reputed to have created many famous
springs, including Hippocrene on Mount Helicon,
by stamping his hoof.
Peleus (Peleus):
In mythology the son of Aeacus.
Peleus appears in several legends. When he and his
brother Telamon killed their half-brother Phocus,
Aeacus expelled them. Peleus went to Phthia in
Thessaly where he was given the king’s daughter,
Antigone (not the Antigone of the Oedipus legend),
in marriage and a share of the kingdom. However,
he accidentally killed someone during the Calydon-
ian boar hunt and was again banished. Acastus (son
of Pelias) had a wife called Astydameia who fell in
love with Peleus, but he rejected her. She therefore
sent a message to Antigone that Peleus was about to
marry another woman, and so Antigone hanged
herself. Astydameia also told Acastus that Peleus
had made advances to her, and so Acastus left
Peleus unarmed on Mount Pelion, so that he could
be attacked by the centaurs. However, the centaur
Chiron gave Peleus his sword, and Peleus then cap-
tured Iolchus, cut Astydameia to pieces and marched
his army through the pieces as an act of ritual
purification.
Peleus was given the goddess Thetis as wife.
Although Zeus was in love with her, she was fated to
bear a son more powerful than his father, so Zeus
thought it prudent to marry her to a mortal. The
child she bore was Achilles, and Peleus took him to
Chiron to be reared. Many incidents in the legends
about Peleus became favorite subjects for artistic
portrayal.
Pelops (Pelops):
A hero worshipped at Olympia
(fig. 8.22). In mythology he was the son of Tantalus,
king of Sipylus in Lydia. He was founder of the
Pelopid family after whom the Peloponnesus (Isle
of Pelops) was named. In childhood Pelops was
killed, cooked and served to the gods by Tantalus,
to discover if they could distinguish human flesh
from animal meat. Pelops was brought back to life
by the gods when they found out, and his shoulder
(inadvertently eaten by Demeter) was replaced by
one of ivory. As a youth Pelops was loved by Posei-
don who gave him a wonderful team of horses and
great driving skill. Reaching manhood he won the
hand of Hippodamia in a chariot race against her
father Oenomaus by bribing Myrtilus (the chario-
teer of Oenomaus) to sabotage his chariot. Instead
of paying Myrtilus, he killed him. Although Pelops
prospered and had six sons by Hippodamia, his
descendants were cursed.

Penelope (Penelope):
In mythology the daughter of
Icarius of Sparta (brother of Tyndareus) and wife of
Odysseus. In Homer’s Odyssey Penelope, beset by
numerous suitors, faithfully waited 20 years for
Odysseus to return from the siege of Troy. She stalled
them by saying she must first weave a shroud for
Odysseus’ father Laertes, but unraveled her work
each night. A maid betrayed her, and so Penelope was
forced to complete it. She then promised to marry the
suitor who could bend the bow of Odysseus. At this
point Odysseus returned in disguise and used the bow
against the other suitors. He then revealed his iden-
tity, and Penelope welcomed him back.
Pentheus (Pentheus):
The son of Echion and
Agave (daughter of Cadmus). Pentheus doubted the
divinity of the god Dionysus. He was subsequently
torn to pieces by a group of Maenads, including his
mother who, in her frenzy, did not recognize him.
Persephone, Phersephone or Kore (Persephone,
Phersephone, Persephassa, Persephatta, Kore):
A god-
dess of grain seed. In religious observance she was
usually known as Kore, but as Persephone in
mythology and modern times. The daughter of
Demeter, she was seldom worshipped other than in
association with Demeter, with whom she was

century AD, when it consisted of a grove surrounded by a stone wall and one entrance. Inside was an altar of Pelops 
and several statues.

closely concerned in the Eleusinian Mysteries. In
mythology Persephone was the daughter of Zeus
and Demeter. She was snatched by Hades to be his
wife and queen of the underworld. Demeter
searched, lamenting, for her daughter, and finally
Zeus pitied her. However, Persephone could not be
completely released from the underworld because
she had eaten there (some pomegranate seeds). It
was arranged that she should spend eight (in some
versions, six) months in the world and the rest of the
year with Hades. This myth was understood as an
allegory of grain seed, which must descend into the
earth and disappear in order to germinate and reap-
pear as grain crops. At Athens a women’s festival
(Stenia) was held in honor of Persephone and Deme-
ter, but was overshadowed by the festival in honor of
Demeter (Thesmophoria) on the 11th–13th days of
the month Pyanopsion.
Perseus (Perseus):
In mythology a hero who was
son of Zeus and Danae. After Danae and Perseus
arrived at Seriphos, Polydectes (king of the island)
fell in love with Danae. To remove Perseus, Poly-
dectes persuaded him to bring back the head of
Medusa. After many adventures, aided by various
gods and goddesses, Perseus managed to kill
Medusa. He returned to Seriphos just in time to save
Danae from the violence of Polydectes. He turned
Polydectes to stone with Medusa’s head and left his
brother Dictys as king. Perseus then returned to his
native Argos with Danae in search of his grandfather
Acrisius, but found that he had gone to Larissa; fol-
lowing him there, Perseus accidentally killed Acrisius
by striking him with a discus thrown during funeral
games. He thus fulﬁlled the prophecy that he was
destined to kill Acrisius. Perseus refused to rule his
grandfather’s kingdom, to which he was heir, but
instead became king of Tiryns and founder of the
dynasty of Perseidae. In other versions he went to
Asia, where his son Perses became ruler of the Per-
sians. See also DANAE, GRAIAE.
Phaedra (Phaidra):
In mythology the daughter of
King Minos of Crete and Pasiphae, sister of Ariadne,
and second wife of King Theseus of Athens. Rejected
by Hippolytus, son of Theseus by Hippolyta, she
brought about his death and killed herself. See also
HIPPOLYTUS.
Phaethon (Phaethon):
In mythology the son of
Helios and the heroine Clymene. Learning that his
father was the sun, he set off to find him in the East.
Arriving at the palace of Helios, Phaethon asked for
a favor. Helios said he would grant him anything he
wished, and Phaeton asked to drive the chariot of
the sun for a day. However, he could not control the
horses, and there was a danger that he would set
the world on fire. Zeus therefore killed him with a
thunderbolt.
Phantasus (Phantasos):
One of three gods of
dreams who were sons of Hypnos (god of sleep).
Phantasus was responsible for sending dreams of
inanimate objects. See also ICELOS, MORPHEUS.
Philoctetes (Philoktetes):
A hero with centers of
worship in Magna Graecia. In mythology he was a
Greek leader in the Trojan War who was left behind
on Lemnos suffering from a snake bite. Odysseus dis-
covered that Troy would not fall unless Philoctetes
was present, so he went with Diomedes to fetch him.
In some versions Philoctetes was killed by Paris, in
others he killed Paris. Because he had hero cults in
Magna Graecia, it was also said that he survived the
fall of Troy, wandered to Magna Graecia and founded
cities there. See also HELENUS.
Philomela (Philomela):
In mythology a daughter
of King Pandion of Athens who had another daugh-
ter, Procne (married to King Tereus of Thrace). Pre-
tending Procne was dead, Tereus persuaded Pandion
to send Philomela to him. Tereus raped her, cut out
her tongue and hid her, to prevent her revealing what
had happened. She managed to send a message to
her sister, woven on tapestry. Procne took revenge by
killing and cooking their son Itys and serving him up
to Tereus. When Tereus realized what had happened,
he pursued the two sisters, but the gods changed
Procne into a nightingale, Philomela into a swallow
and Tereus into a hoopoe.
Phoebe (Phoibe, bright one):
In mythology one
of the Titans, daughter of Uranus and Gaia, wife of
Coeus, and mother of Leto. She was thus grand-
mother of Apollo and Artemis. Her name later
came to be used for the moon (Selene). Another
Phoebe was daughter of King Leucippus who was

DIOSCURI.
Phoenix (Phoinix):
Two mythological characters
had this name. One was the son of King Agenor of
Tyre and the brother of Cadmus and Europa. He was
sent to look for Europa, but did not return. Instead
he founded the people called Phoenicians. The other
Phoenix was a son of Amyntor (king in Thessaly)
who was persuaded by his jealous mother to seduce
his father’s concubine. When Amyntor found out he
cursed Phoenix with childlessness. Phoenix went to
Phthia and was welcomed by Peleus, who put him in
charge of the youthful Achilles. Phoenix accompa-
nied Achilles to the Trojan War and was one of the
ambassadors sent to offer Achilles reconciliation with
Agamemnon after their quarrel. Phoenix was also the
name of a mythical bird that reproduced itself by
dying in a ﬁre. From its ashes a new Phoenix arose. It
was thought to live in Ethiopia but traveled to Egypt
to reproduce. Since it was extremely long-lived,
Phoenix rising from the ashes was a rare event.
Phrixus and Helle (Phrixos, Helle):
In mythology
a brother and sister who were the children of
Athamus and his first wife (the cloud goddess
Nephele). Ino, second wife of Amathus, jealously
hated Phrixus and Helle. She persuaded Athamus to
sacriﬁce them, but they escaped on a golden ram sent
by Zeus (in some versions, by Hermes). Helle fell
into the sea, which became known as the Hellespont,
but Phrixus arrived safely in Colchis. In gratitude he
sacriﬁced the ram to Zeus, and its golden ﬂeece was
hung up and guarded by a dragon. It was this Golden
Fleece that the Argonauts sought.
Pirithous (P[e]irithoos):
In mythology the king of
the Lapiths and son of Ixion and Dia. With other Lap-
iths, Pirithous appeared in several myths, the main one
concerning his marriage to Hippodamia. For various
reasons the Centaurs were invited to the wedding feast
but abused the hospitality of Pirithous. They threat-
ened Hippodamia, causing a great battle between the
Centaurs and the Lapiths, which the Lapiths eventu-
ally won. See also HERACLES, THESEUS.
Plutus (Ploutos):
A god who personified wealth,
which originally took the form of abundant crops.
He was probably connected to the underworld deity
Pluton (another name for Hades), since several forms
of wealth sprang from under the earth. Plutus was
associated with Demeter at Eleusis. In mythology he
was son of Iasion and Demeter.
Podarge (Podarge, swift-footed):
One of the Har-
pies, who were daughters of Thaumas and Electra.
Polhymnia (Polymnia):
One of the Muses, thought
in late Roman times to preside over mime.
Polyphemus (Polyphemos):
In 
mythology 
a
Cyclops and son of Poseidon, who appeared in
Homer’s Odyssey. Polyphemus captured Odysseus
and his men and shut them in his cave. He ate two
men each evening, until they managed to blind him
and escape. Polyphemus called on Poseidon for help,
and consequently Poseidon delayed Odysseus’ return
home. See also GALATEA.
Polyxena (Polyxene):
In mythology the daughter of
King Priam of Troy and Hecuba. She is not men-
tioned by Homer, but in other legends she was sacri-
ﬁced to the shade of Achilles by his son Neoptolemus,
as they were about to sail home from Troy.
Poseidon (Poseidon):
Originally a god of earth-
quakes and water, he also came to be a deity of the
sea and to be associated with horses. In mythology
Poseidon was son of Cronus and Rhea and brother of
Zeus and Hades. He was one of the Olympians. His
wife was Amphitrite, and they had a son, Triton.
Poseidon also had children by numerous other god-
desses and mortals, some of whom were giants and
monsters. As a god of the sea he was worshipped
throughout Greece, particularly on occasions con-
nected with the sea and with navigation. He was also
worshipped as god of fresh water. He was considered
a tamer of horses as well and was often worshipped as
Poseidon Hippios (Poseidon of Horses). In Athens
the eighth day of every month was sacred to Posei-
don. The Isthmian Games were held every two years
on the Isthmus of Corinth in his honor. Sacriﬁces to
Poseidon by the Attic deme Erchia were held on the
27th day of the month Gamelion and on the third
day of the month Skirophorion. See also PELOPS.
Priam (Priamos):
In mythology the son of Laome-
don and husband of Hecuba. He was king of Troy

during the Trojan War. He had 50 sons and many
daughters, some by Hecuba and many by other wives
or concubines. His best known children were Hec-
tor, Paris, Polydorus, Creusa and Cassandra. In
Homer’s Iliad, Priam is depicted as an old man
lamenting the misfortunes of the Trojans and the
death of many of his sons. After Hector’s death he
went to the Greek camp with the help of Hermes to
ransom Hector’s body. Other legends tell how, when
Troy fell, he took refuge at the Altar of Zeus
Herkeios (Zeus the household god) and was killed
there by Neoptolemus.
Priapus (Priapos):
A god of the fertility of crops
and of protection against harm. Originally wor-
shipped in the Lampsacus region, his cult spread to
Greece in the Hellenistic period. He was apparently
regarded with amusement rather than awe (although
still treated as a deity), and he became primarily a
god of gardens. His symbol was a phallus, and his
secondary role was probably linked to the more gen-
eral use of phallic symbols as protective charms, par-
ticularly against the evil eye. Priapus was usually
portrayed as a small, sometimes misshapen man with
enormous genitals. In some myths Priapus was son of
Dionysus, and he was sometimes worshipped as part
of the rites of Dionysus.
Procrustes (Prokroustes):
Also called Damastes he
was a legendary robber and son of Poseidon. He
lived somewhere in Attica (in some versions, along-
side the Athens-Eleusis road) and preyed on
strangers. He would measure them against a bed, and
if too short, he put them on a rack or hammered
them out to the right length. If they were too long,
he cut off their legs. Theseus caught him and cut off
his head because Procrustes was too long for the bed.
Prometheus (Prometheus, forethinker):
A Titan
who was the son of Iapetus and Clymene (daughter
of Oceanus), and in some versions, son of Iapetus and
Themis. His son was Deucalion. Prometheus was
regarded as a champion of mortals against the hostil-
ity of the gods. In some myths Prometheus created
the ﬁrst men from clay. Zeus hid ﬁre from men, but
Prometheus stole a spark and gave it to them in a
stalk of fennel. Prometheus was also regarded as a
craftsman who gave mortals all kinds of arts and sci-
ences. He also tricked Zeus into choosing the worst
part of sacriﬁced animals (bones covered with fat),
leaving the best part for mortals. In revenge Zeus
had Hephaestus create Pandora and sent her to
Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus, with a jar con-
taining all the evils and diseases of humankind.
Prometheus also knew the secret of the marriage of
Thetis (she was destined to bear a child greater than
its father) but refused to tell Zeus, who wanted to
marry her. Zeus therefore chained Prometheus to a
rock where an eagle ate his liver by day, and it grew
back at night. He was eventually released by Hera-
cles (or, in another version, by revealing the secret of
Thetis). See also PANDORA.
Proteus (Proteus):
A sea god who was herdsman of
flocks of the sea, such as seals. He was given the
power of prophecy by Poseidon. He also had the
power to change his shape. If held ﬁrmly to retain his
true shape, he would answer questions, for he pos-
sessed the gift of prophecy.
Psyche (Psykhe):
The soul, sometimes considered
by Greeks as a butterﬂy or bird. Different notions of
the soul were developed by poets and philosophers.
Later, Psyche was regarded as female and was por-
trayed as a young woman.
Pygmalion (Pygmalion):
In mythology a king of
Cyprus who made an ivory sculpture of a woman.
He fell in love with the statue, and Aphrodite
breathed life into it, forming a woman who bore
Pygmalion a daughter called Paphos.
Pyrrhus (Pyrros):
One of the Greeks involved in
the Trojan War, also known as Neoptolemus.
Python (Python):
A dragon that guarded the
sacred place at Delphi, and a deity that personiﬁed
the underworld’s dark forces. Apollo killed the
dragon and established his oracle at Delphi, where
he became known as Pythian Apollo, and his elderly
priestess was called Pythia. Python was probably an
ancient deity whose oracle was transferred to
Apollo.
Rhadamanthys (Rhadamanthys):
The son of Zeus
and Europa, and brother of Minos and Sarpedon. He
became a ruler and judge of dead souls in the under-
world, noted for his justice.

Rhea (Rheia):
In mythology one of the Titans. She
was sister and wife of Cronus, and mother of some of
the Olympian gods. She was sometimes identified
with Cybele. See also CRONUS.
Salmoneus (Salmoneus):
In mythology the son of
Aeolus and father of Tyro. He was a king of Elis who
pretended to be Zeus by making a noise like thunder
with his chariot, and throwing torches about to
mimic lightning. For this blasphemy Zeus struck
him with a thunderbolt, destroying him and his city.
Salmoneus was cast into Tartarus in the underworld.
Sarapis: Greek word for the Egyptian god who was a
conﬂation of the god Osiris and the sacred bull Apis.
The cult of Sarapis seems to have arisen at Memphis
in Egypt, in the temple where Apis was kept. Accord-
ing to tradition Ptolemy I effectively created the god
as a new cult to accompany his own power, establish-
ing the cult at Alexandria. Sarapis was a god of the
underworld, sky and healing, regarded as above fate.
He also performed miracles and was equated with
many gods, such as Dionysus, Zeus, Asclepius, Hades
and Helios. The cult was usually known as that of
Sarapis, even though it included Isis, Harpocrates and
other Egyptian deities. By Roman times Isis was usu-
ally the chief deity. Sarapis was generally portrayed
with a benign and bearded face like that of Zeus, with
a modius (fertility symbol) on his head. He was some-
times shown seated, with Cerberus at his right knee.
A shrine or temple dedicated to Sarapis was known as
a Sarapeion. See also ISIS, ORIENTAL AND MYSTERY
RELIGIONS, p. 383.
Sarpedon (Sarpedon):
A hero worshipped in Lycia.
In mythology, he was son of Zeus and Laodamia. He
commanded the Lycian allies of the Trojans at the
siege of Troy. In Homer’s Iliad, he was killed by
Patroclus and was mourned by Zeus. He was then
carried to Lycia by Hypnos and Thanatos for burial.
Later legends make him the son of Zeus and Europa
and uncle of Glaucus, but he would therefore have
lived for three generations: two Lycian heroes with
the same name may have been conﬂated. To explain
the problem Diodorus Siculus (writing 1st century
BC) constructed a genealogy in which Sarpedon (son
of Zeus and Europa) had a son called Evander. He
married Laodamia, and their son Sarpedon took part
in the Trojan War.
Satyrs (Satyroi):
The boisterous half-bestial spirits
of woods and hills, who were attendant on the god
Dionysus. They were usually portrayed in human
form with some animal part, such as a horse’s tail.
From about the 4th century BC they were portrayed
with a human body and goat’s legs. They were con-
stantly confused with Sileni by ancient authors.
Satyrs had goat’s legs and were generally young, but
Sileni were portrayed as old men with horse’s ears.
Satyrs were lustful and fond of revelry, and were
often portrayed chasing Nymphs.
Scylla (Skylle, Skylla):
The name of two mytholog-
ical ﬁgures. The better known Scylla was a daughter
of Phorcys and Hecate, and a sea monster in the
Straits of Messina. She had six heads, each with a
triple row of teeth, and 12 feet. She lived off ﬁsh, but
also took men from nearby ships and devoured them.
This sea monster was sometimes confused with
Scylla, daughter of King Nisus of Megara. See also
GLAUCUS, NISUS.
Selene (Selene):
Goddess of the moon, identiﬁed
with Artemis. Selene does not appear to have had
much cult following, although there was an oracle at
the shrine of Selene Pasiphae near Thalamae in
Laconia. In mythology Selene was daughter of the
Titans Hyperion and Theia, and sister of Helios and
Eos. She appears in a few myths, the best known
being that of Endymion. In later times she may have
been identiﬁed with Phoebe, since the latter name
came to be used for the Moon.
Semele (Semele; sometimes called Thyone):
In
mythology the daughter of Cadmus and mother of
Dionysus by Zeus. Hera was jealous that Semele was
loved by Zeus. She disguised herself and advised
Semele to test the divinity of her lover. Consequently
Semele asked Zeus to show himself to her in all his
glory, but she was struck dead by the sight. Dionysus
brought Semele back from the underworld to
become a goddess. See also DIONYSUS.
Seven Against Thebes: In mythology the action of
seven Argive leaders to retrieve the throne of
Thebes. When Oedipus cursed his sons (Eteocles
and Polynices) and went into exile, they agreed to
rule Thebes in alternate years. At the end of his year
Eteocles refused to give up the throne, precipitating

the episode called the Seven Against Thebes. The
seven are usually named as Polynices, Adrastus,
Tydeus, Parthenopaeus, Capaneus, Hippomedon
and Amphiaraus, with Adrastus as their leader. Other
versions name Eteocles (son of Iphis) instead of
Adrastus, and Mecisteus (brother of Adrastus)
instead of Polynices. They attacked Thebes, and
Eteocles and the seven (except Adrastus) were killed.
Silenus (Seilenos):
A god who represented the
spirit of untamed nature. He was represented in art
as half-man and half-animal, with ears and some-
times legs and tail of a horse. Silenus was often
regarded as plural (Sileni or Silens). Sileni were fre-
quently confused with Satyrs by ancient authors, and
sometimes with the god Pan. It can be difﬁcult to
distinguish between portrayals of Sileni and Satyrs in
art, although Satyrs had goat’s legs and were gener-
ally young, and Sileni were portrayed as old men
with horse’s ears. Silenus was associated with the cult
of Dionysus and was sometimes regarded as his tutor.
Sirens (Seirenes):
In mythology the female crea-
tures who had the power of luring men to destruc-
tion at sea by their singing (ﬁg. 8.23). In Homer’s
Odyssey the Sirens inhabited an island near Scylla and
Charybdis. Sailors charmed by their song would land
on the island and perish in a meadow full of corpses.
The Sirens were sometimes considered daughters of
Gaia. In some legends they had to die if a mortal
escaped their power. They drowned themselves after
Odysseus passed by safely. In art Sirens were usually
represented as half-women and half-birds, although
male, bearded versions predominated in early art.
See also PARTHENOPE.
Sisyphus (Sisyphos):
A mythological character who
had a shrine at Corinth and was allegedly buried on
the Isthmus at Corinth. In mythology he was the son
of Aeolus and was tormented in Hades by having to
push a rock up a hill, which rolled down again when
he reached the top. One explanation for his punish-
ment was that he offended Zeus by telling Asopus
where Zeus had taken his daughter Aegina. Sisyphus
is portrayed in other myths as a trickster, and his
name was used as a nickname for a cunning person.
Sphinx (Sphinx):
A monster with a human head
and lion’s body. It originated in Egypt but was
absorbed into Greek mythology at an early date. In
Greek literature the Sphinx was always female,
although some bearded male Sphinxes were por-
trayed in art. The image of the Sphinx was used as
protection against evil. The Sphinx appears in sev-
eral myths, including Theban examples about the
House of Oedipus where she preyed on Thebans and
devoured those who could not solve her riddle.
Oedipus destroyed the Sphinx by correctly solving
the riddle, and the Sphinx committed suicide.
Stentor (Stentor):
In mythology a man with a
“brazen voice” who could shout as loud as 50 men.
He appears in Homer’s Iliad but in few other myths.
One later myth related that he died after losing a
shouting match with Hermes.
Steropes (Steropes, Lightener):
In mythology one
of the Cyclopes.
Syrinx (Syrinx):
A Nymph of Arcadia with whom
the god Pan fell in love. She ran away from Pan and
begged the river Nymphs (in some versions, Gaia) to
turn her into a reed bed. It was with reeds from this
bed that Pan made a set of Pan pipes (syrinx).
Tantalus (Tantalos):
In mythology the king of
Sipylus in Lydia, son of Zeus and father of Niobe

and Pelops. Various legends recount different crimes
he allegedly committed. These included stealing
food from the gods and giving it to mortals, and
killing and cooking his son Pelops for a banquet for
the gods, who found out and brought Pelops back to
life. For his crime he was punished with everlasting
torment, usually in Tartarus (part of the under-
world), where he is “tantalized” by food and water
that constantly moved out of his reach. See also
PELOPS.
Teiresias or Tiresias (Teiresias):
A blind Theban
seer. Various legends explain his blindness, including
one that says he saw Athena bathing and she blinded
him. In compensation she gave him the power of
prophecy. He appears in many myths, including
Homer’s Odyssey, with Odysseus being sent into the
underworld to consult him.
Telegonus (Telegonos):
According to legend, the
son of Odysseus and Circe. He was possibly an
invention of the author of the Telegony, a lost epic of
the 6th century BC. See also ODYSSEUS.
Telemachus (Telemakhos):
In mythology the son
of Odysseus and Penelope. He has a prominent role
in Homer’s Odyssey, developing from a youthful and
dutiful but unenterprising son to a warrior who
helped to destroy the unwanted suitors of Penelope.
In another legend he married Circe after Odysseus’
death.
Terpsichore (Terpsikhora):
One of the Muses,
thought in late Roman times to preside over lyric
poetry and dancing.
Tethys (Tethys):
In mythology one of the Titans.
She was wife of Oceanus, and mother of Achelous
and the Oceanids.
Thalia (Thalia):
One of the Muses, thought in late
Roman times to preside over comedy.
Thallo (Thallo):
In Attica one of three goddesses
of the seasons (Horae).
Thanatos (Thanatos):
In mythology the personiﬁ-
cation of death.
Theia (Theia):
In mythology one of the female
Titans.
Themis (Themis):
Originally a goddess similar to
Gaia, she came to be regarded as a personiﬁcation of
justice. In mythology she was one of the Titans. She
was mother, by Zeus, of the Horae and the Fates, and
in some legends mother of Prometheus by Iapetus.
Thersites (Thersites):
In mythology the only non-
heroic character in Homer’s Iliad, described as mean-
spirited, ugly, foul-mouthed and low-class. He
accused Agamemnon of prolonging the Trojan War
for his own ends, and was beaten into silence by
Odysseus. In another legend, where he was described
as from a good family, he insulted Achilles who then
killed him.
Theseus (Theseus):
The national hero of Athens,
his cult center. He was believed by Athenians to be
an early king of Athens. In mythology he was son
either of Poseidon or of King Aegeus of Athens and
Aethra (daughter of King Pittheus of Troezen).
Aegeus left Aethra at Troezen, telling her that when
Theseus reached manhood, he was to lift a certain
large rock and take the sword and sandals hidden
underneath to Athens. Theseus embarked for Athens
by the dangerous land route, enduring adventures on
the way. At Athens he was recognized by Medea, who
had taken refuge with King Aegeus. In an attempt to
destroy Theseus, Medea persuaded Aegeus to send
him to kill the bull of Marathon. Theseus accom-
plished this task, so Medea tried to poison him on his
return to Athens. However, Aegeus recognized his
son in time to prevent his death. Medea was sent
back to Colchis, along with her son Medus, whose
father was either Aegeus or an Asian king who mar-
ried Medea after she was driven out of Athens.
Theseus then heard about the tribute that Athens
had to pay Minos of Crete—seven girls and seven
youths to be eaten by the Minotaur. Theseus volun-
teered to be one of the youths, and with the help of
Ariadne and her thread he managed to kill the Mino-
taur in the labyrinth and ﬁnd his way out. Theseus,
the other Greeks and Ariadne sailed from Crete. He
abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos and
returned to Athens. Theseus had arranged with his
father that he would change his black sail for a white

one if his mission had been successful, but he forgot.
On seeing the black sail, Aegeus threw himself from
the cliffs into the sea in despair. Some legends cite
this as the origin of the name, Aegean Sea. Theseus
then became king of Athens. He was credited with
unifying the Attic communities into a single state,
with Athens as the capital.
With Heracles, Theseus took part in an expedi-
tion against the Amazons and married the Amazon
queen Hippolyta (in some versions, the Amazon
Antiope). The Amazons invaded Attica to recover
her but were defeated. Theseus was present at the
wedding feast of King Pirithous of the Lapiths and
the subsequent battle between the Lapiths and Cen-
taurs. He later helped Pirithous to invade the under-
world to try to carry off Persephone. Theseus also
apparently abducted Helen, who was then rescued
by her brothers the Dioscuri. When Creon, king of
Thebes, refused burial of the bodies of the Seven
against Thebes, Theseus marched with Adrastus and
the sons of these Argive leaders to bury the dead.
After Hippolyta died, by whom he had a son, Hip-
polytus, Theseus married Phaedra (sister of Ari-
adne). Theseus was finally driven from Athens by
rebellions. He took refuge in Scyros, where he died,
but he was seen in the form of a giant ﬁghting for the
Greeks at the battle of Marathon in 490 BC. See also
ARIADNE, HIPPOLYTUS, PROCRUSTES.
Thetis (Thetis):
One of the Nereids who was des-
tined to bear a son greater than his father. When this
was revealed to the gods, Zeus and Poseidon decided
to marry her to a mortal. She was married to Peleus
and gave birth to Achilles. In one legend she left
Peleus after he tried to prevent her from dipping
Achilles in the river Styx to make him immortal. In
Homer’s Iliad she is portrayed as a mother who is
only concerned for her son.
Titans (Titanes):
In mythology the older gods who
existed before the Olympians. They were the off-
spring of Gaia and Uranus. According to Hesiod
there were six male Titans (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius,
Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronus) and six female Titans
(Thea, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys).
Some other legends cite other characters as Titans,
such as Atlas, Leto, Perses and Asterie. When
Cronus castrated Uranus and took his throne, the
Titans seized power. Cronus married Rhea, but
knowing that he would be overthrown by his chil-
dren, he tried to prevent this by swallowing them.
His children ﬁnally escaped, and led by Zeus, they
fought and overcame the Titans and took power for
themselves. This struggle against the Titans was
sometimes called Titanomachia.
Tithonus (Tithonos):
In mythology the son of
King Laomedon of Troy and brother of Priam. Eos
fell in love with Tithonus, and their children were
Emathion and Memnon. Eos asked Zeus to make
Tithonus immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal
youth. He therefore became so old and shriveled that
little more than his voice was left.
Triton (Triton):
The son of Poseidon and
Amphitrite, with a human head and shoulders and a
ﬁsh tail from the waist down. He was commonly por-
trayed as blowing on a conch shell. In some myths
there were several Tritons.
Tritopatores or Tritopatreis (Tritopatores, Tritopa-
treis):
Obscure deities worshipped in Attica. Their
name seems to mean “great-grandfathers,” and they
were said to be ancestors. They were also sometimes
regarded as wind gods. These deities were invoked in
prayers for children before a marriage. The Attic
deme Erchia sacriﬁced to them on the 21st day of the
month Mounichion, and they were worshipped at
Marathon on the eve of the Scira festival.
Troilus (Troilos):
In mythology a younger son of
King Priam of Troy. In Homer’s Iliad he had already
been killed, but other legends relate how he was slain
by Achilles.
Trophonius (Trophonios):
A hero who became god
of the oracular shrine at a cave at Lebadea. This was
an important oracle, and the method of consulting it
was recorded by Pausanias in Roman times. In
mythology Trophonius and his brother Agamedes
were sons of Erginus of Orchomenus in Boeotia.
They were architects and allegedly built the temple
of Apollo at Delphi and a treasury, either for King
Hyrieus of Boeotia or King Augeas of Elis. They
tried to rob the treasury by means of a movable stone
in the wall, but the king caught Agamedes in a trap.

To avoid Agamedes being identiﬁed, Trophonius cut
off his head. He himself was subsequently swallowed
up by the earth at Lebadea. Having consulted the
Delphic Oracle because of a drought, the Boeotians
were told to consult Trophonius’ oracle. They were
led to a cave by a swarm of bees, where one Boeotian
had a vision of Trophonius.
Tyche (Tykhe):
A goddess who personiﬁed chance
or fortune. She became increasingly popular in the
Hellenistic period, when a number of cities adopted
their own version of Tyche as patron deity.
Typhon or Typhoeus (Typhon, Typhoeus):
In myth-
ology a monster who was often confused with the
Giants. Typhon had 100 dragon-shaped heads and
powerful hands and feet. Zeus overcame him with
thunderbolts and cast him into Tartarus, setting Mount
Aetna on ﬁre on the way. In other myths Typhon is the
power below the volcano on Mount Aetna. See also
CERBERUS, CHIMAERA, HERACLES.
Urania (Ourania):
One of the Muses, thought in
late Roman times to preside over astronomy.
Uranus (Ouranos):
In mythology the personiﬁca-
tion of the heavens. Gaia gave birth to Uranus, who
fathered a number of children on Gaia. He pre-
vented them being born until Cronus (another son of
Gaia) castrated Uranus (representing the separation
of Earth from Heaven), which apparently allowed
the children to be born. The children included the
Titans, Giants, Erinyes and Hecatoncheires.
Zephyrus (Zephyros):
God of the west wind; like
all wind gods, he was often thought to take the form
of a horse. He was son of Eos and Astraeus and
sometimes considered to be the husband of the god-
dess Iris and father of Eros. In Homer’s Iliad he is the
father of the talking horses of Achilles (called Xan-
thus and Balius), which had been a present from
Poseidon to Achilles’ father, Peleus.
Zeus (Zeus):
Originally a weather god descended
from the Indo-European sky god, Zeus was chief of all
the Greek gods and came to be regarded as father of
gods and mortals (ﬁg. 8.24). He was often called Zeus
Pater (Zeus the Father). He was one of the Olympians
and the supreme ruler who controlled thunder, light-
ning and rain, and upheld justice, law and morals. In
mythology the power of Zeus was based on supreme
strength and wisdom, a limited power because he was
unable to oppose the will of the three Fates. They
controlled the destinies of people, and fate was the law
of the universe, a law made by Zeus himself. Before
the Dark Age Zeus was regarded as protector of the
king and his family, but after the abolition of monar-
chies, Zeus became protector of the polis and of polit-
ical freedom. He was often invoked by men in oaths.
Zeus appears in various myths, where he is usually
regarded as the youngest son of Cronus, overthrown
by Zeus in the struggle against the Titans (Titano-
machia). Afterward Zeus and his brothers divided the
universe among them, with Zeus obtaining the heav-
ens, Hades the underworld and Poseidon the sea.
Zeus lived on mountaintops, particularly Mount
Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. On Mt
Hymettos he was worshipped as a weather god, Zeus
Ombrios. His power was symbolized by the thunder-
bolt, which only he could wield. Zeus had various
children: deities including Apollo, Ares, Artemis,

Athena, Hebe, Hephaestus, Hermes, Dionysus, Eilei-

In the Hellenistic period Zeus was frequently
identiﬁed with the chief god of any non-Greek area,
such as Ammon in Libya. Zeus had more than 150
epithets, such as Zeus Xenios (Zeus, god of hospital-
ity and protector of guests) and Zeus Ktesios (Zeus,
god of the household).
The Nemean Games were held every two years at
Nemea in honor of Zeus, and the Olympic Games
were held every four years at Olympia in honor of
Olympian Zeus (ﬁg. 8.25). At Athens several festivals
were celebrated in honor of Zeus: in the month
Gamelion, the Theogamia (or Gamelia) festival cele-
brated the sacred marriage between Hera and Zeus;
the Diasia festival on the 23rd day of the month
Anthesterion in honor of Zeus Meilichios (gracious
Zeus); the Pandia festival on the 17th day of the
month Elaphebolion; the Olympieia festival in honor
of Olympian Zeus on the 19th day of the month
Mounichion; and the Bouphonia festival in honor of
Zeus Polieus (Zeus, guardian of the city) on the 14th
day of the month Skirophorion. The Lycaea was a fes-
tival in honor of Zeus, celebrated at Mount Lycaeus.
Several sacriﬁces to Zeus were undertaken by the Attic
deme Erchia: to Zeus Epoptes (tutelary Zeus) on the
25th day of the month Metageitnion; to Zeus Horios
(Zeus of the boundary) on the 16th day of the month
Poseideon; to Zeus Teleius (perfect Zeus, as a deity
who is both perfect and who provides perfection) on
the 27th day of the month Gamelion; to Zeus on the
fourth day of the month Thargelion; to Zeus Epacrios
(Zeus of the heights) on the 16th day of the month
Thargelion; and to Zeus Polieus (Zeus, protector of
the city) on the third day of the month Skirophorion.

PRIESTHOODS
Function
Religion was intertwined with politics, and religious
matters took precedence in state business. Most
priests and priestesses were state ofﬁcials whose duty
was to perform religious observances on behalf of the
whole state or part of it, mediating between worship-
pers and the worshipped.
The duties of priesthood varied from cult to cult,
but were generally not especially great. Some cults
had specialized priests performing different tasks.
Duties might include presiding over rituals and, very
important, sacriﬁces, preparing and participating in
festivals, ofﬁciating at wedding and funerals, purify-
ing houses after a birth or a death, administering
oaths, looking after cult property, and administering
the cult’s affairs.
The earliest historical evidence for priests and
priestesses in Greece comes from Linear B tablets of
c. 1200 BC, which depict them in specialized roles,
such as workers of sacred bronze and keepers of tem-
ple keys. This indicates that by this date priesthoods
were fully developed. Priests continued to retain
respect and authority until the Roman emperor
Theodosius I banned pagan cults in AD 391.
Ofﬁceholders
Traditionally goddesses were served by priestesses
and gods by priests, although some cults had both
priests and priestesses, and there were exceptions. For
example, some cults of Athena were served by boy
priests, while some cults of Apollo had priestesses,
such as the elderly Pythia, who gave the oracles at
Delphi in a trancelike state. By and large, women
played a key role in public religious life, while young
girls and boys often carried out the role of attendants.
There were hereditary priesthoods, such as that
of Poseidon Erechtheus at Athens. So strong was this
tradition, that some priesthoods remained hereditary
for over 1,000 years. Inheritance through the male
line had priority, but if not possible, inheritance was
through the female line. The exact method of inheri-
tance varied, and complicated patterns of inheritance
are known. Sometimes priesthoods were passed on
by wills and testaments, while others were obtained
by election (apparently rare), lottery, purchase or
appointment. Election, lottery and appointment were
methods largely confined to mainland Greece,
whereas purchase of priesthoods was conﬁned largely
to eastern Greek islands and Asia Minor.
Eligibility for priesthoods varied from cult to cult,
but generally candidates needed to be free of any
deformity and to have a suitable family background.
This often meant being able to demonstrate citizen-
ship of a city for several generations, so priests fre-
quently came from elite families. Other factors
included age and family status. For example, priests of
Athena at Rhodes were boys (not men), the virgin
goddess Artemis was served by virgin priestesses, and
Hera (goddess of marriage) was served by married
priestesses. The length of time priesthoods were held
also varied from cult to cult, but this often reﬂected
the method by which the priesthood was acquired.
Hereditary and purchased priesthoods were usually
for life, while those obtained in a lottery tended to be
for between two and four years, or from festival to
festival. Male priesthoods usually sold for a higher
price than female ones.
Priests and priestesses frequently had high social
status, as well as a legal status that was particularly
beneﬁcial to priestesses, who could act on their own
behalf and were not necessarily under the guardian-
ship of a father, husband or brother. Priests and
priestesses were entitled to parts of animals slaugh-
tered for sacriﬁce and sometimes to housing. The
priestess of Demeter at Eleusis, for example, had a
private house. Other rewards for priests included
free meals and privileges, such as front seats at the
theater, but salaries were apparently uncommon.
The value of the rewards generally reﬂected the sta-
tus of the priesthood.
Types of Priesthood
Various types of priesthood are recorded in inscrip-
tions. The most common are the hiereus (priest) and
hiereia (priestess), who looked after the sacred things
(hiera) stored in the sanctuary; many temples had a
single hiereus or hiereia. Larger temples had a staff

with specialists that could include spondophoroi (liba-
tion bearers), loutrophoroi or hydrophoroi (carriers of
holy water), manteis (prophets), an auletes (musician),
exegetai (interpreters or expounders of sacred law),
kleidoukhoi (key holders), an oinokhoos (wine pourer), a
grammateus (scribe) and a mageiros (sacrificer). A
neokoros originally meant “temple sweeper,” but it
later became a less humble post, perhaps “temple
assistant” or “caretaker.” The diakonos (deacon) was
responsible for some chores, and temple slaves were
called hierodouloi. Other specialist priests known
from inscriptions are the dadoukhos (torch bearer)
and hierokeryx (a herald who announced the ritual),
as well as hierothytai (sacrificing priests) and rhab-
dophoroi (responsible for keeping order at festivals).
At the Asclepieion in Athens the priest was
assisted by a zakoros (senior attendant), and there was
also a male sacristan, a male ﬁre bearer (pyrphoros), a
female basket bearer (kanephoros) and a female
“bearer of holy secrets” (arrephoros).
At oracular shrines the words of the god were usu-
ally proclaimed by a chresmologos, mantis or prophetes
(prophet), and at Eleusis the hierophantes was the pre-
siding priest who showed initiates the sacred objects.
In some temples special names were used for priests
and priestesses. For example the child priestesses of
Artemis at Brauron were called “bears,” and the
priestesses of Artemis at Ephesus were called “bees.”
In the cult of Dionysus at Smyrna a theophantor had
some connection with the god appearing to mortals.
At Pergamum the staff of priests included a thyroros
(janitor), and on Crete a hiarorgos (performer of sacred
acts) sometimes took the place of the normal priest.
Sibyl (Sibylla) was a general name given to various
prophetesses, some of whose individual names have
survived as well (ﬁg. 8.26) Sibyls were present in var-
ious places. They prophesied in a state of ecstasy,
possessed by a god (usually Apollo). Their prophe-
cies were sometimes written down, collections of
which were used as oracles.

The Ptolemaic dynasty from the late 4th century
BC introduced Greek traditions to Egypt. Under the
Ptolemies the priesthood remained largely unchanged,
and double names of priests quite often included a
Greek name. Priests in Egypt were fulltime ofﬁcials of
high standing in society. Generations of families fol-
lowed the priesthood, and wives were often priest-
esses. The new ruler cult of the Ptolemies required
traditional priests to become priests of this cult as well.
In 196 BC Ptolemy V Epiphanes conferred great ben-
eﬁts upon the priesthood and set aside revenues for
the maintenance of temples. In gratitude the priests
met at Memphis and ordered statues of the king to be
erected and copies of the decree to be set up, of which
the Rosetta Stone is a surviving example, inscribed in
hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek.
SACRED PLACES
Types
In both rural and urban areas land sacred to the gods
(hieron, literally “ﬁlled with divine power”) was sub-
ject to restrictions. Such sacred land might be an
enclosed, or delineated, area (temenos), a sanctuary
(hieron) with or without buildings, or a natural fea-
ture such as a cave, spring or grove. The term
“shrine” is often used loosely to mean a place of wor-
ship, such as a sanctuary or a temple. Temples were
built within sacred areas. Sanctuaries had a boundary
( peribolos) along which was a wall or, at intervals
boundary markers. The area inside was used for wor-
ship, especially at annual festivals. Inside a sanctuary
could be located a temple to the god, altars and other
buildings, and on the periphery were theaters and
stadia, depending on the size of the sanctuary.
Religious Pollution
Regulations about entry to some speciﬁc sacred areas
are known from inscriptions and show considerable
variation. In Athens the agora had many temples and
altars. Here there were perirrhanteria (sing. perir-
rhanterion), lustral marble water basins on column
stands where people could ritually purify themselves
before entering the sacred area. On the Acropolis at
Athens, some 50 perirrhanteria with dedicatory inscrip-
tions have been found. People tainted with some forms
of religious pollution (miasma) were not allowed into
the sacred area for a number of days, which could
restrict their participation in the political life of Athens.
Of the many types of religious pollution that precluded
entry to sacred areas, the only universal ones were
childbirth, contact with childbirth and contact with a
dead person. Other types of pollution that prevented
entry to speciﬁc sacred areas included the wearing of
certain clothes, recent sexual intercourse, certain dis-
eases including madness, eating certain foods and car-
rying particular types of weapons or certain types of
metal. Sexual intercourse, birth and death were activi-
ties prohibited within sacred areas. If the rules of pol-
lution were not observed, various outcomes could
occur through divine anger, such as crop failure, infer-
tility (of women and animals), disease and warfare.
Puriﬁcation ceremonies also took place as prepa-
ration for particular events and not as a reaction to
pollution, such as at the start of the assembly (ekkle-
sia) at Athens. Such symbolic ceremonies could
include animal sacriﬁce, sprinkling with water, wash-
ing and fumigation.
Temples
FUNCTION
Sanctuaries (sacred areas) could contain small shrines
or vast complexes of buildings such as temples and
theaters, but the temple was most common. Temples
were primarily considered as places where the gods
lived and where their cult statue (agalma) was housed,
rather than places where congregations assembled for
worship. They often served other purposes, such as
sheltering sacred places or objects (for example, an
ancient sacred image or sacred tree) and storing offer-
ings (gifts) made to the temple deity. Many temples
became wealthy and to some extent operated as banks
and as keepers of records (see chapter 5). Acts of wor-
ship were usually carried out at outdoor altars near
temples, although acts of worship and sacriﬁce did
sometimes take place within temples.
The basic component of a temple was the naos (or
cella), which was the room that housed the cult

statue of the deity. Temples were constructed with a
great variety of orientations, but around 80 percent
were oriented approximately eastward, often so that
the rising sun shone into the temple on the festival
day of the deity to which the temple was dedicated.
EARLY TEMPLES
Temples apparently developed from the 8th century
BC, and these early temples had a certain amount of
variation in their form. They were most commonly
based on three types of contemporary house plans.
The simplest temple was square or rectangular in
plan, with a stone bench at the rear for offerings to
the deity. Another type had a hairpin plan, consisting
of a long hall with a narthex (porch) at one end and
an apse at the other. The third type of early temple
was most common and was similar to a megaron. It
was rectangular in plan, with an entrance at one end,
and the side walls often projected to form a porch.
Early temples of the 8th–7th centuries BC appear
to have been constructed mainly of wood, but stone
was also used at an early date. Temple plans devel-
oped from the megaron type, usually with the addition
of columns to form facades, porches and colonnades.
In larger temples there were interior columns (usually
in two parallel rows) to support the roof. After the
experimentation of the early period the basic plan of
temples remained relatively constant, although there
were many variations of proportion, detail and deco-
ration. The cella became a central hall, almost always
with a columned porch (pronaos) at the front, and
often a symmetrical structure to the porch at the rear
of the cella, called an opisthodomos. The cella side walls
often projected to form the side walls of the pronaos
and opisthodomos, and terminated in columns called
antae. Rows of columns were placed in front, at the
rear and sometimes all the way around the temple to
form a colonnade (peristylon).
ARCHAIC TEMPLES
Doric temples of the late 7th century BC are known
from places such as Delphi and Cyrene, but have not
survived in any substantial form. One of the earliest
Doric temples of the Archaic Age with substantial
elements remaining is the temple of Hera at
Olympia (ﬁg. 8.27), built around 590 BC. It appears

bricks. The rest was of wood, apart from the tiled roof. The columns were replaced in stone from time to time.

to mark the end of the transition from wood to stone
for temple building. It had a cella, pronaos and
opisthodomos, surrounded by a colonnade with a row
of six columns at the rear and at the front, and a row
of 16 columns on each side. The pronaos and
opisthodomos both have two columns in antis (sited
between the columns called antae that terminate the
side walls). The columns of this temple were origi-
nally wooden but were gradually replaced in stone.
The temple of Apollo at Corinth provides a good
example of a Doric temple of c. 560 BC. It was basi-
cally similar to the temple of Hera but had two
8.28 Plans of temples at Athens: a) Erechtheum; b) Athena Nike; c) Parthenon

chambers instead of the single cella, and these cham-
bers had two interior rows of columns. In eastern
Greece Ionic temples of this period were often larger
and more elaborate than mainland Doric ones, prob-
ably due to Near Eastern influences. Examples of
this Ionic type include the temple of Apollo at
Didyma and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The
latter temple was built c. 530 BC; it was a dipteral
temple (having a colonnade with two parallel rows of
columns surrounding the temple), with two rows of 21
columns on both sides. It had a triple row of columns
on the facade and was a massive structure, 164 ft (50
m) wide and 377 ft (115 m) long. The temple of
Apollo at Didyma, built in the mid-6th century BC,
was also a large dipteral temple. Its interior was open
to the sky, and within it was a small shrine.
CLASSICAL TEMPLES
In the early Classical period (c. 480–450 BC), most
temples appear to have been built in the Doric style,
although some Ionic ones are known. A Doric exam-
ple is the temple of Zeus at Olympia (fig. 8.25),
which had a pronaos, opisthodomos and peristyle, with
two rows of columns within the cella. The pediments
and metopes were richly decorated with marble
sculptures, many fragments of which have survived.
Another example of an early Classical Doric temple
is that of Zeus Olympios at Acragas, which had a
cella and narrow opisthodomos but no pronaos. There
were two rows of columns in the interior, and the
peristyle had engaged columns set along a continu-
ous wall.
In the second half of the 5th century BC (some-
times called the High Classical period), there was
much building on the Acropolis at Athens, including
the Parthenon (temple of Athena Parthenos) (ﬁgs.
2.9, 8.28c). This temple, which replaced an earlier
temple, had a cella and two shallow porches. A room
behind the cella may have served as a treasury.) The
temple itself certainly housed state funds and offer-
ings and was a huge repository of gold and silver
objects. It was the largest Doric temple on the Greek
mainland. At Sounion the Doric temple of Poseidon
was built about the same time, as were other exam-
ples, such as the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnus and
the temple of Ares in the agora at Athens. Examples
of Ionic temples of this period include the temple of
Athena Nike (ﬁgs. 8.28b, 8.29) and the Erechtheum
(figs. 8.10, 8.28a, 8.30), both on the Acropolis at
Athens.
The 4th century BC was marked by the introduc-
tion of the Corinthian column (see chapter 6), which
gradually gained popularity, but Doric and Ionic
temples still continued to be built. Corinthian
columns were often incorporated as an additional
feature into an otherwise Doric, or sometimes Ionic,
building. The temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus is an
example of a Doric temple of this period. It had a
cella and pronaos but no opisthodomos, and it had a
surrounding peristyle. Grandiose Ionic temples were
built in Asia Minor, such as the temple of Apollo at
Didyma and the temple of Athena Polias at Priene
(ﬁgs. 6.17, 8.31, 9.17).
HELLENISTIC TEMPLES
Most examples of architecture of this period are
found in Asia Minor, as mainland Greece no longer
had resources for much major building. The Doric
order was not popular for Hellenistic temple con-
struction, although it was used for other buildings.
The Ionic order continued to be used, and the ﬁrst
instance of the Corinthian order for the exterior of a
temple appears to have been on the temple of
Olympian Zeus at Athens. In addition to using the

are four prostyle columns at each end.

Corinthian order, some temples showed Oriental
inﬂuences, such as the temple of Sarapis in Alexan-
dria, whose architecture was a mixture of Greek and
Oriental features.
CULT IMAGES
Cult images were representations of gods, goddesses
and heroes, often forming the center of cult sites
such as temples (where the cult image occupied the
cella). Images were either statues or reliefs, usually of
stone or bronze, although early ones may often have
been made of wood. Images of gold and chrysele-
phantine (part gold and part ivory) are also known. It
is usually impossible to be certain that a surviving
statue or fragment was originally a cult image, par-
ticularly as many were deliberately destroyed in the
early Christian period. An agalma (pl. agalmata) was
8.30 The Erechteum on the Acropolis at Athens. In front are the still visible ruins of the older temple of Athena which
was destroyed by the Persians. Various cults were apparently housed in the Erechtheum, including Athena, Poseidon and
Erechteus. It is an Ionic temple, begun in 421 BC and ﬁnished in 405 BC. Both the plan and elevation are unique.

a cult statue, while an aphidruma seems to have been
one copying a more important cult statue elsewhere.
Treasuries
Offerings to the gods were usually stored within a
temple, or sometimes in ancillary buildings within
temple precincts. In the larger, more famous sanctu-
aries, treasuries (thesauroi, sing. thesauros) were also
built. These structures were designed to protect and
display offerings of individual cities. The buildings
themselves also performed the function of a votive
offering, marking the devotion and gratitude of the
builders. Treasuries were normally very simple in
plan, consisting of a rectangular room fronted by a
porch with a two-column facade. They were built in
both Doric and Ionic orders and were often highly
ornamented and embellished to honor the deity and
reﬂect the prestige of the city that had donated them
(ﬁg. 2.5).
Altars
Altars were sited in sacred places. They were used as
sacriﬁcial tables and were indispensable in the cult of
most gods (the exception being underworld gods, to
whom offerings were made in pits). Since nearly
every religious act was accompanied by a sacriﬁce,
altars were a focus of worship that predated the use
of temples. When temples were built the altar usu-
ally stood outside, often at the front. Altars were
sometimes situated inside temples. There were altars
in domestic houses, often in a courtyard, where the
household could worship and perform sacriﬁces.
An altar was a raised place, and the earliest altars
may have been of earth. The great altar of Zeus at
Olympia was made of the ashes of sacrifices that
took place there. Altars were usually of stone, the
simplest being a single stone slab. They were usually
rectangular or square, occasionally circular. In time
they became increasingly elaborate, and eventually
became independent buildings, the most elaborate
being the Hellenistic altar of Zeus at Pergamum (ﬁg.
8.32). Built on a platform 120 by 112 ft (36.44 by 34.2
m), it had a podium reached by a great ﬂight of steps
and was ornamented by high-relief sculptures. The
podium had an Ionic portico with two projecting
sides. This type of altar is sometimes called a stepped
monumental altar and was built to give increased
honor to the god to whom it was dedicated. The
largest known altar was found at Syracuse and was
650 by 74 ft (198 by 23 m).

8.32 A reconstruction of the Hellenistic altar of Zeus at Pergamum

Not all altars were designed to have sacrifices
burnt on them, although some had a metal ﬁre pan
on top for that purpose. Some altars had a deep
depression in the center of the upper surface, and
these were usually dedicated to deities of the under-
world. Small altars of stone or terra-cotta were pos-
sibly intended to be portable. Also outside temples
were placed perirrhanteria (water basins) used in
puriﬁcation ceremonies.
RELIGIOUS
OBSERVANCE
Purpose
The Greeks had no central collection of sacred texts,
such as a bible, nor a universal caste of priests to
interpret and define orthodox religion. They
demonstrated their beliefs and communicated with
their gods largely through prayers, hymns, divina-
tion, sacriﬁce and votive offerings. It was believed
that gods could intervene in human affairs and could
be influenced by rituals, even though there was a
distinction between the realm of gods and that of
humans. Most rituals such as sacrifice were an
attempt to please the gods. Such inﬂuence and inter-
vention might be sought by simple prayers or by a
combination of prayer, ritual and sacriﬁce. The reli-
gious festival was an example of such a combination
and could include all methods of communicating
with gods and propitiating them. Devotion to the
gods was seen as regular performance of rituals,
including various forms of prayer and sacriﬁce. Piety
was deﬁned by correct performance of these rituals,
rather than by moral behavior. Most religious obser-
vance was probably performed at a local rather than
a city-state level.
Prayers
Prayers are known from ancient literature and
inscriptions. They generally followed a formula and
were highly structured, usually with three parts.
They began with an invocation of the deity, referring
to the relevant function or functions of that deity.
This was followed by reasons why the deity should
answer the prayer, often citing what the suppliant
had done for the deity in the past, such as sacriﬁces,
votive offerings and worship. The ﬁnal part of the
prayer was a particular request to the deity.
Personal prayers were usually offered at the start
of new projects, the beginning of a new day and the
beginning of the farming season. Public prayers were
offered at the start of military campaigns, athletic or
dramatic contests, and political meetings. The divi-
sion between prayers and curses could be very nar-
row; often the only difference was in what was being
requested from the deity. It was believed that gods
could provide protection and success for the living.
Prayers were not concerned with the afterlife and
tended to be requests for beneﬁts for the living, such
as success in war and love, a good harvest, good
health and fortune, wealth and children. Prayers
were often accompanied by sacriﬁce, and the gods
were expected to listen and help.
Hymns
Hymns were sung to the gods as prayers set to music,
and there were several types of hymns, including
paeans. The dithyramb was a choral hymn to Diony-
sus. For paeans and dithyrambs, see chapter 7 (LYRIC
POETRY). There were also hymns for particular occa-
sions, such as processions, and some were written to
address a particular god about a specific subject.
Singing of hymns by a trained chorus appears to have
been a common element of communal worship, and
it is likely that each sanctuary had its own set of
hymns, probably used for festivals and special events,
rather than as an act of daily worship.
Votive Offerings
PURPOSE
Votive offerings or dedications were token gifts to
the gods in gratitude for favors received and to
ensure continuing attention from the gods. Some
inscriptions give thanks for a gift or favor received,
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
370

and also constitute a prayer for similar gifts or favors
in the future. Votive offerings could be a part of what
had been requested from the god or closely con-
nected. For example, victorious soldiers often
donated some spoils captured from the enemy, and
winners of contests often dedicated part of their
prizes. Votive offerings were made to mark impor-
tant stages in life, such as births and marriages, to
give thanks for having survived disasters, such as
earthquakes and shipwrecks, and in gratitude for
recovery from illness. Surviving inscribed invento-
ries list votive offerings, giving additional informa-
tion such as value and the name of the person who
gave the offering.
TYPES OF OFFERING
A great variety of votive offerings existed. Almost
everything could be used, from seeds and grains to
massive statues, but some objects were speciﬁcally
made as votive offerings. Linear B records show that
votive offerings were made to the gods as early as the
Mycenaean period, with honey commonly offered,
as well as other foodstuffs such as oil, wine, barley
and ﬁgs.
Votive offerings reﬂected the increase in prosper-
ity from the 8th century BC. A variety of pottery con-
tainers were used (including specially made miniature
pots), probably of less importance than the offerings
of perishable foodstuffs or wine contained in them.
These pots were often ritually broken to prevent
them being taken back into everyday use after having
been given to the gods. Other types of pottery were
used as offerings, such as painted rectangular plaques
and other terra-cotta models.
Personal possessions were often dedicated to the
gods. Soldiers might dedicate arms and armor, poets
might give copies of their poems, athletes might ded-
icate athletic equipment, and women might offer
spinning and weaving equipment and mirrors. Jew-
elry was commonly offered, more to goddesses than
gods, and the size of some extremely large jewelry
indicates that it was specially manufactured for votive
offerings. Figurines in pottery and bronze were also
popular, and some religious sanctuaries had their
own manufacturing workshops. Human figurines
predominated, sometimes representing deities, but
more often representing the worshipper. Figurines
of animals such as bulls, deer, sheep and goats, were
also common. Statues were also dedicated, especially
the kore—the draped female ﬁgure. Foodstuffs and
other perishable offerings, such as ﬂowers, continued
to be dedicated, but have left no trace unless men-
tioned in surviving records. Hair was another perish-
able offering, frequently made at puberty and at
times of crisis to a river god.
A particular form of votive offering, commonly
made at healing sanctuaries in gratitude for a suc-
cessful cure, consisted of anatomical models of parts
of the body, such as hands, feet, legs, breasts, geni-
talia and heads. These represented the affﬂicted part
that had been healed. Of those that survive, the
majority are of pottery, but wood and various metals
were used as well. Also given as offerings were
images of the person cured and images of the deity
that presided over the shrine.
Most votive offerings were relatively small and
were stored within the religious sanctuary where
they had been dedicated. Thousands of offerings
could accumulate, and special buildings were often
constructed to house them. There were also larger
and more elaborate votive offerings, such as sculp-
tured reliefs dedicated to heroes, which were carved
to portray scenes from the hero’s life, scenes of ritu-
als and scenes of feasting. Another type of large
votive offering was a bronze cauldron on a tripod;
these cauldrons were everyday objects, but ones spe-
cially made for the gods were much larger and elab-
orately decorated.
Sacriﬁce
Sacrifice to the gods was a major component of
Greek religion and consisted of blood sacriﬁces, liba-
tions and other offerings. The most common word
for sacriﬁce, thusia (pl. thusiai), came to be synony-
mous with “festival” and “cult.” A sacriﬁce was a gift
to the gods, to heroes or to the dead. Sacriﬁce could
also be a private offering or a public one on behalf of
the people.
WASHING
Before any sacriﬁce took place, the sacriﬁcer needed
to be ritually cleansed, which usually took the form

of washing the hands or sprinkling with water. Hand
washing was an essential part of the ritual of animal
sacriﬁce; in Classical times a distinctive metal vessel
(khernibeion) was used for holding water for ritual
washing and is portrayed in artistic representations
of sacriﬁce. Perirrhanteria were raised stone basins
holding water for ritual washing, commonly found in
religious sanctuaries.
ANIMAL SACRIFICE
One of the most important parts of Greek religion
was the sacriﬁce of animals to gods. Abundant refer-
ences to such sacriﬁces exist in ancient literature and
inscriptions. Animal sacriﬁces were also portrayed in
art. However, relatively little evidence survives of
how such sacriﬁces were performed. Some evidence
comes from writers criticizing sacriﬁces, and so has
an inevitable bias.
Animal sacrifice formed the heart of the vast
majority of Greek religious cults. Animals selected
for sacriﬁce had to be without blemish. They com-
prised domesticated and wild animals, birds and
sometimes even ﬁsh. Generally male animals were
sacrificed to gods and female ones to goddesses.
Light-haired victims were chosen for sacrifice to
“bright” (celestial) deities, and black-haired victims
were sacriﬁced to the dead and to the gods of the
underworld, although there were many exceptions.
Animals unﬁt (or not used) for human food were sac-
riﬁced to speciﬁc deities. For example, horses were
sacriﬁced to Poseidon and dogs to Hecate.
Homer gives details of the performance of an ani-
mal sacrifice. The sacrificer ritually washed his
hands, and water was sprinkled on the victim. After a
holy silence was declared, followed by a prayer by
the officiant, unground barleycorn was sprinkled
over the victim, altar and possibly the participants.
Hair was cut from the victim’s head and burned on
the altar. The victim was then killed with a blow
from an ax, and its throat was cut—not usually by the
priest or priestess, but by a particular ofﬁcial. Blood
was collected in a bowl and splashed on the altar.
The animal was then butchered, and the portion
selected for the god was burned on the altar (appar-
ently usually thigh bones wrapped in fat—worthless
as food), while wine was simultaneously poured into
the ﬂames. The entrails were cooked separately and
tasted ﬁrst, then the remaining meat was cooked and
eaten by the participants in a sacriﬁcial feast at which
the god was regarded as an honored guest.
The sacriﬁce took place in a sacred area, where the
sacriﬁcial meat often had to be consumed, although
evidence suggests that sometimes the participants
took home portions of sacriﬁcial meat. The sacriﬁce
was accompanied by music, and in post-Homeric
times the entrails of the victim were examined for
purposes of divination. In some local cults, women
were banned from attending sacriﬁces. In puriﬁcatory
sacriﬁces and those sacriﬁces designed to propitiate
the gods, the whole animal (or other offering) was
completely destroyed. The complete burning of a sac-
riﬁce is known as a holocaust; such a ritual was usually
performed to propitiate gods of the underworld,
although in times of crisis it was offered to any deity
who was thought able to alleviate the problem. A
hecatomb (hekatombe) was literally an offering of 100
oxen, but more often referred to a great public sacri-
ﬁce, not necessarily of 100, nor of oxen.
Oath sacrifices were made to consecrate oaths.
This was effectively a magical ritual, since oath takers
made a conditional curse upon themselves that speci-
ﬁed penalties if the oath was violated. Such a sacriﬁce
is described in Homer’s Iliad, where those taking the
oath ﬁrst cut hair from the victims’ heads and invoked
the relevant gods. They then stated the terms of the
oath, cut the victims’ throat and poured libations of
wine on the ground. Finally they prayed to the gods
and buried the victims or threw them into the sea.
Although there are accounts of human sacriﬁce
in Greek mythology, no deﬁnite evidence exists for
human sacrifice, and the Greeks appear to have
regarded the practice as barbaric. People were,
though, expelled from cities as scapegoats (pharma-
koi ) during disasters such as plagues and famine.
They were chosen from the poor and ugly. There is
some evidence from Protogeometric to Classical
times of ritual slaughter at the graveside, including
the horses of the hearses; human sacriﬁce also possi-
bly took place at the graveside.
LIBATIONS
Libations (offerings of a liquid as a sacriﬁce) were
very common in honor of gods, heroes or the dead.
Liquids were poured into a container and deposited
in a sacred spot, or else poured on an altar, a rock or
the ground. A distinction was made between a sponde,

where a small part of the liquid was poured from a
drinking vessel before the rest was drunk by the wor-
shipper, and a khoe, in which all the liquid was poured
out. Spondai were particularly associated with solem-
nizing treaties and khoai with the dead. The most
common liquid for libations was wine, quite often
mixed with water (as normally drunk by the Greeks).
Water, milk, oil and honey were mainly for speciﬁc
rituals, and libations of oil, perfumes and ointments
were smeared on sacred objects. A distinctive vessel
called a phiale, usually of metal, was employed for
pouring libations and was itself a common offering at
religious sanctuaries. In the 5th century BC in
Athens, decorated ﬂasks (lethykoi) containing oil were
often deposited as grave goods and offerings.
OTHER SACRIFICIAL OFFERINGS
Apart from blood sacriﬁces of animals and libations,
various other commodities were used as offerings to
the gods. Incense, in the form of native herbs or
expensive herbs imported from the East, were burnt
on their own (as a modest sacriﬁce) or with other
offerings. Fragrant substances such as incense, resin
and spices were also burned on the altar or on bra-
ziers to neutralize the smell of burning ﬂesh, hair and
hoofs in animal sacrifices. Flowers were used as
offerings, as well as to decorate sacriﬁcial victims and
adorn participants in rituals. Branches of trees, such
as olive and laurel, were similarly used, sometimes
draped with fillets (decorative bands) of wool. All
kinds of raw and cooked foods were used as offerings
and in rituals. The panspermia (all-seeds) was an
offering of a collection of different grains, and pots
of cooked beans were deposited when an altar was set
up and used as regular offerings. Pelanos was an offer-
ing made of ﬂour mixed with liquids, and cakes in
various shapes (often animals) were given as offer-
ings. The “ﬁrst fruits” (aparchai) of the harvest from
ﬁelds and orchards were another popular offering.
The idea also applied to meals, so that part of the
meal was offered to the gods.
Divination
It was thought that gods revealed their will to people
in the form of signs or omens—portents. They were
not regarded as due to divine anger. Some might be
fairly obvious, such as natural phenomena or mean-
ingful words uttered by chance, but most signs were
less obvious and needed proper interpretation. Div-
ination was the art of reading such signs to predict
the future. The Greeks had various methods of div-
ination, which can be divided into artiﬁcial and nat-
ural divination.
ARTIFICIAL DIVINATION
Artiﬁcial divination was based on external observa-
tion of animals, plants, objects or phenomena, and
on the observation of the entrails of sacriﬁced ani-
mals. Augury was divination by the observation of
the behavior of birds, and was one of the most
ancient and common methods of divination. Gener-
ally augury was performed by recognized augurs, but
many aspects of augury were well known; for exam-
ple, a bird appearing from the right during observa-
tion of the augur was taken as a good omen, but a
bird from the left was a bad omen, as was a crow set-
tling on a half-built house. Lecanomancy was divina-
tion by looking into water (usually in a bowl or basin)
in the hope of seeing future events, and took place at
some oracles. Cleromancy was divination by lots, and
both the drawing of lots and throwing of dice were
used to predict the future. Divination by cleromancy,
regarded as an inferior method, was apparently
sometimes available as a cheaper option at some ora-
cles for those who could not afford to consult the
oracle proper. Divination by the examination of the
entrails of sacriﬁced animals was practiced but was
not particularly common. The observation of
metereological and astronomical phenomena was
frequently carried out, such as lightning and eclipses.
NATURAL DIVINATION
Natural divination included the interpretation of
dreams, either by the dreamer or by a professional
interpreter. The rite of incubation was the process of
sleeping in a sacred place in the hope of receiving
guidance from a god in a dream. This method was
often used to obtain guidance on how to cure a par-
ticular affliction and was commonly employed at
healing sanctuaries. Necromancy, divination by com-
munication with the dead, was practiced, particularly
at the tomb of the deceased, where their ghost was
believed to inhabit the tomb. Necromancy possibly

I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E

took place by means of incubation: seeking the dead
in dreams by sleeping at the tomb. Cledomancy was
divination by the interpretation of chance remarks
or sayings. A very important method of divination
was prophecy. Prophets were thought, at certain
times, to be possessed by a deity, so that the deity
could speak through the mouth of the prophet.
Sometimes the power of prophecy was considered to
reside in a particular place, where oracles would be
established: the deity might speak through a succes-
sion of prophets or seers over many generations.
ORACLES
Oracles were a form of natural divination in which a
god gave a response to a question by a worshipper. It
was the most prestigious method of divination, and
oracular shrines were scattered across the Greek
world. The deity at such shrines (often Apollo) was
usually approached through the medium of a priest
or priestess; inspired by the god, the medium gave
advice to the person consulting the oracle. There
were different ways in which the priest or priestess
delivering the oracle achieved the state of inspiration
(often a trance) to receive and deliver the words of
the deity. For example, the elderly woman Pythia at
Delphi sat on a tripod with a laurel twig in her right
hand and a bowl in her left. Unless the bowl con-
tained a drug or a substance giving off intoxicating
fumes, it is difﬁcult to understand how her apparent
trance was achieved. In some cases the prophet at an
oracle drank holy water before prophesying.
The term “oracle” has come to be used both for
the response of the deity and the shrine at which the
deity was consulted. Oracles were consulted on per-
sonal, religious and political matters by men and
women, both rich and poor, by slaves and by delega-
tions from groups and communities. Each oracle

made certain demands on those consulting it (usually
sacriﬁces and rituals of puriﬁcation); each also had its
own rituals to be performed by the priests or priest-
esses at the oracle as well as by the worshippers.
Records also existed of oracular sayings by prophets
and prophetesses (some possibly mythological rather
than real people), which were thought to predict the
future.
The most famous oracle was that of Pythian
Apollo at Delphi (fig. 8.33). Here the responses of
the god were given by an elected and elderly priest-
ess with the title Pythia. Despite its mountainous
location, Delphi was easily accessible by sea and
attracted enquiries from beyond the Greek world.
It continued to be consulted well into the Roman
period. Other oracles of the god Apollo included
Delos, Corope (Thessaly), Abae, Tegyra, Thebes
and Mount Ptoon in Boeotia, and Clarus, Gry-
neum, Patara and Branchidae (Didyma) in Asia
Minor.
An oracle of Zeus was at Dodona in northwest
Greece, and one of Zeus Ammon was at the oasis of
Siwa in north Africa. Gaia had oracles at Olympia
and at Agae near Corinth, Dionysus had ones in
Thrace and at Amphicleia in Phocis, and there was
an oracle of Hermes at Pharae in Achaea. Other gods
also had oracles, as did some heroes, the most famous
being that of the hero Trophonius at Lebadea.
Healing Sanctuaries 
and Shrines
There were particular kinds of oracular shrines that
people visited in order to consult the deity about cur-
ing ailments. The most common method of consult-
ing a deity at a healing shrine was by incubation.
After various rituals, such as sacrifices and ritual
puriﬁcation, the person seeking a cure slept at the

shrine (often in a special dormitory, the abaton), in
the hope that the deity would heal them or give
instructions in a dream that would lead to their cure.
At some healing sanctuaries people may have been
given drugs or herbs before they slept to increase the
possibility of dreams. Ofﬁcial interpreters of dreams
were often present at these sanctuaries. Such ofﬁcial
interpretations might include the prescription of
drugs, a special diet and/or a regime of bathing and
exercise, so that there could be a degree of overlap
between religious healing and that attempted by
physicians.
Those cured of ailments left votive offerings to
the deity, which sometimes took the form of a model
of the afﬂicted part of the anatomy. People could also
visit such sanctuaries in order to preserve good
health. The main deity associated with healing in the
Archaic and Classical periods was Apollo, but from
the 5th century BC he was gradually replaced in
importance by his son, Asclepius. Most healing sanc-
tuaries were dedicated to Asclepius (called Asclepieia:
ﬁg. 8.34), the most famous being the Asclepieion of
Epidaurus (ﬁg. 6.10). There were other well-known
healing centers, such as the sanctuary of Amphiaraus
at Oropus in Boeotia. Other deities, such as Ino,
Demeter, Apollo Paeon, Athena Hygieia and Isis,
were believed to possess healing powers. Despite
their specialization in healing, such sanctuaries were
still religious sites, and worship of the deity took
place there as at other sacred places.
FESTIVALS
Type and Number of Festivals
Religious festivals varied in importance, size and
popularity, and present knowledge of festivals is
uneven: there is more surviving evidence about Pan-
hellenic and Athenian festivals than others. The Pan-
hellenic festivals were great interstate events that
attracted people from all parts of the Greek world.
Many pilgrims, some official and some private,
would make their way across the Greek world to par-
ticular festivals, and women are known to have trav-
elled to some of the festivals. Local festivals were
organized and celebrated on a city-state, deme or
even village basis, and their signiﬁcance was gener-
ally limited to the area in which they were held. Most
Panhellenic festivals were celebrated at only one cen-
ter, but a few were celebrated at several places. The
Thesmophoria, for example, was celebrated in at
least 30 cities throughout the Greek world.
Each festival had its own events and rituals, but
common elements included a formal procession to
the shrine of a deity (with ritual stops along the way),
decorating wooden objects symbolizing the deity,
singing of hymns by choirs, athletic, music and
drama contests, and the sacrifice of an animal in
front of the shrine of the deity.
The number of festivals celebrated during the year
was probably quite high. In Athens, for which infor-
mation is relatively complete, it has been estimated
that just under half the days in each year were festival
days. However, the boule remained in session on all
except the annual festival days, although the Assembly
did not meet on monthly festival days. It is assumed
that most citizens conducted their normal business on
most festival days, and that much the same schedule
for festivals existed elsewhere in Greece. Some festi-
vals were celebrated only by women, with men strictly
excluded, and the purpose of these festivals was to
ensure agricultural fertility. Women were themselves
often prohibited from attending festivals, such as the
Olympic Games at Athens, though virgins (parthenoi)
could be an exception.
Panhellenic Festivals
The Panhellenic festivals (Panhellenic Games) com-
prised four events recognized as national Greek fes-
tivals: Olympic Games, Pythian Games, Isthmian
Games and Nemean Games. These games took place
at different intervals within a four-year cycle. Each
four-year period was known as an Olympiad. Within
an Olympiad the games were held in the following
sequence: Olympic, Nemean, Isthmian, Pythian,
Nemean and Isthmian Games. Thus it was possible
to compete in each of the four games in the course of
25 months, rather than four years. The four games
were known as the circuit (periodos), and a winner of
all four games was known as a circuit victor (peri-
odonikes). There is a small amount of evidence, some
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E

inconclusive, for women and girls participating in
athletic races at festivals. See also chapter 9, ENTER-
TAINMENT, for the chariot races and athletics of
these festivals.
OLYMPIC GAMES
Traditionally these games were thought to have been
founded in 776 BC. Originally a local festival held at
Olympia, the Olympic Games became a Pelopon-
nesian and eventually a national event. The festival
took place once every four years, and the four-year
interval was known as an Olympiad (later used as a
dating system). The games were in honor of
Olympian Zeus, and myths surrounded the origins of
the games, including Zeus being the founder. Origi-
nally they lasted only one day and consisted of run-
ning and wrestling contests. Later horse and chariot
races were included, but the foot race of one length of
the stadium (ﬁg. 8.35) remained the principal event.
Other contests were added, and the games then took
place over ﬁve days. The ﬁrst day was for sacriﬁces
and festivities, while judges and competitors took
oaths of fair dealing. There were then athletic contests
for boys (paides) and men (andres). The second day
had horse and chariot races and the men’s pentathlon.
A mule cart race was introduced, but was discontinued
after a few decades. Boys’ contests took place on the
third day, and men’s running, jumping, wrestling, box-
ing and pankration (“all ﬁght”) contests occupied the

fourth day, with the last event being the race for men
in armor. The ﬁnal day was for sacriﬁces, and in the
evening a banquet was held for the winners. The
prizes were wreaths of wild olive from a tree growing
in the sanctuary of Zeus. The games were abolished
by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in AD 393.
PYTHIAN GAMES
These took place at Delphi in honor of Apollo. From
very early times there was a musical festival here.
Originally held every eight years, it was connected
with the oracle of Apollo. In 582 BC the festival was
reorganized and was then celebrated every four years,
in the third year of each Olympiad. From that time
both music and athletic contests took place. The ath-
letic contests were modeled on those at Olympia, and
there were competitions in singing, instrumental
music, drama, and verse and prose recitation. The
prize was a crown of bay leaves cut from the valley of
Tempe.
ISTHMIAN GAMES
These were celebrated on the Isthmus of Corinth in
honor of Poseidon. There was probably an ancient
local festival on the Isthmus, but the Panhellenic fes-
tival dated from 581 BC and was held every two years,
in the ﬁrst and third years of each Olympiad. The
games consisted of various athletic contests, and the
prize was a wreath of pine, up to the early 5th cen-
tury, and then dry celery (differentiating it from the
crown of fresh celery awarded at Nemea). From the
2nd century BC the wreaths were a mixture of pine
and dry celery.
NEMEAN GAMES
These were held in honor of Zeus in the sanctuary of
Zeus at Nemea in Argolis. According to tradition,
the games had been founded either by Heracles after
killing the Nemean Lion, or by the Seven Against
Thebes to commemorate the death of the Opheltes
(infant son of Lycurgus). The Panhellenic festival
dated from 573 BC and was held every two years in
the second and fourth years of each Olympiad. The
games consisted of athletic contests, with a greater
number of boys’ events than at Olympia. The prize
was a crown of fresh wild celery (differentiating it
from the wreath of dry celery awarded at the Isth-
mian Games).
Athenian and 
Attic Festivals
The calendar of festivals and religious sacriﬁces in
Athens and Attica is the only one that can be recon-
structed in any detail. Apart from the annual festivals
there were a number of days in the ﬁrst part of each
month on which monthly festivals took place. The
ﬁrst day of the month was new moon day (noumenia),
recognized as a holy day throughout the Greek
world. It was so holy that at Athens no other festival
ever took place that day. It was celebrated by a pub-
lic ritual on the Acropolis and by private offerings of
frankincense to statues of the gods.
The second day of the month was sacred to the
Agathos Daimon. The third day of the month was
the birthday of Athena; it may also have been sacred
to the three Graces. The fourth day of the month
was the birthday of Heracles, Hermes and
Aphrodite, and was also sacred to Eros. The ﬁfth day
of the month was the birthday of Artemis, recog-
nized throughout Greece. The seventh day of the
month was Apollo’s birthday, which was celebrated
widely in the Greek world, and at Athens no other
festival was held on this day. The eighth day of the
month was sacred to Poseidon.
The main annual festivals and some annual sacri-
ﬁces in Athens and Attica are listed below, under the
names of the months of the Athenian calendar dur-
ing which they took place. The presence of women
at many of these festivals is disputed. For the calen-
dar, see chapter 10.
HEKATOMBAION (MONTH OF)
12th day:
Festival in honor of Cronus (Kronia). Also
a sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to Kouro-
trophos and Artemis.
16th day:
Synoecia (Synoikia), a celebration of the
coming together of the peoples of Attica. It
appears to have been an annual sacriﬁce, although
sometimes recorded as biennial. The sacriﬁce was
not accompanied by public meetings.

17th and 18th days:
A private celebration by
Orgeones, a general term used mainly in Attica for
a religious organization or group of worshippers,
irrespective of what deities were worshipped.
28th day:
Panathenaea (Panathenaia), a major festi-
val “for all Athens” that appears to have been cel-
ebrated at Athens on a varying number of days
between the 23rd and 30th days of Hekatom-
baion, with the main celebration on the 28th. The
festival was in honor of the birth of the goddess
Athena, and the focal point was the presentation
of a new robe (peplos) to the goddess. This robe
was set up on a mast on a cart in the form of a
ship. It was carried in a religious procession to the
temple of Athena on the Acropolis. This proces-
sion (pompe) was depicted on the frieze of the Par-
thenon temple (Elgin Marbles) now in the British
Museum. There were numerous animal sacriﬁces,
which were subject to complex regulations. The
parts of the meat not offered to Athena were dis-
tributed to the people in the Kerameikos district.
Every fourth year a much larger celebration took
place called the Great Panathenaea (Panathenaic
Games), which included horse racing, chariot racing
(ﬁg. 8.36) and a regatta; on the other three years the
festival was known as the Lesser Panathenaea.
METAGEITNION (MONTH OF)
15th–18th days:
Eleusinia, a festival of games cele-
brated at Eleusis (not the celebration of the
Eleusinian Mysteries). The Eleusinia took place
on four days between the 13th and 20th days of
Metageitnion (probably 15th–18th). This festi-
val was celebrated on the fourth year of every
Olympiad and, on a lesser scale, every second
year of the Olympiad. The festival included a
religious procession and sacrifices, as well as the
games. The winner’s prize was a quantity of
grain.
16th day:
A sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to
Kourotrophos, Hecate and Artemis.
19th day:
A sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to
“the Heroines.”
20th day:
A sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to
Hera Thelchinia.
25th day:
A sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to
Zeus Epoptes.
BOEDROMION (MONTH OF)
The major celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries
(the Greater Mysteries) was held in this month. See
also ORIENTAL AND MYSTERY RELIGIONS (p. 383).

4th day:
A sacrifice by the Attic deme Erchia to

5th day:
Genesia, a public festival for the dead.
There was also a sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia
to Epops. The sacriﬁce was a holocaust without
wine and may have been connected with the festi-
val of Genesia.
6th day:
A festival in honor of Artemis Agrotera.
12th day:
Democratia, a festival in honor of democ-
racy, established after the restoration of democ-
racy in Athens in 403 BC following the rule of the
Thirty Tyrants. It probably took place on the
12th day of this month.
17th or 18th day:
Epidauria, a festival in honor of
Asclepius.
27th day:
A sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to the
Nymphs, Achelous, Alochus, Hermes and Gaia.
Also a sacrifice by the Attic deme Teithras to
Athene.
PYANOPSION (MONTH OF)
6th (?) day:
Proerosia, an agricultural festival, liter-
ally “the preliminary to the plowing.” It involved
an offering of ﬁrst fruits in gratitude for deliver-
ance from a legendary plague. There is doubt as
to whether it was an ofﬁcial festival of the Athen-
ian state.
7th day:
Pyanopsia, a festival celebrated at Athens
in honor of Apollo and probably once a wide-
spread festival as the name of the month Pyanop-
sion was common. The festival’s name means
“bean-boiling,” and the festival included dedicat-
ing and eating beans and cereals. Its origin was
believed to be the homecoming of Theseus.
8th day:
Theseia, a festival in honor of Theseus.
8th (?) day:
Oschophoria (Oskhophoria), a festival of
the vintage. The main ritual was a procession car-
rying vine branches with clusters of grapes from the
shrine of Dionysus at Athens to the shrine of
Athena Sciras at Phalerum. The branches were
carried by two young men dressed in female robes,
followed by a choir singing hymns. Its origin was
believed to be the homecoming of Theseus.
9th day:
Stenia, a women’s festival at Athens in
honor of Demeter and Persephone. It was cele-
brated by sacriﬁce and a ritual exchange of verbal
abuse. Its exact purpose is uncertain. It was over-
shadowed by the festival of Thesmophoria.
11th–13th days:
Thesmophoria, a three-day festival
in honor of Demeter, celebrated not only in
Athens, but also virtually everywhere in the
Greek world. It was a women’s festival from
which men were excluded. At Athens it took
place on the 11th to 13th days of Pyanopsion,
and the celebration ceremonies were a mystery
known only to the participants. For three days
the women took over the Pnyx. On the ﬁrst day
shelters with couches of plants were specially
erected for participants (married women) to
camp in. The second was a fast day (Nesteia),
ending in a ritual exchange of verbal abuse. The
third day was known as Calligeneia (day of ﬁne
offspring), but the rituals that took place are
unknown. The main focus of the festival seems to
have been the retrieval of the remains of rotting
piglets and other fertility symbols that had been
thrown into pits or caves earlier in the year,
probably during the festival of Scirophoria.
These remains were laid on an altar, mixed with
grain seed and later buried. The festival appears
to have been a fertility ritual to ensure the suc-
cess of the cereal crops sown in the autumn. The
play Thesmophoriazusae (women celebrating the
Thesmophoria) by Aristophanes is a parody of
this festival.
14th day:
A sacriﬁce by the Attic deme Erchia to
“the Heroines.”
19th–21st or 26th–28th days:
Apaturia (Apatouria,
probably meaning the festival of common father-
hood), a three-day festival of the phratries. Sacri-
fices were made to Zeus Phratrios and Athena
Phratria. The three days of the festival were
called Dorpia (Supper), Anarrhyrsis (Sacrifice)
and Cureotis (Day of the Youths). On the last day
(Cureotis) children, young adult men and newly
married wives were enrolled in the phratries.
30th day:
Chalceia (Khalkeia), a festival in honor of
Athena in her role as mistress of technology, and
in honor of Hephaestus, god of the smiths. Dur-
ing this festival the loom was set up for weaving
the robe presented to Athena in the Panathenaea
festival.
MAIMAKTERION (MONTH OF)
Pompaia was a festival that took place some time
during this month. A sheepskin from a sacriﬁce to

Zeus was carried in procession along with the staff of
Hermes, possibly to avert evil at the onset of winter.
POSEIDEON (MONTH OF)
The Rural Dionysia (or Rustic Dionysia) took place
this month. The name Dionysia was given to any
festival in honor of Dionysus at which dramatic per-
formances took place. Because the dramatic perfor-
mances became very popular, such festivals rapidly
spread from Athens where this type of festival
appears to have originated. Two Dionysia were cele-
brated at Athens, the lesser one being the Rural
Dionysia. In addition to dramatic performances and
the sacriﬁce of a goat, fruit in a basket and a ceremo-
nial phallus were carried in procession. See also
ELAPHEBOLION (below).
5th day:
Plerosia, a festival celebrated by the Attic
deme Myrrhinus.
16th day:
A sacriﬁce to Zeus Horios by the Attic
deme Erchia.
19th day:
A private sacrifice to the wind gods is
recorded for this day. A meeting of the Attic deme
Myrrhinus on matters concerned with Dionysus
also took place.
26th day:
Haloa, a fertility festival in honor of
Dionysus and Demeter that was celebrated by
women and was characterized by phallic repre-
sentations.
GAMELION (MONTH OF)
8th day:
A sacriﬁce to Apollo Apotropaeus, Apollo
Nymphegetes and the Nymphs by the Attic deme
Erchia.
9th day:
A sacrifice to Athena by the Attic deme
Erchia.
12th day:
Lenaea, a festival in honor of Dionysus. It
took place on the 12th but appears to have lasted
at least four days. Among the Ionian Greeks the
festival gave its name to the month, which was
Lanaeon in their calendar. Little is known about
the rituals of the festival, but there were dramatic
performances and a procession. From about 440
BC drama competitions took place in which com-
edy seems to have been particularly important.
27th day:
Theogamia, a festival celebrating the
sacred marriage between Hera and Zeus, also
called the Gamelia, may have taken place on this
day. Also on this day there was a sacrifice to
Kourotrophos, Hera, Zeus Teleius and Poseidon
by the Attic deme Erchia. This may have been
connected with the Theogamia festival.
ANTHESTERION (MONTH OF)
2nd day:
A sacriﬁce to Dionysus by the Attic deme
Erchia.
11th–13th days:
Anthesteria, a festival in honor of
Dionysus, involving ﬂowers, wine and spirits of the
dead, from which the month Anthesterion took its
name. At Athens it was celebrated on the 11th to
13th of this month and was probably the most pop-
ular Athenian festival. It was also widely celebrated
among Ionian Greeks. Children took part in the
festival and three-year old children were garlanded
with ﬂowers. The ﬁrst day was the Pithoigia
(Opening of the Jars), when the new wine was
tasted and offered at the shrine of Dionysus. The
second day, called Choes (Wine Jugs), saw much
drinking and a procession in which Dionysus (per-
haps an image or a masked actor) was carried in a
cart in the form of a ship with wheels. Dionysus
was then united in a sacred marriage with the wife
of the archon basileus. The third day was called
Chytrai (Pots), because pots containing a mixture
of boiled vegetables were offered to Hermes
Chthonios (Hermes of the underworld) to placate
the hostility of the dead. It was a day of ill-omen,
when spirits of the dead were thought to roam the
city. At the end of the day they were banished with
the cry “away, dread spirits; Anthesteria is over.”
20th–26th days:
A smaller festival (Lesser Myster-
ies), in preparation for the Eleusinian Mysteries,
was held at Agrae, a suburb of Athens, probably
between the 20th and 26th of this month.
23rd day: Diasia, a festival in honor of Zeus Meilichios.
ELAPHEBOLION (MONTH OF)
10th–17th days:
City Dionysia (or Great Dionysia),
an important festival in honor of Dionysus. The
festival lasted ﬁve days, and appears to have taken
place between the 10th and 17th of this month,
although the precise events are uncertain. It was
celebrated from at least 534 BC, when Peisistra-
tus brought the cult to Athens from Eleutherae

(a village on the Attica-Boeotia border). Just
before each festival the image of Dionysus was
removed to a temple outside Athens on the road
to Eleutherae, so that a procession carrying the
image could reenact the god’s original arrival
from Eleutherae. The procession was performed
with a great deal of pomp, and images of phalli
were carried in the god’s honor. The god’s image
was then placed in the old temple of Dionysus
within the theater precinct, and sacrifices and
libations were offered. Then the god’s image was
carried to the theater and was present for the
performance of the comedies, tragedies, satyr
plays and dithyrambic competitions. It was the
most important festival for performing new
tragedies, comedies and satyr plays.
15th day:
A private sacriﬁce to Cronus.
17th day:
Pandia, a festival in honor of Zeus about
which little is known.
MOUNICHION (MONTH OF)
16th day:
Munichia (Mounikhia), a festival in honor
of Artemis. It involved special cakes with candles
said to be moon symbols, and a sacriﬁce of a she-
goat dressed as a girl.
17th day:
The religious association of the Thiasotai
is recorded as meeting on this day.
18th day:
The religious association of the Eranistai
is recorded as meeting on this day.
19th day:
Olympieia, a festival in honor of Olympian
Zeus. It was instituted by Peisistratus and was asso-
ciated with the inauguration of the temple of
Olympian Zeus at Athens, which was not com-
pleted until Roman times. The festival included a
procession of cavalry.
20th day:
A sacriﬁce to Leucaspis by the Attic deme
Erchia.
21st day:
A sacriﬁce to the Tritopatores by the Attic
deme Erchia.
THARGELION (MONTH OF)
4th day:
A sacriﬁce to Leto, Pythian Apollo, Zeus,
Hermes and the Dioscuri by the Attic deme Erchia.
7th day:
Thargelia, a festival in honor of Apollo.
16th day:
A sacriﬁce to Zeus Epacrios by the Attic
deme Erchia.
19th day:
A festival of the Thracian goddess Bendis
(Bendideia). It included an all-night festival with a
torch race on horseback. Also a sacrifice to
Menedeius by the Attic deme Erchia.
24th day:
Spring-cleaning of the temple of Athena
probably took place on the 24th day. It was
known as the Callynteria.
25th day:
Festival of Washing (Plynteria), during
which the image of Athena, and possibly her robe,
was ceremonially washed. It was regarded as a
dangerous day, because the goddess was preoccu-
pied and might not afford her usual degree of
protection.
SKIROPHORION (MONTH OF)
3rd day:
Arrephoria (or Arrhetophoria), a festival at
Athens in honor of Athena, in which two or four
girls performed a rite.
3rd day:
A sacrifice to Kourotrophos, Athena
Polias, Aglaurus, Zeus Polieus, Poseidon and pos-
sibly to Pandrosus by the Attic deme Erchia.
Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus were both “pro-
tectors of the city.”
12th day:
Scira (Skira or Skiraphoria), a predomi-
nantly, but not exclusively, women’s festival. It
started with a procession that included the priestess
of Athena, priest of Poseidon and possibly the priest
of Apollo, all under a large parasol. It went from the
Acropolis at Athens to Skiron near the Kephissos
river. The festival included a women’s fertility ritual
in honor of Demeter. The Tritopatores were wor-
shipped at Marathon on the eve of this festival.
14th day:
Bouphonia (also known as Dipolieia), a
festival in honor of Zeus Polieus. It included a
strange ritual. Barley and wheat were placed on
an altar, and when the sacriﬁcial bull moved to
eat the grain, a priest killed the bull, threw down
the poleax and ﬂed. The poleax was then formally
tried for murder.
Other Festivals
ASCLEPIEIA
Festivals in honor of Asclepius, held at various sanc-
tuaries (also called Asclepieia) of the god. A major
festival of this kind took place at Epidaurus every

four years, nine days after the Isthmian Games (Great
Asclepieia). At Epidaurus the worshippers were ritu-
ally cleansed before entering the sanctuary, and a
series of rituals preceded games and musical contests
in honor of Asclepius. The festival culminated in a
sacriﬁce to Asclepius, followed by a banquet.
GYMNOPAEDIA (GYMNOPAIDIAI )
“Festival of the naked youths” at Sparta, but possibly
meaning “Festival of Unarmed Dancing”. It was estab-
lished as an annual festival soon after the crushing
defeat of Sparta by Argos at the battle of Hysiae in 669
BC. It was held in July in the hottest part of the year
and lasted several days, during which there were gym-
nastic displays and dancing by boys and men. Hymns
were sung in honor of the gods and Spartan heroes.
CARNEA (KARNEIA)
A festival celebrated by Sparta and other Doric states
in the month of Karneios (August–September),
which derived its name from the festival. It was held
in honor of Apollo, but it may have originally been in
honor of a more ancient, unknown god, perhaps with
the name Karnos or Karneis. In part it reflected
Sparta’s military life, and a meal was taken in shelters
in a military fashion, but there were rural aspects to
the celebration as well, including a race between
boys carrying bunches of grapes. There were other
races, as well as a musical contest that drew musi-
cians and poets from all parts of the Greek world.
HERAEA
A festival in honor of Hera at Argos, held every fourth
year. In a procession to the Heraeum the priestess of
Hera rode in a chariot drawn by oxen. There was a
hecatomb, and athletic contests took place in the sta-
dium near the temple of Hera, with a bronze shield as
the prize. There were races for women, though these
seem to have been restricted to parthenoi (virgins) and
were possibly a rite preceding marriage.
DAIDALA
A festival in honor of Hera, celebrated in Boeotia
every 59 years. Daidala (intricately worked things)
were wooden images. One was dressed as a bride and
carried in procession to the top of Mount Cithaeron.
Here a sacriﬁce was performed, and several daidala
were burned in a great bonfire. According to the
myth that explained this curious festival, Zeus and
Hera quarreled, and Hera hid on Mount Cithaeron.
Zeus therefore dressed a doll as a bride, which he
said he was going to marry. Hera rushed out to attack
her rival but, realizing the trick, was reconciled with
Zeus, and the doll was burned.
ELEUTHERIA
A festival celebrated at Plataea every four years in
thanksgiving for the Greek defeat of the Persians in
the battle of Plataea (479 BC).
LYCAEA
A festival in honor of Zeus, celebrated at Mount
Lycaeus.
HYACINTHIA
A festival held over three days celebrated at Sparta in
honor of Apollo and his male lover Hyacinthus. The
ﬁrst half of the festival was a solemn event, with no
garlands worn or hymns sung and only extremely
plain food being eaten. Halfway through the festival,
a hymn was sung, the nature of the festival changed to
one of celebration, and a large procession occurred.
ORIENTAL AND
MYSTERY RELIGIONS
Many foreign cults were absorbed into Greek reli-
gion by the process of identifying foreign gods with
existing Greek ones. However, some foreign cults
were adopted rather than absorbed, usually because
their cults offered the worshipper more than the
existing Greek cults. Generally these foreign cults
were partly or wholly mystery religions, which had
secrets (mysteries—mysteria) that were revealed only
to initiates (mystai, sing. mystes, who were ﬁrst-time
R E L I G I O N
A N D M Y T H O L O G Y
383

initiates, from the verb “to close [the eyes]”). Their
teachings were supposed to illuminate the mystery of
achieving immortality; the teachings themselves
were kept as a mystery, to which the faithful were
initiated. The following year, an initiate seems to
have been called an epoptes (pl. epoptai), “viewer.”
There were also numerous minor mystery cults
existing in Greece itself, with a few major ones. Mys-
tery religions involved participation by the individ-
ual, unlike worship of traditional Greek gods. They
involved initiation rites, puriﬁcation, sacred symbols,
sacred rites and a promise of a happy afterlife.
Because so much of a mystery religion was kept
secret, modern knowledge of the beliefs and rituals
of these religions is far from complete.
Eleusinian Mysteries
The Eleusinian Mysteries, open to Athenians and
non-Athenians, both freeborn and slave, were
claimed to guarantee initiates a happy afterlife. The
cult was celebrated each year at Athens in the month
Boedromion (September) at the time of sowing,
when every participant bathed in the sea for puriﬁca-
tion and sacrificed a piglet. Then the sacred and
secret objects (hiera) which had been brought from
Eleusis to Athens a few days previously and stored in
the Eleusinion (a temple below the Acropolis at
Athens), were taken back the 14 miles (22.5 km) to
Eleusis accompanied by a great procession of initi-
ates. At a certain place on the procession route,
obscenities were shouted as a reenactment of the
abusive joking of a mythical woman (called Iambe),
who was supposed to have made Demeter smile. The
shout of Iakch’ o Iakche was raised regularly during
the procession, and was usually regarded as referring
to Iacchus (an obscure deity, sometimes identified
with Dionysus or said to be a son of Demeter or
Persephone). The ritual was supposed to represent
the myth of Demeter and Persephone and the sym-
bolic death and rebirth of the grain (corn) seed. On
the following day the initiates fasted (as Demeter
fasted when mourning the loss of Persephone). They
broke their fast with a special drink of barley water
ﬂavored with pennyroyal (called kykeon). The culmi-
nation of the festival took place in the telesterion (ini-
tiation hall) at Eleusis (fig. 8.37), where a priest
showed the sacred objects to the initiated. The cult
was open to both Athenians and non-Athenians and
appears to have existed for more than 1,000 years,
from at least the early 6th century BC, until it was
suppressed by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in
AD 393.
Mysteries of the Cabiri
The cult of the Cabiri (Kabeiroi) was centered on
Samothrace. The Cabiri were deities of fertility and
of protection for sailors, probably originally Phrygian
deities. Different traditions recorded different num-
bers of Cabiri. One tradition recorded four Cabiri
and named them as Axierus, Axiocersa, Axiocersus
and Cadmilus. The Cabiri were part of a mystery
cult; probably because of this they were not usually
individually named and were generally referred to as
the “great gods.” In the Hellenistic period the cult
spread rapidly throughout the Greek world. The
Cabiri were often confused with the Dioscuri, who
also had the function of protecting sailors. This con-
fusion was helped by the fact that the Cabiri came to
be portrayed in art as a pair of gods: an old, reclining,
bearded one, and a younger, standing one. Later they
were depicted as a pair of youths almost indistin-
guishable from portrayals of the Dioscuri.
Mysteries of Dionysus
These mysteries were the rites (orgia) of the worship
of Dionysus. The cult appears to have originated in
Asia Minor, or possibly Thrace, and spread rapidly
throughout Greece from Thrace. The orgia do not
appear to have been associated with specific cult
sites, but were performed wherever there was a
group of worshippers. Adherents to this cult were
mainly women and were called Maenads (mad
women). Inspired by Dionysus they surrendered to
an ecstatic frenzy in order to achieve a sense of free-
dom and wellbeing; this appears to have been at the
heart of these mysteries, although there were also
promises of an afterlife.
The Maenads were believed to roam mountains
with music and dancing, performing supernatural
feats of strength, such as uprooting trees and catch-
H A N D B O O K
T O L I F E
I N A N C I E N T G R E E C E
384

ing and tearing apart wild animals, sometimes eating
the ﬂesh raw. Maenads were often depicted wearing
the skins of fawns or panthers, with wreaths of ivy,
oak or ﬁr, and carrying a thyrsos (wand wreathed in
ivy and vine leaves and topped with a pine cone).
This aspect of the religion symbolized the triumph
of unfettered nature over man-made order. Less wild
forms of the worship of Dionysus, similar to worship
offered to other Greek gods, took place at shrines
and temples dedicated to Dionysus and at festivals in
his honor. See also DIONYSUS (pp. 328–329).
Orphic Mysteries
From about the 6th century BC there are indications
of mystery cults associated with Orpheus (see p. 349),
but it is doubtful whether there was ever a uniﬁed
cult that could be called “Orphism.” The Derveni
papyrus, an ancient book of the late 4th century BC
found at Derveni in Macedonia, gives a commentary
on an Orphic religious poem. It indicates that good
and evil in human nature were explained by the myth
of Dionysus Zagreus (which involved death and res-
urrection, and punishment of the wicked). Men were
regarded as bearing the guilt of the death of Dionysus
Zagreus and had to pay a penalty to Persephone after
death before rising to a higher existence. This Greek
myth was different in having as its central doctrine
the punishment of individuals after death.
The Orphic cult also recognized reincarnation.
After three virtuous lives as deﬁned by Orphic doc-
trine, individuals were supposed to dwell in the Isles
of the Blessed forever. The mysteries continued to
have a following into the Roman period, but the high
ethical tone and ascetic practices of some adherents

were worshipped.

of Orpheus in Greece later became debased and
ridiculed. There appear to have been some links
between the Orphic Mysteries and the mythology of
Dionysus, but some hostility evidently existed
between the adherents of Orpheus and those of
Dionysus.
Cult of Isis and Sarapis
Isis was an Egyptian mother goddess whose son
Horus (usually called Harpocrates in the Greek world)
is an heroic ﬁgure who avenged the death of his father
Osiris (usually known to the Greeks as Sarapis). Their
worship was virtually a mystery religion. The triad of
Isis, Harpocrates and Sarapis represented the power of
creation. The cult of Isis involved initiation cere-
monies, baptism and service, and processions of music
and dance designed to arouse religious fervor. It also
promised eventual salvation. See also HARPOCRATES
(pp. 332–333), ISIS (p.341), SARAPIS (p. 356).
Judaism
Judaism was originally an ancient monotheistic Ori-
ental mystery religion of Judaea and Babylonia. Of all
religions in the ancient world before Christianity,
Judaism was exclusive in insisting on the worship of
only one God (Yahweh), based on the temple at
Jerusalem. The Jews built their second temple at
Jerusalem when the Persian king Cyrus allowed them
to return there from exile in Babylon. It was dedi-
cated in 516 BC, and Judaism was centered on this
temple, whose high priest and priests ruled Judaea
and collected taxes. In 167 BC under the reign of
Antiochus IV, it was rededicated to Olympian Zeus,
but after the Maccabean Revolt it was reconsecrated
to Yahweh in 164 BC. Herod the Great replaced this
small temple with a massive third temple; the build-
ing work took place from 19 BC and was largely com-
pleted by 9 BC. It was destroyed by Titus during the
Jewish revolt against Roman rule in AD 70.
Jews regarded their God as the one and only cre-
ator of all things and the giver of natural and moral
law. They also regarded the Jewish nation as the peo-
ple especially chosen by God to receive his revelation
and to play the central role in human salvation.
Judaism was not exclusive to the Jewish nation, since
non-Jews could convert to the religion, but no active
missionary work took place to encourage such con-
versions. Judaea was under Persian domination from
538 to 332 BC, when it became part of the empire of
Alexander the Great. From that time it continued to
be inﬂuenced by the Greeks until after it came under
Roman control in 37 BC.
In the early years of Greek rule, Jews were
encouraged to settle in the newly founded cities of
Alexander the Great’s empire; this greatly increased
the dispersion (diaspora) of Jews, which had begun as
early as 587 BC when Nebuchadnezzar sacked Jeru-
salem and captured the inhabitants. Settlement in
the new Hellenistic cities spread Jews and the Jewish
religion throughout the entire Greek world—some
forcibly resettled, some voluntarily. Jewish commu-
nities were organized in ofﬁcially recognized corpo-
rations (politeumata), as were other minority groups.
This gave Jews the freedom to live under their own
laws and privileges such as exemption from worship
of rulers and pagan gods, and freedom to keep the
Sabbath as a day of rest. In return Jews were gener-
ally loyal to their foreign rulers. Many synagogues
were built.
MAGIC AND
SUPERSTITION
Superstition is the irrational fear of the unknown
allied to a false idea of the causes of events. Magic is
the attempt to control such events by direct actions
and rituals. Superstition and magic spring from the
same origin as religion—a belief in supernatural
forces that control the lives of people. The dividing
line between a religious ritual (asking the gods for
something to happen) and a magic ritual (directly
attempting to make that thing happen) was often
very ﬁne. A strong element of magic was present in
Greek religion. For example, at a sacred well on
Mount Lycaeon in Arcadia, a priest performed a rit-
ual to induce rain in time of drought. Having offered
a sacriﬁce to Zeus, he stirred the waters with a twig
and summoned mist and rain clouds.

There were apparently no magicians in Classical
Greece, although evidence suggests that they existed
in earlier periods. As Greek civilization developed
magic appears to have been suppressed, but many
magical rituals appear to have been absorbed into
Greek religion. Also, many superstitions survived
that were mainly concerned with averting evil, often
by warding off the evil eye. Various charms, spells
and rituals were used to avert evil. For example, care
had to be taken in the disposal of nail-parings and
hair-clippings, in case they were used in black magic
to cause harm to the body from which they had
come. Necromancy, the summoning of spirits of the
dead for various purposes, was practiced, although
not considered respectable.
RITUAL ARTIFACTS
Several groups of artifacts were connected with ritual
and religious use, including cult images, altars,
implements, vessels, votive offerings, materials used
for curses, charms and amulets. There was some
overlap between these groups. For instance, an altar
may have been a votive gift as well as an object used
in rituals. Many artifacts are often conveniently
assumed to have had a religious or ritual connection,
when no other interpretation can be suggested.
Ritual Vessels 
and Implements
Various vessels were used in religious rituals,
although it is not always certain whether special ves-
sels were used, or whether everyday vessels were con-
secrated for religious use. In art a distinctive vessel
called a phiale is often depicted for pouring libations,
as are cups and similar vessels. In Athens in the 5th
century BC ﬂasks (lekythoi) containing oil were placed
in graves as offerings. In the Classical period a dis-
tinctive metal vessel known as a khernibeion was used
for holding water for ritual washing. It is portrayed in
artistic representations of sacrifices. Raised stone
basins holding water for ritual washing (perirrhante-
ria) were commonly found in religious sanctuaries.
Musical Instruments
Music played a part in religious observance, particu-
larly at festivals and games, where there were musical
contests. See chapter 7, MUSIC.
Processional Objects
Processions were a major part of Greek festivals and
usually consisted of worshippers walking to a temple
or taking an image of a deity from one place to
another. Sacred implements relating to the deity
were often carried in procession. For example, virtu-
ally no procession in honor of Dionysus was without
at least a few phallic symbols. Special vehicles were
sometimes present, such as the ship on wheels that
carried the new robe of the goddess to the temple of
Athena on the Acropolis at Athens in the Pana-
thenaea festival. A cart in the form of a ship formed
part of the procession during the Anthesteria festival.
Charms, Amulets 
and Curses
Various charms and amulets were used to bring good
luck and as protection against evil, and the division
between superstition and religion in their use is often
unclear. For example, one of the titles of Heracles was
“Averter of Evil” (Alexikakos), so wearing his image,
perhaps on a ring, could be interpreted as both reli-
gious and superstitious. Amulets were used to protect
the wearer against witchcraft and the evil eye. They
were also used to protect buildings, particularly
houses and other structures such as walls. Amulets
were of virtually any material, and rings were often
worn for this purpose. The potency of amulets might
be enhanced by having a charm inscribed on them.
Charms were used to bring good luck and ward
off evil. They were used on their own, sometimes
worn around the neck in a bag on a string, and con-
sisted of magic formulas, words and anagrams.
Curses were used for a variety of purposes, such as
revenge against an enemy or to protect a grave
against violation; the difference between a vow and a
curse was often negligible. Curses could be spoken or

else written down on a variety of objects such as
papyrus, lead tablets and amulets of various kinds.
See also votive offerings, cult images, altars. Over
1,100 lead curse tablets (katadesmoi) have been found
dating from the 5th century BC onwards, and they
were deposited in underground contexts, such as in
graves, pits or rivers, because it was thought that the
dead could deliver them to the chthonic deities.
They were folded lead plaques that urged chthonic
deities to intervene with their enemies in a wide vari-
ety of actions.
Snakes were believed to offer protection, probably
for their chthonian powers that stemmed from their
being secretive, hiding deep inside cracks in rocks and
in caves. They often guarded sacred places and were
depicted on altars, tombstones and other works of art.

ART
What is today termed “art” or “applied art” encom-
passes a wide range of materials and techniques in
the Greek world, including pottery, sculpture (from
miniature objects to immense statues and architec-
tural sculpture), metalwork (especially bronze and
gold), frescoes and wall paintings, and ﬂoor mosaics.
In the Greek world there was no Muse for art or
architecture, only for arts such as music, dancing and
literature. Artists were artisans, and the only word
for art was tekhne (craft). Roman collectors of art date
from the later Republic, and they were particularly
attracted to objects from Greece.
Contrary to perceptions of Greek art today, much
Greek art was very colorful and gaudy, with architec-
tural sculpture, columns, walls, ceilings, gravestones
and sculptures all being brightly painted.
Pottery
Many types of Greek pottery have distinctive decora-
tion and are usually discussed in terms of art history, in
particular black-ﬁgure and red-ﬁgure vases. Pottery is
the most common artifact in archaeological sites and
was ﬁrst developed in the Neolithic period. Particu-
larly for the prehistoric period many types of pottery
are named after the sites where they have been found
(such as Kamares ware). The study of pottery has
tended to concentrate on decorated wares, but in
nearly all periods plain wares existed alongside deco-
rated wares. Modern scientiﬁc techniques, especially
petrographical and chemical analysis of the clay, give
invaluable information on the origins of pottery ves-
sels, showing whether pots were locally made or
imported from further aﬁeld—and from where. See
also POTTERY MANUFACTURE (pp. 197–198).
SHAPES
Pottery (baked clay or terra-cotta) was used for a vast
range of vessels with varying and sometimes over-
lapping shapes and functions (fig. 9.1). Not only
were containers such as jugs, drinking vessels and
dishes produced, but also items such as large tubs,
buckets, kettles, frying pans, mortars for grinding,
ovens, cosmetic boxes, coffins, figurines, statues,
architectural decoration and lamps.
A great deal is known about the finer pottery
wares with artistic decoration, because they can sur-
vive relatively intact in tombs; far less is known about
everyday coarse wares, such as those used in the
kitchen, although these latter vessels were probably
more common in all periods. Pottery containers
were also used in trades, industries and public life,
such as for liquid and dry measures, water clocks and
voting urns. Pottery vessels, such as black-figure
Panathenaic prize amphorae, were also given as
prizes in games. Greek names of some shapes of pots
are known, largely of Attic ﬁne wares, although some
names are still used that are now known to be incor-
rect. The same shape could be used for a fairly plain
vessel and a highly decorated one. Cups were the
most commonly decorated type of vessel. Some
shapes were also made in other materials, such as
stone and metal. Novelty vessels were also made,
such as vases that spilled their contents over the user.
The following were the most common shapes:
Alabastron (pl. alabastra):
Small flask for oil or
perfume, with a narrow neck, sagging base (no foot)
and no handles, derived from Egyptian stone vases. A
few have a foot. They may have had a leather thong
for suspension.
Amis (pl. amides):
A portable urinal, possibly in the
form of a wide-mouthed jug.
Amphora (pl. amphorae):
A tall vessel with a nar-
row neck (Greek amphoreus or amphiphoreus, mean-
ing “carried on both sides,” but usually referred to by
the Latin name amphora) carried by two variously
placed handles, used for transporting and storing
wine, olive oil and other goods, for serving wine at
the table, and as cremation urns. Many had a pointed
foot, and many were undecorated. There were three
main kinds: transport amphorae, neck amphorae and
belly amphorae. They had stoppers of clay, resin and
other materials and had an average capacity of 4 1⁄2–
5 1⁄2 gallons (20–25 liters). Amphorae were also given
as prizes in games and used as gravemarkers.
Amphoriskos (pl. amphoriskoi):
A small amphora
for perfumed oil.

Aryballos (pl. aryballoi):
A small rounded oil ﬂask
with a narrow neck and one, two or no handles, used
by athletes and men at the gymnasium.
Askos (pl. askoi, literally “a wine skin”):
A small,
wide ﬂat vase or ﬂask for oil, with a narrow sloping
spout and an arched handle meeting the spout.
Bolsal:
An invented name (from the place-names
Bologna and Salonica) for a broad shallow cup with
upright sides and two horizontal handles, copying a
metal original.
Bottle:
A vase with a narrow neck, rounded body,
shallow foot and no handle.
Bowl:
A plain open vessel with no handles.
Chalice:
A deep cup with conical foot, and hori-
zontal handles.
Chous (pl. choes; Greek khous from the verb meaning
“to pour”):
A bulbous jug with a low handle and
trefoil mouth, supported on a stand. Choes were
used in the Anthesteria festival. Small choes were
given to children.
Chytra (pl. chytrai):
(Greek khytra) Footless cook-
ing pot, with one or two handles at the rim. Some
have a lid.

EARLY BRONZE AGE
In Crete, Early Minoan I pottery has many different
shapes, and is either monochrome (gray or red),
white on a dark background (light-on-dark) or a dark
color on a light background (dark-on-light). EMI
pottery includes Pyrgos and Aghios Onouphrios
wares. Pyrgos ware has burnished patterns and varies
from gray to black; most common are plain or footed
bowls, with the chalice being a distinctive drinking
vessel. Aghios Onouphrios wares were oxidized, with
red linear decoration on a buff ground, and included
distinctive decorated jugs.
Early Minoan II pottery includes Aghios
Onouphrios ware, Koumasa ware and Vasilike ware,
and Early Minoan III pottery includes Vasilike ware
and white-on-dark ware (ﬁg. 9.3). Large pithoi are
also known. Koumasa ware has red to black painted
linear decoration on a light background. It declined
in favor of Vasilike ware, whose typical shapes are
cups and long-spouted jugs (like teapots), with mot-
tled black, red and brown decoration imitating stone
vessels. In Early Minoan III, mottled decoration was
replaced by geometric designs (white-on-dark ware),
and vessels had less pronounced spouts.
In the Cyclades Islands, Early Cycladic I has lim-
ited pottery shapes and decoration, including lidded
boxes (pyxides), probably for cosmetics, and the ﬁrst
so-called frying pans. Early Cycladic II pottery
copied stone vessels, with incised decoration, some-
times inlaid in white. Frying pans and cosmetic boxes
continued, as well as zoomorphic forms such as
hedgehogs (ﬁg. 9.4). In Early Cycladic III the kernos
appears for the ﬁrst time.
On the mainland in Early Helladic II, various new
shapes of pottery appeared, including the “sauce-
boat” (a pouring vessel), as well as spouted jugs and
saucers. The pottery often has a dark glossy appear-
9.2 Fourth-century BC drinking cup (rhyton) in the shape
of a calf. It has one handle. Its length is 6.3 in (0.16 m).

ance, described by the German term “Urﬁrnis.” In
Early Helladic III there were plain burnished or
painted pots and geometrically decorated ones
(light-on-dark and dark-on-light). Forms include a
two-handled tankard, large jars with trumpet mouths
and lug handles, and small cylindrical cups. A few
wheel-thrown pottery vessels occur, forerunners of
the grey Minyan ware of Middle Helladic Greece.
MIDDLE BRONZE AGE
The potter’s wheel became widespread in Middle
Minoan IB. Kamares ware was common in Middle
Minoan I and II, and had two fabrics—a coarse one
for storage and pouring vessels, and a very thin
wheel-made eggshell tableware. Shapes included the
single-handled cup, spouted jar and beak-spouted
jug, with teacups the main form of the eggshell ware.
Abstract and naturalistic decoration was in light-on-
dark, with added yellow, orange and red. Barbotine
decoration also appears in this period. Kamares ware
is also found in the eastern Mediterranean, in main-
land Greece and the Cyclades. In Middle Minoan III
it continued, but with more restrained decoration,
including vegetation motifs, such as lilies. Middle
Minoan pottery also included a dark-on-light style,
used mostly for domestic vessels.
In the Cyclades, pottery originally underwent lit-
tle change from Early Cycladic III, but in Middle
Cycladic II the main shape was the beak-spouted jug
decorated with a matte paint using dark-on-light
abstract designs. In Middle Cycladic III this became

especially popular on Melos, where vegetation motifs,
birds, animals and ﬁsh were also introduced, and even
a design of four ﬁshermen was used on one vase.
On mainland Greece, pottery was no longer of
the same artistic quality. Minyan ware pottery, which
ﬁrst appeared in Early Helladic III, is characteristic
of the Middle Helladic period. It was named after
the legendary king Minyas and should not be con-
fused with Minoan. It has a fine hard-fired clay,
always monochrome, initially gray and later yellow.
There were few shapes—thick-stemmed goblets and
kantharoi, made on the fast wheel. Contemporary
with this pottery was handmade matte-painted pot-
tery, decorated with geometric patterns and with
coarse fabrics; the forms include huge storage jars,
beak-spouted jugs and kantharoi.
LATE BRONZE AGE
Pottery styles changed from the bright polychrome
designs to black-and-white (mainly dark-on-light),
with occasional use of red and yellow. The many
types of pottery included small cups and goblets, jugs
with horizontal spouts, rhytons, pilgrim’s ﬂasks and
large pithoi in the palace magazines (ﬁg. 6.3). Some
pottery of this period occurs only at Knossos. Late
Minoan IA has a Pattern Style (abstract motifs) and a
Floral Style (naturalistic designs). In Late Minoan IB
the Marine Style appears, depicting various types of
marine life. The designs became more stylized.
In the Cyclades, pottery was increasingly inﬂu-
enced by Crete, with beak-spouted jugs, the askos,
spouted jars, rhytons and cups. Birds continued as a
popular motif, joined by vegetation and marine
motifs. Pottery then came under Mycenaean inﬂu-
ence.
During the Late Helladic I and II, shapes and
decoration in mainland Greece were derived from
Minoan pottery, possibly made by immigrant
Minoan potters. Minyan type pottery also continued
in LHI, along with a Lustrous Decorated Ware (dec-
orated in a lustrous paint). Decoration of LHIIA
pottery is much more elaborate, including a Marine
Style and Pictorial Style. Large decorated jars are
known as Palace Style Jars (an inaccurate term). The
Ephyraean goblet (named after the site at Ephyra) is
an example of the more stylized decoration charac-
teristic of Late Helladic IIB pottery.
From about 1400 BC, Late Helladic IIIA pottery
of the Greek mainland was mass produced and
exported all over the Mediterranean. It was made in
a ﬁne fabric, with sparse decoration and standardized
shapes, particularly the kylikes, tankards, stirrup jars,
kraters and alabastra. The naturalistic designs
became more constrained and eventually stylized,
and horizontal bands of paint became common. This
style is known as the Pattern Style (different from
the Pattern Style seen earlier on Crete). Some deco-
ration included scenes of charioteers, horses and
warriors, as well as various animals and mythological
creatures, a style known as the Pictorial Style. Par-
ticularly important are large stirrup jars for the trans-
port of wine and olive oil, some of which have Linear
B inscriptions.
The Pictorial Style continued into Late Helladic
IIIC. In this period mostly linear decoration is used,
but local styles began to emerge and a variety of dec-
oration appears, including an octopus stirrup jar
(favored on Naxos and nearby islands, with one or
two elaborate octopuses covering the belly of the
vessel), a Close Style (in the Argolid) and a Pictorial
Style on mainland Greece and the Aegean islands. A
Granary Style (named after a building at Mycenae)
consisted of simple horizontal dark bands and occa-
sional wavy lines. The Close Style was used mainly
on the stirrup jar and had numerous animals, such as
birds and marine life, surrounded by a variety of geo-
metric motifs, such as crosshatched lozenges, trian-
gles, zigzags and semicircles. The designs were
closely packed (hence its name). At times the style is
so ﬂamboyant that it has been termed the Wild Style.
The Pictorial Style is commonly found on kraters
and sometimes on other shapes, and consisted of
chariot scenes, hunting scenes and scenes of warfare,
animals and mythical beasts. They include the
famous Warrior Vase from Mycenae. In Late Hel-
ladic IIIC, pottery styles and decoration declined,
and the Granary Style prevailed. The submycenaean
phase (from about 1050 BC) saw a gradual transition
toward Protogeometric, with badly made pottery
and a limited range of decorative motifs.
GEOMETRIC
Protogeometric pottery occurs from about 1050 BC
to 900 BC, mainly in Athens. The most common

shapes were the storage amphora, krater, oinochoe
and various cups; the stirrup jar disappeared. A faster
wheel was now used. The pots had a black gloss, with
decoration limited to concentric circles and semicir-
cles, crosshatched triangles and panels, and zigzags,
drawn by compasses and multiple brushes.
From about 900 BC the full Geometric style
appears, divided into Early Geometric (900–850 BC),
Middle Geometric (850–760 BC) and Late Geometric
pottery (760–700 BC), the main shapes being the
amphora, oinochoe, krater and cup. Various geomet-
ric designs became common, especially battlement
maeanders, lozenges, squares, triangles, swastikas and
crosshatching. The entire pot was decorated in this
way, dark-on-light. Many patterns resemble those
produced by the weaving of wool on looms. As weav-
ing was women’s work, the decoration of these pots
may have been done by women. In the 8th century BC
stylized animals appeared, repeated as patterns, and
then human ﬁgures, again in stylized form (ﬁg. 3.22).
Many such huge vessels were used as gravemarkers to
mark wealthy Athenian graves, with scenes of funer-
als, chariot processions and warfare most popular.
ORIENTALIZING
Geometric pottery spread to much of Greece, with
varying patterns, but in Corinth from about 720 BC,
Oriental designs affected the pottery, and many of
these pots were exported to Sicily and southern Italy
(some possibly for the perfumes and oils they held,
rather than for the pots themselves). These pots were
not designed as gravemarkers. This new style of pot-
tery is termed Protocorinthian and lasted for about
100 years. The main shapes were the aryballos (which
tended to be the most highly decorated pottery form),
olpe, oinochoe and kotyle. Motifs included ﬂoral and
vegetation designs, as well as various animals and dot-
ted rosettes to ﬁll spaces. Human ﬁgures were less
common than animals. The drawings were originally
done in outline or silhouette. Later, anatomical
details were highlighted by incision—the black-ﬁgure
technique, which appeared in Corinth about 100
years earlier than in Athens. Added color was also
used in this black-ﬁgure technique. A new type of
perfume ﬂask (alabastron) also appeared at this time.
Around 625 BC the full (Ripe) Corinthian style
emerged. Oriental-type animals and mythological
beasts were still used, but less carefully drawn, along
with floral motifs, including enlarged rosettes as
ﬁllers. The ﬁrst phase (to c. 600 BC) was very popu-
lar and widely copied.
In Athens this period of pottery is called Protoat-
tic. It was not as popular as Protocorinthian (being
rarely found abroad) and did not use the black-ﬁgure
technique. The main shapes were the amphora and
krater, as well as the oinochoe and skyphos, but other
shapes were imported from Corinth. There were
fewer Oriental animals but more human ﬁgures and
larger painted designs. The figures were drawn
partly in outline, partly in silhouette, with numerous
motifs derived from the Geometric style. The tech-
nique is known as the Black and White style.
Throughout the 7th century BC narrative mytholog-
ical scenes became increasingly common. Around
625–600 BC the black-figure technique was intro-
duced to Athens, and geometric ﬁller motifs became
less common.
Other styles of pottery are also seen elsewhere in
the Greek world, such as the Wild Goat style in
Rhodes and elsewhere in the Greek east. It was once
called the Rhodian style and was characterized by
goats and other animals as well as monsters and lotus
and bud friezes. The most common shape was the
oinochoe jug. In the islands pots were manufactured
with ﬁgured scenes in relief decoration.
BLACK-FIGURE VASES
From the beginning of the 6th century BC Athens
employed the Corinthian black-figure technique,
large narrative scenes and Oriental motifs, and began
to compete with the Corinthian trade in tablewares.
The decoration was painted on with a brush using a
highly puriﬁed clay slip known as a gloss (not a glaze)
before the pots were ﬁred. When ﬁred in an oxidiz-
ing kiln, the pots were ﬁred red, while the decorated
ﬁgures turned black, due to the type of gloss and the
ﬁring techniques. Black-ﬁgure pottery therefore had
a light background (red or cream) and black decora-
tion (ﬁg. 9.6), with details incised or painted without
incision (such as red for men’s beards, white for
women’s faces). When incised, the light clay under-
neath showed through.
The ﬁrst pots used friezes of ﬁgures and animals
depicted close together, often with inscriptions nam-
ing the ﬁgures in the story. Many themes were of
gods and heroes (especially Heracles), but everyday

scenes were introduced in the second half of the 6th
century BC, as well as symposia and athletics. On
hydriai (water jars) of the late 6th century BC, women
were depicted at fountain houses. In the later 6th
century BC the two main painters were the Amasis
Painter and Execias. At this time the main body of
the pot was opened up, with ﬁgures no longer con-
ﬁned to friezes; large areas of the vessel could also be
covered in a black gloss, with one main scene of black
ﬁgures on a red background.
Some of the pots were signed with painted
inscriptions, and the ﬁrst known painter is Sophilos,
who may have come from east Greece. Different
painters can be identiﬁed according to the styles used,
but not all are known by their actual name; they are
often named after the place where their works were
most popular. The Amasis Painter is named after the
potter who signed his name; the painter’s name is
actually unknown. The Taras Painter is named after
Taras, because many cups made by this anonymous
painter were exported to that place.
In Corinth the Animal Style continued but was
obsolete by 550 BC for no apparent reason. By the
later 6th century BC ﬁgure vases here had declined in
output probably due to the competition with Athen-
ian vases, and exports ceased. Athens began to export
quantities of often high-quality black-ﬁgure vessels,
with a whole range of shapes. Black-ﬁgure pottery
was made in many other places as well, such as in
Laconia (Sparta). Here the outline technique had
been used for decoration, but black-ﬁgure designs
began to be made from about 600 BC, mainly for local
use but also for export to Taras and north Africa.
Apart from narrative scenes, fishes, dolphins and
other marine motifs were popular. In the east the
Wild Goat style and the drawing of animals declined,
after the black-ﬁgure style was introduced. In Sicily
and Italy much pottery was imported, but some pot-
tery was produced in the area of Rhegium (known as
the Chalcidian school), where high-quality black-
ﬁgure vases were made from 550 to 500 BC. Many
Greek vases in Italy have been found in Etruscan
cemeteries, and Etruscan pottery developed from
Greek pottery.
From the mid-6th century BC the Athenians
awarded amphorae of olive oil as prizes in the Pan-
athenaic games, which are now known as Panathenaic
prize amphorae. They were decorated in black-
ﬁgure, with Athena on one side and a scene from the
games on the other. They continued to be made to
the end of the 3rd century BC, long after the intro-
duction of red-ﬁgure. Many of the pots can be pre-
cisely dated, because by 375 BC the name of the
eponymous archon was added. In the later 4th cen-
tury BC names of other ofﬁcials were also added.
RED-FIGURE VASES
Around 530–520 BC a number of new techniques
were tried at Athens. Red ﬁgure was the reverse of
black figure, but it did not immediately replace
black-ﬁgure pottery. It was made mainly in Athens

and southern Italy. The figures remained the red
color of the clay; their outlines were drawn, and the
ﬁner details were drawn with a thinner line that ﬁred
brown rather than black. Some incised decoration
was initially used, but this was abandoned, so that all
decoration came to be done with a brush. The
remaining pot was painted, with a brush, in a black
gloss. The Andocides Painter (named after the pot-
ter) allegedly invented this technique. Athens con-
tinued to dominate the market, exporting as far aﬁeld
as the Black Sea and Egypt. In Corinth the red-ﬁgure
technique was used for a very short period only.
Some pots in Athens used black-ﬁgure technique on
one side and red-ﬁgure on the other (bilingual ves-
sels). They were possibly display pieces.
Popular designs were mythological, heroic and
everyday scenes, including Dionysiac and erotic
themes. Red-ﬁgure vases continued throughout the
5th century BC. In the early 5th century BC the potter
Sotades made several pots with modeled parts, such
as a vase with a sphinx. Rather than appearing along a
single groundline, ﬁgures appear all over the surface
of the pot, but all at the same scale. By the mid-5th
century BC heroic and mythological scenes became
less popular; instead, there were scenes of daily life,
especially nude young women. Drapery also appeared
more transparent, following sculpture styles.
Even during the Peloponnesian War, the red-
ﬁgure technique continued at Athens. In the 4th cen-
tury BC the Kerch style used added color, especially
yellow, white and gold and to a lesser extent blue and
green. The style was named after the site at Kerch in
the Ukraine, where numerous such Athenian vases
have been found. Although the mid-4th century BC
experienced some ﬁne painters at Athens, produc-
tion weakened in the later part of the century and
ceased by around 320 BC.
In the Greek west (Italy and Sicily), painted pot-
tery was imported, but in the mid-5th century BC
south Italian red-figure pottery began to be made
(ﬁg. 9.7). Five major workshops emerged: the Lucan-
ian, Apulian, Campanian (near Rome), Sicilian and
Paestan. At Apulia two styles developed, an early
Plain Style and the Ornate Style; the latter was used
for large vases, especially those used in burials, many
with funerary scenes. In Paestum, scenes from the
theater were depicted.
WHITE-GROUND
During the experimentation that led to the introduc-
tion of the red-ﬁgure technique, a white background
was brieﬂy tried. In the ﬁrst half of the 5th century
BC this was tried again, with the ﬁgures drawn in out-
line. It was used for various shapes, but as the white
ground was fragile (it did not adhere closely to the
clay body in ﬁring), it was mainly used for vessels
that received little use, notably lekythoi deposited in
burials. The technique was more akin to wall or
panel painting, where a light background was used.
Several colors were used, although often they have
faded. By the end of the 5th century BC, red, black
and brown were used for outlines and polychrome
washes applied to areas such as drapery. Many
designs are funerary in nature.

In Hellenistic Alexandria in Egypt a series of
hydriai were used as cinerary urns, with a white
ground, most of which have been found in the ceme-
tery at Hadra (east of the city). They were made in
Crete. They were used for the burial of dead for-
eigners, and some were also produced locally and
have modest decoration and inscriptions giving
names and dates. At the end of the 3rd century BC a
new type of jug known as the lagynos was often dec-
orated with brown paint on a white slip. The decora-
tion consisted mostly of garlands of wreaths and
objects related to feasting.
HELLENISTIC
From the end of the 4th century BC export markets
declined, and the new styles and colors of painting
could not be achieved on pots, unless applied after
ﬁring (which was not durable). Vase painting there-
fore largely ceased at this time, although pottery
continued to be decorated with wreaths, festoons and
abstract patterns. Gnathian ware was produced in
southern Italy and Etruria in the second half of the
4th century BC. It was a simple black gloss ware, col-
orfully decorated in white, brown, yellow and red,
with animal and vegetation motifs, floral motifs,
wreaths and occasional female heads. Production
continued to the end of the 3rd century BC, and this
pottery was exported as far as Egypt and the Black
Sea. At the end of the 4th century BC painted pottery
gave way to vessels made in molds with relief decora-
tion. Although called Megarian bowls, these molded
hemispherical bowls were made in many places all
over the Hellenistic world, not just at Megara (near
Corinth), from the late 3rd to 1st centuries BC. The
decoration was largely ﬂoral, with some ﬁgures and
mythological scenes. Metal vessels also became far
more common during this period.
PAINTERS
Numerous red-ﬁgure painters are known, many with
non-Athenian names. At Athens they included the
Andocides Painter, Euphronios, Euthymides, Gor-
gos, Berlin Painter, Kleophrades Painter, Douris,
Brygos Painter, Pan Painter, Niobid Painter, Mei-
dias Painter, Meleager Painter and the Marsyas
Painter. In Italy the leading painters included the
Sisyphus Painter, Ilioupersis Painter, Assteas and
Python.
More than 900 artists can be recognized from the
style of their painting, but few signatures are known.
They are found on only 1 percent of pots, and the
names of only 40 artists are known. Some were pos-
sibly metics or slaves. The signatures mainly say that
[name] egrapsen (drew me) or [name] epoisen (made
me). Sometimes both are on the same vase, so one
refers to the potter and one to the painter, but in other
instances the potter and painter were the same person.

EVERYDAY POTS
In the Geometric period, large pithoi were made
with relief decoration that was painted after ﬁring,
and these are found especially on Crete from the 8th
to 6th centuries BC. At Sparta relief vases were made
that seem to copy metal vessels.
Apart from painted pottery, Athenian potters also
made vast quantities of plain simple wares for every-
day use from the Geometric period, including pots
for storing and transporting goods. From the 5th
century BC plain glossy black pots became common
as everyday tablewares. By this period everyday
wares were still handmade and of coarse fabrics,
broadly similar to those produced for the same pur-
pose in earlier periods. They included coarse, undec-
orated transport amphorae (for transport of wine and
olive oil), cooking pots, jugs, casseroles, baby-feed-
ers, knee covers (epinetra) and portable stoves.
Amphorae all had two handles and a knoblike foot
but the proﬁles differ, which gives an indication of
their provenance. Transport amphorae developed
from the 6th century BC, initially from the island of
Chios. Particularly in the Hellenistic period, they
were often stamped on the handle before ﬁring, indi-
cating the origin of the oil or wine, the name of the
governing magistrate and the contents. On average
they contained about 7 gallons (26.5 liters). They
were placed on their sides for transport, and many
have been found in this position in shipwrecks. Over
time, the forms of transport amphorae became more
elongated.

In the Hellenistic period, plain pottery was also
numerous—more numerous than decorated pottery,
because metal vessels were replacing the ﬁne-painted
pots. One common find of this period are plain
unguentaria (clay ﬂasks) for perfumed oil.
REPAIRS
Pots must have been commonly broken, especially
when being transported in such quantities. Ship-
wrecks containing pottery vessels are known, such as
one of Marseilles dating to 515 BC that contained
over 800 Athenian black-figure cups. Broken pots
were at times mended with lead and bronze clamps
and pins, secured through pairs of holes drilled
through the wall of the vase. Bronze rivets were used
to fasten a broken foot. Some pots were even
repaired with shards from different pots.
Sculpture
FIGURINES
Small ﬁgures (ﬁgurines or statuettes) could be made
from a variety of materials, such as stone, faience,
ivory and terra-cotta. There is no rigid dividing line
in size between a statue and a ﬁgurine. Many were
used as votive offerings and have been found in sanc-
tuaries or in tombs, although some may have been
children’s toys. They were of females and males,
often depicting worshippers, sometimes the deity,
although the identiﬁcation is generally uncertain.
Stone: Cycladic ﬁgurines date from Early Cycladic
I but are mainly Early Cycladic II (ﬁg. 9.8). They
were made of local marble (especially from Naxos
and Paros) and are schematic fairly ﬂat sculptures of
females, males and musicians. The earliest ﬁgures are
violin-shaped. A number of categories have been dis-
tinguished, such as the Plastiras type (the most natu-
ralistic) and the Spedos type (more schematic,
including folded-arms figurines). They range in
height from ﬁgurines of 8 in (200 mm) to statues of 5
ft (1.5 m). Many have been found in graves. Small
limestone ﬁgures in the Daedalic style (see below)
date from the mid-7th century BC and were origi-
nally painted. Large feet appear from beneath their
long dresses.
Terra-cotta: From Middle Minoan I there are
terra-cotta ﬁgurines of humans and animals and also
of human limbs. They are fairly stylized, and the
females wear elaborate hats and have bared breasts.
Similar female terra-cotta ﬁgures date to the Late
Helladic period, ranging in size from about 271⁄2 in
(0.7 m) to almost lifesize. Figures of females of the
Late Minoan period have wheelmade cylindrical
bodies; their hands are held aloft. These ﬁgurines
were made for over 300 years, and in the Dark Age
from about 1000 BC similar ones were made, along
with animals and mythical creatures such as centaurs.
The most common Mycenaean sculptures are
terra-cotta ﬁgurines, dating to the 14th and 13th cen-
turies BC. They are found from Italy to Syria and range
in height from 2 in (50 mm) to 5 in (130 mm). The
main types are named psi and phi ﬁgurines (ﬁg. 9.9),
after the shape of the Greek letters, and they were very
stylized. Ones of animals were also made. From the
10th century BC terra-cotta ﬁgurines were one of the
most common votive offerings at sanctuaries.
From the 7th century BC molds began to be used,
enabling terra-cotta figurines to be inexpensively
mass produced. When a mold became worn, a new
one could be made from an existing ﬁgurine. These

mold-produced ﬁgurines are found across the Greek
world, and most are of females, largely standing but
often seated. The Daedalic style was introduced
from the Near East, possessing a typical vertical
wavy hairstyle (resembling a wig), frontal and rigid
pose, triangular or U-shaped face, and ﬂatness. This
style is also found in bronze, ivory, gold and stone
ﬁgurines.
In the Classical period thousands of terra-cotta
figurines were made in most parts of the Greek
world, to be used as votive offerings at sanctuaries;
they represented either the worshipper or the deity.
Some may have been children’s toys. Most ﬁgurines
were now made in molds and were hollow. The main
centers for production were Athens and Boeotia.
In the Hellenistic period terra-cotta figurines
continued to be produced, notably in Italy, Athens
and Asia Minor. Ones of comic actors became popu-
lar, and at the end of the 4th century BC the ﬁnest
were produced at Athens and at Tanagra in Boeotia.
Hundreds of these “Tanagra” ﬁgurines (named after
the site near Thebes where large quantities were ﬁrst
discovered) have been found, mainly in graves and
tombs. They developed from about 330 BC. The
most popular Tanagra ﬁgurine is of a standing draped
female. Less commonly depicted were seated females,
men, boys and ﬂying Eros ﬁgures. Like Hellenistic
statues, ﬁgurines now have much greater realism; dif-
ferent parts of the figures were made in different
molds. All these ﬁgurines were brightly painted and
some were gilded.
Faience: A group of female faience ﬁgurines from
Knossos dates to Middle Minoan I, the largest being
13.5 in (345 mm) high. They have outstretched arms
and bare breasts (ﬁg. 9.10).
Ivory: Ivory ﬁgurines date from Late Minoan I on
Crete; some were chryselephantine ﬁgures (of gold
and ivory). The larger examples were made in several
pieces. They were popular in the Late Helladic
period and reappear around 730 BC.
Lead: Lead ﬁgurines are known from the Second
Palace Period and also Late Helladic IIA. Hundreds
of thousands of small lead ﬁgurines dating to the 7th
century BC have been found at the sanctuary of
Artemis Orthia at Sparta.
Bronze: Figurines of males and females and some
animals began to be made in solid bronze on Crete
from Late Minoan I, or possibly a little earlier. It is
only from the 8th century BC that they are found on
the mainland, and horses especially were popular.
Votive offerings in bronze are found at sanctuaries,
such as Delphi, Olympia and Delos; the earliest were
animal ﬁgures cut from bronze or copper sheet, but
they were later cast. Of the human ﬁgurines the war-
rior was most popular. From the 7th century BC
these warrior figures became more naturalistic. In
the Classical period large numbers of bronze fig-
urines were made as grave goods or as votive offer-
ings in sanctuaries. By the 5th century BC many were
made as mirror handles.
STATUES
From about the mid-7th century BC lifesize male
statues began to be made of marble on the islands of
Naxos, Samos and Paros. The style was at first
Daedalic, with the typical wavy hairstyle (like a wig),
frontal and rigid pose, and triangular face. The ﬁg-
ures were naked, except for a belt, and one leg was

slightly advanced. They display Egyptian inﬂuence
(although Egyptian ﬁgures are clothed and have a
supporting column). They were used as gravemark-
ers and in sanctuaries. By the end of the 7th century
BC, such sculptures were also being made on the
mainland. Like architectural sculpture, these statues
were painted in bright colors, a tradition that contin-
ued throughout Greek history. The most common
word for a statue was agalma, especially one dedi-
cated to a deity.
There were two main types of marble sculpture in
the 6th century BC: the standing nude male (kouros,
pl. kouroi) and the standing clothed or draped female
(kore, pl. korai). They were dedicated in sanctuaries
(mainly as votive offerings, sometimes as represen-
tations of deities), especially the korai, and some
were gravemarkers in cemeteries. Many were dedi-
cated on the Acropolis at Athens by both men and
women. They were usually larger than lifesize and
retained a frontal stance and hairstyle reminiscent of
the Daedalic style, with one leg advanced (walking
pose), arms by the side and large feet. The naked
males no longer had a belt, and anatomy was rather
abstract and rigid. During the 6th century BC the
depiction of anatomy became more naturalistic. By
the mid-6th century BC other male statues were
being produced, such as a man carrying a calf, but
still in a similar style.
The female kore ﬁgures appear slightly later than
the male ones and display a variety of patterns in the
clothing, often with lavish painting to depict the
elaborate textiles, abstract linear patterns, complex
hairstyles and protruding large feet (not the walking
pose). By the mid-6th century BC other female ﬁg-
ures appear, including some in the form of a sphinx.
Seated ﬁgures, particularly deities, were also quite
common in the Archaic period.
There is evidence that bronze was widely used for
statues from the late 6th century BC, but little has
survived, because bronze tended to be melted down
and recast. While probably not painted, bronze stat-
ues in all periods would have had a brass or golden
color (not the patina they have acquired today); lips
and nipples were picked out in red copper, teeth with
silver, eyes were inlaid with glass or stone, and pat-
terns on clothing were inlaid with various materials.
From the 5th century BC, graves were rarely
marked by statues. Statues of marble or bronze were

9.10 A polychrome faience ﬁgure (so-called snake
goddess) found at Knossos, Second Palace Period

commissioned by individuals to stand in sanctuaries
or public places such as the agora. They were not
portraits of the donors, but reflected the subject
(such as a successful athlete commissioning an ath-
lete statue). Simple cult statues in temples also began
to be replaced by bronze or marble, and some ivory
and gold ones were made.
For about 30 years from the end of the Archaic
period (c. 480–450 BC), the period of sculpture is
known as the Transitional or Early Classical Period,
or Severe Style, with many statues having a stern or
serious expression, lifelike but not totally realistic.
These statues were a transitional phase between the
Archaic kouroi and korai statues and those of the
High Classical period. Most freestanding statues
were in bronze, but very few have survived (ﬁg. 9.11).
Anatomy and drapery began to be more realistically
portrayed. Some of the bronze statues have survived
as Roman copies, mainly in marble (where the copy-
ing often necessitated some changes, such as the
addition of a tree trunk for support). Sculptors in this
period also produced lifesize statues in terra-cotta,
which were painted, particularly in the Greek west
where marble was unavailable.
From c. 450 BC the Severe Style was replaced by
the High Classical Style, in which young men and
women were carved with uniform, idealized appear-
ance and expressions, and no individuality. Drapery
is carved much deeper, and by the end of the century
is more transparent (rather like clinging wet or wind-
blown drapery), allowing the ﬁgure underneath to be
apparent. Human anatomy is correctly shown. There
is much more movement in the ﬁgures, particularly
the drapery. The naked female appeared from the
4th century BC. Portrait statues also began to appear,
although at ﬁrst they were of dead people, and an
ideal rather than a true likeness was made. Copies of
the heads of these statues were often later set up as
herms (on rectangular pillars) (ﬁg. 2.8).
From about 400 BC to the death of Alexander the
Great (323 BC), the period of sculpture is often called
Late Classical. Sculptures began to appear more real-
istic, less austere and with emotion. The standing
naked male ﬁgure continued to be a dominant sub-
ject, as well as the naked male athlete. Again, few
bronze originals have survived from this period.
Cult statues placed in temples were sometimes
very simple, and many were made of wood. Ones for
Classical temples were of bronze or marble, with a
few huge ones of gold and ivory constructed over a
wooden core (such as those by Pheidias).
Sculpture in the Hellenistic period (from 323 BC)
is characterized by greater realism and a greater vari-
ety of subjects and poses. There was more interest in
individual people, and realistic portrait statues
became extremely popular, including those of rulers
of Hellenistic kingdoms, philosophers, orators, gen-
erals, politicians and poets, as well as old people,
women and children (not shown realistically before).
No longer were portraits conﬁned to those of the
dead. The standing naked male was also presented
in a variety of poses, such as the body being twisted.
A large number of naked male athletes were also
produced. Many statues were presented as groups,

was originally cast in eight pieces. He has copper lips and
eyelashes, a silver headband and inlaid eyes and is in the
Severe Style of sculpture. The charioteer once formed
part of a group with chariots and horses.

particularly historical and mythological groups.
Some of the greatest sculpture was produced at
Pergamum and is termed Hellenistic baroque. Also
popular were statues of Dionysus, satyrs, maenads,
nymphs and centaurs.
Numerous statues were produced in this period,
mainly in bronze. Cult statues of deities, however,
were often of marble. Many Hellenistic and earlier
statues were taken to Rome by collectors following
conquest of Greek territory by the Romans. They
were also copied by the Romans, although bronze
statues were often copied in stone, and heads rather
than the entire statue were often copied.
GRAVEMARKERS
At Mycenae, grave steles were carved with relief
sculpture from the 16th century BC, with scenes such
as warriors and animals, and the remaining space was
ﬁlled with carved spiral designs, a decoration typical
of that period (ﬁg. 3.3). There were also plain grave
steles, implying that they may have been originally
plastered and painted in a manner similar to wall
frescoes.
From about 600 BC grave steles (stelai, sing. stele)
in Attica consisted of tall, narrow rectangular slabs.
Initially they were surmounted by capitals, then
scrolls with sphinxes on top; the sphinxes were later
replaced by palmettes. The ﬂat face of the stele itself
was usually carved in relief with a single male ﬁgure
(usually a warrior or athlete facing right—the sign of
a victor in Greek art—or a cloaked older man) or
sometimes a group of ﬁgures, all colorfully painted.
The ﬁgures were in proﬁle, but similar in appear-
ance to the kouros statues. Similar sculptured reliefs
were set up as votive offerings.
Grave reliefs ceased from the early 5th century BC,
then began to be produced in Attica once more from
around 430 BC, although they had continued else-
where in the Greek world. The tall steles with single
ﬁgures were replaced by smaller, broader steles, with
two or more ﬁgures in relief, one of whom was often
seated (ﬁg. 9.12). Some show companions or family
members saying farewell to the deceased. The sculp-
tured relief may represent the deceased, although it is
not always possible to distinguish the deceased person
amongst the group with certainty. Sculptured ﬁgures
are now more lifelike, with transparent drapery and
idealized features. Some are set within an architec-
tural setting such as a pediment (ﬁgs. 1.9, 9.12).
Throughout the 4th century BC grave reliefs were
produced in quantity in Athens, until laws forbade
their use around 317 BC. Many have a more pro-
nounced architectural setting. Some figures are
carved in high relief (as in ﬁg. 1.9), with some virtu-
ally in the round. In the East, carved relief sculptures
occur on sarcophagi, which were also painted. Dur-
ing the 3rd century BC in the Aegean and Asia Minor,

from her name, no further information is given 
about Hegeso.

a smaller type of grave stele emerged. See also chap-
ter 10, gravemarkers.
ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE
The earliest example of monumental sculpture is the
Lion Gate at Mycenae (ﬁg. 3.18). From the late 7th
century BC the ﬁrst architectural sculpture appears in
stone on temples. The earliest architectural order
(see chapter 6) was the Doric, and the metopes were
frequently decorated, as were the pediments, at ﬁrst
in low or high relief but eventually completely in the
round, with the ﬁgures supported on a ﬂoor or ledge
and attached to the back of the pediment or metope
by rods. External metopes could be left plain, with
the ones inside the temple (such as over the porch)
decorated. Where marble was not available (such as
in Sicily and Italy), sculptures were often in terra-
cotta, or else of imported marble used just for the
sculptures. In the Ionic order there was a continuous
frieze (not metopes) that was sometimes decorated,
both on the exterior of the temple and around the
cella.
The sculptured ﬁgures on temples were brightly
painted in blue, green, red and white, and there were
even metal additions, such as bronze weapons and
horse harnesses. Particularly favored as a theme was
the triumph of Greek gods over barbaric giants.
Architectural sculpture tended to follow the same
styles as freestanding statues (many were virtually
freestanding, particularly on the pediments), becom-
ing more naturalistic over time. In the Hellenistic
period other architectural sculptures included
immense altars, such as that of Zeus at Pergamum.
STONE VESSELS
From the Neolithic period Cycladic marble workers
made stone vessels (mainly in marble) of various
shapes, some with zoomorphic forms. In the Early
Minoan period on Crete, small brightly colored
vases were made from various stones. Many were of
miniature size and were probably intended as grave
goods or to hold offerings. In the Late Minoan
period a number of stone ritual vessels (rhyta, sing.
rhyton) were decorated with relief scenes or were
zoomorphic in form (such as one of a bull’s head).
Some seem to have been covered in gold leaf (gilt).
SEALSTONES, GEMS AND COIN DIES
The word for a seal was sphragis. Seals were carved
from a variety of materials (such as bone, soft and
hard stone, ivory and wood). They were finely
engraved (cut in intaglio) with a wide range of topics,
using the aid of a drill (see also chapter 7). They date
from the Neolithic period. Gold signet rings of
Bronze Age date are known, but most seals in that
period were of other materials (fig. 7.7). Topics
include humans, animals and abstract designs, with
the emphasis on the appearance of the sealstone
rather than the sealing. They reappear in the Archaic
period from the 8th century BC, with carved hard-
stones from the 6th century BC (these may have been
gems rather than sealstones, although a few have
inscriptions suggesting use as sealstones). Common
topics were animals, humans and mythology.
Engraved gems of the Classical period tend to be
larger than earlier ones. Gem engraving continued
throughout the Hellenistic period, with even greater
virtuosity. In the 3rd century BC the cameo tech-
nique (rather than intaglio as before) was used for
carving semiprecious stones: the design was carved
out of the surface. Many of the clay sealings are now
being studied, especially as they can be more accu-
rately dated from their archaeological context in
excavations. Finger-rings were not discarded in the
same way, but tended to survive as heirlooms.
A related art from the 6th centure BC was that of
engraving coin dies. Some states hardly varied their
dies, but others had very ﬁne designs (see chapter 5).
See also SEALS (p. 267).
Wall Paintings
Wall paintings in the Late Bronze Age are tradition-
ally termed frescoes, implying paint applied while
the plaster is still damp, although most Bronze Age
ones were probably painted on dry plaster. From the
3rd millennium BC plastered walls were commonly
painted dark red, which remained a favorite color for
backgrounds, although they were sometimes painted
black. By the First Palace Period other colors are
known, with geometric patterns. Paintings with dec-
orative scenes are known from the Minoan palaces
on Crete by the Late Minoan IA, and naturalistic

scenes were common. The most famous is the bull-
vaulting scene from Knossos, with a combination of
scenes from nature and religious ritual. Red was used
for women and white for men. Most Cretan frescoes
were done on ﬂat surfaces, but there were some relief
frescoes that combined paintings with plaster relief,
which compensated for the lack of shading used (ﬁg.
9.13). They include lifesize frescoes of ﬁgures and
animals. The main fresco was on a central zone of
the wall, flanked by colored or patterned bands,
some imitating wood or stone.
Some paintings are known as miniature frescoes
(2.4–3.9 in, 60–100 mm high), either literally minia-
ture friezes or tiny scenes depicted on the clothing of
the men and women. From Late Minoan IB painted
processions appear, inspired by Egyptian painters. In
the Second Palace Period, frescoes also spread to
islands such as Melos and Thera, with many based on
scenes of nature. Some frescoes are also known on
the mainland, using a technique adopted from Crete
and dating from Late Helladic I. Particularly popular
were procession scenes in the Egyptian style.
Plaster ﬂoors were also decorated by painting in
the Minoan and especially the Mycenaean palaces.
They were divided into rectangles or squares, in imi-
tation of gypsum slabs, with geometric designs and
ones of sea creatures.
Evidence for painting in the later Greek world
comes largely from pottery vases: very few largescale
paintings, on ﬂat surfaces (walls or panels) have sur-
vived. Techniques of wall painting were lost after the
fall of the Mycenaean palaces c. 1200 BC until the
Archaic period. Painted walls are known in temples
at Corinth and the surrounding area from the early
7th century BC. Evidence for wall paintings of the
5th and 4th centuries BC is scarce, although painters
were held in high regard at this time. One substantial
wall painting of this period is from the Tomb of the
Diver at Paestum in southern Italy. Names of
painters are known from historical sources, some of
whom were apparently commissioned to paint major
friezes on large whitened wooden panels that were
hung on interior walls of public buildings. Toward
the end of the 5th century BC there was an improve-
ment in painting styles, with use of shading and
lighting and greater realism. Most painting was done
with brushes, but in encaustic painting pigments
could also be mixed with heated wax.
Such paintings are also scarce in the Hellenistic
period, although some are known from elaborately
painted Macedonian tombs, especially Vergina.
There was greater depiction of landscape, as well as
still lifes, erotic scenes and portraits. Scene painting
in theaters became important, with various backdrops
for different types of plays. This led to the develop-
ment of linear perspective, and the term for perspec-
tive painting was skenographia (stage painting).
Some ﬁne paintings of the 1st century BC have
been found in Rome (Odyssey Landscapes) and may
have been done by a Greek painter. Literary sources
say that Romans often copied Greek paintings,
apparently mainly 4th-century BC paintings, and

many surviving Roman wall paintings and mosaics
from Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy were repro-
ductions or adaptations of original Greek paintings.
Artists included Polygnotus, Apollodorus, Zeuxis,
Parrhasius, Nicias and Apelles, the latter being the
most famous.
Mosaics
The earliest decorated ﬂoor mosaics in the Greek
world to survive date to the 5th century BC, and the
largest are those at Olynthus, dating to 400 BC. They
were made from smooth natural pebbles and were
mainly white on dark, with geometric patterns and
some figured designs in a panel (emblema) sur-
rounded by patterns. They have been mainly found
in wealthy private houses, especially the dining
rooms. Inscriptions were occasionally incorporated
in the mosaics, and motifs such as ﬂowers and vege-
tation began to be used. By the late 4th century BC
the pebbles selected for use became smaller and were
packed more closely, with a greater range of colors.
The ﬁnest examples are from Pella (ﬁg. 9.14), and
the figures in the central panels (emblemata) were
depicted with shading. The quality of mosaics then
started to decline. All mosaics were of pebbles until
the early or mid-3rd century BC, when they were
gradually superseded by tessellated mosaics. This
technique was probably developed in Sicily and
involved a system of cutting stone and tile cubes to
make close-ﬁtting mosaic ﬂoors. Tessellae is a diminu-
tive of the Latin word tesserae, meaning “cubes.” Tes-
sellated mosaics spread throughout the Greek world.
Most were of abstract designs, but there were also
ﬁgured central panels of ﬁne tesserae surrounded by
borders of larger tesserae. They could be in black
and white or color. The most skilled mosaics imi-
tated the effects of painting. One of the most famous
Hellenistic mosaicists was Sosus of Pergamum. Tes-
sellated mosaics continued into the Roman period.
Roman mosaics can sometimes be identified as
copies of Greek paintings or mosaics, including two
works of Sosus (Unswept Room and Doves).

Minor Arts
A range of materials was used for various other arti-
facts that can be classiﬁed as art. The materials include
stone, semiprecious stones, ivory, terra-cotta, gold, sil-
ver, lead, bone, bronze, faience and wood. The range
of other art forms was considerable, including furni-
ture, jewelry, tableware, tripods, lamps, votive offer-
ings, some weapons, model objects, altars, decorative
boxes, and votive and terra-cotta relief plaques. See
also chapter 5, ECONOMY AND INDUSTRY.
ARTISTS AND
ARCHITECTS:
BIOGRAPHIES
From the 6th century BC in particular, many rulers of
city-states were patrons of the arts, including art and
architecture. Most artists and architects were artisans
who earned little money; they worked in family busi-
nesses, passing skills from father to son. Many works
of art were unsigned, and the artists are unknown.
The names of some architects and artists are known
from literary sources and inscriptions. Very few
women are known as artists—their traditional pur-
suits were weaving and embroidery, about which lit-
tle is known, but they may also have been responsible
for the decoration of some pottery. In the Hellenistic
period artists enjoyed royal patronage and great
wealth and traveled to various cities to conduct their
work. Architects were involved in preparing designs,
drawing up speciﬁcations and assessing the quantity
and size of materials needed, such as stone blocks
from quarries. They also supervised the actual work.
Following are the major artists and architects, with
the Greek version of their name, in italics.
Agatharcus (Agatharkhos):
Painter, from Samos,
floruit c. 440–410 BC. He apparently worked in
Athens and painted the walls of the house of Alcibi-
ades c. 430 BC—the ﬁrst record of such decoration.
He painted a scene for a play by Aeschylus and
wrote a treatise on scene painting, which inspired
Anaxagoras and Democritus to work out the rules of
perspective.
Agoracritus (Agorakritos):
Sculptor, floruit c.
440–400 BC. He was a native of Paros and pupil of
Pheidias. He was primarily a marble sculptor. His
most famous work was the cult statue of Nemesis at
Rhamnus (before 431 BC), of which fragments have
been excavated. The work was also attributed to
Pheidias. Agoracritus is also known to have made a
colossal marble statue of the Mother of the Gods for
the metroon in Athens’ agora. Two bronze statues by
him are also recorded.
Alcamenes (Alkamenes):
Sculptor, possibly Athen-
ian, ﬂoruit c. 440–400 BC. A pupil and rival of Pheidias.
He worked at or near Athens, and about 12 of his
works are known, many of which were copied by the
Romans. He mostly produced statues of gods in mar-
ble, but also worked in bronze, gold and ivory. His
works included a chryselephantine cult statue of Dio-
nysus, a bronze athlete, a statue of Aphrodite of the
Gardens, a marble group of Procne and Itys on the
Athenian Acropolis (possibly not his work) and Hermes
of the Gateway. Pausanias incorrectly attributes to him
the west pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia.
Amasis (Amasis):
Floruit c. 560–530 BC. A potter
who is known from nine signed vases, all painted by
the same artist who is also known as the Amasis
Painter (after the potter). His name may have had an
Egyptian derivation. Over 100 black-figure vases
have been attributed to this painter, who may have
also been the potter. He painted a variety of scenes
on large amphorae, oinochoai, lekythoi and cups.
Antenor (Antenor):
An Athenian sculptor, ﬂoruit
c. 540–500 BC. He made the famous bronze group of
Harmodius and Aristogiton (who killed Hipparchus
in 514 BC). It was stolen by Xerxes in 480 BC but was
later restored in the agora. It is now lost and its form
is unknown. Antenor was also responsible for the
Caryatids of the Erechtheum, and possibly for the
east pediment of the temple of Apollo at Delphi.
Antigonus of Carystus (Antigonos):
Late 3rd-
century BC bronzeworker and writer. He worked
under Attalus I at Pergamum, and created statues

that celebrated Attalus I’s victory over the Gauls (the
“dying Gaul” triumphal monument).
Apelles (Apelles):
First half of 4th century BC.
Painter from Colophon (or Cos) who moved to Eph-
esus and later worked at Corinth, Athens and the
Macedonian court at Pella (for Philip II and Alexan-
der the Great). He was the most famous and praised
of Greek painters, mainly of portraits. His most
famous picture was of Aphrodite Anadyomene
(Aphrodite rising from the sea), and other known
works include Alexander with a Thunderbolt and a
self-portrait (the first ever recorded). He wrote a
treatise on painting. All his works are lost.
Apollodorus (Apollodoros):
Floruit c. 430–390 BC.
A painter from Athens who was known for skia-
graphos—painting with light and shade by a grada-
tion of color. He was evidently an important painter,
but few of his works were recorded and all are lost.
Archermus (Arkhermos):
Sixth-century BC sculp-
tor from Chios, probably responsible for the Nike of
Delos and the ﬁrst to represent her with wings.
Aristion (Aristion):
Floruit c. 550–520 BC. A sculp-
tor from Paros, who later moved to Athens. He is
known from signed statue bases and for an Archaic
kore statue.
Brygus (Brygos):
Floruit 500–480 BC. Athenian
potter who is known from over 13 signatures, all on
cups. The painter of several of his vessels is known as
the “Brygos Painter,” to whom over 200 other red-
ﬁgure vases (nearly all cups) are attributed.
Calamis (Kalamis):
Floruit c. 470–430 BC. Possi-
bly from Boeotia or Athens. One of the most impor-
tant bronze sculptors, who also worked in marble,
gold and ivory. A few works by him are recorded,
including Zeus Ammon made for Pindar, a colossal
bronze statue of Apollo made for Apollonia Pontica,
a chryselephantine Asclepius in Sicyon, and the
Sosandra on the Acropolis at Athens.
Callicrates (Kallikrates):
Fifth-century BC archi-
tect who collaborated with Ictinus (architect) and
Pheidias (sculptor) in building the Parthenon.
Colotes (Kolotes):
Second half of 5th century BC. A
sculptor, possibly from Paros. He apparently helped
Pheidias with the chryselephantine Zeus statue at
Olympia, and made other chryselephantine statues
and some bronze ones of philosophers.
Cresilas (Kresilas):
Floruit c. 450–430 BC. A sculp-
tor from Cydonia in Crete, who worked mostly in
Athens. He is known from literature, from signed
statue bases and Roman copies (a portrait statue of
Pericles [ﬁg. 2.9] and a statue of a wounded Amazon).
Critius (Kritios):
Floruit c. 480–460 BC. Sculptor,
probably an Athenian. He is known from six statue
bases signed by him and Nesiotes; in 477 BC they
were commissioned to make the group of the tyran-
nicides Harmodius and Aristogiton to replace those
by Antenor. Numerous copies are known. Other
statues have been attributed to Critius based on their
style, including the “Critius Boy” of c. 480 BC found
at Athens.
Damophon (Damophon):
Floruit c. 200–150 BC.
Sculptor from Messene. His works were mainly cult
statues and larger groups for sites within the Pelo-
ponnese. He also repaired Pheidias’ statue of Zeus at
Olympia.
Douris (Douris):
Floruit to 470s BC. Possibly from
Samos, he was a painter of red-ﬁgure cups, contem-
porary with the Brygos Painter. He signed 39 vases
as a painter, although around 300 have been attrib-
uted to him, mainly cups.
Endoios (Endoios):
Floruit c. 530–500 BC. A sculp-
tor who worked mainly in Athens. Four signatures
are known (three from Athens). His surviving work
includes remains of a marble seated Athena from the
Acropolis at Athens, seen by Pausanias.
Eubulides the Younger (Euboulides):
Floruit c.
140–120 BC. A sculptor from an Athenian family of
sculptors. Son of the sculptor Eucheir (with whom
he often collaborated) and grandson of the sculptor
Eubulides the Elder. He was responsible for a colos-
sal group of Athena, Zeus, Mnemosyne, the Muses
and Apollo at Athens, fragments of which have been
found; it was seen by Pausanias.

Euphranor (Euphranor):
Floruit c. 360–330 BC. A
sculptor and painter who apparently worked mainly
in Athens. About 12 sculptures are known, some
colossal, including Philip II and Alexander the Great
riding in chariots, a statue of Paris and a cult statue of
Apollo Patroos (found in the Athenian agora). Three
paintings on the interior of the Stoa of Zeus in the
agora were a cavalry scene before the battle of Man-
tinea, the 12 gods, and Theseus with personified
Democracy and the People. He wrote treatises on
colors and symmetry.
Euphronius (Euphronios):
Floruit c. 515–480 BC.
A potter and one of the ﬁnest red-ﬁgure vase painters
who worked at Athens (he later did potting only). He
is known from 16 signatures: he signed six vases as a
painter and 10 as a potter (decorated by other
painters, including Onesimus and the Pistoxenus
painter). His ﬁnest vases were calyx kraters.
Execias (Exekias):
Floruit c. 550–530 BC. The
finest Attic black-figure vase painter, and a potter
who made vases for others and for himself to paint.
Several signatures are known (as both potter and
painter). He invented several new vase shapes. His
amphora showing Achilles and Ajax playing dice, and
his painting of the death of Ajax are well known. He
also painted several terra-cotta plaques.
Hermogenes (Hermogenes):
Second-century BC
architect, possibly from Priene. Active c. 200 BC or c.
130 BC. Attributed to him are the temple of Diony-
sus at Teos and the temple of Artemis Leucophryene
at Magnesia ad Maeandrum, both in Ionic style (he
objected to the Doric order in sacred buildings). He
wrote treatises on these temples, with principles for
Ionic architecture that appear in Vitruvius.
Hippodamus (Hippodamos):
Fifth 
century 
BC
(born c. 500 BC). The most famous town planner,
although not the inventor of the gridiron type of
town plan. He was from Miletus (destroyed 494 BC);
it was rebuilt with a grid layout, for which Hippo-
damus is unlikely to have been responsible. He
planned the town of Piraeus around the old seaport
in the mid-5th century BC, and in 444/443 BC he
went with the group founding the colony of Thurii
and probably undertook its planning. He may have
been responsible for the plan of the city of Rhodes
(408/407 BC), but this is possibly too late.
Ictinus (Iktinos, kite):
Floruit c. 450–420 BC. An
architect who collaborated with Callicrates (archi-
tect) and Pheidias (sculptor) in building the
Parthenon at Athens, of which he wrote an account.
He was also responsible for the temple of Apollo at
Bassae (possibly begun c. 430 BC) and was one of the
architects who worked on the Telesterion at Eleusis.
Lysippus (Lysippos):
Floruit c. 328 BC. Famous
sculptor from Sicyon who worked exclusively in
bronze; he reputedly made over 1,500 statues and
created new and slender proportions. He made
mainly athletic statues, ones of Zeus and Heracles,
and portraits. Many of his commissions were at
Olympia, but some were as far aﬁeld as Tarentum,
Asia Minor and Rhodes. Works attributed to him
include several statues of Alexander the Great (from
340 BC), the Apoxyomenus (athlete scraping himself
clean), Olympic victors, Socrates, Chilon, Alexan-
der’s lion hunt, Zeus at Tarentum, Eros at Thespiae,
Heracles (several), Satyrs in Athens and Kairos in
Sicyon. Some are known from Roman copies.
Mnesicles (Mnesikles):
An architect of the later
5th century BC who designed the Propylaea on the
Acropolis at Athens, built between 437 and 432 BC. It
was never completed to his original plan.
Myron (Myron):
Floruit c. 460–430 BC. Sculptor
from Eleutherae, one of the most famous sculptors of
his time. He worked largely in bronze, although
some of his statues are known from later marble
copies and other representations, including the “Dis-
cus thrower” (Discobolus) and a group of Athena and
Marsyas. Seventeen other commissions are known
from literary sources, the most famous of which is a
bronze cow on the Acropolis at Athens.
Nicias (Nikias):
Fourth century BC. Painter from
Athens. About 12 paintings are known, including
Nemea, Necyomantea, Alexander, Io, Andromeda
and Calypso. The latter three seem to be copied at
Pompeii. Nicias also painted marble statues carved
by Praxiteles. He was the ﬁrst to attempt to paint
women three-dimensionally with shading.

Paeonius (Paionios):
Floruit 425 BC. Sculptor from
Mende. In 1875 a marble statue of a winged victory
(Nike) on a triangular pillar was found at Olympia
(ﬁg. 9.15). The inscription attributes it to Paeonius,
and it was dedicated by the Messenians and Nau-
pactians after defeating the Spartans at Pylos in 425 BC.
Parrhasius (Parrhasios):
Floruit c. 430–390 BC. A
painter from Ephesus who worked mainly in Athens,
a contemporary and rival of Zeuxis. His paintings of
ﬁgures were very lifelike, and over 20 are known (all
lost). They were mainly of single mythological ﬁg-
ures, although one of his most famous pictures was
the Athenian People, showing their various qualities.
He also made drawings on wood and parchment for
use by later craftsmen, and wrote about painting.
Pheidias or Phidias (Pheidias):
c. 490–430 BC. A
sculptor from Athens, the most famous in antiquity.
He worked mainly in bronze but also in marble and
chryselephantine (for cult statues). He was also an
architect and painter. His works include a bronze
Athena Promachos about 33 ft (10 m) high (erected
on the Acropolis c. 456 BC), the Lemnian Athena, an
Amazon at Ephesus and a colossal chryselephantine
Athena made for the Parthenon (completed 438 BC).
Pheidias probably went into exile and then made a
colossal chryselephantine Zeus at Olympia (c. 430
BC), one of the Seven Wonders of the World. His
workshop at Olympia has been excavated (ﬁg. 9.16).
Pheidias may also have been responsible for the
sculptures on the Parthenon. In 432 BC he was
charged with embezzling gold (probably by enemies

of Pericles) and later with impiety. He was put into
prison and was probably executed.
Philon (Philon):
Fourth-century BC architect from
Eleusis who designed the naval stores (arsenal) at
Piraeus and added a porch to the Telesterion at Eleu-
sis. His writings on architecture have not survived.
Polycleitus or Polyclitus (Polykleitos):
Second
half of 5th century BC. A sculptor from Argos, the
most celebrated after Pheidias. He worked largely in
the Peloponnese, specializing in statues of naked ath-
letes at Olympia and elsewhere. Most of his work was
in bronze, with some marble and gold and ivory. Sev-
eral inscribed bases have been found, and about 20
statues can be attributed to him. These include sev-
eral Roman marble copies of the Doryphorus (youth
holding a spear) and Diadumenus (youth tying a ﬁl-
let round his head). He was also responsible for a
chryselephantine statue of Hera at Argos, judged to
be ﬁner than that of Pheidias. He wrote a book on
rhythm and proportion.
Polygnotus (Polygnotos):
Floruit 475–447 BC. A
painter from Thasos who worked mainly in Athens
and became a citizen there. None of his wall paint-
ings survive, but they were mainly mythological and
included the Iliupersis (capture of Troy) and Nekyia
(descent of Odysseus to the underworld) in the Cni-
dian Lesche (public room) at Delphi; each contained
over 70 ﬁgures and was probably painted between
458 and 447 BC. At Athens he decorated part of the
Stoa Poikile (painted stoa) and Theseum and
Anakeion. He was one of the most famous painters
and adopted a much freer style (for example, the ﬁg-
ures were grouped across the painting, not just along
a single line), although no shading was used.
Praxiteles (Praxiteles):
Floruit c. 370–330 BC. An
Athenian sculptor, one of the most famous and inﬂu-
ential. He worked mostly in mainland Greece but
undertook some commissions elsewhere (islands and
Asia Minor). He was most proﬁcient in marble but
also worked in bronze. Nicias painted many of his
marble statues. Over 50 commissions (more than 75
statues) are recorded, particularly cult statues and
cult groups. Some are known from later copies. They
include Aphrodite (especially famous being the
naked marble Aphrodite of Cnidus), Apollo, a bronze
Apollo Sauroctonus (lizard slayer), Satyrs, Artemis,
Eros, Dionysus, Leto and two statues of Phryne (his
mistress). A famous statue of Hermes with the infant
god Dionysus was found at Olympia and is probably
an original version (but some say a Hellenistic copy).
Pythius or Pytheus (Pytheus):
Fourth-century BC
architect from Priene. The spelling of his name in
ancient sources varies, but he is possibly the same
person who designed the Mausoleum at Halicarnas-
sus and the temple of Athena Polias at Priene (ﬁg.
9.17), both of the Ionic order. He wrote books on
both buildings; neither has survived.
Scopas (Skopas):
Fourth century BC. A sculptor
from Paros who was a contemporary of Praxiteles.
He worked mainly in marble, specializing in cult
statues. He was especially known for the expression
of violent emotion. About 30 statues are attributed to
him (around 20 of which are cult statues). He is also
recorded as being the architect of the temple of
Athena Alea at Tegea, and he undertook the east side
of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.
Silanion (Silanion):
Fourth-century BC sculptor
from Athens. Ten works are known: Achilles, The-
seus, Dying Jocasta (bronze with some silver) and
seven portraits of Sappho, Corinna, Plato, the sculp-
tor Apollodorus and three boxers from Olympia
(one, possibly Satyrus, is in bronze). He also wrote
on the rules of proportion.
Sosus (Sosos):
Second-century BC mosaicist from
Pergamum, who was famous for his realistic mosaics,
such as an unswept ﬂoor and doves drinking from a
bowl.
Timotheus (Timotheos):
Floruit c. 380–340 BC. A
sculptor who worked on the temple of Asclepius at
Epidaurus (c. 370 BC) and the Mausoleum at Hali-
carnassus (c. 350 BC), the latter with Scopas, Bryaxis
and Leochares. His work at both monuments cannot
be speciﬁcally identiﬁed.
Zeuxis (Zeuxis):
Active c. 430–390 BC. A painter
from Heraclea (Italy) who went to Athens in the 430s
or 420s BC where he undertook various commissions.
He later went to the court of Archelaus of Macedonia
(409–397 BC) to paint his palace; he also gave him a

picture of Pan. Zeuxis was a famous painter and a rival
of Parrhasius. His paintings were so lifelike that birds
ﬂew down to eat the grapes. His best-known pictures
were of Helen of Troy and of a female centaur with
her young. He also did monochrome paintings.
PHILOSOPHY
Introduction
Greek philosophy ( philosophia, meaning “love of
knowledge”) covered a wider range of subjects than
modern philosophy. It was the pursuit of knowledge
by reasoning, and it came to include scientiﬁc inquiry,
speculation about how political and social life should
be conducted, morality and even some religious
questions.
Greek philosophy seems to have had its origin in
the Ionian cities of Asia Minor in the 6th century BC.
At this time philosophers such as Thales, Anaximan-
der and Anaximenes (all from Miletus) were mainly
concerned with speculation about the universe and
the search for a single substance that they believed
had undergone various modiﬁcations to produce the
phenomena of the world.
Pythagoras (late 6th century BC) saw the basis of
the universe in numbers and the relationships
between numbers. Heracleitus (c. 50 BC) rejected the
idea of a single permanent substance that was modi-
ﬁed in various ways. He thought that matter itself
was constantly changing and that everything was in a
state of ﬂux. Xenophanes (late 6th to early 5th cen-
tury BC) created a rationalization for theology.
In the early 5th century BC Parmenides and Zeno
distinguished between what they saw as the true,
eternal and unchangeable material of the universe
and the unreal phenomena of change and diversity

that was apparent to the senses. Empedocles was the
ﬁrst to propose the theory that the universe com-
prised only four elements (earth, air, ﬁre and water),
with different things composed of different propor-
tions of these four elements. Anaxagoras of Clazom-
enae thought that the universe contained the “seeds”
of every material. He also introduced the idea of an
intelligence (nous) as something distinct from matter,
an animating principle of force and order. Leucippus
was credited with originating the theory that the uni-
verse was composed of a large number of atoms that
were combined mechanically, a theory developed by
Democritus.
The culmination of Greek philosophy came with
Socrates in the second half of the 5th century BC and
Plato and Aristotle in the 4th century BC. However,
the context in which their ideas occurred—the inde-
pendent city-state (which they had assumed would
continue to exist)—was destroyed by the conquests
of Alexander the Great. This changed the outlook of
subsequent philosophers, such as the Stoics and the
Epicureans, whose focus of interest was quite differ-
ent. Instead of the nature of reality and knowledge,
Hellenistic philosophers were more interested in
practical problems of everyday behavior. Such
philosophies tended to search for means of achieving
a state of mind that allowed an individual to be
happy, or at least content, irrespective of their exter-
nal circumstances. Other philosophical ideas, such as
those of the Sceptics and the Cynics, also reﬂected
this change of attitude, which was to some extent a
move toward philosophies of acceptance and resig-
nation, rather than speculation and inquiry.
Female philosophers are known to have been asso-
ciated with various schools of philosophy, most notably
Pythagoreanism, and to have written texts and letters,
some of which survive. See also EDUCATION (p. 275).
Individual Philosophies
THALES OF MILETUS
Thales (early 6th century BC) was traditionally
regarded as the earliest Greek philosopher. Nothing
written by him has survived, and it is even doubtful
that he wrote anything. Aristotle attributed to him
the view that the world and everything in it originate
as water and eventually return to water. Thus water
was regarded as both eternal and divine. This philos-
ophy was encapsulated in his saying “all things are
full of gods.”
ANAXIMANDER OF MILETUS
Working at the beginning of the 6th century BC
Anaximander was the ﬁrst philosopher to attempt to
propose a rational explanation for the origin of the
world. He said that the origin of all things was “the
unbounded” (to apeiron), which was divine, immortal
and indestructible. “The unbounded” controlled and
“enfolded” the kosmos, or even many kosmoi, although
it is unclear whether he thought that kosmoi coexisted
or succeeded one another. The word kosmos (cosmos)
meant “good order,” as well as the world or universe
in its perfect order.
To Anaximander the most important forces at
work in the world were pairs of opposites, such as
heat and cold. He thought that the ﬁrst living things
were created by spontaneous generation from mud,
which was caused by the action of the Sun. This was
long accepted as a standard explanation. He thought
that the Earth was shaped like the drum of a column,
with people living on the upper surface.
ANAXIMENES OF MILETUS
Anaximenes (mid-6th century BC) thought that air
was the substance from which everything was made.
It could be rariﬁed to form ﬁre or condensed to form
water or earth, and these elements were com-
pounded to make the world and everything on it. He
regarded air as the breath of the cosmos, its divine
and immortal source. He also thought that Earth was
ﬂat and shallow like a disc and was supported by air.
PYTHAGORAS
Pythagoras founded a religious community at Croton
around 530 BC, open to both men and women.
Pythagoras was a worshipper of Apollo and believed
in reincarnation. He thought that the soul was a fallen
divinity entombed within the body and destined to
pass through a number of reincarnations, until it
developed an Apollo-like purity that would release it.
Such purity was attained especially through study.
His mathematical studies led him to interpret the
whole world through numbers. He initiated a sys-

tematic study of the numerical basis of the world,
which was continued by his followers.
Pythagoreans thought that the universe was cre-
ated by the First Unit (the Heaven) inhaling the Inﬁ-
nite or Void to produce groups of units or numbers.
All things in the universe (even abstractions such as
opinion and justice) were actually numbers and had a
position in the cosmos. Pythagoreans came to believe
that Earth was spherical and that the heavenly bodies
(including the sun) revolved around a central ﬁre. A
similar, earlier cosmological system called “harmony
of the spheres” was accommodated to the Pythag-
orean view.
XENOPHANES
Xenophanes (late 6th to early 5th centuries BC) was
best known for his rationalization of religion. He
attacked the polytheism and anthropomorphism of
Greek religion and denounced the immoral stories
about the gods that are found in the poetry of
Homer and Hesiod. He believed in a single eternal
god who did not resemble humans and caused things
to happen by mind alone. This monotheism was a
radical departure from traditional Greek thought
and religion.
HERACLEITUS
Heracleitus (c. 500 BC) did not believe that it was
possible to understand reality fully. He thought that
appearances were unreliable, but that some sort of
knowledge was attainable. He believed that the
world had an underlying unity, which depended on a
balance between opposites. This balance meant that
a change in one direction resulted in a change in the
opposite direction, so everything was in a state of
ﬂux. He thought that the essential material of the
universe was pure fire, some of which was being
extinguished to form the sea and earth, while some
pure ﬁre was always being kindled. Souls were also
composed of this ﬁre, and after death the souls of the
virtuous joined the cosmic ﬁre.
PARMENIDES, ZENO 
AND THE ELEATIC SCHOOL
Parmenides founded the Eleatic school of philoso-
phy (named after Elea where he lived) in the early
5th century BC. He believed that the essential matter
(“what exists”) was single, unchanging and indivisi-
ble. From this the universe was created. This theory
denied that there was any real motion or change in
the universe. Parmenides apparently considered that
a fundamental difference existed between the world
as explained by reason and the world as perceived by
the senses.
Zeno was a disciple of Parmenides and a member
of the Eleatic school of philosophy. He produced
arguments intended to reduce his opponents’ argu-
ments to absurdity by illustrating the contradictions
within them. His attacks were not against specific
theories but against popularly held beliefs that he
thought were erroneous. The way he framed his
arguments caused Aristotle to call him the “inventor
of dialectic.”
EMPEDOCLES
After his death (432 BC) Empedocles attracted a
number of apocryphal stories, casting doubt on some
of his writings, particularly since two of his poems
appear contradictory. One indicates a belief in the
transmigration of souls while another appears to
deny the existence of a soul. Nevertheless, both
works do appear to be genuine. While accepting
many arguments of the Eleatic school, Empedocles
did not accept the idea of a single indivisible element.
He proposed four “roots” or elements—earth, air,
ﬁre and water. He thought that these elements were
eternally distinct but were combined to create every-
thing. They continually combined and separated
under the inﬂuence of Love and Strife, which caused
the generation and dissolution of all “mortal” things.
Generation and dissolution therefore changed only
the combinations of the four elements. Empedocles
also proposed that Love and Strife alternately domi-
nated the cosmos, causing a cosmic cycle of genera-
tion and dissolution. Adapted by later philosophers,
Empedocles’ theory of the four elements dominated
natural science for nearly 2,000 years.
ANAXAGORAS OF CLAZOMENAE
The surviving evidence for the philosophy of
Anaxagoras (5th century BC) is difﬁcult to interpret,
but he apparently regarded the universe as com-
posed of “seeds” of every distinct substance, so that
A R T,  S C I E N C E
A N D P H I L O S O P H Y
419

“everything has a share of everything.” He thought
that changes in something occurred as a result of the
rearrangement of its constituent substances. He also
regarded mind or intelligence (nous) as separate from
other substances, omnipresent and eternal; nous was
the animating principle of all living things and the
initiator of cosmic motion. According to Anaxagoras
the Earth was ﬂat and supported by air, but the heav-
enly bodies rotated and the moon acquired light
from the sun. He apparently understood the princi-
ple of eclipses.
LEUCIPPUS AND DEMOCRITUS
Leucippus (mid- to late 5th century BC) originated
the atomic theory, believing that the universe was
composed of a large number of atoms that were com-
bined mechanically. This theory was evolved to
counter the arguments of the Eleatic school, which
denied all motion and change in the universe. Leu-
cippus was overshadowed by his pupil, Democritus,
and their individual work is extremely difficult to
separate. Their work sought to rehabilitate the idea
that the perceivable physical world was real (a con-
cept denied by the Eleatic school). They thought
that everything was created by the chance collision of
solid particles that were homogeneous and indivisi-
ble, and which continually moved through an inﬁnite
void in inﬁnite numbers.
SOCRATES
Socrates (469–399 BC) was initially interested in nat-
ural philosophy but abandoned this in favor of ethi-
cal inquiry. He pretended to know nothing himself
but relentlessly questioned those with pretensions to
wisdom, in order to show that their assumptions
were wrong. He attracted a diverse circle of friends
and young men wishing to learn from him. It was
Socrates’ integrity and philosophic lifestyle that had
the greatest impact on subsequent philosophers. He
wrote no books, and our knowledge of him comes
largely from the works of Plato, Aristophanes and
Xenophon. Socrates marks such a watershed in
Greek philosophy that Greek philosophers are
sometimes categorized as pre-Socratic or post-
Socratic. He believed that philosophers should study
ethics and human relationships rather than the nat-
ural and physical world. His inﬂuence on subsequent
philosophers moved philosophy away from natural
science and toward logic, ethics and morals.
PLATO AND THE ACADEMY
Plato (c. 429–347 BC) was one of Socrates’ disciples
and was greatly influenced by him. He withdrew
from Athens after Socrates’ death, but on his return
he established the Academy (Academeia or Kekade-
meia) school (c. 385 BC), over which he presided for
the next 40 years. It did not relate to the modern
meaning of the word academic, but was named after
the Attic hero Academus: the Academy was set up
where Academus was worshipped in a grove one mile
northwest of Athens. Academus had helped the
Dioscuri ﬁnd their sister Helen, who was abducted
from Sparta by Theseus. 
Plato’s writings do not provide a systematic expla-
nation of his views; this is partly because he does not
seem to have reached a final philosophical system
and partly because his views are put forward as a
series of dialogues, from which his philosophy has to
be interpreted. The ideas in these dialogues are com-
plex. For example, he believed that just by holding
the right opinions, it was possible to be a good man,
without knowing what goodness is; however, this was
a precarious state, since holding the right opinion
without knowing it is right leaves no method of judg-
ing whether a new idea is right or wrong.
Plato thought that objects of knowledge (includ-
ing abstract things such as “beauty”) were real,
whereas objects of mathematical knowledge, such as
“the ideal triangle,” existed only in the world of Ideas
or Forms. The relationship between the latter and
the real world is unclear. He thought that a duality
existed between the soul and the body, and that the
soul was aware of the world of Ideas before birth, so
that knowledge came from the soul’s recollection of
the world of Ideas. He therefore advocated cultiva-
tion of the soul and suppression of the body. In some
way (which he never explained), the Good was
beyond all other Ideas and was the cause of all things.
It was therefore the soul’s ambition to attain knowl-
edge of the Good. Plato’s philosophy was most
greatly inﬂuenced by Socrates, but other inﬂuences
included Heracleitus, Parmenides, Empedocles and
the Pythagoreans.

Plato’s primary aim in founding the Academy was
to give potential statesmen the necessary philosoph-
ical insight for governing. It is thought that the cur-
riculum was similar to the one described in Plato’s
Republic and probably included political theory,
mathematics and dialectic. It survived as an institu-
tion teaching philosophy and science until the
Roman emperor Justinian closed the philosophy
schools in Athens in AD 529, although it underwent
many changes during its long history.
In the Roman period in the 3rd century AD, a phi-
losophy of Neoplatonism was developed, based on
the philosophy of Plato but incorporating aspects of
other philosophers’ teachings, such as Aristotle and
the Stoics.
ARISTOTLE AND 
THE PERIPATETIC SCHOOL
Aristotle (384–322 BC) was a pupil of Plato at the
Academy, remaining there for 20 years until Plato’s
death. He then left Athens but returned in 335 BC
and founded his school, the Lyceum (in the area
around the shrine of Apollo Lyceios. It was also
known as the Peripatos—The Walk—and as the
Peripatetic school of philosophy). He developed a
comprehensive system covering every branch of phi-
losophy and science recognized in his day. Plato was
a major inﬂuence on Aristotle’s philosophy, but Aris-
totle rejected some aspects of Plato’s work. He was the
ﬁrst to examine the science of reasoning. He thought
that the universe must have a single unchanging cause
(an “unmoved mover” engaged in eternal contem-
plation or thought, who has no interest in the uni-
verse). He also explored the constituent elements of
natural things. He knew that the Earth was spherical,
but thought it was the center of the universe. He put
forward the proposition that the soul and body were
two aspects of a single being, but it is unclear
whether he held that the soul survived death. Aristo-
tle’s successor was Theophrastus.
In the realm of ethics Aristotle thought happi-
ness, achievement and success were the proper
human aims in life. Because so many of his writings
survived, and because they covered such a broad area
of philosophy and science, Aristotle’s inﬂuence on
later philosophers was immense, and parts of his
work were still being used in the 16th century.
CYNICS
The Cynics were a group of philosophers who fol-
lowed the principles of Antisthenes and Diogenes of
Sinope. Antisthenes was considered the founder of
the Cynics. He was a pupil of Socrates, but his views
differed from other pupils of Socrates, such as Plato.
Antisthenes thought that happiness was based on
virtue, and that virtue consisted of action and was a
practical quality that could be taught. He thought
that the mythical life of Heracles was an ideal exam-
ple. He believed that because happiness was derived
only from virtue, most pleasures did not bring hap-
piness; he also believed that a wise man could not act
unwisely, since once he had acquired a knowledge of
virtue, it could not be lost.
Diogenes was inﬂuenced by Antisthenes and
became the most famous exponent of the sect. He
rejected all conventional views of what contributed to
happiness and led an austere life, renouncing all pos-
sessions and relationships. He thought that happiness
would come from self-sufﬁciency, which could be
achieved by self-discipline and a loss of the conven-
tional sense of shame. Apparently it was the latter char-
acteristic that led to him being nicknamed kyon (dog),
from which the name Cynic (doglike) was derived. An
alternative derivation was from Cynosarges outside the
walls of Athens, where Antisthenes established a
school. Crates, a pupil of Diogenes, was also a famous
Cynic. The Cynics did not develop a philosophical sys-
tem or an organized school. Their common belief was
in self-sufﬁciency as a means of contentment, but they
otherwise held a range of differing views.
STOICS
The Stoic school of philosophy was named after the
Stoa Poikile in Athens. Here the founder of the
school, Zeno of Citium, taught in the early 3rd cen-
tury BC. This school of philosophy is sometimes
known as the Stoa. Inﬂuenced by the Cynics and by
Socratic philosophy, Zeno developed his own doc-
trines about logic, knowledge, physics and ethics. He
was succeeded by Cleanthes, who completed and sys-
tematized the Stoic doctrines, and in turn was suc-
ceeded by Chrysippus. The Stoic school continued
into the Roman period.
Stoicism was primarily a doctrine of detachment
from and independence of the world. The universe

was thought to be controlled by reason (logos), so that
whatever happened was divinely ordained by reason.
Consequently someone knowing this must accept
whatever happens and live in harmony with the divine
reason. The term logos combined the meaning of
speech and reason, and later philosophers used logos
for various divine principles or powers from which the
world originated. The Stoics thought that to live in
such acceptant harmony with the divine reason was
the only virtue. Failure to achieve willing acceptance
of whatever happened was regarded as moral weak-
ness. Stoics also held that everyone possessed a spark
of divine ﬁre within them, which led to the concept of
a universal fellowship, irrespective of race or status.
MEGARIAN SCHOOL
The Megarian school of philosophy was founded by
Eucleides of Megara. It adopted the beliefs of the
Eleatic school. Following the example of Zeno of
Elea, its members became known for their skilled
dialectical argument.
ARISTIPPUS OF CYRENE
There were two philosophers of this name, one the
grandson of the other, and some confusion exists
between them. The elder Aristippus was a pupil of
Socrates, but it was probably the younger Aristippus
who founded the Cyrenaic school of philosophy. Its
fundamental belief was that knowledge is based on
sensation and that the present moment is the only
reality, so immediate pleasure should be a person’s
primary aim in life. This was a more extreme hedo-
nistic doctrine than that of the Epicureans.
EPICUREANS
The Epicureans followed the philosophy of Epicurus
(341–270 BC): He was inﬂuenced by the philosophy
of Democritus and established his own philosophical
groups at Mytilene and Lampsacus. Around 307 BC
he settled in Athens, where he founded a community
(the Garden) of followers, including women and
slaves. They apparently lived in austere seclusion,
but their communal living attracted criticism and
mockery. The basis of his doctrine was a reliance on
the evidence of the senses and elimination of belief in
supernatural intervention and superstition. He
accepted the atomic theory of Democritus and
thought that the soul perished with the body. He
believed that happiness came from attaining a tran-
quillity of mind derived from a proper understanding
of the natural world, and that pleasure was identical
with good. He thought that the main aim in life was
freedom from trouble, but his philosophy was often
misrepresented as merely being the pursuit of plea-
sure, notably the pursuit of physical pleasure.
SCEPTICS
As a school of philosophy Scepticism was founded by
Pyrrhon, although sceptical attitudes formed part of
some philosophers’ teachings at a much earlier date.
Pyrrhon believed that knowledge of the true nature
of things was unattainable, because the senses were
unreliable and the teachings of dogmatic philoso-
phers were contradictory. The aim of Sceptic
philosophers was to achieve tranquillity by following
the appearance of things, but suspending judgment
and avoiding commitment and dogmatism.
SCIENCE
Introduction
The ancient Greeks made little distinction between
science and philosophy, and no specialization of dif-
ferent disciplines existed within science, as today.
Philosophers might study astronomy, and mathe-
maticians might evolve a world view including moral
codes. Many philosophers were heavily involved in
some kind of scientiﬁc study, and the level of avail-
able detailed knowledge was sufﬁciently low that one
person might master a number of different branches
of learning. Although the Greeks did not divide sci-
ence into a number of separate disciplines, it is con-
venient to consider Greek science in relation to some
modern subdivisions of the subject.
Mathematics
This was the area of science that most interested the
Greeks and in which they had greatest success. The

Egyptians were thought to have invented geometry,
and Thales was credited with introducing geometry
to Greece from Egypt. The Egyptians were practical
mathematicians, however, and had no conception of
the deductive proof of a mathematical principle,
which was invented by the Greeks. The Greeks also
introduced the use of a chain of theorems to develop
a mathematical subject.
Pythagorean philosophers attempted to explain the
order underlying the universe in terms of numbers,
which led to an emphasis on arithmetic and the theory
of numbers, rather than the process of calculation and
the solving of particular problems. Discovery of ﬂaws
in the theory of numbers switched attention to geom-
etry, which developed rapidly over a period of 300
years. It culminated in the work of Euclid (who sys-
tematized previous work), Archimedes and Apollonius
of Perge (who developed new areas of geometrical
research). This development of pure mathematics was
paralleled by the use of applied mathematics in the
related disciplines of astronomy and physics.
Astronomy
The study of astronomy was often based on astrol-
ogy, as it was believed that heavenly bodies were
associated with different gods and had an effect on
the Earth. The same word (astrologia) covered both
disciplines. Astronomy was important for navigation,
timekeeping and regulating the agricultural year.
The Egyptians and Babylonians already used some
astronomical cycles for navigation and for maintain-
ing a calendar, and the Greeks also used astronomy
for these purposes. The pre-Socratic philosophers
began to rationalize the study of astronomy, which
greatly beneﬁted from the use of mathematics. Geo-
metrical systems were used to represent the observed
motions of heavenly bodies, an idea that probably
began with Anaximander. The Pythagoreans laid the
foundation of the science by greatly increasing the
use of mathematics in astronomy. The study of
astronomy increased with the diffusion of knowledge
from Mesopotamia.
In the 4th century BC Eudoxus of Cnidus was able
to use mathematics to propose how the observed
irregular motions of the planets could be the result of
regular circular motions. His work was improved and
expanded by Callipus. Difﬁculties in this system led
to it being replaced by improved systems devised by
later astronomers. All these systems put the Earth at
the center of the universe, but in the 3rd century BC
Aristarchus proposed a more accurate system that
placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Other
astronomers were not prepared to accept that the
stars were so far away, as would be necessary for this
system, and so it was not adopted. In fact the Greek
system (revised by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD),
which had the planets revolving around the Earth,
was accepted as accurate for nearly 1,400 years.
There were attempts to predict eclipses of the Sun
and Moon. Eclipses that are mentioned in ancient
literature can now be dated, and in turn this enables
actual events that coincided with such eclipses to be
precisely dated.
Physics
Physics, as the study of all aspects of the natural world
(physeos, nature), began with the work of the philoso-
phers Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes in the
6th century BC. They were convinced that there was
an order that governed the diverse natural phenomena
and attempted to ﬁnd this order and explain the world
and its origins. Their search for a unifying hypothesis
rejected the supernatural agencies that were invoked
by others, and relied on rational explanations. The
deductive logic of Parmenides and followers of the
Eleatic school brought an end to such speculation
about the natural world, by apparently proving that
the material from which the universe was made was
single, unchanging and indivisible, leaving no room
for theories about change or development.
Following this impasse, two important theories
were developed. Empedocles originated the theory
of four basic physical elements (earth, air, fire,
water), which was later adopted by the Academy, the
Peripatetic school and the Stoics. The atomic theory
was developed by Leucippus and Democritus, and
was later adopted in a modiﬁed form by the Epicure-
ans. These two theories dominated natural science
until the 16th century.
What was lacking in ancient Greek physics was
the use of systematic experimentation and the for-
mulation of speciﬁc laws. Rare examples of the latter
are Pythagoras’ laws of musical harmony and
Archimedes’ law of leverage.

Zoology
From earliest times ancient Greeks were interested
in the origin of life, particularly human life. The
belief that animals and humans sprang from the
earth occurs in Greek mythology, but with the devel-
opment of philosophy, rational explanations were
sought. In the 6th century BC Anaximander advanced
the theory that the first living beings, enclosed in
prickly membranes, came from primeval liquid that
was evaporated by the sun. He also realized that the
ﬁrst creatures would need some sort of protection,
not having parents to protect them in early life.
Despite claims to the contrary, he does not appear to
have had any idea of the principles of evolution.
Although speculation about the origins of life are
found in the works of other philosophers, the only
philosophers to consider zoology in any detail were
Aristotle and possibly Hippocrates. A work on zool-
ogy exists in the Hippocratic Corpus (which may not
have been written by Hippocrates), while Aristotle
wrote several treatises on zoology. The most impor-
tant were History of Animals, On the Generation of Ani-
mals, On the Parts of Animals, On the Motion of
Animals and On the Progression of Animals. The care-
ful description and classiﬁcation of these works laid
the foundation of systematic zoology.
Botany
As a source of food, drink and medicine, plants were
of interest to the Greeks from earliest times, but
were often surrounded by superstition. Some early
philosophers put forward rational speculations about
plants, but it is not until the 4th century BC that any
great interest was taken in botany. Philosophers of
both the Academy and the Lyceum were interested
in botany. Aristotle regarded plants as a lower order
than animals, but although numerous references to
botany occur in his work, he did not produce the
same detailed study of plants as he did of animals.
Aristotle’s work inﬂuenced Theophrastus who pro-
duced two works on botany, History of Plants and
Causes of Plants. Plants were the main source of med-
icines, and so an overlap existed between medicine
and botany. Physicians such as Diocles and Crateuas
produced herbals that are also very important for the
history of botany. Drugs formed an important basis
of the practice of medicine, and the inclusion of
many botanical ingredients was based on folklore,
with many being of no beneﬁt to the patient or even
being poisonous. Other ingredients of drugs were
spices, animal products such as fats, blood and
beeswax, vegetable products such as sesame and lin-
seed oil, as well as perfumes. Apart from medicines,
puriﬁcation ceremonies were also believed to cure
patients of polluting diseases.
Anatomy
Despite the fact that wounds were described with
anatomical accuracy in works such as Homer’s Iliad,
the treatises in the Hippocratic Corpus show that
even in the early 4th century BC there was little
anatomical knowledge, and that knowledge was prob-
ably not based on dissection or vivisection of animals
or humans. Greek religion prohibited human dissec-
tion, and although Diocles was said to have been the
ﬁrst to write a work on anatomy, he was describing
animal anatomy. Human dissection was not under-
taken systematically until the 3rd century BC, when
Herophilus and Erasistratus carried out anatomical
research at Alexandria, under the protection of the
Ptolemies. Their work attained a high level of sophis-
tication and was not surpassed for many centuries. In
optics, it was variously believed that emissions from
an object entered the eye or that a type of fire or
visual ray led from the eye to an object.
Medicine
DISEASES
Plague is a term used by ancient historians to describe
any major epidemic of infectious disease. The “plague
of Athens” was a major event in 430–426 BC, but the
precise nature of the disease is uncertain, possibly
typhus or smallpox rather than true plague, which
does appear in the Hellenistic period. Apart from
typhus and smallpox, other diseases are known, many
from the evidence of excavated skeletal remains, and
they include malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy (from the
Hellenistic period) and cancers. Most prevalent were
malaria (kausos, wasting disease) and tuberculosis
( phthsis, wasting). There is no evidence for cholera.

RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY
From earliest times the treatment of sickness and
disease was the province of religion. Various gods
were regarded as healing deities, but from the 5th
century BC Asclepius became the preeminent healing
god. Asclepius and other healing deities had sanctu-
aries where an illness could be diagnosed and various
remedies prescribed. It was thought that the temple
of Asclepius at Cos was the origin of Greek medi-
cine, but this temple was not built until the late 4th
century BC.
The practice of rational medicine grew out of
attempts by early philosophers to examine and
explain natural phenomena. Over 60 medical treatises
form the Hippocratic Corpus, but their authorship is
uncertain. They deal with causes and symptoms of
disease in rational terms, without invoking supernat-
ural agencies. Although initially beneﬁcial there was
potential danger in the philosophical approach to
medicine—the clash between the strictly rational
approach of the philosopher and the empirical
approach of the physician. One work in the Hippo-
cratic Corpus (Nature of Man) advanced the theory of
four humors (blood, black bile, yellow bile and
phlegm), which was a medical analogue of the four
elements (air, earth, ﬁre and water). Although philo-
sophical in origin, this theory was claimed to be
empirically justiﬁed, and it came to dominate medi-
cine for the next 2,000 years.
Probably to explain the similarities between some
later practices in healing sanctuaries and those used
by rational physicians, it was said that Hippocrates
had studied medicine at the temple of Asclepius on
Cos, but this was inaccurate. Similarities between
later healing practices in temples of Asclepius (Ascle-
pieia) and Hippocratic medicine are most likely to
have arisen due to the inﬂuence of rational medicine
on temple priests. Rational medicine did not supplant
temple medicine; rather, religious healing shrines
employed a mixture of religion, magic and rational
medicine to effect cures. However, the religious
taboo on human dissection held back the continued
development of rational medicine until the Hellenis-
tic period.
From the 5th century BC dietetics became an
established part of medicine. Dietetics originally
formed the regime adopted by those training for the
games, but physicians began to prescribe certain
regimes for treating some ailments. They formulated
rules, based on all the factors inﬂuencing the body
and designed to regulate in detail all aspects of the
patient’s life. In time such regimes were recom-
mended for healthy people to prevent illness.
Although physicians admitted that the poor could
not afford to carry out such regimes properly, they
urged the rich to do so. This resulted in the rich
becoming nervous and overconscious of their health
and tending to refrain from any useful activity. See
also chapter 8, HEALING SANCTUARIES AND SHRINES.
GYNECOLOGY
In Hippocratic medicine, women were a different
race to men, not just in their reproductive organs.
They were wetter and softer than men and so
required different treatments. Later on, they came to
be regarded as reverse males, as the lack of under-
standing of internal anatomy persisted. One treat-
ment for women’s gynecological problems was
fumigation, as the vapors were thought to pass
through the mouth to the womb and to resolve prob-
lems—the notion existed that the womb (hystera,
“lower parts”) wandered round the body and caused
various ailments, including respiratory problems.
In Hippocratic medicine, menstruation was essen-
tial to a woman’s well-being. It was believed to start in
a girl’s 14th year, supposedly due to the increased
absorption of ﬂuids that needed to be evacuated to
prevent disease. Menstruation was a sign that the
womb was open to receive the male seed, the best time
for conception being toward the end of the menstrual
period, in contrast to later taboos. Folded rags are
known to have been used by women for protection.
Intercourse and pregnancy were also deemed neces-
sary for a woman’s health. The menopause is not dis-
cussed by any female writer, but was thought to occur
because women dried out as they became older. See
also CHILDREN (pp. 445–446).
PHYSICIANS
At ﬁrst the status of a physician was not much higher
than that of a skilled craftsman. Physicians tended to
move from town to town, setting up a workshop or
surgery (iatreion), from which to work. A physician
would have pupils, bound to him by a legal contract,
who acted as assistants and nurses. No formal train-
ing or qualiﬁcations were needed. Some physicians

were slaves, although they may have been engaged
solely in treating illnesses of other slaves. There were
also some state physicians, but very little is known
about them.
Hippocrates was the most famous physician of
rational Greek medicine. He lived from the late 5th
century into the 4th century BC, but despite his fame
little is known about him. Many works on medicine
were attributed to him (the Hippocratic Corpus),
although there is no evidence that he wrote any of
them. The status of physicians rose in the Hellenistic
period, mainly because of the school of physicians in
Alexandria in Egypt, where medical research was
carried out unhindered by religious prohibitions and
where systematic medical instruction was given to
pupils.
SURGERY
Descriptions of the treatment of wounds occur in
Homer’s Iliad. Together with the evidence of early
Greek surgical instruments, this suggests that
surgery before Classical times was derived from
medical practices in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The
Hippocratic Corpus contains a number of works on
various aspects of surgery, dealing mainly with
wounds, fractures and dislocations. These works
reﬂect the development of a high degree of skill and
knowledge of the subject, and contain detailed direc-
tions for preparing an operating room, making a
diagnosis, carrying out various operations, dressing
wounds and treating fractures. Dentistry was also
performed, including extractions and use of gold
wire to secure loose teeth. Fillings were unknown.
In the 3rd century BC surgery beneﬁted from an
increased knowledge of anatomy that resulted from
dissections carried out in the Alexandrian school.
Twenty different operations were devised for the
treatment of various disorders of the eye, showing a
great advance in opthalmology that was not sur-
passed until the 18th century.
Engineering
The elements of engineering needed for agriculture
and industry were discovered before the end of the
Dark Age, many apparently inherited from earlier
civilizations. Despite impressive architectural and
artistic achievements, the Greeks were not responsi-
ble for many important engineering innovations.
Inventions that can be credited to them include the
gear, screw, rotary mills, screw press, bronzecasting
techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion cata-
pult and the use of steam to operate some experi-
mental machines and toys. Many of these inventions
occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by
the need to improve weapons and tactics in war.
No power sources were effectively utilized. Even
the traction power of animals was limited by the lack
of an efﬁcient harness. High value does not appear to
have been placed on material progress, and inven-
tions were utilized slowly. Only in warfare were
mechanical inventions developed and used to any
great extent, mainly because improved defensive for-
tiﬁcations could be overcome only by improved siege
engines (see chapter 3). Consequently gifted inven-
tors like Archimedes were mainly employed as mili-
tary engineers, and their other inventions were
regarded as of secondary importance.
The failure of the Greeks to develop their tech-
nology has sometimes been attributed to the easy
availability of slave labor, removing the need to
develop labor-saving devices. However, slavery in
Egypt apparently did not inhibit technological devel-
opment. A more likely explanation was the Greek
attitude to the social status of people providing labor.
Manual labor was despised, and anyone attempting
to apply science to it was likely to lose status in soci-
ety, removing much of the incentive to seek techno-
logical innovation. A sophisticated tunnel built for
water in the 6th century BC by the engineer Eupali-
nos at Samos has led to some reevaluation of the
engineering skills of the Greeks.
Meteorology
Initially natural phenomena, such as wind, rain,
meteors, thunder and lightning, were attributed to
the actions of supernatural agencies. With the
growth of philosophy and the interest of philoso-
phers in all aspects of the universe, rational explana-
tions were provided instead. Aristotle classiﬁed many
phenomena in his Meteorologica, and his study was
continued by Theophrastus and the Epicureans.

PHILOSOPHERS
AND SCIENTISTS:
BIOGRAPHIES
Following is a list of the major philosophers and sci-
entists, with the Greek version of their name, in ital-
ics. See also INDIVIDUAL PHILOSOPHIES (p. 418).
Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (Anaxagoras):
c.
500–c. 428 BC. A philosopher who moved to Athens
at the age of 20 and was the first philosopher to
reside there. He was the teacher and friend of Peri-
cles. He was indicted by enemies of Pericles on
charges of impiety, but escaped from Athens, proba-
bly to Lampsacus, where he founded a school and
remained until his death.
Anaxarchus of Abdera (Anaxarkhos):
Fourth-
century BC philosopher, a follower of Democritus
and teacher of Pyrrhon. He accompanied Alexander
the Great on his campaigns in Asia. He was put to
death by the Cypriot prince Nicocreon.
Anaximander of Miletus (Anaximandros):
c. 610–
c. 546 BC. A philosopher and astronomer. He was
credited with writing the ﬁrst philosophic treatise in
prose, On the World, introducing the gnomon into
Greece, setting up the ﬁrst Greek sundial at Sparta
and an astronomical model of the heavens, and draw-
ing the ﬁrst map of the Earth. He also rationalized
astronomy.
Anaximenes of Miletus (Anaximenes):
Born in
Miletus c. 526 BC, ﬂoruit c. 546 BC. A philosopher
who wrote a book on the subject.
Antiochus of Ascalon (Antiokhos):
Born c. 130–120
BC, died c. 68 BC. A philosopher and pupil of Philon
of Larissa at Athens. He accompanied him to Rome
in 88 BC and met the Roman general Lucullus. In
79–78 BC he was head of the Academy in Athens
when it was attended by Cicero. He joined Lucullus
during the Second Mithridatic War in 73 BC.
Antiphon (Antiphon):
A 5th-century BC sophist
from Athens, possibly the same man as the orator
Antiphon of Rhamnus.
Antisthenes (Antisthenes):
c. 445–360 
BC.
A
philosopher and founder of what became known as
the Cynic school of philosophy. He was a pupil of
Socrates and later established a school at Cynosarges
outside the walls of Athens.
Apollodorus of Alexandria (Apollodoros):
Early
3rd-century BC physician and scientist, who wrote
On Poisonous Creatures and a work on pharmacology.
Apollonius of Perge (Apollonios):
Second half of
3rd century BC, a mathematician who studied at
Alexandria and possibly worked at Rhodes, Perga-
mum and Ephesus. He composed Conics, a work in
eight books (much of which survives, some in Ara-
bic), as well as several other works. He also worked
on theoretical astronomy, and as a mathematician
ranked second only to Archimedes.
Arcesilaus (Arkesilaos):
c. 316–242 BC. A philoso-
pher from Pitane in Aeolia who studied philosophy
under Theophrastus. He became head of the Acad-
emy. He followed the Socratic practice of argument
and debate, without reaching conclusions, and prob-
ably published nothing. His main moral principle
was to follow what is reasonable (to eulogon).
Archimedes (Arkhimedes):
287–212 BC. Born at
Syracuse, son of the astronomer Pheidias. He was one
of the greatest Greek mathematicians and an inven-
tor, physicist and astronomer. He probably studied at
Alexandria and then lived at the court of Hieron II of
Syracuse. He was killed in the Roman siege of Syra-
cuse. Several of his mathematical treatises survive in
Greek (and two in Arabic) on various topics such as
the circle, sphere and cylinder. They include On the
Sphere and Cylinder, On Floating Bodies (the science of
hydrostatics, invented by him), On Spirals, Method of
Mechanical Theorems and The Sand-Reckoner (a means
of expressing huge numbers in words). He exclaimed
the famous eureka (I have found it) on discovering
how to determine the proportions of gold and silver
in a crown made for Hieron.

Archytas (Arkhytas):
Early 4th century BC. A
mathematician and Pythagorean philosopher from
Tarentum and a successful general. Fragments of his
mathematical works survive.
Aristaeus of Croton (Aristaios):
Son-in-law of
Pythagoras. He apparently wrote works on mathe-
matics.
Aristarchus of Samos (Aristarkhos):
First half of
3rd century BC. An astronomer who is famous for
the heliocentric theory that the Sun and stars are
ﬁxed and the Earth moves around the Sun. His only
extant treatise is On the sizes and distances of the Sun
and Moon. He studied under Straton of Lampsacus.
Aristippus of Cyrene (the elder) (Aristippos):
Uncertain date, but a pupil of Socrates. He was
apparently a teacher of rhetoric, and at one time a
courtier of Dionysius I. He was sometimes thought
to have founded the Cyrenaic school of philosophy,
but this was probably his grandson Aristippus the
younger.
Aristippus of Cyrene (the younger) (Aristippos):
Uncertain date. Grandson of Aristippus the elder
through the latter’s daughter Arete. He probably
founded the Cyrenaic school of philosophy, which
held a more extreme hedonistic doctrine than the
Epicureans.
Aristotle (Aristoteles):
384–322 BC. A philosopher
and author of books covering every branch of philos-
ophy and science. He was born at Stagira in Chal-
cidice. His father was Nicomachus, a member of the
Asclepiadae medical guild. Aristotle may have spent
his youth at the royal court at Pella. He entered the
Academy at Athens at the age of 17. He remained
there until Plato’s death (347 BC), then left to join a
group of Platonists at Assus in Mysia. There he mar-
ried Pythias, niece of Hermias (ruler of Assus and
nearby Atarneus). After the fall and death of Her-
mias in 345 BC, Aristotle went to Mytilene where he
collaborated with Theophrastus in zoological
research and taught until 343/342 BC.
Aristotle was next invited by Philip II of Macedo-
nia to be tutor to his son Alexander, then 13 years
old. In 335 BC Alexander the Great succeeded to the
throne and started on his expedition to Asia, so Aris-
totle returned to Athens and set up his school, the
Lyceum (see chapter 7, EDUCATION). Here Aristotle
also collected a library of manuscripts and maps and
a museum of natural objects. During this period
Pythias died, and afterward Aristotle lived with Her-
pyllis, by whom he had a son, Nicomachus. During
the anti-Macedonian period in Athens, following the
death of Alexander, Aristotle was charged with impi-
ety. He left Athens and retired to Chalcis, where he
died.
Aristotle wrote a large number of works, some
now lost, and many others may have been attributed
to him incorrectly. They fall broadly into three cate-
gories: early popular works on philosophy, large col-
lections of historical and scientific facts and
philosophical and scientific works. Most surviving
material comes from the latter category. Extant
works include Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, Top-
ics, Physics, On the Heavens, Inquiry into Animals, On
the Soul, Politics, On Interpretation, Metaphysics and
Rhetoric.
Aristoxenus (Aristoxenos):
Born between 375 and
360 BC. A philosopher and musical theorist, famous
for his works on rhythm and harmonics. He was
born at Tarentum and received musical training from
his father, Spintharus, and from Lamprus of Ery-
thrae. He lived at Mantinea and Corinth and then
studied at Athens, ﬁrst under Xenophilus and then
under Aristotle. He was passed over for the headship
of the Lyceum in favor of Theophrastus. He wrote
various works, parts of which survive, including Prin-
ciples and Elements of Harmonics, Elements of Rhythm,
On Music, On Melody, Pythagorean Maxims, Political
Laws and Historical Notes.
Asclepiades (Asklepiades):
Floruit 1st century BC.
A physician from Prusa in Bithynia. He studied
rhetoric in Athens and was inﬂuenced by the philos-
ophy of Epicurus and Heracleides Ponticus. He was
opposed to the theory of humors and relied on diet
rather than drugs for treatment. He became an inﬂu-
ential physician in Rome.
Autolycus of Pitane (Autolykos):
Late 4th century
BC. Astronomer and author of two astronomical
works on spherical astronomy, On the Moving Sphere

and On Risings and Settings—the earliest complete
surviving Greek mathematical treatises.
Bion the Borysthenite (Bion):
c. 325–c. 255 BC. A
philosopher. The son of a freedman and a former
hetaera of Borysthenes. His family was sold into slav-
ery after his father committed a fraud. Bion, how-
ever, received a good education and was eventually
freed. He studied in various philosophical schools in
Athens, but did not become a follower of any partic-
ular school. He spent much of his life wandering
from city to city, earning a living by lecturing and
teaching. He popularized the diatribe (amusement,
discussion) as a written sermon so that it could reach
a wider audience. His humorous but sharp attacks 
in these works gave the diatribe its connotation of
abusiveness.
Callippus (Kallippos):
Late-4th-century BC astrono-
mer from Cyzicus who worked with Aristotle in
Athens. He proposed a year of 365 1/4 days. He
improved Eudoxus of Cnidus’ theory of movement
of the Sun, Moon and stars by introducing additional
spheres.
Carneades (Karneades):
c. 213–129 BC. A philoso-
pher from Cyrene, the son of Epicomus or Philoco-
mus. He studied at the Academy in Athens and then
became its head some time before 155 BC. He retired
around 137 BC on the grounds of age.
Cebes of Thebes (Kebes):
Fourth-century BC
Pythagorean philosopher. He was a pupil of Philo-
laus. According to Plato, Cebes was one of those who
took part in the discussion on immortality just before
Socrates drank hemlock.
Chrysippus (Khrysippos):
c. 280–207 BC. A Stoic
philosopher, the son of Apollonius of Soli. He moved
to Athens c. 260 BC and attended the lectures of
Arcesilaus at the Academy. He was later converted to
Stoicism by Cleanthes, whom he succeeded as head
of the Stoic school of philosophy in 232 BC.
Cleanthes (Kleanthes):
c. 331–232 BC. A Stoic
philosopher, the son of Phanias of Assus. He studied
under Zeno of Citium at Athens, where he later
became head of the Stoic school of philosophy.
Cleitomachus (Kleitomakhos):
c. 186–109 BC. A
philosopher who was Carthaginian, originally named
Hasdrubal. He moved to Athens and studied at the
Academy under Carneades. He established his own
school of philosophy, but returned to the Academy
with his followers and later became its head. He
was said to have written over 400 books, but none
survive.
Colotes of Lampsacus (Kolotes):
An Epicurean
philosopher, 4th–3rd centuries BC. He was a pupil
and fanatical admirer of Epicurus. He wrote works
trying to show that adherence to the teachings of
earlier philosophers would make life impossible,
including Against Plato’s “Lysis” and Against the
“Republic”.
Conon of Samos (Konon):
Third-century BC
astronomer and mathematician, much admired by
Archimedes. Little is known of his work, but he
apparently discovered the constellation Coma
Berenices (Lock of Berenice).
Crantor (Krantor):
Late 4th to early 3rd centuries
BC. A philosopher from Soli in Cilicia. He moved to
Athens to study at the Academy under Xenocrates
and Polemon. He wrote many works, of which only
fragments survive. His most famous work, On Grief,
was much admired by later writers.
Crates of Thebes (Krates):
c. 365–285 BC. A
Cynic philosopher. He was the son of Ascondas of
Thebes. At Athens he initially studied the philosophy
of the Megarian school but was converted to Cyni-
cism by Diogenes of Sinope. He decided to live a life
of wandering and poverty with his wife Hipparchia,
who shared his philosophical beliefs.
Crateuas (Krateuas):
Floruit early 1st century BC.
A botanist and physician to Mithridates VI. He
wrote at least two works—an herbal illustrated with
colored drawings of plants (of which fragments sur-
vive) and a work on the pharmacological use of
plants.
Cratylus (Kratylos):
Floruit late 5th century BC. A
philosopher who developed Heracleitus’ theory of
constant change to an extreme level.

Critolaus of Phaselis (Kritolaos):
Floruit 2nd cen-
tury BC. A philosopher who was a head of the Peri-
patetic school of philosophy in Athens and revived
the philosophical and scientiﬁc work of the school,
which had begun to ﬂag. Only fragments of his writ-
ings survive.
Ctesibius (Ktesibios):
Floruit c. 275–260 BC. An
inventor from Alexandria, the most famous of his
day, who worked under the Ptolemies. He had an
interest in pneumatics and various mechanical
devices. His inventions included a torsion catapult,
air catapult, water organ, the first accurate water
clock, a force pump with cylinder and plunger, and
ingenious toys.
Democedes (Demokedes):
Sixth-century BC physi-
cian of great repute, from Croton. He practiced in
Aegina and Athens, then at the court of Polycrates of
Samos. In 522 BC he became court physician of Dar-
ius I, later returning to Croton.
Democritus (Demokritos):
A philosopher, born at
Abdera c. 460 BC. He traveled widely in Egypt and
Asia as far as India and visited Athens. He was taught
by Leucippus and possibly by Anaxagoras. Over 60
works are attributed to him, covering as broad a
range of philosophy and science as that covered by
Aristotle. About 300 fragments from his works sur-
vive. He was said to have lived to a great age, but the
date of his death is unknown.
Diocles (Diokles):
Possibly c. 200 BC. A mathe-
matician who wrote On Burning-Mirrors, important
in the history of conic sections.

he was the second most famous physician and the
ﬁrst to write in Attic. He was especially renowned for
his medical writings.
Diogenes 
of 
Apollonia (Diogenes):
Floruit
440/425 BC. An Eclectic philosopher (one who col-
lects and amalgamates elements from different
philosophies). He was probably from Apollonia in
Phrygia. He revived the views of Anaximenes, but
was also influenced by the work of Empedocles,
Anaxagoras and Leucippus. He wrote a number of
works, including On Nature, Against the Sophists,
Meteorology and Nature of Man. His work on the
arrangement of veins in the body was quoted by Aris-
totle.
Diogenes of Seleucia (sometimes called Dio-
genes of Babylon) (Diogenes):
c. 240–152 BC. A

c. 400–325 BC. A
philosopher, the main proponent of the Cynic school
of philosophy. He moved to Athens after he and/or
his father Hicesias (who was in charge of the mint at
Sinope) was accused of adulterating the coinage.
From his lifestyle he became known as “dog” (kyon),
a possible origin of the name Cynic (meaning “dog-
like”). He did not develop a comprehensive system of
philosophy, but he was influential through his
lifestyle and his pointed remarks.
Echecrates of Philius (Ekhekrates):
Floruit c. 367
BC. A Pythagorean philosopher, he was one of the
last members of the Pythagorean school of philoso-
phy.

c. 492–c. 432 BC. A
philosopher and poet. He was the son of Meton, an
aristocrat who was born at Acragas in Sicily. He sup-
ported democracy there and allegedly refused the
kingship. He was later exiled and ﬂed to the Pelo-
ponnese. He combined the roles of philosopher, sci-
entist, poet and statesman. He pioneered the theory
of the four main elements—earth, air, ﬁre and water.
Many fragments survive from his two books, written
in verse, On Nature and Puriﬁcations.
Epicurus (Epikouros):
24 January 341–270 BC. A
philosopher, the son of Chaerestrate and Neocles (an
Athenian) (ﬁg. 9.18). He was born in Samos and as a
boy was taught by the Platonist Pamphilus. At the
age of 18 he was required to go to Athens as an ephe-
bos. He later rejoined his family, who had moved to
Colophon. At some stage, he studied under Nausi-
phanes. At the age of 32 he moved to Mytilene and
then to Lampsacus. In both places he established

schools of philosophy. Around 307/306 BC he
returned to Athens and bought a house with a gar-
den, where he set up the Epicurean school of philos-
ophy, which became known as “the Garden.” Apart
from some visits to Asia, he remained in Athens until
his death. He bequeathed his library and the garden
to Hermarchus of Mytilene to ensure the continua-
tion of the school. Epicurus wrote a great deal, most
of which is lost.

First half of 3rd cen-
tury BC. A physician from Ceos. He probably studied
philosophy, then practiced medicine at Alexandria 
or possibly Antioch. He was a younger contemporary
of Herophilus and continued the latter’s anatomical
research, distinguishing between motor and sensory
nerves. His work on blood circulation was not sur-
passed until the 17th century. His books were still read
in the 4th century AD, but only fragments survive.
Eucleides of Megara (Eukleides):
c. 450–380 BC.
A philosopher. He was an associate of Socrates and
founded the Megarian school of philosophy, in
which logic and logical paradoxes were a central con-
cern. Plato and other philosophers took refuge with
him at Megara after Socrates’ death in 399 BC.
Euclid (Eukleides):
Floruit c. 300 BC. A mathe-
matician who lived and taught at Alexandria under
Ptolemy I, but little else is known of him. His text-
book Stoicheia (Elements) in 13 books was so famous
that “Euclid” became virtually synonymous with
geometry. He also wrote other works on geometry.
The term QED apparently derived from Euclid—
quod erat demonstrandum, a Latin translation of his
original Greek hoper edei deixai. Until the 12th cen-
tury his work was only known in Arabic.
Eudemus of Rhodes (Eudemos):
Floruit late 4th
century BC. A philosopher. He was a pupil of Aristo-
tle and may have been in line to succeed Aristotle as
head of the Lyceum, though it was Theophrastus
who actually succeeded Aristotle. Little is known
about his life. He wrote extensively, possibly orga-
nizing and clarifying Aristotle’s work, but only frag-
ments have survived.
Eudoxus of Cnidus (Eudoxos):
c. 400–c. 350 BC.
An outstanding mathematician, and also astronomer,
geographer and philosopher. He apparently spent
time in Egypt and also at the court of Mausolus and
at Athens. None of his works survive, but some of his
work on geometry was included in Euclid’s Elements.
Eudoxus undertook research on the movement of
planets and stars, and calculated the circumference of
the Earth. Aratus’ poem Phaenomena was based on
Eudoxus’ description of constellations.
Gorgias (Gorgias):
Born at Leontini in Sicily c.
480 BC. One of the most inﬂuential sophists and a
teacher of rhetoric. He was possibly the pupil of

duced his style of oratory. He was said to have lived
to 100, dying c. 380 BC.
Heracleides Ponticus (Herakleides):
Floruit 4th
century BC. Philosopher, astronomer and writer. He
was born into an aristocratic family at Heraclea Pon-
tica. He studied under Aristotle and Speusippus at the
Academy. After the death of Speusippus, he was nar-
rowly defeated in the election for leadership of the
Academy. He returned to Heraclea and may have set
up his own school of philosophy. He wrote on a wide
range of subjects, but only fragments have survived.
Heracleitus or Heraclitus (Herakleitos):
Born c.
540 BC. Floruit c. 500 BC. A philosopher, and son of
Bloson of Ephesus, he was probably of royal blood
and was said to have given up any claim to kingship
in favor of his brother. Over 100 small fragments of
his work survive. Possibly died 480–470 BC.
Hermarchus of Mytilene (Hermarkhos):
Floruit
3rd century BC. An Epicurean philosopher, he stud-
ied under Epicurus at Mytilene, before the school
moved to Lampsacus in 310 BC. He became head of
the school after the death of Epicurus in 270 BC. Epi-
curus bequeathed him his library and revenues to
support the school of philosophy.
Herophilus (Herophilos):
Early 3rd century BC,
from Chalcedon. One of the leading physicians at
Alexandria (with Erasistratus). He is known particu-
larly for anatomical research, apparently undertaking
human dissection on criminals. His work on speciﬁc
organs was famous; he also discovered the rhythm of
the pulse and used drugs extensively. Many of his
technical terms have passed into common usage.
Hipparchus of Nicaea (Hipparkhos):
c. 190–after
126 BC. Astronomer from Nicaea (Bithynia) who
lived and worked mainly at Rhodes. He systemati-
cally used trigonometry and old Babylonian records
dating from the 8th century BC to undertake astro-
nomical calculations. He also adopted a sexagesimal
system and transformed astronomy into a predictive
science. He is particularly famous for the discovery of
the precession of the equinoxes and determining the
sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon. He com-
piled a list of lunar eclipses at Babylon from the 8th
century BC to his own time. He probably invented
the plane astrolabe. Much is known from the 2nd-
century-AD Almagest of the Greco-Roman scientist
Ptolemy (an astronomical textbook). His only surviv-
ing work is a commentary on Phaenomena by Aratus.
Hippasus of Metapontum (Hippasos):
Floruit 5th
century BC. A Pythagorean philosopher who was
apparently punished for revealing a mathematical
secret of the Pythagoreans.
Hippocrates of Chios (Hippokrates):
c. 470–400
BC. A mathematician who wrote the ﬁrst Elements of
Geometry (now lost), a forerunner of Euclid’s Elements.
Hippocrates of Cos (Hippokrates):
Traditional
dates c. 460–380 BC. A physician about whom very
little is known. He apparently died at Larissa (Thes-
saly). A collection of some 60 medical works known as
the Hippocratic Corpus is in the Ionic dialect; as the
works were written between c. 430 and 330 BC (pos-
sibly later), they may represent the library associated
with the Hippocratic school of medicine at the heal-
ing shrine of Asclepius on Cos. They include On
Ancient Medicine, On the Sacred Disease (epilepsy), On
Airs, Waters, Places and Epidemics. Hippocrates’ own
works seem to be lost, as no works in the Hippocratic
Corpus can be deﬁnitely attributed to him. He was
regarded as the ideal physician, to whom the Hippo-
cratic Oath was attributed. He was famous from the
time of Plato.
Lacydes of Cyrene (Lakydes):

Athenians in 441/440 BC. Date of death unknown.
Menedemus of Eretria (Menedemos):
c. 339–265
BC. A philosopher. He was sent to Megara on mili-
tary service and became involved in philosophy
there. He studied under Stilpon and moved to Elis to
join the school founded by Phaedon. He became
leader of this school and transferred it to Eretria. He
was actively involved in politics and attained high
ofﬁce, but his opponents forced him into exile. He
retreated to the court of Antigonus II Gonatas in
Macedonia, remaining there until his death. Little is
known about his philosophy.
Menippus of Gadara (Menippos):
Floruit ﬁrst half
of 3rd century BC. A Cynic philosopher, he was
noted for using satire to popularize the Cynical out-

fragments survive. He was said by some to have orig-
inally been a slave who bought his freedom and
became a citizen of Thebes.
Meton (Meton):

curus, who provided for the care of the son and
daughter of Metrodorus in his will.
Nausiphanes of Teos (Nausiphanes):
Born c. 360
BC. A philosopher who studied under Pyrrhon, prob-
ably when they were both soldiers in Alexander the
Great’s campaigns. Nausiphanes established a school
at Teos, where Epicurus studied under him c. 324
BC. Nausiphanes was a follower of Democritus and
believed in his atomic theory.

lowed Empedocles in believing that health depended
on the four elements of ﬁre, air, water and earth. He
wrote a book on dietetics.
Philolaus (Philolaos):
Born c. 470 BC. A Pytha-
gorean philosopher. Born at Croton or Tarentum in
Italy, he went to Thebes around 450 BC. Fragments
of writing attributed to him, such as those proposing
theories that the Earth was not the center of the uni-
verse, are suspected of being forgeries.
Philon of Byzantium (Philon):
Third–2nd cen-
turies BC (date uncertain). Writer at Alexandria on
technology. He wrote a Mechanical Handbook, in pos-
sibly nine books. Surviving parts include book four
on siege warfare machines; book ﬁve on siphons and
other devices operated by air and water; and parts of
books seven and eight on siege warfare techniques.
Book six (now lost) was on automata.
Philon of Larissa (Philon):
159–c. 80 BC. A
philosopher who went to Athens at the age of 24,
having previously studied in his home town. At
Athens he studied under Clitomachus, whom he suc-
ceeded as head of the Academy. In 88 BC during the
Mithridatic Wars, he went to Rome where he lec-
tured on philosophy and rhetoric. He wrote many
books, but not even their titles have survived.
Plato (Platon):
c. 429–348/347 BC. A philosopher,
the son of Ariston and Perictione, Athenians of aris-
tocratic descent. He became a follower of Socrates,
but after Socrates’ death in 399 BC he took refuge
with Eucleides in Megara. He then spent some
years traveling, visiting Egypt, Italy and Sicily. He
returned to Athens and established a school at the
grove of Academus c. 385 BC that became known 
as the Academy (see chapter 7, EDUCATION). He
returned to Syracuse in 367 BC to try (unsuccessfully)
to persuade Dionysius II to adopt true philosophical
principles of government. He visited Syracuse again
in 362 BC.
His works, which all survive, consist of about 25
dialogues (some others attributed to him are unlikely
to be genuine), some letters and the Apology. Plato
was greatly inﬂuenced by Socrates, who appears as a
character in the dialogues. On his death his nephew
Speusippus succeeded him as head of the Academy.
Polemon (Polemon):
Died c. 270 BC. Philosopher
who was head of the Academy at Athens from 314 BC

entourage of Alexander the Great. He returned to
Elis, where he lived quietly and was elected high
priest by the citizens.
Pythagoras (Pythagoras):
Active c. 520–490 BC.
Born c. 570 BC at Samos. Philosopher and mathe-
matician. He was the son of Mnesarchus of Samos,
from where he moved to Croton c. 531 BC, probably
to escape the tyranny of Polycrates. He was a wor-
shipper of Apollo and founded a religious society in
Croton, under the government of which Croton
became the foremost city among Achaean colonies in
Italy. An uprising later forced him to retire to
Metapontum, where he remained until death. He
died c. 490 BC. He was noted for his mathematical
and musical theories. He wrote no books, and many
legends grew up about him.
Socrates (Sokrates):
469–399 BC. A philosopher.
He was an Athenian of the deme of Alopece, son of

Sophroniscus (a sculptor or stonemason) and
Phaenarete. He served in the army as a hoplite. He
married Xanthippe late in life, possibly his second
marriage. As president of the Assembly he refused to
put to the vote the illegal motion to execute the gen-
erals after their defeat at Arginusae. He also resisted
the Thirty Tyrants when they tried to involve him in
their crimes. After the restoration of democracy in
Athens, he was condemned to death for “introducing
new gods” and “corrupting the young.” He refused
to escape during the 30 days allowed after sentence
and died by suicide after drinking hemlock.
Socrates was initially interested in natural philoso-
phy, which he abandoned in favor of ethical inquiry.
He attracted a diverse circle of friends and young
men wishing to learn from him. It was his integrity
and philosophic lifestyle that had the greatest impact
on subsequent philosophers. He wrote no books at
all, and knowledge of him comes largely from the
works of Plato, Aristophanes and Xenophon.
Speusippus (Speusippos):
c. 407–339/338 BC. A
philosopher, he was an Athenian, the son of
Eurymedon and Plato’s sister Potone. He accompa-

Athens. He probably joined Aristotle at Assus, mov-
ing with him to Macedonia and then Athens. He
wrote widely, but only a small part of his works sur-
vive, including History of Plants, Causes of Plants,
Characters, Metaphysics and fragments from The Doc-
trines of the Natural Philosophers and Laws.
Timon of Philius (Timon):
c. 320–230 BC. A
Sceptical philosopher. After poverty in his youth,

to have lived until the time of Hieron of Syracuse
(ruled 478–467 BC). Born at Colophon in Ionia, he
left around 545 BC after the Persian conquest of
Lydia and spent the rest of his life traveling around
the Greek world. He was mainly known for his ratio-
nalization of theology, attacking the polytheism and
anthropomorphism of traditional Greek religion.
Zeno of Elea (Zenon):
c. 490–after 445 BC. Born

CALENDAR
Little is known about early Greek calendars. Names of
months do occur in Mycenaean Linear B texts, where
months seem to be lunar. In Homer the calendar is
seasonal, and no names of months are mentioned.
One theory was that the calendar was reformed at
Delphi in the 8th century BC. Calendars were usually
lunisolar, based both on the Sun and the Moon.
All Greek city states had 12 months, with alternate
months having 29 days (hollow months) or 30 days
(full months), all beginning with the new moon. The
lunar month (the period between one new moon and
the next) measures 291/2 days, but the yearly cycle of
the Earth around the Sun is about 3651/4 days (about
11 days longer than 12 lunar months). All calendars
were originally lunar, but they also had to be recon-
ciled with the solar year, otherwise the months would
slip according to the season. This was done by inter-
calation—inserting an extra month (in Athens usually
another Poseideon) in the year or extra days within
the month. Each state had a different system, but it
was common for alternate years to have an extra 30
days, with alternate years of 354 and 384 days. This
system still led to discrepancies, and astronomers
devised astronomical cycles to control the intercala-
tion. Magistrates were responsible for bringing the
lunar months in line with the seasons (in particular so
that festivals could be held at appropriate times), but
there is no evidence that astronomical methods were
used in civil calendars until Hellenistic times.
In the late 4th century BC Egypt and the East came
under Greek control. Egypt had used a local 25-year
cycle that regulated the Egyptian religious lunar cal-
endar. In the mid-3rd century BC this was adapted to
the Macedonian calendar for use in Ptolemaic Egypt.
There were 12 months of 30 days each, and ﬁve addi-
tional days at the end of the year, in total, 365 days. At
the end of the 3rd century BC Ptolemy III decreed
that an extra day should be added at the end of every
four years, although this was never done. This Egypt-
ian calendar was used into the Roman period.
In Syria and elsewhere in the East, the Macedon-
ian calendar was adjusted so that its months coin-
cided with the Babylonian calendar, which was
regulated by a 19-year cycle. This system continued
until Roman times.
Months
A month (men) is a moon-period. Each city-state had
its own list of months, and colonies tended to have
the same system as their mother cities. The Athenians
divided the year into 12 months, beginning in mid-
summer, so that the precise year is not always certain
today, such as the founding of the Delian League in
478/477 BC. Before 411 BC the year of the boule of
500 may have begun in Skirophorion, while the civil
calendar, which was controlled by the archons, began
in Hekatombaion. Archons were responsible for
making adjustments to the civil calendar (inserting
extra days or an extra month), and the civil calendar
could be out of phase with the Moon.
Festivals followed the civil calendar rather than
the lunar calendar. Each Greek state had different
names for the months, with many named after festi-
vals. Some names of months may date back to Myce-
naean times. Most is known about the Athenian
(Attic) calendar, whose months had the following
names (given with approximate modern equivalents):
Hekatombaion (June–July)
Metageitnion (July–August)
Boedromion (August–September)
Pyanopsion (September–October)
Maimakterion (October–November)
Poseideon (November–December)
Gamelion (December–January)
Anthesterion (January–February)
Elaphebolion (February–March)
Mounichion (March–April)
Thargelion (April–May)
Skirophorion (May–June)
In Macedonia the names of months were Loios,
Gorpaios, Hyperberetaios, Dios, Apellaios, Aud-
naios, Peritios, Dustros, Xandikos, Artemisios,
Daisios and Panemos. Seleucus I ordered that Baby-
lonian months should receive Macedonian names.
Not all the names of months of every state are
known, and the succession of months in some city-
states is not known.
Days
The days in the month were named and numbered,
beginning at sunset. In Athens and other Greek cities,

days within the month were divided into three peri-
ods of (mostly) 10 days (decades, dekades). The days
within each decade were counted, those of the ﬁrst
decade being expressed in terms of the rising moon.
The ﬁrst day was the “new moon” (noumenia), and the
following days were numbered from 2 to 10. The
days of the middle third were usually 11 to 20, but in
the last third, the days were numbered backward (10
to 1) in terms of the dying month. There were many
variations, even in Athens itself. In some calendars
there was no division of the month, and days were
numbered from 1 to 29 or 30, with no backward
counting. This system was operative in the Macedon-
ian calendar, in use all over the Greek world in Hel-
lenistic times. Each Macedonian month ended as day
30; for months with 29 days, the number 29 was
omitted. There is no evidence of the use of weeks in
the Greek world before the Roman period.
Dates of Years
It can be very difﬁcult to convert an ancient Greek
event to the modern calendar, because many different
systems of designating years were used, often side by
side. In many places the calendar year started at dif-
ferent times: the Athenian one started in summer
(possibly after the summer solstice), and the Olympiad
year began in midsummer. Dates converted to the
modern calendar from Hellenistic and Babylonian cal-
endars are usually more accurate than those of the
Greek cities.
Most commonly a year was named after an epony-
mous magistrate, such as the eponymous archons in
Athens and senior ephors in Sparta, or after other
officeholders such as the priestesses of Hera at
Argos. Dates can be related to the modern calendar if
lists of such ofﬁcials are known. At Athens lists of
archons (some of which have survived) were main-
tained from the 7th century BC, but they are not reli-
able until the 5th century BC, when dates in Greek
history can be assigned with greater certainty. The
Athenian year was from about July to June, so in the
modern calendar there can be a discrepancy of one
year when converting dates.
At Athens three calendars were used: lunar calen-
dar, archon (civil or festival) calendar and prytany
calendar. Dates could be designated according to the
lunar or civil calendar, but these could differ by up to
30 days. In Athens dates could also be given accord-
ing to another civil calendar, that of the prytany (or
bouleutic or conciliar) calendar. There were 10 pry-
tanies in the year in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (see
chapter 1, COUNCIL). This was the period when rep-
resentatives from each of the 10 tribes to the Coun-
cil (boule) of 500 served as presidents (or executive
committee). Prytanies varied between 34 and 39
days. Ofﬁcial dates at Athens were usually given as
double dates, by naming the archon (the civil calen-
dar) and the prytany (the prytany calendar). From
394 BC the prytanies were numbered, and from 346
BC the day within the prytany was also stated.
Another system of designating dates was based on
the Olympic Games, held every four years. The four-
year period was called an Olympiad, and the ﬁrst year
of the ﬁrst Olympiad equates to 776 BC. By the end of
the 5th century BC a list of these games and the victors
had been drawn up, and the system was used by Greek
historians by the 4th century BC. The Olympiads were
numbered, and sometimes the particular year of an
Olympiad was also noted (such as 3rd year of the 15th
Olympiad). Another system of keeping track of years
was based on eras, which measured a succession of
time from a notable event, a system used only in the
Greek world from Hellenistic times. The Seleucid Era
was widely used in the Greek East; year 1 was reck-
oned to be that when Seleucus I became satrap at
Babylon. This equates to 312 BC, or 311 BC using the
Babylonian calendar. Cities that became liberated
from the Seleucid Empire (such as Tyre) began to use
their own era system commencing with the year of
liberation.
Clocks
The day was divided into 12 equal segments of night
and 12 of day, so that a daylight hour was not the
same as a night hour (except at equinox) and varied in
length from month to month and according to lati-
tude. Time was generally measured according to
names given to parts of the day from sunrise to sun-
set, such as “ﬁrst light” and “midday.” Time could be
measured by the stars or by the passage of the Sun.
Hellenistic astronomers followed the Egyptian
method of dividing the day into 24 equal parts; fol-
lowing the Babylonian system they divided these
Egyptian hours into 60 equal parts.

Various mechanisms for measuring time were
known to the Egyptians and Babylonians, and were
adopted by the Greeks. Two basic types of clocks
were used by the Greeks, the shadow clock or sundial
and the water clock. The shadow clock consisted of a
vertical staff (gnomon), whose shadow could be mea-
sured on a ﬂat or concave surface.
A water clock or clepsydra (klepsydra) allowed a
predetermined quantity of water to ﬂow out at a reg-
ular rate and was used at Athens to time speeches. It
could consist of a vessel from which water flowed
through a small hole, or a graduated container into
which water ﬂowed. Ctesibius apparently invented a
water clock in which dripping water turned wheels
that gradually raised a small statue with a stick, which
pointed to the time. Other complex mechanisms were
also invented based upon astronomy, but these never
became widespread, and clocks were never accurate.
The Tower of the Winds, or Horologion, at Athens,
once thought to be of Roman date, is now believed to
be Hellenistic. The octagonal tower portrayed the
various winds and also incorporated a sundial. Inside,
it held a water clock.
THE FAMILY
The family or household (oikos, also meaning estate)
was considered a very important part of Greek life,
an essential element of the city-state. While the oikos
was permanent, its members could change and vary
in number. A household would comprise family
members (with a woman usually moving into her
husband’s family home), as well as those of inferior,
noncitizen status, especially slaves. Extended family
such as unmarried female relatives were often part of
a household.
Women
The position of women depended very much on
their social status, and more is known about the sta-
tus of wealthier classes and of those living in Athens.
In contrast to what was written about men, very little
was written about women, and most ancient authors
were men. Although men were part of both the polis
and oikos, women had a role only in the oikos.
As depicted in Homer’s poetry, female characters
of the upper classes led a relatively independent life,
and there is evidence that this was the case for other
circles of women in later times, such as the poetess
Sappho and her group in the 7th century BC. The
role of women was somewhat limited in Athens in the
5th and 4th centuries BC. Although women (not
slaves, freedwomen or metics) were technically of cit-
izen status, they had no rights of citizenship. Women
had no political rights and could take no part whatso-
ever in government; they had no more rights than
slaves. They could conduct only limited business and
hold and inherit limited property. All business was
conducted on a woman’s behalf by her husband or
father. In other states, women had greater freedom.
Women rarely received inheritances, since the
law of inheritance was through the male line. Indeed,
written wills were allowed at Athens only if there was
no son. At Sparta women were able to own and
inherit property. Marriage was arranged for a woman
by her father or male guardian.
In the home women were kept segregated in their
own quarters (gynaikonitis or gynaikeion) and were vir-
tually unseen. They were responsible for the total
control of their household (oikos), including slaves,
children, cooking, cleaning, caring for the sick and
making clothes (from spinning wool to ﬁnishing the
garments). Much would be done by female slaves
under the supervision of the mistress (despoina). Virtu-
ally no written evidence exists for household chores.
Women (especially those who were citizens) rarely
left the house, and even then would be accompanied
by female slaves. Women did go shopping and to the
wells to fetch water (fig. 10.1), but this was done
mainly by slaves and by poorer women without slaves.
Older women and widows had more freedom, as did
Spartan wives. Poorer women undertook work,
including selling goods in the market, spinning, mak-
ing bread, agricultural laboring, acting as wet nurses
or working alongside their husbands. It was not pos-
sible in such households to segregate men from
women. Poorer widows often had to work, if they had
no means of ﬁnancial support.
Within religion women did play an important
role, such as a dominant role at funerals, weddings,
and a large number of public festivals (see chapter 8,

FESTIVALS, PRIESTHOODS). There were many priest-
esses, and women also had their own festivals. At
some festivals, though, it is believed that women
were not present; nor may they have attended associ-
ated performances at theaters.
In Hellenistic times Macedonian women wielded
much power, and contemporary philosophies also
encouraged greater freedom for women. Many
women, such as in the Ptolemaic world, wielded
great political inﬂuence.
Marriage
By far the most information about marriage comes
from Athens. Differences occurred in other states.
Marriages were usually monogamous, and at Athens
polygamy was not allowed and was considered bar-
baric. Nearly all women citizens were married, and
marriage was very much for political and economic
expediency, and for the continuance of the family by
procreation of children. Women were effectively lent
to their husbands and could be recalled if they had to
act as epikleros (see below).
There was no minimum legal age for marriage,
but at Sparta marriage was delayed, whereas at
Athens it took place soon after puberty, around the
age of 14, when a woman was usually married to an
older man (about 30 or slightly younger), usually a
relative. It was quite common to marry ﬁrst cousins
or uncles. However, relationships between children
and parents, or siblings and half siblings with the
same mother were considered incest. Relationships
between half siblings with the same father were tol-
erated. And at Sparta siblings with the same mother
could marry. In Hellenistic Egypt, marriage did take
place between siblings of the same mother and
father.

just arriving, and those facing right are leaving, with their hydriai ﬁlled with water. The scene was itself painted on a
black-ﬁgure hydria, of c. 530 BC.

A betrothal was arranged for a young woman by
her kyrios (father or guardian) after the age of ﬁve. At
Athens a formal betrothal (engye) took place, with
witnesses on both sides. In early times a bride gift (or
bride price) may have been given to the bride’s father
by the family of the bridegroom, although this is dis-
puted and possibly represented a token exchange of
gifts. In later times a dowry was universally given by
the bride’s father at the time of the betrothal and was
part of the betrothal conditions, although not com-
pulsory. The dowry was given to her future husband,
and on his death it would pass to her children.
Inheritance was usually through the male line. At
Athens a woman inherited her father’s property only
if she had no brothers. Even then she did not inherit
the property, but it was bequeathed through her hus-
band to her sons. She was known as an epikleros
(heiress, but literally “attached to the estate”). The
nearest male relative had the right to marry her to
continue her father’s oikos, even if both were already
married. Alternatively he could arrange for her to
marry someone else, such as a more distant relative,
the man to whom she was betrothed or the man
appointed in her father’s will. This was the case even
for poor people with nothing to inherit, thus ensur-
ing marriage for fatherless daughters.
Marriage was the act of living together, although it
was usually accompanied by various rituals and cere-
monies (ekdosis, giving away). On marriage (which
could take place some years after the betrothal), the
bride went to the bridegroom’s house and became
part of his family. The favorite time for marriage at
Athens was at the full moon in the month of Game-
lion (from gamos, marriage or wedding celebration),
traditionally the time in the agricultural year when
the least work was required. A sacriﬁce was made to
appropriate deities, such as Zeus and Hera, to whom
the bride could dedicate a lock of hair. Childhood
possessions were then dedicated to Artemis, the vir-
gin goddess. The bride and groom then each took
prenuptial ritual baths with water fetched in a
loutrophoros, and a feast was held at the groom’s
father’s house. The lebes gamikos was a type of bowl
also used in the wedding ritual and may have been
given as a present to the bride.
In the evening the bride was taken to the groom’s
house (ﬁg. 10.2) in a torchlight procession, with atten-
dants singing the hymenaeus (wedding song). The
veiled bride was conducted by the groom’s mother
into the house. The married couple went into the bed-
room (thalamos) to consummate the marriage, and
young men and girls sung the epithalamion (wedding
song) outside the bedroom door to cover the noise of
the cries of the bride as she was penetrated for the ﬁrst
time. Although religious rituals could take place at
marriage ceremonies, it was in effect a civil contract.
After marriage the most important role of the woman
was to produce a child as soon as possible to ensure
her status in and acceptance into her new household.
Most cities did not recognize marriage between
slaves or between people of nonequal status, but mar-
riage between metics at Athens was similar to that
between citizens. Endogamy was marriage within a
citizen group such as Athens or even a kin group,
including between uncles and nieces, which was com-
mon at Athens. It excluded marriage to foreigners.

10.2 A bride is led from her childhood home to her future husband who stands by the door of his house. Apollo with his
laurel wreath and Artemis with her bow are present. The scene is on a red-ﬁgure vase.

A childless widow would return with her dowry to
her original family, and would often be provided with
a new husband. Widows were expected to live under
the protection of male relatives, though older wid-
ows had greater freedom. Because of the large age
discrepancy between men and women on marriage,
women often became widows at a fairly young age
and were expected to remarry.
Although married men could practice homosexu-
ality, take mistresses and use prostitutes, in Greek
law adultery (moikheia) was between a man and a
wife, widowed mother, unmarried daughter, sister or
niece, as it was an offense against the head of the
household. If a man’s wife was involved (or had been
raped), he had to divorce her, though such drastic
action is disputed. He could deal with the adulterer
(moikhos) as he wished (including killing or maiming
him), or the adulterer could pay a ﬁnancial penalty. It
was also possible to take legal proceedings against an
adulterer, and penalties were very harsh. Some
papyri found in Egypt mention ﬁnancial penalties for
adultery in marriage contracts. There were fewer
taboos on adultery in Sparta. Marriage could be eas-
ily dissolved by the husband or wife living apart; a
man could divorce his wife by expelling her from the
house, or she could leave him by leaving the house-
hold. Fathers had custody of children in a divorce,
but widows would remain in their husband’s family
to continue to raise their children.
In time, particularly in the Hellenistic period,
marriage changed. For example, the groom married
at a younger age. In Macedonia polygamy was prac-
ticed. Alexander the Great allowed his soldiers to
marry captive women in Persia while keeping their
wives in Macedonia. Marriage between brothers and
sisters was practiced among Hellenistic rulers, such
as the Ptolemies. In Hellenistic states marriage was
not based on the oikos system, and women could not,
for example, become epikleroi. Marital law improved
for women in this period.
Men
A man was the head (kyrios) of the household (oikos).
Men’s work was usually outdoors, away from the
home. For the role of men in society, see chapter 1,
GOVERNMENT, POPULATION.
Children
Contraception and abortion were probably practiced
mainly by prostitutes and poorer families. There was
no effective means of contraception, but several
methods were used. These included barriers such as
pessaries soaked in materials such as vinegar or oil
and the use of cedar resin as a prophylactic. Some
contraceptive material could have caused abortions.
Abortion is known to have been induced by instru-
ments and physical exercise, and was regarded as
another means of contraception, as was exposure
(ekthesis) of babies. Unwanted newborn children,
undoubtedly mainly girls and those who were
deformed, were exposed to die (technically, they
were not killed). Poverty was a possible motive for
exposure, although in some city-states poor parents
could legitimately sell their children. Abortion and
exposure were legitimate, but not necessarily accept-
able, and in Athens it was a crime to abort a child
after the father had died. In Sparta exposure was a
legal requirement for deformed infants. Some dwarfs
and other disabled children did survive, as they are
depicted in artistic representations, with some men-
tions in written texts. Exposed children could be res-
cued for use as slaves or prostitutes.
Childbirth took place at home, with all the
women of the household in attendance. A female
midwife (maia) may have been present, and a male
doctor called in if complications arose, but virtually
no information on midwifery exists. The mortality
rate for women during and after childbirth must have
been high. Childbirth was regarded as polluting so
was not allowed to take place on sacred ground.
Gynecological treatises comprise a large proportion
of the Hippocratic Corpus. At birth the guardian
(usually the father) had to decide whether to keep
the child or expose it. If it was kept a puriﬁcation
ceremony (amphidromia) took place on the ﬁfth or
seventh day after birth.
At Athens children were swaddled, but not in
Sparta. It was the mother’s duty to breast-feed their
children, but wet nurses were employed, and pottery
feeding bottles are also known (several found in
graves of deceased infants) (ﬁg. 10.3). There is evi-
dence from vase paintings for cradles of wickerwork
or wood, and children’s toys ( paignia) are known.
From the 4th century BC children appear much more
E V E R Y D A Y L I F E
445

in artistic representations. Children played a number
of games, and evidence of toys comes from litera-
ture, vase paintings and surviving examples of the
actual toys. Various types of games using balls
(sphairai) were popular, as were hoops and spinning
tops. Infants had rattles, clappers and bells in a vari-
ety of forms, such as a hollow animal with loose peb-
bles inside. Dolls made of wood, bone, clay or rag are
known, as well as dolls’ houses complete with furni-
ture and utensils. Many dolls have been found, some
with articulated limbs, and depictions of dolls often
show them naked. Swings, seesaws and yo-yos were
used, as well as miniature carts or chariots, and
games of dice (kuboi) and knucklebones (astragaloi)
were played.
It was customary at various festivals to give chil-
dren toys. When girls were about to marry and when
boys reached adolescence, it was customary for them
to dedicate their playthings to deities.
Male children were favored for many reasons.
They perpetuated the family and family cult, cared
for parents in old age and arranged a proper funeral
for deceased parents. In addition sons could inherit
the dowry. Boys were raised in the female quarters
until about the age of six, when they were educated
in schools, but girls remained under the close super-
vision of their mothers until they married. They
rarely went out of the women’s section of the house
and were taught domestic skills at home, though they
did attend some religious festivals. In Sparta boys
were removed from their families at the age of seven
to be reared by the state. See chapter 7, EDUCATION.
ADOPTION
In order to continue the family it was possible for a
man to adopt a son, although the adopted son did not
have as many rights of inheritance as a son by birth.
It was usually a method of providing a man with an
heir. By the 4th century BC in Athens, adoption could
be inter vivos (adoptive father and adopted son both
alive), or a son could be adopted after a man’s death
through a will, or assigned to the family after his
death if none was mentioned in a will and there was
no heir. The adoption of a daughter’s husband was
commonplace.
Pets
Some animals were kept in the home from at least
the time of Homer, who mentions dogs. The most
popular pet was a small dog, often represented on
5th-century BC Attic gravestones.
SLAVES
The civilization of the Greek world was enjoyed by
the few at the expense of the majority. Distribution
of wealth and resources was unequal, with relatively

little social mobility. A large labor force of slaves
existed, as well as free labor, which at times was
poorly paid and was to some extent indistinguishable
from the slaves. There were also serfs, who were not
technically slaves but were tied to the land, and
helots. See chapter 1, POPULATION.
Slavery occurred in Greece from the Bronze Age
onward. Slaves and their children were the property
of their owners, to be traded like any other commod-
ity. Slaves were sold or rented out by slave dealers, or
they could be bought and sold between individuals.
They were virtually without rights and were often
distinguished from serfs and other workers as “chat-
tel slaves,” being the property of their owners. They
were regarded as “living tools” and were supplied
from several sources, primarily warfare and piracy
(where they could have been previously free citizens;
see chapter 5, p. 203). Usually slaves were foreigners.
The majority of slaves in Athens, for example, were
not Athenians, and generally there was a great mix-
ture of nationalities. The number of slaves as a per-
centage of the population is uncertain.
Slaves were employed in every form of skilled and
unskilled labor. No tasks were performed solely by
slaves, but they formed the overwhelming majority
of workers in mining, manual and manufacturing
work, entertainment, prostitution and domestic ser-
vice in private households. Everyone who was not
extremely poor had at least one slave. Slavery was
essential to Greek society. Craftsmen and tradesmen
aimed to have at least one slave to train in their busi-
ness so that the work would be continued by the
slave on their retirement. Slaves could also be leased
out to industrial establishments, providing a proﬁt
for their owners. A number of slaves were also owned
by towns and cities to undertake public works.
The treatment of slaves varied enormously,
depending on their employment and their owner.
Harsh treatment was often restrained by the fact that
the slave was an investment, and impairment of the
slave’s performance might involve financial loss.
Treatment tended to be more harsh in industrial
establishments, factories, agriculture and mining.
Slaves are known to have been fettered, and a few
shackles have been found. Relatively few slaves
worked in the professions, although slave doctors are
known, and some slaves reached high levels of man-
agement in businesses.
Slave markets probably existed in many cities,
with a major market on Delos in the Hellenistic
period. As property, slaves could be sold, bequeathed
or given away by their owners, but not killed. Any-
one injuring a slave had to pay compensation to the
owner. Slaves could seek asylum at some temples and
shrines, but they were often excluded from religious
cults. A slave’s evidence was admissible in law only if
it had been obtained under torture, apparently on
the premise that only fear of further torture would
counteract the inﬂuence of the slave’s owner. There
is little evidence of slaves being used as witnesses.
Freedom
Slaves could be freed (manumitted) by their masters.
In Athens a simple declaration by the owner, before
witnesses, was sufficient. Such freedom was often
conditional, and freed slaves might be required to
continue performing certain services for the former
owner. Apart from giving other slaves some incen-
tive, an owner often freed a slave toward the end of
the slave’s useful life to avoid an asset becoming a
liability. In some emergencies large-scale freeing of
slaves took place in order for them to enlist or be
conscripted into the army or navy. Apart from helot
revolts there is no record of slave revolts in Greek
history, although many may have attempted to
escape.

10.4 Inscriptions on a polygonal masonry wall by the
temple of Apollo at Delphi relate to the manumission 
of slaves. More than 1,000 such inscriptions at the site
date from the 5th century BC to 3rd century AD.

Freed slaves did not become completely free but
were classed as freedmen or freedwomen. In Athens
they had the same status as metics and had to register
with a citizen (their former owner) as their patron
and legal representative. The freeing of slaves was
sometimes recorded in inscriptions, and such
inscriptions are known from several places, including
Athens and Delphi (ﬁg. 10.4).
FOOD AND DRINK
Evidence for food and drink comes mainly from
ancient authors, archaeological deposits (such as seeds
and animal bones) and some artistic representations.
There were various writings on cookery by ancient
authors, but only fragments from the works of later
writers survive. See also chapter 5, AGRICULTURE.
Food
Food was undoubtedly the most important aspect of
people’s lives, and many poor people are likely never
to have had enough to eat. Little work has yet been
done on excavated skeletons from ancient Greece to
assess malnutrition. There were few taboos on what
was eaten. Diet and dining customs depended on the
standard of living and geographical region—Spartan
food was said to be the worst in all of Greece. The
diet of most people was frugal, based on cereals
(grain), olive oil and wine, with possibly legumes an
important element as well, with little else to add to
the variety. Cereals, mainly barley and wheat, pro-
vided the staple food. Originally husked barley was
predominant (ground to make a paste, bread or a
gruel), but later naked species of wheat were culti-
vated and made into bread.
By the 5th century BC the wealthy could afford
more exotic foods, and exotic foods and recipes were
available for the dinner parties of the wealthy. The
importance of cereals in the diet of the upper classes
was diminished. For those that could afford them,
there was a great variety of breads, cakes and pastries.
Some were sweetened by honey, while others were
prepared with milk, eggs, suet or cheese. Bread was
eaten at most meals, accompanied by products such as
cheese, fruit, vegetables, eggs, ﬁsh, shellﬁsh and meat.
Butter was not used except occasionally in medicine,
and cheese, yogurt and milk came from goats rather
than cows.
Meat was rarely eaten, especially by those living
in cities, and ﬁsh was a delicacy for many. Where
available, all kinds of ﬁsh were eaten—fresh, dried or
pickled. A range of shellfish was eaten, and meat
(especially pork, mutton and goat) was available for
the wealthy. A great variety of birds were eaten,
including fowl, ducks, geese, swans, pelicans, cranes,
owls, pigeons, thrushes, larks, jays, wagtails and
nightingales. Wild boar, deer and hares also provided
meat.
Olives and particularly olive oil formed an essen-
tial part of the diet. The range of vegetables, fruits
and nuts was also wide. For many people meat and
even fish were luxuries, and their diet consisted
largely of bread, beans, olives, cheese and eggs, as
well as vegetables made into soups and stews. The
very poor generally had bread, paste and gruel made
from barley. See also chapter 5, p. 189.
Cooking
Bread, cakes and pastries were produced both com-
mercially and at home. Maza was ﬂat bread or cake
made from barley ﬂour, and artos was a white bread
made from wheat flour. Circular domed ovens,
heated by a ﬁre underneath, were used mainly for
baking bread and pastries. Individual loaves could be
baked in lidded earthenware pans or under upturned
pots that were placed in the ﬁre and then covered
with embers. See also chapter 5, p. 189.
Most food was cooked over a brazier or open
hearth, with cauldrons suspended from a chain or
cooking vessels set on gridirons or trivets. Food
could be grilled, fried, roasted, boiled or stewed.
Cooking was done outdoors (especially in the sum-
mer) or in kitchens, where smoke from ﬁres escaped
through a vent in the roof or wall. Soups and sauces
were popular with meat dishes. Sausages and black
puddings were also eaten, and ﬂavorings of herbs and
spices were commonly used in food. Honey was
important for sweetening. In many households the
cooking was done by one or more slaves. Apart from

a few famous chefs, women were generally regarded
as better cooks than men, and cooking was one of
their duties within the household.
The preservation of food would have been difﬁ-
cult. Fish and shellfish were probably transported
live to their destination. Some fruits were dried to
preserve them. Various other foods could be pre-
served by pickling, and meat and fish by drying,
smoking and salting. Nevertheless, contaminated
food must have been eaten, and food poisoning was
probably not uncommon.
Drink
Wine was the most common drink, generally
watered down and artiﬁcially sweetened. Some wine
was spiced and flavored, and some was heated to
make a warming drink. Drinking undiluted wine was
considered barbaric. The best wines were the most
expensive, and wines drunk by the poor were of the
lowest quality. Drinking beer and milk was also
regarded as barbaric. Milk, usually from sheep or
goats, was reserved for making cheese and for medi-
cinal purposes. There were no infused drinks like tea
and coffee, nor any distilled liquors. See also chapter
5, WINE PRODUCTION (pp. 189–190).
Meals
The times of day when meals were taken and the
names of the meals themselves varied at different
periods. In early Greece breakfast (ariston) was eaten
soon after sunrise. There was a main meal (deipnon)
in the middle of the day and a supper (dorpon) in the
evening. In Athens in the Classical period only two
meals were eaten—a light lunch (ariston) and a din-
ner (deipnon) in evening, but from the 4th century BC
breakfast (akratisma) was again added to the daily
meals.
For most people meals were relatively simple,
with little difference between the town and the coun-
tryside. Breakfast and lunch were light meals and
may frequently have been eaten outdoors, whereas
the main meal was usually eaten indoors. People ate
their food with their ﬁngers, no doubt assisted by
bread, and those that could afford it had slaves stand-
ing by to wash their hands when necessary. Men and
women would have eaten separately in many house-
holds. A symposium was a drinking party that fol-
lowed an evening meal (see ENTERTAINMENT,
below). Reclining on couches to eat was introduced
from the Near East toward the end of the 7th cen-
tury BC for special occasions such as the symposium.
Special dining rooms often held 11 couches, set
against the wall, each with a small table alongside.
The rooms were referred to by the number of
couches they held.
PERSONAL
APPEARANCE
Clothing
The clothing of the Minoan and Mycenaean periods
is quite distinct from that of the 8th century BC
onward. Mycenaean dress was similar to Minoan
dress. However, artistic representations of Myce-
naean dress were heavily inﬂuenced by Minoan art
and may not provide an accurate record. Virtually no
representations survive from the Dark Age, so the
next evidence for dress comes from the 8th century
BC. From then relatively little change took place in
the range of garments worn by the Greeks. Fashions
did not change drastically or rapidly, and both men’s
and women’s clothes were remarkably similar.
In contrast to Minoan and Mycenaean depictions
of dress, clothing from the 8th century BC onward
was generally plain, sometimes with decorative bor-
ders, and highly decorated clothing was much less
common. In some cases clothes were interchange-
able. For example, a woman might wear her husband’s
outdoor cloak. Most clothes were of wool and were
made by women at home. Increased contact with
other cultures, particularly the Romans, began to
inﬂuence Greek dress from the late 2nd century BC.
WOMEN’S CLOTHES
Minoan dress for women consisted of ﬂowing ﬂoor-
length dresses, some of which had ﬂounces. Some

women are portrayed naked above the waist, while
others have a tight-ﬁtting bodice leaving the breasts
bare, and there was a belt at the waist. A variety of
hats or headdresses seem to have been worn, often
rising well above the top of the head (ﬁg. 9.10). In
Mycenaean representations women are often shown
in a similar long ﬂounced skirt, with a tight bodice
apparently worn over a blouse. In both Minoan and
Mycenaean representations this type of dress is
highly decorated. Mycenaean women are also por-
trayed wearing a long, anklelength tunic with short
sleeves and a girdle at the waist. There is one por-
trayal of a fringed shawl, but otherwise little is
known about outer garments such as cloaks.
In the Archaic period the normal female dress
seems to have been the peplos. It was made from a
rectangle of woolen cloth, taller than the woman
wearing it and more than twice her width. The top of
the rectangle was folded over outward, so that the
cloth was of double thickness above the waist (ﬁg.
10.5a). The cloth was then wrapped around the body,
and a piece of the cloth (epomis) was pulled over each
shoulder and fastened in front with pins. The gar-
ment was held secure and supported by a girdle at
the waist. Some examples of peplos had the open side
of the garment sewn up, but mostly they overlapped
and were held in place by the girdle. These dresses
are often depicted as richly decorated. A linen cloak
or shawl could be worn over the peplos, in later times
called a himation.
In the Classical period there was a change from
the peplos to the chiton (khiton), which was a wide
10.5 Examples of clothing: a) peplos; b) Ionic chiton; c) himation cloak worn as the sole garment

tunic worn by both men and women. The various
forms of chitons included the Ionic chiton, made
from a rectangle of cloth, with two edges sewn
together to form a tube (ﬁg. 10.5b). It was a sleeved
garment, closed across the shoulders and upper arms
by buttons or several small brooches. The excess
length was pulled up and held by a girdle at the waist
to form a kind of pouch called a kolpos. Sometimes it
was also held in place by cross cords running from
the shoulders to the waist (ﬁg. 8.5).
The Archaic peplos was not immediately super-
seded, and was sometimes worn over the chiton. It
continued to be worn in the Peloponnese into the
5th century BC. The peplos developed a large over-
fold at the waist, and this developed garment was
now called the Doric chiton. Eventually the two
styles of Ionic and Doric chiton began to be mixed,
and sometimes both types were worn at once, one
over the other.
Outside the house women always wore a wrap or
cloak called a himation (ﬁg. 10.2), apparently a generic
term for such garments. There were variations in size,
style and the way they were worn. For example, the
khlanis was a wrap of very ﬁne wool, the most famous
of which came from Miletus (khlanis Milesia). The xys-
tis was a long robe of ﬁne material for special occa-
sions, and the ephestris was of thicker wool.
In Hellenistic times the dress of the Classical
period continued to be worn, but there was increas-
ing variety in the combinations of the various gar-
ments and the ways in which they were worn.
MEN’S CLOTHES
The earliest Minoan depictions show men wearing
only a belt and codpiece, possibly made from soft
leather. Later they are shown with one of two types
of dress that have been called the kilt and the apron,
both supported by a decorated belt. The kilt was a
skirt reaching to the thighs at the back, and to the
knees in the front, often ending in a long tassel.
There were two forms of apron. The double apron
reached the thighs at the back and front, but was cut
away at the sides. It was often worn with a codpiece.
The single apron was the back half of the double
apron and was worn with a codpiece. Like female
Minoan dress, kilts and aprons could be lavishly dec-
orated. In Mycenaean artistic representations men
are generally shown wearing a tunic reaching to the
thighs, with short sleeves and a belt or girdle at the
waist. Men are also shown in a short ﬂared kilt or in
what appears to be shorts decorated with rows of tas-
sels or fringes.
In the Archaic period men wore the Ionic tunic
(chiton), which appears to have been sewn rather
than pinned. Older men, and wealthy younger men,
usually wore an ankle-length chiton without a girdle,
while younger men and those involved in activities
wore a thigh-length chiton. The garment was often
made of linen, but woolen versions were warmer and
cheaper. A wrap or cloak could be worn over the chi-
ton, and occasionally the cloak was the only garment
that was worn. Khlaina (in later Greek, himation)
referred to various types of cloaks or wraps. Male
craftsmen and laborers (ﬁg. 5.2) were often depicted
wearing a loincloth or short kilt (zoma), possibly also
worn as underclothes.
Men’s dress in the Classical period was even more
like women’s dress than previously. The various types
of Ionic chitons continued to be worn (ﬁg. 9.11), and
there was a male version of the Doric chiton. This
was a shorter tunic without an overfold that reached
only to the thighs or the knees and was pinned at the
shoulders. The exomis (“off the shoulder”), a varia-
tion on the Doric chiton, was only pinned at the left
shoulder, leaving the right shoulder and breast bare.
Various cloaks and wraps were also worn over
tunics or as the sole garment (ﬁgs. 1.9, 10.2). The
generic term himation (pl. himatia) is used for these
garments, although different types can be distin-
guished. The himation was usually a large piece of
cloth wrapped around the body and over one or both
shoulders (fig. 10.5c). The tribon was a cloak of
coarse, dark-colored wool; it was worn on its own
and was the traditional dress of the men of Sparta.
The chlamys (khlamys) cloak was usually worn over
the left shoulder and fastened over the right shoulder
with a pin or brooch, leaving much of the right side
uncovered. It could also be fastened at the throat,
allowing both shoulders to be covered. The chlaina
(khlaina) was a thick winter woolen cloak.
In the countryside peasants often wore garments
made of animal skins, such as the diphthera and spolas
(goatskin or leather jerkins), and a goatskin or sheep-
skin cloak called a sisyra or haite, which was cured
with the hair or wool left on.

452
In Hellenistic times men’s tunics were usually
sewn rather than pinned, and generally had long or
short sleeves rather than being sleeveless. The
draped himation was often the only garment worn.
UNDERCLOTHES
There is little evidence for underclothes. Women
occasionally wore a soft band of cloth beneath or
around the breasts, which was sometimes called a
strophion (ﬁg. 8.18). A rare representation of this gar-
ment also depicts the heroine Atalanta wearing a
form of loincloth similar to the zoma worn by men.
Such a garment may therefore have been worn as
underclothes by women. Male workers are often
depicted wearing the loincloth known as the zoma,
diazoma or perizoma. This was a length of cloth
wrapped around as a short kilt. The evidence sug-
gests that it was sometimes worn as underclothing by
men, either beneath clothes or under armor.
SHOES
Indoors, and often outdoors, many people went
barefoot much of the time, but a variety of footwear
is also known, including sandals, shoes and boots.
Shoes were made from cattle hides, or ﬁner shoes
from skins of sheep, goats and calves. Felt was used
in the production of warm boots, and soles were
sometimes made of wood. Kroupezai were high shoes
made of wood, some worn by ﬂute players to beat
time and some worn for treading olives. Various
types of sandals (called sandalia and pedila) consisted
mainly of a sole strapped to the foot, sometimes with
thongs carried a short way up the leg. Shoes or short
boots (hypodemata koila) were similar to sandals but
enclosed the whole foot. They ranged from light,
loose-ﬁtting shoes that were almost like slippers to
heavy-duty nail-studded types.
HATS
Hats were rarely worn except when traveling or in
extreme weather. They were usually made of felt.
Various types of the traveler’s hat (petasos) frequently
occur in artistic representations, and could be
secured by a strap under the chin or around the nape
of the neck. They had a wide brim that was often cut
into a decorative shape and might be turned up or
down. Hats of skin or leather called kynai were also
worn, and conical hats were popular. Workmen and
slaves wore a conical hat known as a pilidion. In Hel-
lenistic times two other types of hats became popu-
lar, the tholia and kausia. The tholia was a conical hat
with a flat broad brim. It was worn as a sun hat,
mainly by women, and was probably made of straw.
The felt kausia had its origin in Macedonia and was a
broad-rimmed hat for protection against the heat
(kausis). An umbrella known as a skiadon was used as
protection against the sun.
Hairstyles
Wigs and hairpieces were worn by both men and
women. Dyes were mainly used to darken gray hair
or to color the hair blond, which was a fashionable
color.
WOMEN
Most women wore their hair long but cut it short
when in mourning. Slaves also had short hair. In the
7th and 6th centuries BC women’s hair was usually
allowed to fall over the shoulders and back, fastened
by a headband (mitra, tainia, ampyx or anadesme) or a
decorative diadem headdress (stephane).
Around the beginning of the 5th century BC the
hair began to be restrained. The ends of the hair
could be gathered in a small bag or tucked under the
hairband. By the end of the 5th century BC women’s
hair was worn up on the head in a variety of styles,
pinned or tied into a bun or held in place with a com-
plex arrangement of headbands or a stephane (fig.
10.6). Except possibly for a fringe, the hair might be
almost completely wrapped in a sakkos, a length of
cloth or scarf wound round the head and secured (ﬁg.
9.12). Sometimes a tail of hair was left protruding
from the sakkos. A sphendone (a broad headband,
smaller version of the sakkos) did not completely
cover the hair. The stephane could also be worn with
the sakkos.
In Hellenistic times the sakkos and sphendone
appear to have been discarded. Women still wore
their hair up, but it was artiﬁcially curled and waved
in a variety of styles.

MEN
In the 7th and 6th centuries BC men wore their hair
long and usually held it in place with a headband
(mitra). Slaves had short hair. In the 5th century BC
an alternative was to roll up the long hair tightly and
tuck it into the headband, or else twist it into two
plaits that were wound around the head. Short hair
became more common among free men in the 6th
century BC, especially among younger men. Older
men wore long hair well into the 5th century BC.
Even beyond the 5th century BC boys commonly
wore long hair, although in Sparta boys had short
hair and men wore long hair.
Short hair remained fashionable until Alexander
the Great wore his a little longer, which set a trend.
He also introduced the diadema, a headband or ﬁllet
tied at the back with the loose ends left hanging.
Until the 5th century BC it was usual for freeborn
men to wear a beard—pogon, geneion (literally, “the
chin covered by the beard”) or hypene (technically
moustache, but often used for beard). A moustache
(mystax, hypene) was at times worn with a beard, but
never without a beard (ﬁgs. 2.8, 7.18). Youths and
young men were frequently clean-shaven. In the 5th
and 4th centuries BC beards were optional, but again
Alexander’s clean-shaven face set the fashion for the
Hellenistic period (ﬁg. 2.1).
Jewelry
Many types of jewelry were worn from earliest times.
Particularly common were pins (belonai) and
brooches (peronai), used by both men and women for
fastening clothes. Jewelry was mainly worn by
women, but men wore ﬁnger rings (daktylioi) as orna-
ments and sometimes as signet rings. Rings might be
made entirely of a metal or have an inset gem or seal-
stone. Spartans, with their reputation for austerity,
were said to wear only iron rings.
Women also wore earrings, necklaces and
bracelets. Earrings (ellobia or hermata) were common
and took the form of rings, discs, or hooks with pen-
dants. Necklaces (hormoi) were usually of beads or of
pendants suspended from a neck band. Bracelets
(pselia) were worn on the wrist or above the elbow on
one or both arms. An anklet ( periskelis) was also
sometimes worn. See also chapter 5, JEWELRY MAN-
UFACTURE, and chapter 7, SEALS.
Cosmetics and Toiletries
Women and sometimes men used a variety of per-
fumes and cosmetics. Perfumes were generally oils
scented with ﬂowers or blossoms, used on the skin and
hair. A white face was fashionable for women, achieved
by painting the face with psimythion (white lead). It
was made by soaking lead in vinegar to produce cor-
rosion, which was scraped off, powdered and heated to
form a whitener. Most women in any case had a pale
complexion from a life spent largely indoors. Rouge
(phykos) was made from various materials, including
seaweed, mulberries and some plants. Eyebrows and
eyelids could be emphasized with black from soot,
charcoal or a preparation made from antimony.
Soap was not used for washing, but instead the
body was rubbed with olive oil, which was then
scraped off with a strigil. The frequency of washing
is not known, but baths were used. Mirrors of bur-
nished metal (usually bronze), combs, bronze razors
and manicure implements are all known. Often only

the mirror handles survive, the rest having been
melted down for reuse. Unwanted hair was removed
by various preparations and with tweezers. Teeth
were cleaned with a whitener, and toothpicks were
used. There were also remedies for bad breath.
ENTERTAINMENT
Main public entertainments in ancient Greece were all
closely connected with religious festivals, including
athletics, horse and chariot racing, music and theater.
Many were held as competitions, and prizes were
symbolic, usually wreaths or ribbons. Participants
took part for the glory rather than personal gain.
Many private types of entertainment also took place;
board games, possibly for gambling, were played, as
well as games with dice and knucklebones. Some evi-
dence exists for cock ﬁghting. For children’s toys, see
the family (p. 442).
Singing, Dancing, Theater
Theater performances developed from the songs and
dances performed in honor of Dionysus. Other reli-
gious festivals included music contests, and some fes-
tivals provided the opportunity for ordinary citizens
to take part in singing and dancing, often in proces-
sion. Dancing also took place at other events such as
weddings, funerals, harvests and victory celebrations.
See chapter 7, LITERATURE (p. 276), MUSIC AND
DANCE (p. 286).
Athletics
At games such as the Olympic Games, various ath-
letic and other contests took place. Generally these
contests were only for male Greek citizens, and only
men were allowed as spectators. Athletes mainly
competed naked or with a loincloth but oiled their
bodies for protection against the sun. The contests
were usually for individuals rather than teams and
included foot races, throwing the discus and javelin,
long jumping, wrestling, boxing and the pancratium.
Foot races consisted of one length of the stadium
(stadion, about 600 ft, 183 m), two lengths of the sta-
dium (about 1,200 ft, 365 m), a long distance race
that might be up to 24 lengths of the stadium (ﬁgs.
6.11, 8.35, 10.7) and a race in armor where the com-
petitors wore a helmet and greaves and carried a
shield. The length of a stadium varied between states.
There was also a pentathlon, in which the two best
competitors at javelin and discus throwing, running
and jumping also took part in a wrestling contest.
Some contests were different from their modern
equivalents. Long jumpers were aided by holding a
weight (halter, pl. halteres) in each hand, which they
swung forward as they jumped, apparently in the
belief that they could jump greater distances (fig.
10.8). Wrestling matches continued until one man
had been thrown three times or until one competitor
gave up. The pancratium (pankration) was a violent
mixture of boxing, wrestling, kicking and strangling.
Apart from biting and gouging, most holds and moves
were allowed, but there were strict rules enforced by
umpires.
Women were usually excluded from athletic con-
tests, but while the Olympic Games were in
progress, races for women (or at least for parthenoi,
virgins) took place at nearby Elis as part of a festival
in honor of Hera. Women may have participated in
athletic contests at some other festivals, but there is
no direct evidence. Athletic contests (including those
women’s races that are known to have taken place)
were dominated by the Spartans, because of their
rigorous training of both girls and boys. See chapter
7, EDUCATION.
10.7 Part of the starting line of the foot races at the
stadium at Delphi

Another form of public entertainment was the
gymnasium, where male citizens could go to exercise
and take part in sports, as well as to train for compe-
titions—gymnos meaning naked or lightly clad, which
was how they exercised. Various ball games were
apparently played by adults as well as children, and
there were games similar to hockey and handball or
basketball. Swimming also appears to have been
regarded as a recreation.
Chariot Races
Chariot races in the Panhellenic festivals took place
from earliest times, initially using two-wheeled char-
iots (ﬁg. 10.9). Chariot racing with four horses side by
side traditionally began at the Olympic Games in 680
BC. The charioteer stood in the chariot (ﬁg. 5.14),
and wore a traditional long white chiton. He held a
whip in one hand and the reins in the other (ﬁg. 9.11).
The largest recorded number of chariots entered in
one race was 41, of which only one ﬁnished, and acci-
dents at the turning posts were probably numerous.

The races were held in hippodromes (see chapter 6, 
p. 237). At Olympia the race consisted of 12 laps of the
course, a lap being about 900–1,000 yds (823–914 m).
The owner of the winning chariot, not the charioteer,
received the glory. In the Great Panathenaea, chariot
races involved various acrobatic feats, including
naked drivers (with shield and helmet) leaping from
their chariots and jumping back on (ﬁg. 8.36). They
were called apobatai (sing. apobates), a term also used
for the acrobatic feat that involved jumping from one
moving horse to another, which was another feature
of these games.
Horse racing was introduced to the Olympic
Games in 648 BC and became a prominent event at
many games. The horses were unshod, and the riders
rode bareback. The race was one lap of the hippo-
drome. Horse races were less important than chariot
races. Mule races and mule cart races also took place.
Symposia
Symposia were a popular form of private entertain-
ment for wealthy men. A symposium (symposion) was
literally a drinking together or party that followed an
evening meal. It was not really a dinner party, in that
the food was only a preliminary to the symposium.
Only men took part, although hetaerae might also be
present as entertainers. The men reclined in the
andron (men’s room) on couches for the meal, which
was served by slaves (ﬁg. 10.10). After the meal, liba-
tions to deities were poured and a hymn was sung.
The participants then drank wine and conversed.
They might also tell riddles and stories, sing drinking
songs and play games. One popular game was called
“cottabos.” This involved participants keeping some
wine in the bottom of their drinking cups and ﬂicking
it at a chosen target. Music was usually by a woman
ﬂute player, sometimes accompanied by other musi-
cians, and other entertainment included dancers, jug-
glers and acrobats. The purpose of the symposium
ranged from serious philosophical discussions to
drunken revels, depending on who took part.
Apart from symposia there were other kinds of
dinner parties, both formal and informal. Men
might belong to dining clubs or other associations,
and there were various types of public feasts and
banquets.

Prostitutes 
and Homosexuality
Prostitutes could be male or female. They were of
low social status, although prostitution itself was
regarded as a normal element of life: it was perfectly
acceptable for men, including married men, to use
prostitutes. Foreign women, female slaves, freed-
women and abandoned (exposed) girls (rarely
women of citizen status) could become prostitutes or
courtesans. The term hetaerae (hetairai, female com-
panions) was a euphemism for such women trading in
sex; they were widely available either on the street, in
brothels or as accomplished courtesans. They enjoyed
more liberated lives and may have been able to own
property. They had to pay taxes and enjoyed legal
safeguards in many city-states. They were unknown
in Homer’s heroic age or at Sparta; most is known
about them in the 5th–3rd centuries BC. Prostitutes
were particularly common at Piraeus.
Many hetaerae were professional dancers and
musicians, hired to entertain at men’s functions such
as symposia, and many were highly accomplished.
Hetaerae could also become mistresses of men, such
as Aspasia, mistress of Pericles. Retired hetaerae could
become brothel keepers. From the late 4th century BC
a distinction tended to be made between the common
prostitutes ( pornai) and the hetaerae of higher class.
There were also sacred slave prostitutes at temples
(hierodouloi hetairai), especially of Aphrodite. Their
origin probably lay in the Near East.
Women are discussed in several other sections in
this book, such as under marriage, medicine, cloth-
ing, hairstyles and priests.
From at least the 7th century BC, homosexuality
became an accepted part of everyday life. There was
no Greek word for homosexuality, and the concept
did not exist. Although men used prostitutes and
took mistresses, the type of all-male society greatly
encouraged homosexuality (technically bisexuality),
particularly among the upper classes. Sexual relations
between the same sex were not classiﬁed as such—
what was important were social status and age. The
usual sexual relationship was between an older man
(erastes, lover) and a submissive adolescent (eromenos,
loved one). Pederasty ( paiderastia) was a word used
by the Greeks to denote sexual relations between a
man and a boy, the latter apparently of adolescent age
rather than a young child. In order to preserve the
honor of these boys, it was often claimed that pene-
tration did not take place. In any event, it was shame-
ful for a man, especially a free citizen, to be penetrated
anally by his social inferior or by a younger person. A
male always had to penetrate his social inferior,
whether male or female, foreign, slave or prostitute.
Adultery between a male and female citizen, on the
other hand, was an offense.
There are many references to homosexuality,
such as in poetry and grafﬁti, and numerous inscrip-
tions on black-ﬁgure vases and red-ﬁgure vases refer
to the beauty of particular boys. On vase paintings,
the boys are about 10 to 15 years of age. Although
they are depicted in homosexual activity, intercourse
was not depicted. Some of the boys are named and
are known through their later political careers. The
Theban Sacred Band allegedly comprised pairs of
homosexual lovers (see chapter 3, p. 101), and in
Sparta homosexuality was common.
Male prostitution was not acceptable and could
lead to loss of citizenship at Athens. There is some
evidence in ancient writing for female homosexual-
ity, lesbianism, such as in the poetry of Sappho,
although there is doubt about whether the relation-
ships were ever physical. The evidence relates almost
entirely to male homosexuality. Masturbation, male
and female, is depicted on vase paintings, and women
are known to have used leather dildos.
DEATH AND
AFTERLIFE
Life expectancy was low, especially for women in
childbirth and for children. Even so, the age of 70
was believed to be a full life, and many men died even
older—105 is the oldest known age at death.
Afterlife
Views on afterlife changed over the centuries, but at
all times there was belief in some form of life after
death. There was no generally accepted view on
afterlife, and many views were contradictory.

Numerous myths concerning the underworld
existed. It was usually believed that life after death
was separate from the life of the gods. A common
belief was that the dead lived on in their tombs or in
their gravemarkers, so offerings were repeatedly
made to them by their families. Another view was
that all souls (good and bad alike) went to the rather
grim underworld (beneath the earth), the kingdom
of Hades guarded by the dog Cerberus, where the
dead were helpless and powerless, but had access to
infernal powers such as Pluto. In Hades, some
wrongdoers suffered punishment. Instead of dying,
favored heroes went to the Isles of the Blessed (nesoi
makaron) or Elysium (Elysion) at the far west of the
world, beyond the ocean, for a life of endless plea-
sure. One common belief was that all family mem-
bers would be reunited in Hades, which is possibly
why so many funerary reliefs depicted a handshake.
Not everyone believed in Hades, but were more
likely to believe in a continued existence after death
near their tomb.
From the 6th century BC ideas of possible happi-
ness after death developed, with eternal punishment
taking place in the underworld or in Tartarus (a place
of punishment beyond or below the underworld).
This idea of happiness and punishment was encour-
aged by religions such as Orphism, the Eleusinian
Mysteries and other mystery religions. Philosophers
such as Plato put forward various views on the after-
life and the immortality of the soul, while later
philosophers tended to be sceptical. See chapter 9,
PHILOSOPHY.
There is limited evidence for suicide. It seems to
have been neither widely approved or condemned,
and apparently had little effect on what happened in
the afterlife. The philosopher Socrates committed sui-
cide, and suicide was discussed by some philosophers.
Funerals and Burials
Very little is known of funerals in the Minoan and
Mycenaean periods, although there are representa-
tions of mourners. The type of funeral (kedeia, liter-
ally “caring for”) in later ages depended largely on
the status and wealth of the deceased, and some mag-
nificent public funerals could be given to heroes
killed in battle.
Most people died at home or else in battle. A
funeral commenced with women washing and
anointing the body with olive oil, which was followed
by the dressing (usually in white garments) and lay-
ing out of the body (the prothesis). The body was
placed on a bed (kline) with the head on a pillow and
the feet facing the door. The eyes were closed, a chin
strap was tied around the head, and the body was
covered by a bier cloth. The house was cleaned and
hung with wreaths and other foliage. The family and
other female mourners (some hired) held a vigil and
sung laments, and the burial then took place at night.
The body was transported to the place of burial in a
funeral cortege (the ekphora), usually carried by pall
bearers or possibly on a horse-drawn cart. A proces-
sion of mourners, accompanied by ﬂute players, went
with the body. A funeral speech (epitaphios) could be
delivered, but no burial service is known. It was
acceptable for men and women to display extreme
grief by tearing their clothes, pulling out their hair,
striking their heads and wailing. Mourning women
are often depicted on vases and as terracotta ﬁgures.
The body was either burned on a funeral pyre
(pyra) and the ashes placed in a vessel, or the body
was placed in a cofﬁn and buried. Throughout antiq-
uity both cremation and inhumation were practiced,
with one method sometimes being more popular. For
example, inhumation was most common in Myce-
naean times, but by c. 1200 BC cremation became the
main method of burial and was universal in Homer’s
time. By the 5th century BC inhumation was again
more common, possibly because of the shortage of
wood for cremations. Neither method of burial seems
to have been affected by ideas of the afterlife.
The most important aspect of burial was to
ensure that the correct elaborate rites were carried
out. In inhumation, the dead were normally placed in
cofﬁns and buried in the earth. In cremation, bodies
were burned on a pyre, probably with some grave
goods. In the Archaic period the pyre tended to be
very large, with numerous grave goods, but this
declined in later periods. The ashes were quenched
with wine, and the bones were collected and placed
in a container, which was then buried. The type of
container varied throughout Greek history.
The most important aspect of a funeral was to
cover the inhumed or cremated body with earth
(even three handfuls would suffice) to prevent it

from polluting the gods and their altars. This also
allowed the dead to pass to the underworld. Before
dawn the grave was covered, then marked later on.
Those attending a funeral were considered polluted
and had to be puriﬁed by washing. Priests did not
attend funerals. After funerals a communal meal was
served, and sometimes funeral games took place.
Young children were usually buried as inhuma-
tions (rarely cremated), often near houses, probably
because they were not considered to cause religious
pollution. Cremation for the young is virtually
unknown. Other dead were buried outside city walls,
alongside roads (cemeteries as such did not exist), in
order to avoid pollution, such as outside the Dipylon
gate in the Kerameikos Cemetery at Athens (ﬁg. 4.4).
In Athens burial inside the boundaries of the city
walls was forbidden c. 500 BC. In Sparta people were
allowed to bury their dead within the city walls, even
near temples. In Bronze Age Greece, burials are
found inside settlements until the Mycenaeans estab-
lished extramural cemeteries. Executed criminals
were left unburied, by being thrown into the sea or
into open pits. One belief was that the unburied
(ataphoi) could not enter the underworld and were
condemned to haunt the Earth.
At Athens and possibly other cities, soldiers killed
in warfare were only rarely buried on the battleﬁeld.
Very often they were cremated on the battle site and
their ashes taken home. Two known examples of bur-
ial on the battlefield (an exceptional honor) were
after the battles of Marathon (490 BC) and Plataea
(479 BC). At Marathon, for example, the Athenian
dead were cremated and buried on the actual site of
the battle in a large funeral mound (29ft [9m] high
and nearly 164 feet [50m] diameter), known as the
Soros. The Spartans tended to bury their dead on
the battleﬁeld. The war dead were usually given a
state burial at Athens.

At the point of burial, some ritual sacriﬁce of ani-
mals (for example, horses) and possibly even humans
took place in Dark Age Greece, and perhaps in
Minoan and Mycenaean Greece.
The view toward suicides (autocheires or biaio-
thanatoi) is unclear—there was fear or loathing, but
no religious qualms as in later Christianity.
GRAVES AND TOMBS
Methods of burials and types of graves and tombs
were extremely varied. In the Early Bronze Age, buri-
als in cists (built of upright stone slabs) were common
in the Cyclades. In Crete during the Bronze Age, the
two major types of tombs are circular tholos tombs
and rectangular house tombs, with some use of cists,
pits, caves, rock shelters and rock-cut chamber tombs
(tombs with a chamber or room). House tombs
resembled the plan of a house, with adjoining rectan-
gular rooms. The tombs were used for collective bur-
ial, possibly by families. From Early Minoan III on
Crete, inhumations were placed in clay pithoi and lar-
nakes, some in cemeteries and some in tombs.
Outside Crete a similar diversity of tombs
occurred, including some tumuli. On the mainland,
Mycenaean burials were in cists and pits, some under
tumuli, as well as in shaft graves and very occasion-
ally in caves and disused wells. Cist graves were the
most common, cut into earth or rock and lined with
stones or stone slabs. Next most common were pit
graves, again both rock and earth cut. Some were
covered with slabs, stones and even pottery vases.
The shaft graves at Mycenae consist of a circular plot
surrounded by a low stone wall (ﬁg. 10.11), inside
which were numerous burials (mainly of the ruling
elite) within deep narrow pits (“shafts”). Grave Cir-
cle B dates to c. 1600 BC and Grave Circle A to c.
1550 BC. Various types of chamber tombs were also
adopted on mainland Greece, including stone-built
tholos tombs for elite burials. These comprised an
underground vaulted corbelled roofed chamber of
circular shape, some with a long passageway (dromos).
They are also known as beehive tombs and date to c.
1550–1300 BC (ﬁgs. 10.12, 10.13). The largest is the
Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae. The main types of
Mycenaean tombs spread throughout the Aegean
during the Late Bronze Age, and the rock-cut cham-
ber tomb became dominant. In Crete in Late
Minoan III, larnax burials were frequent, although
only occasionally found on the mainland. In the
Postpalatial Period, monumental tomb architecture
ceased: chamber tombs began to be abandoned, and
there was a return of cist and pit graves, with the
gradual introduction of cremations.
In the Protogeometric and Geometric periods,
cremations continued, often buried in pottery vessels
within pits, along with other grave goods. Inhuma-
tion was also resumed. In the Geometric and Archaic
periods, there were family plots or groups of related
graves; the individual graves were marked by a simple
mound of earth, usually circular (although some were
rectangular), and were later surmounted by vases and
10.12 A cross section through the tomb known as the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae, with the burial chamber on the left

sculptures. The mounds became increasingly larger,
so that space became a problem in cemeteries. From
c. 600 BC smaller tombs were constructed with walls.
Toward the end of the 5th century BC at Athens, fam-
ily enclosures (periboloi) became popular that lasted
for about three generations before a new one was
started. Many of these lined major roads leading into
a town or city and were surrounded by tall walls on
which the gravemarkers were placed. Often they were
marked by an anthemion stele—a tall gravemarker
carrying inscriptions and carved rosettes or a vegeta-
tion ﬁnial.
Knowledge of Hellenistic burial practices is more
limited, apart from some of the more monumental
burials. For example, in Macedonia very rich burials
have been found in vaulted chamber tombs, such as
that of Philip II at Vergina, some with rich grave
goods and painted plastered walls. Large tomb mon-
uments also appear, such as the mausoleum of Mau-
solus erected at Halicarnassus. Some rock-cut tombs
of this period have architectural facades, such as ones
in Asia Minor. In Alexandria in Egypt and at Paphos
Nea in Cyprus, underground rock-cut tombs have
plans similar to Hellenistic peristyle houses. They
contained rooms lined with niches (loculi), closed by
a plaster or stone slab, a prototype for later cata-
combs (ﬁg. 10.14).
COFFINS
The coffin (soros or larnax) was usually of wood,
although pottery and stone ones are known. On
Crete from Early Minoan III, inhumations were
placed in clay pithoi (large storage vessels) or in clay
larnakes (sing. larnax), tubs with lids, similar to
cofﬁns. Some were richly painted. In Late Minoan

III, larnakes became particularly common on Crete
and resembled a rectangular chest with feet. In Geo-
metric and Archaic Athens a few adult inhumation
burials were placed in large pithoi. Sculptured stone
sarcophagi appeared in Asia Minor from the 5th cen-
tury BC and became popular among the wealthy in
Hellenistic times. In southern Russia painted wooden
sarcophagi of Hellenistic date have also survived.
In the Bronze Age, infants were sometimes buried
in pots or under fragments of pithoi, a trend that con-
tinued throughout Greek history. From the Classical
period a pair of clay tubs was also used for infant buri-
als, one placed over the other. Some were brightly
painted.
GRAVEMARKERS
Graves were usually marked with an engraved stone
slab (stele, pl. stelai) to identify the dead. They are
ﬁrst found above Bronze Age shaft graves at Myce-
nae from the 16th century BC (ﬁg. 3.3), showing bat-
tle and hunting scenes with chariots. In Geometric
and Archaic times, pottery vases, some very large,
were used as gravemarkers, with huge craters for
men and amphorae for women’s graves, and wooden
markers were probably used as well. From about the
mid- to late 7th century BC, funerary statues (korai
and kouroi—standing, usually nude young men and
standing draped young women) were erected as
gravemarkers, and ceramic plaques also began to be
used. From about 600 BC the stele began to replace
ceramic gravemarkers. The earliest versions date
from around 600 to 500 BC at Athens and were tall
and slim. Some are crowned by a sphinx, lion or later
a siren, beasts often used symbolically to guard
tombs and probably borrowed from the Egyptians.
By 530 BC the sphinx was replaced by a palmette
ﬁnial (ﬁg. 10.15). These stelai were often painted.
From c. 500 to 430 BC very few stelai occur,
except for a few publicly erected ones, following leg-

islation forbidding such sumptuous markers. From
450 BC gravestones with sculptured figures first
appear at Athens. From 430 to 417 BC private stelai
reappear and are broader, with more complex sculp-
ture (ﬁgs. 1.9, 9.12), and many show a male ﬁgure
reclining on a couch, holding a wine jug, a table of
food close by, and attended by a woman or a boy.
Funerary legislation of Demetrius of Phalerum in
Athens c. 317–315 BC forbade this type of sumptuous
gravemarker, and subsequently simple short cylindri-
cal slabs were used. Toward the end of the 5th cen-
tury BC marble vases carved in the round (including
lekythoi and loutrophoroi) came into fashion as grave-
markers. Marble loutrophoroi were used as grave-
markers for the unmarried-two-handled ones for
men and three-handled ones for women (ﬁg. 10.16),
while lekythoi were for the married. Lekythoi were
oil jugs used in funerary ritual, and loutrophoroi

ding. See also chapter 7, FUNERARY INSCRIPTIONS
(p. 273), and chapter 9, SCULPTURE (p. 404).
GRAVE GOODS AND GIFTS
Grave goods were usually deposited with the dead
(inhumations and cremations) for their use in the
afterlife. Richer grave goods began to be provided
from the Late Bronze Age, the most notable being in
the shaft graves at Mycenae, where grave goods
included spears, daggers, gold cups, silver vases,
amber necklaces, stone vases, gold jewelry and other
ornaments, and five gold death masks (fig. 10.17).
Other less wealthy Mycenaean graves also contained
a broad range of grave goods. From the Geometric
period grave goods included food, pots, jewelry,
weapons, ﬁgurines and other model objects. From
the Classical period a decreasing number of such
goods was deposited in the grave. Traditional objects
for traveling to the underworld (such as shoes, lamps
and coins for the boat fee of Charon) were not uni-
versally deposited with burials. In Sparta few if any
grave goods were deposited.
Various rites continued to take place at the grave-
side, on the third, ninth and thirtieth days after
death. It was as important to visit the tomb at subse-
quent festivals and various anniversaries, such as at
monthly and annual commemorative visits. Particu-
larly important were visits by the son or adopted heir.
The tomb was decorated with wreaths and colorful
ribbons, and offerings of food, drink, oil and water
were left. Celery (selinon) was a popular offering to
the dead. The lekythos appears as a grave gift from c.
600 BC, and from 470 to 410 BC it was the favorite
grave gift at Athens. Lekythoi were jugs ﬁlled with
oil, but some had a small, false internal container to
minimize the amount of oil that was left. In Classical
Athens, women often visited graves with offerings.
From the late 4th century BC it was common in
Asia Minor and the Aegean islands to bequeath a
sum of money for rites to be held in honor of the
deceased in perpetuity.
