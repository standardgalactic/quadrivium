Linux Programs 
 
A program, or command, interacts with the kernel to provide the environment and perform the 
functions called for by the user. A program can be: an executable shell file, known as a shell script; a 
built-in shell command; or a source compiled, object code file. 
The shell is a command line interpreter. The user interacts with the kernel through the shell. You can 
write ASCII (text) scripts to be acted upon by a shell. 
 
System programs are usually binary, having been compiled from C source code. These are located in 
places like /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/ucb, etc. They provide the functions that you normally 
think of when you think of Linux. Some of these are sh, csh, date, who, more, and there are many 
others.
