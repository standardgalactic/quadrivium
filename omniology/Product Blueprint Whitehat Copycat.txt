Experience Level

Traffic sources 
They would like to know how you are going to send traffic to their CPA 
offers. Through paid advertising (like PPC), your own website, email etc. 
When you have read the other Modules you can better answer this kind 
of questions.

Experience with other cpa networks 
If you have worked with other networks you can enter them here (like 
commission junction or Clickbank). 
Important when you sign up!
Remember that there are real people behind this network. Mostly are 
highly professional. Try to be honest in your application (of course you 
can play a little with this, but not too much ). If you are accepted in the 
network you are going to work with this people closely. So lying would 
only have a very negative effect on your relationship with this network.
Be friendly and honest and they will be open to higher commission 
payouts, better payout plans and advance payments. 
If you are building a good relationship with them they maybe even will let 
you know first about new great CPA offers before they  open it to the 
public (other marketers).
