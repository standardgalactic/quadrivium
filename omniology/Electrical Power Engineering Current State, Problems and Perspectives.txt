Preface
The author of this textbook intends to consider all stages of the life cycle of the
energy resources: extraction of mineral energy resources and mastering for power
engineering renewable energy, transportation of mineral energy raw materials to the
place of consumption, the conversion of primary energy sources into electrical
and/or thermal energy, transportation and distribution among the customers, and
energy storage (if necessary).
The author hopes that this approach—an analysis in the book of all main issues
of the current state, problems and prospects for the most important sectors of the
modern economy and daily life—power engineering—will allow the reader with
minimal time and effort to get a holistic view of it. Naturally, such an approach does
not allow all the problems to be considered deeply enough. This is the task of
specialized textbooks and monographs. In these circumstances, all the questions in
the textbook were conditionally divided into two groups. The former include the
following issues: the impact of the energy sector on the socioeconomic and envi-
ronmental conditions for the existence of the humanity, new and perspective pri-
mary energy sources (nonconventional renewable energy, auxiliary fuel resources),
poorly developed new and promising ways of producing electricity and thermal
energy (hydrogen energy, fast reactors, controlled thermonuclear fusion), accu-
mulation of various types of energy (electrical, thermal, chemical, kinetic, and
potential), small distributed power, and DC power transmission.
The latter include issues related to the well mastered in the industry and covered
in the educational and scientiﬁc literature energy technologies: traditional produc-
tion and transportation of energy resources (gas, oil, coal, and nuclear fuel);
operation of powerful thermal, hydraulic, and nuclear power plants; transmission of
electricity by means of three-phase current; and energy saving and energy efﬁciency
at the enterprises of the fuel and power complex (FPC). Questions of the second
group are considered in the book only concisely.
A great deal of attention given to main problems of power engineering includes
the following: (1) exhaustion of nonrenewable power-generating resources
(“Hunger for energy”), (2) negative impact of energy facilities on the environment
(“Ecological infarct”), and (3) social and geopolitical threats.

The ﬁrst problem is due to the rapid growth of the speciﬁc energy consumption
(by each person) and the population growth on the planet. Today, it is particularly
relevant for those countries that do not have their own energy resources in sufﬁcient
quantities and cannot buy it in abroad due to poverty [1, 2.]
Scientists studying the problem of sustainable development of human society
believe that the second problem—the harmful impact of industry (ﬁrst of all the
objects of energy industry) on the environment—is of major concern today [3–5.]
Seriousness of the third problem “the social and geopolitical threats” is well
expressed by journalists: “The current wars have not only the smell of the blood, but
also the smell of oil” [6]. The reality of this problem conﬁrmed quickly and easily—
just compare the map of contemporary armed conﬂicts with the map of location of the
main oil and gas reserves. This problem is not discussed in the textbook, as the true
causes of today’s military conﬂicts, their cause and results are covered in details by
the mass media. Besides, the author of the textbook is not a professional politician
and his personal point of view may not always reﬂect objective reality.
Methods for solving the ﬁrst two problems based on mastering new production
and energy consumption technologies, increasing the efﬁciency of utilization of
power resources, and improving the life organization (life style) are analyzed.
Upgrade strategy for power energy development and environment protection—one
of the world trends in the past 1.5–2 decades. In its line is the Russian President
decree “On the Strategy of the Russian Federation Scientiﬁc and Technological
Development” signed in 2016. Important place is given to “New power engineering
and environmental protection.”
Many experts believe that the situation with growing demand for electric power
for humanity can be improved only through revolutionary changes in the energy
sector. However, on the path of reforms, there are a number of problems.
Factors determining the onset and rate of development of global energy revo-
lution are
1. Economic—requirements in investment on a huge scale.
2. Technological—the inability of quick change of technological structures.
3. Social—(a) rapid population growth in developing countries and (b) the inability
to quick change the existing domestic foundations.
A difﬁcult task is provision of humanity with the electrical and thermal energy in
developed countries. It solved by the fuel and power complex (FPC). It includes
ﬁve main sectors (enumerated in accordance with technology in electrical power
engineering):
• Search and investigation of ﬁelds (oil, gas, coal, shale oil and gas, and uranium);
• Fuel industry (production of oil, gas, coal, shale, peat);
• Pipeline transportation fuels (oil-trunk pipelines, oil products pipelines, and gas
pipelines);
• Power production;
• Power transmission and distribution.

Preface

For example, in Russia, the FPC ensured about 35 % of the gross domestic
product, more than 40% of the revenue item of the budget, and about 65–68 %
of the currency income of Russia.
In the present century, one of the most important problems for humanity is the
development of power engineering as a branch of science and economy without
the damaging effects on the environment—this is the prevailing opinion among
scientists around the world.
This statement is conﬁrmed, including the fact that the International Global
Energy Prize (*1 million $ by analogy with Nobel Prize) was established in Russia
in 2003 on the initiative of Nobel laureate Zhores Alferov. It awarded for out-
standing basic and applied research in the ﬁeld of power engineering.
In the program ads of Administration of US President D. Trump in his inau-
guration day, the ﬁrst task is energy.
Over the past century, the electric power industry continues to contribute to the
welfare, progress, and technological advances of the human race. The growth of
electric energy consumption in the world has been phenomenal. In the USA, for
example, electric energy sale has grown well over 400 times in the period between
the turn of the twentieth century and the early 1970s. This growth rate was 50 times
as much as the growth rate of all other energy forms used during the same period.
The industry now faces new challenges associated with the interaction of power
system entities in their efforts to make crucial technical decisions while striving to
achieve the highest level of human welfare. This issue is discussed in Chap. 1 and
in the introductory parts of several other chapters.
The second chapter provides the brief historical information on the formation
and development of the electricity study and its application that makes it possible
for students and young scientists to acquire the skills of perception of special
disciplines in their historical correlations with fundamental science.

issues and consolidate the new knowledge. The reference list includes only the
English-language publications that are easy to ﬁnd, and that contain materials sufﬁ-
cient for in-depth study of the problems discussed in the textbook. (The exception is
made only for two monographs: [1] Bauman Z. Leben in der Fluechtigen Moderne.—

Chapter 1
Power Engineering as a Basis for Progress
of Civilization
The ﬁrst chapter in this textbook should provide insights into the inﬂuence of power
engineering on the present day civilization. It is through an understanding of the
past developments and achievements we can understand our present and forge
ahead to future advances.
1.1
Main Concepts and Deﬁnitions
Before we brieﬂy consider the history and current problems of electric power
engineering (EPE) as part of the FPC and challenges to all human community
associated with power engineering, we recall the main concepts and deﬁnitions
relating to this issue.
Energy (action or activity in the Greek language) is a common quantitative
measure of various forms of motion of matter.
The main properties of energy are:
• Ability to manifest itself only when states or positions of various objects in the
surrounding world are changing,
• Each form of energy can be transformed into another form,
• Possibility to be quantiﬁed,
• Ability to display effects useful for a human.
Depending on the nature, there are eight basic forms of energy: mechanical,
thermal, electrical, chemical, magnetic, electromagnetic, nuclear, and gravitational.
There are numerous ways to classify the types of power-generating natural
resources. They include the source of origin, the state of development, and the
renewability of the resources. In articles and monographs, you can ﬁnd different
names to the same types of energy resources, as well as their different classiﬁca-
tions. Here are the most common. For example, natural resources can be combined
according to of their origin into the following types:

Biotic or “biomass” (BM)—these terms include a wide range of materials of
biological origin, namely:
(1) Natural vegetation products (wood, wood waste, peat, leaves, etc.);
(2) Wastes, including ﬂammable, household, and industrial waste;
(3) Agricultural residues (stalks, leaves, manure, etc.);
(4) Specially grown high-yielding agricultures.
The chemical composition and formation processes of the traditional “fuel triad”
(coal, oil, and gas) is similar to that of biomass. However, fossil fuels formed
millions of years ago, and therefore they are not considered as renewable energy
sources.
Abiotic: these resources come from nonliving and organic materials. Examples
of these resources include fuel for nuclear reactors—uranium, thorium (in a future)
and thermonuclear reactors—helium, deuterium, and tritium.
Natural resources can categorize based on their stage of development including:
• Potential resources: these resources that exist in a region and may be used in
future. For example, if a country has petroleum in bowels of the earth, it is a
potential resource until they will be extracted.
• Actual resources: these are resources that have been surveyed, their quantity
and quality has been determined, and they are currently being used. The
development of actual resources depends on technology.
• Reserve resources: this is the part of an actual resource that can be used
proﬁtably in future.
• Stock resources: these resources are explored, but can not be used at present due
to the lack of appropriate technologies. An example of a stock resource is
hydrogen. There is constant worldwide debate regarding the allocation of nat-
ural resources. The discussions are centered around the issues of resource
depletion and the exportation of natural resources as a basis for many economies
(especially developed nations). The vast majority of natural resources are
exhaustible which means they are available in a limited quantity and can be fully
depleted if their use is not managed correctly. Natural resource economics aim
to study resources in order to prevent depletion.
Energy extracted directly from the nature called primary energy.
Energy produced by a human by primary energy conversion in power plants is
called secondary energy (electrical, vapor, and hot-water energies). Thermal,
chemical, and nuclear energies in the literature sometimes are called internal
energy, that is, energy stored inside a substance. The modern science admits the
existence of other types of energy that have not yet been discovered. Power-
generating resources (PGR) are material objects containing energy suitable for its
utilization by a human at present or in the nearest future. Depending on sources,
PGR subdivided into primary (natural) and secondary (subsidiary) ones.
In turn, primary PGR subdivided into fuel and non-fuel according to methods of
their utilization.

1. Natural resources also classiﬁed based on their renewability:
• Renewable natural resources: these resources can replenish. Examples of
renewable resources include sunlight, wind, water ﬂow, and others. They are
available for a long time and their quantity does not depend on consumption.
However, renewable resources do not have a rapid recovery rate, but some of
them can be depleted if overused.
• Non-renewable natural resources: these resources are formed extremely
slowly in the scale of human life and even the life of generations. It is
reﬂected in their name. Resources are non-renewable if their consumption
rate exceeds the recovery rate. For example, fossil fuels are non-renewable
natural resources.
2. According to their dynamics, they are resources participating in the permanent
energy cycle (solar and space energy and so on), deposited resources (coal, oil,
gas, and so on), and artiﬁcially activated resources (nuclear and thermonuclear
energy).
3. According to the effect on the Earth and near-Earth space, they add or do not
add energy to the natural planetary energy inﬂux.
4. According to the economic efﬁciency, they are: gross (theoretical) resources
encompassing the whole energy of the given energy resource, technical
resources incorporating the energy that can be extracted from the given resource
at the existing technical level, and economic resources encompassing the energy
whose production from the given resource type is economically proﬁtable for
the existing costs of equipment, materials, and labor. The relative contribution
of the last two resources increases in the process of reﬁnement of power
equipment and mastering new technologies.
Secondary PGR (SPGR) are power by-products unused in the given production
process or facility. The secondary PGR characterize the energy potential of prod-
ucts, wastes, by-products, and intermediate products of technological aggregates
(systems) that cannot will be used in this aggregate but can be used partially or
completely to supply power to other consumer.
Chemically bound heat of products of fuel reﬁning (oil reﬁning, gas-generator,
coking, coal-enrichment, and so on) systems does not belong to the SPGR. Thermal
energy of wastes used for heating ﬂows entering the aggregate—the secondary PGR
source (for regeneration or recuperation)—belongs to them.
The amount of heat, cold, or electrical energy produced from the SPGR in a
utilization system are called a yield. The yield can be possible, economically
expedient, planned, and actual. The difference is understandable from the
deﬁnitions.
By nature, the SPGR are subdivided into thermal and combustible and an ex-
cessive pressure.
The thermal SPGR incorporate physical heat of outgoing gases, main products
and by-products, ash and slag, and hot water and vapor used in technological
systems and working bodies of cooling systems of these technological systems.
1.1
Main Concepts and Deﬁnitions

When the thermal SPGR in the form of heat of outgoing gases of technological
aggregates and heat of main products and by-products are properly utilized, much
fuel is saved. Calculations demonstrated that the cost of heat energy produced in
utilization systems is lower than expenses on generation of the same amount of heat
energy in main power plants.
The combustible SPGR incorporate combustible gases and by-products that can
be used as fuel in other systems and cannot be used in the given technological
process, for example, by-products of timber industry (chips, sawdust, shavings, and
cuttings), combustible parts of buildings and structures destroyed because of
unﬁtness for further exploitation. Others solid or liquid fuel by-products are used in
pulp and paper production.
The SPGR of excessive pressure incorporate potential energy of gases, water,
and vapor outgoing from a system and having an excessive pressure that still can be
utilized before emission into the atmosphere or discharge into water reservoirs,
tanks, or other containers.
The excessive kinetic energy also refers to secondary power resources of
excessive pressure.
The electrical power system (EPS) is a subsystem of the fuel and power com-
plex (FPC) that, in its turn, consists of following three systems:
• the source of energy—generation (production)
• bulk transfer—transmission
• supply to individual customers—distribution.
It is a set of power stations, step-up and step-down transformer substations, and
transmission and distribution lines.
Figure 1.1 illustrates this set of systems together with their direct and reverse
links (shown by dashed straight lines). This ﬁgure and the above deﬁnition
emphasize the system approach to power engineering in the context of which it is
considered as a large system incorporating parts of large systems as subsystems.
The development and functioning of power engineering depends on social and
demographic factors (political and economic states of the given country, labor
resources in it, population accommodation, location of power sources, and so on).
The volume of energy production is connected with its consumption in industry,
agriculture, everyday life, and transport.
Since power of artiﬁcial power systems and natural geophysical processes that
inﬂuence our planet become comparable, power engineering will play more and
more important role in the future of humanity. This is not only demographic and
ecological but the social and political factors that inﬂuence international affairs.
Essential factor inﬂuencing international cooperation, conﬂicts, and agreements
between governments is the extreme uneven distribution of energy resources on the
planet, Fig. 1.2.

It is very heterogeneous across countries and per capita energy consumption.
The difference in the electricity consumption per capita in different countries
reaches 50-fold.

Inﬂuence of Power Engineering on the Development
of Humanity
Historically, the process of energy consumption on our planet was strong
non-uniform. Figure 1.3 illustrates this process. Humanity has spent approximately
900–950 thousand TWh of energy of all types during its lifetime. Moreover, about
2/3 of this amount has been spent in the last 30–5 years.

Figure 1.3 shows that especially rapidly the energy consumption has been
increasing since the 20th century. Dynamics of world energy consumption from
1990 up to 2035 is shown in Fig. 1.4.
Annual growth in world energy consumption up to 2020 will amount 1.6–2%
and then slows down to 1%; in 2035, the world will consume about 17.4 billion
tons of oil equivalent. This is by 33% higher than in 2011.
The non-uniformity of energy consumption is also typical over this period. Thus,
each human in the prehistoric epoch used his/her muscular force and the energy of
ﬁre and spent nearly the same amount of energy. Hence, the energy distribution can
be considered approximately uniform (1:1). At present, the non-uniformity of
energy consumption per capita is huge. In different countries, it is expressed by the
1:40 ratio. The non-uniformity of electrical energy consumption is even higher.
Thus, about 25,200 kWh of electrical energy is spent per capita in Norway, whereas
in Ethiopia only 54 kWh is spent per capita.
Even in a small group of countries that produce and consume the greatest
amount of electricity there is a signiﬁcant difference in the value of this index,
Table 1.1.
Progress in power engineering and in electrical consumption systems is of great
importance, because they increase the labor efﬁciency and hence the gross output

Figure 1.5 shows the dependence of the gross national population income
(NI) on the energy consumption (EC). The income expressed in dollars USA and
energy in Btu was recalculated per capita (Btu is the British unit of heat equal to
1.055 kJ).

In Fig. 1.6 shows the connection of other indicators of well-being of residents of
a country—Human Development Index (HDI)—with the volume of electricity
consumption.
The period of scientiﬁc and technical revolution and formation of postindustrial
society in the most developed countries differs qualitatively from the preceding
stages of development. This difference is primarily a huge revolutionary advance of
productive forces and creation of technically perfect and highly efﬁcient automated
means of production on a large scale.
A scientiﬁc and technical revolution is a complicated process with diversiﬁed
social consequences. Progress in science and technology is determined by the unity
of evolutionary and revolutionary changes. Moreover, with the corresponding

premises, the effect of internal mechanisms in the development of science and
technology and of public needs can transform the evolutionary changes into rev-
olutionary ones. Any technical revolution is characterized by radical changes in
production means or production process itself. It involves even branches of
industry, and as a result, a qualitatively new material and technical base are created.
Considering the current scientiﬁc and technical revolution and processes in the
postindustrial society, we must take into account the history of technical devel-
opment, basic technical achievements, and scientiﬁc discoveries over the past few
years. This allows proper directions of scientiﬁc and technical progress chose that
will not only ensure fast progress, but also will completely meet the requirements of
the present and future generations.
Advances in automation and electriﬁcation of the production process and means
of transport are also important for present and future revolutionary changes in
power engineering and the gross income. Human consciousness and mind evolve in
the process of modernization of production means and forces as people learn to
change the nature. Attempting to penetrate the mysteries of nature, humans are
making efforts to use capabilities of nature to meet its own needs. Such natural
phenomena as a lightning, solar energy, rise and fall of tides, and many others that
were perceived as mysterious forces by ancient people became more understandable
in the course of time. The worship of these and elemental forces makes people to

idolize them. It was no mere chance that the Sun was a supreme god for many
ancient people. This naive idea of the Sun evaluates correctly its signiﬁcance as a
source of almost all energy used by humans and as a source of life. Solar heat was
the ﬁrst energy source used by a human. A legend about Prometheus reported the
greatest event in the human life, namely, that people had been learned to make and
to support ﬁre and hence to utilize chemical energy accumulated in an inorganic
fuel. This form of energy is widely used at present.
Mastering of natural PGR has stimulated the creation of machines capable of
execution of complex operations, and a considerable portion of physical and a
certain portion of intellectual work was thrown on these machines. Their mod-
ernization gave people free time for the most creative work and better under-
standing of laws of nature to use them for the beneﬁt of humanity. In turn, this
promoted the creation of even better instruments of production.
The demands for energy permanently increased sending people in a search for
new energy resources and new methods of energy transformation from one type
into another. At present the use of solar energy, chemical energy of organic fuel,
mechanical energy of water in rivers, seas, and oceans, wind energy, and nuclear
energy liberated in the process of ﬁssion of heavy nuclei becomes already con-
ventional. The use of thermonuclear energy of synthesis of light elements is very
promising; this will solve the problem of energy supply arising in connection with
exhaustion of organic fuel reserves in near future.
Returning to the question of the development of power engineering, it should be
noted that explosive progress in technique and its modern level would be impos-
sible without qualitatively new energy types, ﬁrst, electrical energy. Electrical
energy provides the basis for modern civilization. Without electrical energy, the
normal life of modern society is impossible. Exactly electrical energy was a driving
force that led to large-scale machine manufacture and ensured unprecedented
progress in the development of productive forces. Electric energy can be easily
transmitted over a long distance and transformed into other energy types.
Recently, the relationship of power engineering with the biosphere, that is, the
space in which all living beings exist, becomes more clearly pronounced. This
happens on our planet because the power and energy that a human has learned to
produce artiﬁcially become comparable to natural ones (See Chaps. 5 and 8).

Chapter 2
From the History of Electrical
Power Engineering
This chapter describes a brief perspective of development of electric power systems.
This is not a detailed historical review, but rather it uses historical landmarks as a
background to highlight the features and structure of the modern power
systems discussed in the next chapters [1]. (Fragments of the newest history can be
found in [2].)
2.1
Formation of Electrical Engineering
as an Independent Engineering Branch (1870–1890)
Electrical equipment systems were used only in laboratories, and consumers had no
sufﬁciently high-power and economically efﬁcient source of electric energy. Such a
source was created in 1870. The next 15–20 years passed as years of creation of
main electrical engineering devices for industrial and household applications and
formation of new engineering branch—electrical engineering.
The experience in application of electromagnetic telegraph suggested the prin-
cipal feasibility of transmission of signiﬁcant amount of electric energy using
conductors. Already in the 1840–1850s electrical engineers from the USA, Italy,
and some other countries came up with the idea of an electriﬁed railroad equipped
with
power
transmission
at
long
distances.
Experiments
of
I. Fontaine
(1833–1910), a French electrical engineer, became world-known.
The international exhibition from which the history of power transmission began
was held in Vienna in 1873. In this exhibition, I. Fontaine demonstrated
reversibility of electrical machines. A cable more than 1 km long connected a
generator and an engine. The engine actuated a pump of an artiﬁcial decorative
waterfall. This experiment demonstrated the principal feasibility of power trans-
mission at long distances. At the same time, I. Fontaine was not convinced of an
economic efﬁciency of power transmission, because he observed signiﬁcant decay

of the engine power when he connected the cable and large energy losses in the
cable. W. Stanley in the US at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, installed the ﬁrst
practical AC distribution system in 1866, which acquired the American rights to the
transformer from its British inventors Goliard and Gibbs. Early AC distribution
utilized 1000-V overhead lines. The Nikola Tesla invention of the induction motor
in 1888 helped to replace DC motors and fastened the advance in use of AC
systems. The ﬁrst American single-phase AC system was installed in Oregon in
1889. Southern California Edison Company established the ﬁrst three-phase 2.3 kV
system in 1893. By 1895, Philadelphia had about twenty electric companies with
distribution systems operating at 100-V and 500-V two-wire DC and 220-V
three-wire DC, single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase AC with frequencies of
60, 66, 125, and 133 cycles per second, and feeders at 1000–1200 V and 2000–
2400 V.
As is well known, the losses in a transmission line depend on voltage and wire
resistance, and cross sectional area. It is virtually impossible to decrease the
resistance of wires, since copper that became the main material for manufacturing
wires has extremely low resistance. Only nowadays researchers are involved in
theoretical and experimental works aimed at reducing the resistance of transmission
lines based on the superconductivity phenomenon (cryogenic transmission lines).
Therefore, there were only two methods of decreasing losses in the transmission
line, namely, to increase the wire cross-section or to increase the voltage.
The ﬁrst method was intensively studied in the 1870s, because an increase in the
cross sectional area of conductors seemed more natural and easier for realization
than an increase in the voltage. However, numerous attempts of implementation of
this method have ﬁnally demonstrated the lack of its prospects.
The deadlock character of the method for decreasing losses by increasing the
cross sectional area of wires was rather quickly realized.
The third method of solving the problem of electric energy transmission had
been comprehended theoretically for a long time.
M. Deprez
(1843–1918),
a
French
engineer
(later
Academician)
and
D.A. Lachinov (1842–1902), Professor of Physics of the St. Petersburg Forest
Institute, carried out the most comprehensive studies of this problem independently
in 1880.
The report of M. Deprez entitled “On the Efﬁciency of Electric Engines and
Measurement of the Amount of Energy in an Electric Circuit” was published in
minutes of the Paris Academy of Sciences in March 1880. M. Deprez is known in
the history of electrical engineering as an inventor of several systems of an
ammeter, wattmeter, deadbeat galvanometer, and principle of mixed (compound)
excitation of electric machines, electromagnetic hammer (reciprocating engine),
and electrical motion synchronization system.
In his report, M. Deprez mathematically proved that the efﬁciency of a system
comprising an electric motor and a transmission line was independent of the line
resistance. This conclusion seemed paradoxical for M. Deprez, since from the very
beginning he failed to establish that the increase of the line resistance had no effect
14

From the History of Electrical Power Engineering

on the efﬁciency of electric power transmission only under a speciﬁc condition,
namely, when the transmission voltage increased.
These conditions were ﬁrst pointed out by D.A. Lachinov in his paper entitled
“Electromechanical work” published in June 1880 in the ﬁrst issue of the Journal
Electricity. Based on mathematical operations, he demonstrated that the efﬁciency
of electric energy transmission is independent of the distance only under condition
of increasing rotation rate of the generator (that is, when the voltage in the line
increased, because the EMF produced by the generator is proportional to its rota-
tional speed.) D.A. Lachinov also determined quantitative interrelationships among
the parameters of the transmission line and proved that to keep the transmission
efﬁciency constant when the resistance increases n folds, the rotational speed of the
generator should be increased by square root of n times.
In 1882 M. Deprez built the ﬁrst Misbach–München transmission line 57 km
long. A steam engine actuating a 3-hp dc generator producing a dc voltage of 1.5–
2 kV was placed at one end of the test transmission line in Misbach. The energy
was delivered through steel telegraphic wires 4.5 mm in diameter to the territory of
the München exhibition where the same machine operated as an electric motor that
actuated a pump of an artiﬁcial waterfall. Though this ﬁrst experiment gave no
favorable technical results (the transmission efﬁciency did not exceed 25%), its
signiﬁcance could not be underestimated, because the electric energy transmission
from Miesbach to München was the starting point for the development of methods
and means of electric energy transmission at long distances.
In 1885 new experiments on power transmission between Crale and Paris at a
distance of 56 km were conducted. Specially constructed machines that yield the
output 6 kV were used as dc high-voltage generators. The mass of this machine was
70 t, its output power was about 50 hp, and its transmission efﬁciency was about
45%.
During the same period, case transmissions of electric power at long distances
were performed for industrial applications with the efﬁciency as great as 75%.
Nevertheless, attempts to transmit the electric power using the direct current
carried out in the 80s did not bring desirable results. In this case, it is important to
emphasize the arising contradiction. On the one hand, the design and production of
dc electric machines and systems had gained wide acceptance and the dc engines
had good performance characteristics that met the majority of industrial require-
ments. Therefore, there were no severe obstacles for electriﬁcation of the industrial
stock of machines. However, on the other hand, large-scale industrial electriﬁcation
could be realized only in the case of centralized production of electric power and
hence only when it could be transmitted at long distances.
Difﬁculties connected with dc energy transmission set scientists thinking over
the theory and technology of alternating current.
Once the main parts of ac systems (generators and transformers) had been
developed, attempts of industrial ac power transmission were undertaken. In 1883
L. Golyar transmitted a power of 20 hp at a distance of 23 km to supply the
illumination system of the London Subway. Transformers stepped up the voltage to
2.1

1500 V. Next year L. Golyar demonstrated transmission of a power of *40 hp. at
2 kV at a distance of 40 km in the Turin Exhibition.
However, in the second half of the 1880s a problem of connecting a electric
motive load into an electric circuit arose that troubled engineers and scientists.
Thus, the transmission of electric power in single-phase ac circuits involved con-
tradictions no less serious than the dc transmission. The voltage in single-phase ac
circuits could easily be stepped up and down in any desirable limits using trans-
formers. Therefore, there were no difﬁculties in the electric power transmission.
However, single-phase ac engines had characteristics unsuitable for practical
applications. In particular, they either had no starter at all (synchronous engines) or
were hard to start up because of difﬁcult conditions for current commutation
(collector engines). Therefore, the application ﬁeld of single-phase ac circuits was
limited almost exclusively by illumination systems, which certainly could not meet
the requirements of the industry.
Whereas N. Tesla and his employees attempted to improve the two-phase sys-
tem, a better three-phase electric system had been developed in Europe. In 1887–
1889, scientists and engineers developed multiphase systems more or less
successfully.
M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii (1862–1919), who managed to assign the practical
character to his work, was most successful in the development of multiphase sys-
tems. Therefore, he is correctly considered to be a founder of three-phase system
technology.
M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii was born in St. Petersburg, studied in Riga
Polytechnic Institute, and completed his education in Higher Technical School in
Darmstadt (Germany). In this School much attention was given to practical
applications of electricity.
M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii developed a three-phase electric system and a perfect
design of the asynchronous motor that still remained unchanged.
The ﬁrst important step made by him was the invention of a rotor with a winding
reminiscent of a squirrel wheel the design of which remained virtually unchanged
up to now.
The next step of M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii work was the replacement of the
two-phase system by a three-phase system. The ﬁrst three-phase asynchronous
motor with an output power of about 100 W was constructed in spring of 1889.
This motor was supplied by the current from a three-phase single-armature con-
verter and passed tests quite satisfactorily.
After the ﬁrst single-armature converter he created the second high-power
modiﬁcation. Then manufacturing of three-phase synchronous generators began.
Designs of engines constructed by M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii were so perfect that
remained virtually unchanged for more than 100 years of their existence.
The three-phase system became so widespread from the ﬁrst years of its con-
struction because it did solve successfully the problem of power transmission at
long distances. However, the power transmission is efﬁcient at high voltage, which
for the ac can be obtained using a transformer. The three-phase system presented no
principal difﬁculties for energy transformation, but required three single-phase
16

transformers instead of one. Such an increase of the number of rather expensive
transformers sent M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii in search for a better solution.
M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii invented a three-phase transformer. In October 1891 he
submitted an application for a patent on a three-phase transformer with parallel rods
arranged in one plane. This design is still retained.
Works devoted to three-phase circuits were also aimed at improving the power
transmission characteristics. To adjust voltages in separate phases and to have two
voltages in the system, namely, phase and linear voltages, M.O. Dolivo-
Dobrovolskii suggested a four-wire scheme for three-phase circuit or in other
words, a system with a neutral wire in 1890. Simultaneously he indicated that the
grounding could be used instead of neutral or zero wire. Thus, all basic elements of
the three-phase system of power supply including a transformer, three- or four-wire
transmission line, and an asynchronous motor in two main modiﬁcations (with
phase and cage rotors) was constructed for 2–3 years. From all possible designs of
multiphase synchronous generators the principle of construction of which had
already been known, only three-phase machines have received wide application. In
such a way, the three-phase electric current system came into being and received
wide recognition.
M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii recommended a sine curve as a main current
waveform. He also recommended a current frequency of 30–40 Hz. However, only
two mains frequencies were chosen after a critical analysis: 60 Hz in the USA and
50 Hz in other countries. These frequencies were optimal, because an increase in
the mains frequency led to an excessive increase of the rotation speed of electric
machines (with the same number of poles), whereas a decrease in the mains fre-
quency adversely affected the uniformity of illumination.
2.2
Next Stages of Power Engineering—Sustainable
Formation and Development
Electriﬁcation in the history of science and technology dates back to 1891 when a
three-phase electric transmission system was demonstrated and tested in the
International Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt am Main.
In August 1891, 1000 incandescent lamps supplied by a current from the Laufen
hydroelectric power station were ﬁrst lit in the exhibition; on September 12, 1891
the M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii engine put into operation a decorative waterfall.
What was this ﬁrst three-phase system of electric transmission like?
In the Laufen hydroelectric power station, the electric power generated by a
turbine was transmitted through a conical gear to the shaft of a three-phase syn-
chronous generator (with an output power of 230 kV A, rotation speed of 150 rpm,
and voltage of 95 V in which windings were connected in star). In Laufen and
Frankfurt there were three three-phase transformers with a prismatic magnetic core.
The transformers were immersed in tanks ﬁlled with oil.
2.1

The three-wire transmission line supports were made from wood with an average
span of about 60 m. Pin-type porcelain-oil insulators carried copper wires 4 mm in
diameter. An interesting feature of this transmission line was the installation of
fuses on the high-voltage side: a segment 2.5 m long consisting of two copper wires
each having a diameter of 0.15 mm was connected in the gap of each wire at the
beginning of the line. To switch off the line in Frankfurt, a simple device was used
to short the three-phase circuit. The fuses blew, the turbine started to increase its
speed, and when the machine operator noticed this, he stopped the machine.
In the exhibition site in Frankfurt, a step-down transformer was placed from
which 1000 incandescent lamps arranged on a huge board were supplied at a
voltage of 65 V. The Dolivo-Dobrovolskii three-phase asynchronous motor that
drove a hydraulic pump with an output power of about 100 hp that put into
operation a small artiﬁcial waterfall was also demonstrated in this exhibition.
Simultaneously with this high-power motor, M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii exhibited a
100-W three-phase asynchronous motor with a fan ﬁtted to its shaft and a 1.5-kW
motor with a dc generator ﬁtted to its shaft.
Tests of transmission system conducted by the International Commission gave
the following results: the minimum electricity transmission efﬁciency (the ratio of
the power on the secondary terminals of the transformer in Frankfurt to the power
on the turbine shaft in Laufen) was 68.5%, the maximum efﬁciency was 75.2%, the
linear voltage during the tests was about 15 kV and increased to 25.1 kV at a higher
voltage, and the maximum efﬁciency was 78.9%.
These tests not only demonstrated the capabilities of electrical energy trans-
mission but also resolved the old debates: the alternating current conquered the
direct current.
The creation of the three-phase system was the most important stage in the
development of electric power engineering and electriﬁcation. When the Frankfurt
exhibition was over, the electric power station in Laufen became the property of
Halbern situated at a distance of 12 km from Laufen. It was put into operation in
early 1892. The electric power was used to supply all urban lighting mains as well
as a number of small plants and workshops. The step-down transformers were
established directly for consumers.
In 1892, the Bulakh–Erlikon line was put into operation in Switzerland.
A hydroelectric power station with three three-phase generators having a power of
150 kW each was built at a waterfall in Bulakh. The electric power was transmitted
at a distance of 23 km to supply a plant. After these ﬁrst stations, a number of
electric power stations were built rather fast. Most of them were built in Germany.
In America, the ﬁrst three-phase station was built in the late 1893 in California.
The hydroelectric power station had two generators with power of 250 kW each
and two transmission lines at a generated voltage of 2500 V. The ﬁrst line
(12 km long) delivered energy for lighting, and the second line (7.5 km long)
supplied a three-phase asynchronous motor with a power of 150 kW.
At the beginning, the rate of use of three-phase systems in America was much
less than in Europe. This is explained by the fact that one of the largest American
18
2
From the History of Electrical Power Engineering

ﬁrms—the Westinghouse Electric Corporation—persistently attempted to organize
building of the Tesla two-phase electric power stations and electric networks.
The American ﬁrm General Electric, the main competitor of the Westinghouse
Electric Corporation, fast redirected and in counterpoise to the competitive ﬁrm
organized building of three-phase systems. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation
lost the competition.
Attempts of combining outdated and new engineering solutions were charac-
teristic of transition periods of any engineering branch. Thus, during almost two
decades since 1891 attempts were undertaken to combine three-phase systems with
other systems. In these years there were electric power stations having generators of
constant and alternating single-phase current together with two-phase and
three-phase generators or any their combination. The voltages and frequencies were
also different, and the consumers were supplied through separate lines. Attempts to
use outdated systems together with electric equipment mastered by plants resulted
in the creation of hybrid systems.
Two three-phase electric power stations were ﬁrst combined in 1892 in
Switzerland. In Russia, the ﬁrst enterprise with three-phase power supply was the
Novorossiisk elevator. This was a huge set of buildings, and the problem of power
distribution over ﬂoors and buildings could be solved in the best way only with the
help of electricity.
Drawings of three-phase machines were ordered to the Swiss Brown-Bowery
Plant in summer of 1892. In 1893 the elevator was electriﬁed. It is interesting to
note that all machines designed abroad were manufactured in workshops of the
elevator. Four synchronous generators having power of 300 kV A each were
mounted in the electric power station built near the elevator. Thus, the total power
of the electric power station was 1200 kW A, that is, it was the most powerful
three-phase electric power station in the world at that time.
Three-phase engines having a power of 3.5–15 kW worked in elevator rooms.
They actuated various machines and mechanisms. A portion of energy was used for
illumination.
In conclusion it is necessary to say that the historical evolution of electrical
engineering can be attributed to the work and discoveries of the scientists, math-
ematicians, and physicists who were not referenced throughout the text, but
included in the following list and Table 2.1.
Charles A. Coulomb (1736–1806), French engineer and physicist, published
the laws of electrostatics in seven memoirs to the French Academy of Science
between 1785 and 1791. His name is associated with the unit of charge.
James Watt (1736–1819), English inventor, developed the steam engine. His
name is used to represent the unit of power.
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), Italian physicist, discovered the electric pile.
The unit of electric potential and the alternate name of this quantity (voltage) are
named after him.
Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851), Danish physicist, discovered the con-
nection between electricity and magnetism in 1820. The unit of magnetic ﬁeld
strength is named after him.

Georg Simon Ohm (1789–1854), German mathematician, investigated the
relationship between voltage and current and quantiﬁed the phenomenon of resis-
tance. His ﬁrst results were published in 1827. His name is used to represent the
unit of resistance.
Michael Faraday (1791–1867), English experimenter, demonstrated electro-
magnetic induction in 1831. His electric transformer and electromagnetic generator
marked the beginning of the age of electric power. His name is associated with the
unit of capacitance.
Joseph Henry (1797–1878), U.S. physicist, discovered self-induction around
1831, and his name has been designated to represent the unit of inductance. He had
also recognized the essential structure of the telegraph, which was later perfected by
Samuel F. B. Morse.
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), German mathematician, and Wilhelm
Eduard Weber (1804–1891), German physicist, published a treatise in 1833
describing the measurement of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The gauss is a unit of
magnetic ﬁeld strength, while the weber is a unit of magnetic ﬂux.
James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), Scottish physicist, discovered the elec-
tromagnetic theory of light and the laws of electrodynamics. The modern theory of
electromagnetics is entirely founded upon Maxwell’s equations.
Ernst Werner Siemens (1816–1892) and Wilhelm Siemens (1823–1883),
German inventors and engineers, contributed to the invention and development of
electric machines, as well as to perfecting electrical science. The modern unit of
conductance is named after them.
Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857–1894), German scientist and experimenter,
discovered the nature of electromagnetic waves and published his ﬁndings in 1888.
His name is associated with the unit of frequency.

The Earth’s Energy Resources
(Reserves, Short Characteristics)
3.1
Traditional Non-renewable Energy Resources
From a large variety of energy resources occurring in nature and mentioned in
Chap. 1, we recognize the main resources used in large amounts for human needs.
Shares of energy resources of different types in the global generation of primary
energy late in the 20th century are shown in Fig. 3.1 and Table 3.1. They present
global energy resources for the same period.
The data in Table 3.1 are temporary and are approximate for three reasons:
(1) continuous intake of mineral energy resources takes place simultaneously with
the discovery of new deposits, (2) the share available for the power of
non-renewable and renewable sources of energy increases due to technological
progress, and (3) for commercial reasons, not all countries report reliable data on
energy reserves.
The energy of the required type is produced and delivered to customers in the
process of energy generation that involves ﬁve stages:
1. Production and concentration of energy resources including extraction and
enrichment of a fuel, creation of a hydrostatic head with hydraulic facilities, etc.
2. Delivery of energy resources to power engineering systems.
3. Transformation of primary energy into secondary energy most convenient for
distribution and consumption; electric power and heat are most typical.
4. Transmission and distribution of the transformed energy.
5. Primary and transformed energy consumption.
Figure 3.2 shows the energy utilization scheme.
Figure 3.2b shows the approximate (average) global consumption of energy
resources. In this case, setting the total energy of consumed primary energy
resources at 100%, the useful utilized energy is only 35–40%. The remaining part is
lost; moreover, the largest part is lost as heat. To generate electric power, the
mechanical energy of wind (“light-blue coal”), tidal energy (“dark-blue coal”),

thermal energy of bowels of the Earth (geothermal energy), and solar energy
(“yellow coal”) (see below) are used in addition to the main energy resources.
The distribution of energy resources over the Earth, countries, and territories
inside countries is very uneven. Regions with maximum concentration of energy
resources do not coincide with regions of their consumption, as exempliﬁed by oil.
More than half the global oil reserves are concentrated in the Middle East, while the
level of energy consumption there is less than one fourth of the average global level
[1, 2].
Due to the concentration of energy consumption in the most developed coun-
tries, we are in the situation in which 30% of population consume 90% of generated
energy, and 70% of population consume only 10% of generated energy. The ten-
dency toward an increase in the no uniformity of energy consumption per capita is
retained during many decades. Expediency of energy transfer at a certain distance is
determined by the energy content of the energy carrier deﬁned as the amount of
energy per unit mass of the physical body (see Table 3.2).
Among the energy, carriers used at present the highest energy content have
uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes. Their energy content reaches 2.22
GWh/kg (8  1012 J/kg). Due to a very high-energy content of nuclear fuel, it can
be easily transmitted at long distances, since comparatively small amounts of this
fuel are required to provide the operation of high-power electrical equipment sys-
tems. The power content of fuel averaged over all fuel types is 0.834 kWh/kg (3 
106 J/kg).
Organic heat by virtue of its speciﬁc properties and historical conditions remains
the main source of energy consumed by humanity, Fig. 3.1.
Reserves of all fuels that can be extracted from the bowels are limited and
according to the data of the World Energy Conference (WEC) are 28.3 million
TWh or 3480 billion ton of standard fuel.

As is well known, the standard fuel unit is taken to mean the amount of fuel the
combustion of 1 kg of which yields 29.3 MJ (8.12 kWh) of heat. This unit is used
to compare different fuel types.

Coal
The estimated global geological reserves of coal are 61–114 million TWh (7500–
14,000 billion ton of standard fuel), from which 24.4 million TWh (3000 billion ton
of standard fuel) are proven reserves. Russia and the USA have the greatest amount
of proven reserves. Germany, the People’s Republic of China, and some other
countries have considerable amounts of proven reserves, Table 3.3.
The volumes of coal production in a number of countries are shown in Table 3.4,
and the volumes of electricity produced from coal—in Table 3.5

Quite a lot of coal consumed electricity of Australia, Republic of South Africa,
Poland, Rumania and some others countries.
Due to large volumes of gas extraction and relatively low its price the so-called
“gas pause”—the rapid increase in the share of gas in the generation of electricity
and thermal energy—came in the 70–80s in the Russian energy sector in the 70–80s.

This allowed rapid increase in thermal electric power with simultaneous reduction
of the environmental impact. Today, its share is 42% (the largest among developed
countries).
The medium-term plans envisage a gradual reduction in the fuel balance of the
share of gas and, on the contrary, an increase in the share of coal, especially in the

Kuzbass is disposed.
3.1.2
Oil
In the modern global economy, the mechanisms of investment and support of its
save development are based on oil. Oil is a universal product, which has no analogs.
The price of oil is not determined by its production cost, and the factors, which lie
outside of the law of supply and demand (the law of the free market), is forecast
zone. No one analyst was able to predict price jumps in the oil market. The price of
oil is always the result of political (power) compromise. Therefore, the history of oil
is the history of wars, coups, and revolutions, that is, the history of our world. The
basis of real (not camouﬂaged) conﬂict is the struggle for the backbone (political) of
life of the world economy—for oil.
Recognition of petroleum as a product—the beginning of trading—goes back to
the middle of the XVIst century. In Russia, the ﬁrst oil was discovered under the
river Ukhta in 1721. In 1823 in the North Caucasus kerosene was obtained for the
ﬁrst time using a distillation cube of oil. The ﬁrst oil company “Pennsylvania Rock
Oil Co.” was founded in the United States in 1854. In 1859 the company ﬁrst oil
was extracted from the well, and not from the draw-well as before.
Estimation of the global oil reserves is of special interest now. This is caused by
a rapid growth of oil consumption and by the fact that in many countries (Japan,
Sweden, etc.) oil has substituted for coal in the electric power generation, though
this process slows down.
The estimated global geological reserves of oil are 200 billion ton from which 53
billion ton are proven reserves. More than half the proven reserves of oil are
concentrated in the Middle East countries. Relatively small reserves of oil are
concentrated in Western European countries with highly developed productive
forces. The global oil and gas reserves explored late in the 20th century, according
to the international “Oil and Gas Journal,” are given in Table 3.6.
The estimated proved reserves of oil are dynamic in character. Their value
changes after exploration of new deposits, Fig. 3.3 and Table 3.7.

dynamics of the world oil extraction. A very rapid growth of oil consumption is
determined primarily by four factors:
1. Development of transport of all kinds and ﬁrst, cars and aircrafts for which
liquid fuel is irreplaceable in the meanwhile.
2. Higher efﬁciency of extraction, transmission, and utilization compared to solid
fuel.
3. The tendency toward utilization of natural energy resources in the shortest
possible time and with minimum expenses.
4. The tendency toward earning maximum proﬁt through exploitation of oil
deposits.
An important trend in the oil industry is the development of its hard recoverable
reserves located in layers with the following features: (a) low permeability, (b) with
high water content, (c) with low oil saturation, and (d) with small thickness.
The fact that oil resources are far removed from places of their consumption or
centers of location of productive forces resulted in a rapid growth of oil transport
means, in particular, in the creation of pipelines of large diameters (exceeding 1 m)
and large oil ships.

Natural Gas
The estimated global geological reserves of natural gas are 140–160 trillion m3,
from which *50 trillion m3 is a share of Russia and 42 trillion m3 is a share of
Middle East countries. The distribution of gas reserves over countries and conti-
nents is presented in Fig. 3.5.
Figure 3.6 shows the world’s largest gas ﬁelds.
These numerical estimates, as in the case of oil, are approximate. They are
changing in the process of exploration of new deposits.
The importance of gas for power is demonstrated in Table 3.7.
3.1.4
Nuclear Energy
The concentration of uranium in the Earth’s crust is 0.003%. The amount of ura-
nium in the lithosphere with thickness of 20 km is estimated to be 1.3  1014 tons.
The estimated heat content of geological uranium reserves all over the world
exceeds by 320 times the heat content of the global reserves of mineral oil.

However, the geological estimate is of limited practical usefulness, because the
efﬁciency of uranium extraction depends primarily on its concentration in reserves.
With good quality of natural uranium, ore concentration there is only 0.712%, that
is, 7 kg per ton of ore. Some of the richest uranium ore (uranium content of 0.12%)
is located in the territory of Canada.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the total amount
of uranium that can be produced at a sufﬁciently low cost (less than 22 dollars per
1 kg) is 10 million ton. It will be possible to produce approximately 10 times larger

amount of uranium at 2–3 times greater cost. It is believed that the global power
resources will be doubled in the case of complete utilization of nuclear energy.
Just like other energy resources, distribution of uranium ore reserves across
countries and continents is very uneven, Table 3.8.
In general, the situation with the nuclear fuel in the world can be characterized
by the following facts:
• The annual uranium fuel consumption of about 64 thousand tons (Fig. 3.7).
• Annual production—about 55 thousand tons. The deﬁcit is covered by stocks
(armories and civil).
• Term of exhaustion—at least 100 years while maintaining the existing tech-
nologies of nuclear fuel—nuclear fuel Open NFC based on reactors with thermal
neutrons (RTN).
• In such reactors, U-235 content in natural uranium of only 0.72% is used, and
the main component is U-238 (99.28%), the probability of its ﬁssion in RTN is
very low.
• Projected world consumption of uranium by 2035 will amount to 98–136
thousand tons (large spread is due to a number of policy uncertainty regarding
the future of AE).
• In 2010, more than 2 billion dollars were spent for exploration work in the
world.

of the XXIst century

• Urgent is saving of uranium due to: (a) a more complete extraction of U-235
from the ore, (b) improvement of the technology of nuclear fuel cycle, including
transition to breeders (fast neutrons reactors—FNR).
However, it is well to bear in mind that in addition to the apparent advantages,
atomic power engineering has three severe disadvantages: (a) a small fraction of
fuel “burning away,” (b) a small but as demonstrated by the history, ﬁnite proba-
bility of emergency, and (c) problems of burial of radioactive wastes.
Since the chain reaction in modern nuclear reactors proceeds in uranium rods or
in graphite and uranium mixture only with the participation of the U-235 isotope
rather than in the entire uranium mass and the relative content of this isotope in the
basic element U-238 is only 0.7%, methods of more efﬁcient utilization of uranium
have been searched already from the very beginning of the nuclear era. The
emergency at the Chernobyl NPP on April 26, 1986 took lives of tens and health of
tens of thousand people. It dispelled the myth that NPP are safe. Reactions of
simple people were identical: they all were in fear of this source of electricity and
heat. Enormous damage caused to the population and the nature of the accident at
the NPP “Fokushima-1” in Japan in 2011.
Experts have made the only possible rightful conclusion to modify the design of
the reactor and all its systems to ensure actual rather than mythical safety of its
operation and to avoid building nuclear power plants in areas of high geological
activity (threat of earthquakes and tsunamis).
3.2
Backup Fuel (Subsidiary Mineral Fuel)
Experts have long shown interest in the mineral fuel that is not relevant to a
classical energetic triad (oil, natural gas, and coal) and nuclear fuel, its share in the
energy balance makes about 80%. These fuels (backup fuel or subsidery mineral
fuel) include: (1) slate coal, (2) bituminous sandstone, (3) gas—hydrate, (4) asso-
ciated petroleum gas, and (5) mine methane.
With the improvement of production and utilization in the course of scientiﬁc
and technological revolution, their share in the energy balance will increase.
However, because of the great technological difﬁculties in the near future they will
not be an alternative to “fuel triad” (oil, natural gas, and coal) and uranium, but only
helpers. Exclusion can make slate coal as a source nicknamed shale gas.
3.2.1
Slate Coal
The signiﬁcant part of the world stock of slate coal containing such combustion
agent as kerogen is concentrated in the USA (Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming) and
3.1
Traditional Non-renewable Energy Resources

counts about 400 billion ton that equals to 320–630 mlrd tons of liquid hydro-
carbon. Slate coal (SC) resources of Russia make 45 billion tons.
SC production in the whole world has been unproﬁtable recently since it
required mine method of extraction, the more so that SC caloric content is inferior
to mineral carbon. One ton of SC is needed to get from 0.5 to 2 barrels of com-
bustible liquid that resembles oil. However, the remains of waste material make
770 kg, in addition, they need a place to be stored. The amount of waste material
exceeds the amount of initial slate coal; moreover, there are mercury, cadmium and
lead emissions; underground waters get polluted by insoluble impurities.
The situation had radically changed when the technology of horizontal well
drilling was adapted. The technology made it possible to extract ﬂuid components
of these deposits. Experience of technology use in the USA has shown that it
increases the wells debit by a factor of at 2.5–3.
In the gas sector in general and in the development of shale deposits in 2009
started a “new energy revolution”—a large-scale extraction of shale gas began.
In 2009 the US produced 745.3 billion m3 of gas and occupied the ﬁrst place in
the world. This amounted to 40% of shale and coal bed methane. In 2010, the US
produced 51 billion m3 of shale gas. By the beginning of 2010 in the US market
over-supply of gas had been formed. So great that the terminals built in the United
States on imports of liqueﬁed natural gas remained inactive, then they started
renovations to export gas.
In the US, shale gas proven reserves amount to 24 trillion m3, or more than 10%
of the world reserves(at the moment, 3.6 trillion m3 are technically recoverable).
Large deposits of shale gas were found in a number of European countries, in
particular, in Austria, England, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine,
Romania, as well as in Australia, China, India, Canada. The distribution of shale
gas reserves by regions of the world is shown in Fig. 3.8.

The IEA predicts that by 2030 unconventional gas in Europe will amount to 15
billion m3 per year. According to the most optimistic forecasts, the current pro-
duction in Europe will not exceed 40 billion m3 per year by 2030. China plans in
2020 to reach the level of production in the range from 60 to 100 billion m3 of shale
gas annually. The wide distribution of shale gas on the planet is its major advantage
over conventional one.
The scale and pace of development of work on shale gas will depend on the
success in solving number of problems:
• the extraction of shale gas is effective only by horizontal wells, which cost 4
times higher than the vertical; the problem is aggravated by the higher hardness
shale compared to rocks in the ﬁelds of conventional gas;
• shale gas lies in a small isolated “pockets”; to get it in the appropriate volumes,
it is necessary to drill a large number of wells, each of which has a small
production rate; it is unacceptable for countries and regions with high density of
population (in particular, for the overcrowded Western Europe, in dire need of
gas, but reverently relating to the environment, including the not yet built-up
land); well service requires a large number of roads and pipelines to deliver a
huge need for the volume of water;
• for efﬁcient extraction of gas from shale, fracturing should be implemented—
water with special chemicals should be pumped into the well under high
pressure, tearing walls between the pores, and with the sand that riving these
gaps; these chemicals can get into the aquifers and adversely affect the ground
water—in fact, the last reserve of drinking water in the world;
• the life of horizontal wells is estimated to be 5–12 years, whereas conventional
wells are in operation for 30–40 years;
• according to independent experts, the cost of production 1000 m3 of shale gas in
2009–2010 was $212–283, and the volume of production from a single well—
about 50 million m3 (companies extracting shale gas, probably for promotional
purposes
referred
to
other
values—$150,
and
180–200
million m3,
respectively);
• in the process of horizontal drilling, fracturing and completion of wells in the
atmosphere gets that amount of methane that it negates all the beneﬁts of shale
gas relative to coal.
From 2010 to the summer of 2014, many members of the slate industry switched
from production of shale gas to the shale oil (Fig. 3.9). In 2014 the United States
produced about 0.4 million barrels of shale oil per day.
Around the shale gas hot economic and political debates on the global level and
in a number of countries and, above all, in the United States were opened. In 2015
because of the collapse of prices for conventional oil a number of US companies,
producing shale oil became unproﬁtable and practically ceased operations.

3.2.2
Bituminous Sandstone
Bituminous sandstone (BS) is a mixture of sand, clay, and oil asphalt. One ton of
BS, containing 14% of bitumen, needed to get 100 L of liquid carbohydrates. The
signiﬁcant part of the world stock of BS is concentrated in the USA, Canada, and
Venezuela. In some developed countries production and processing of BS has
started aiming at extraction from it non-standard oil. However, this type of oil is
being produced now only in Canada where BS contains bitumen in large propor-
tions. According to some predictions, in 2010 BS production will increase from
today’s 1 million barrels per day to 1.3 million barrels, and by 2015 will exceed
2.7 million barrels per day. According to some US experts, BS processing is
proﬁtable only if the oil price is no less than 100–200 dollars for a barrel.
High working cost interferes with the intense processing of bituminous sand-
stones and slate coals. The estimated cost of 1 m3 bitumen production from
sandstones is 220–314 dollars, from slate coals is 340–350 dollars. Thus,
non-standard oil production is near at hand.
3.2.3
Gas Hydrate
Gas hydrate (GH) is a peculiar type of gas—a crystalline molecule water cell with
the methane molecule inside (Fig. 3.10). The cells form a compact crystalline grid
that resembles ice (Figs. 3.10 and 3.11).
Escaping methane from deep under ground is able to create GH only with water
combination, particular environmental conditions, low temperatures and high
pressures. That explains the reason why GH can be found only in seas, oceans and
permafrost areas. Gas hydrates can be formed in bottom sediments with the pressure
of 25 atmospheres and temperature of about 0 °C. In case of higher temperature, a
higher pressure is required in order to form GH. Gas-hydrates can be usually found
in forms of layers in oceans and seas at depth from 300 to 1200 m. Rarely they can

oil in several countries

www.ebook3000.com

be found close to the sea bottom (at a depth of several meters from its surface). On a
Messoyakhskiy natural (ordinary) gas ﬁeld in Western Siberia (on the left bank of
the river Yenisei) GH appear even on the surface.
For the ﬁrst time GH of marine occurrence have been detected in the
mid-seventies by the Canadian ﬁsherman, and GH, laid out under ever-frozen
layers, were found by Academician A. Troﬁmuk et al. in 1975.
Special activity in prospecting GH and developing economically and ecologi-
cally effective technology of methane withdrawal from them is exhibited by the
countries experiencing deﬁciency of power resources—Japan, South Korea,
Germany, the USA, Canada, China, etc. For today, more than 200 ﬁelds are opened
in various parts of the globe, Fig. 3.12. Canada has detected vast gas hydrates
(Mallic) in river Mackenzie plain with stocks of gas of 110 billion m3, Japan lays
out gas stocks in gas-hydrates on Paciﬁc shelf (ﬁeld Hankai) in bulk of
4–20 billion m3.
Thanks to the studies held in the 80–90s, gas stocks of GH in continental and
shelf parts of Russia are valued by 100–1000 billion m3. Reservoirs of GH are
detected also in the Black sea and Lake Baikal.
Owing to a poor level of scrutiny of genesis of gas hydrates and small volume of
search and trial works, world’s reserves of gas-hydrates on different sources lay in

extremely wide limits—from several hundred to several thousand billion cubic
meters. It is considered that GH contains raw hydrocarbons 10 times more, than in
all oil and natural gas ﬁelds. GH are unique yet not developed and sufﬁciently
perspective source of gas distillate (from 1 m3 of gas hydrates it is possible to get
300 m3 of methane). If the problems concerning extraction of methane from GH are
solved successfully, the shape of the world market of power resources can be
essentially inﬂected, and the problem of “hunger for energy” will be removed for
uncertain period.
In the USA in 2000, the law has been passed providing allocation within ﬁve
years 47.5 million dollars for works on investigation and gas production from gas
hydrates. Even more active in this ﬁeld is Japan which intended to start industrial
extraction of methane from gas hydrates within the next decade.
In Russia, according to the offer of Rosnedra, two centers with ﬁnancing of
20 million rubles for research of GH in the Black Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk will
be allocated until 2010.
Difﬁculties of extraction of methane from GH consist in that at their lifting on
the surface they quickly decay into methane and ordinary ice. Thus, methane dis-
appears, aggravating the “green-house effect”. In this connection, it is necessary to
master technology of extraction of gas directly in depth by means of deep-water
extracting platforms, from where gas will be pumped by pipes in special tankers.
3.2.4
Associated Petroleum Gas
For today more accessible and competitive technology of use of “backup” fuel is oil
recovery and subsequent recycling of associated petroleum gas (APG) which
represents a mixture of methane and a wide spread of a light hydrocarbons (ethane,
propane, butane, isobutene, etc.), and also non carbon components (nitrogen, car-
bon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, helium, and argon). By the geological character-
istics, the associated petroleum gas caps and the gases dissolved in oil are
distinguished. The ﬁrst are evolved from the oil wells, the second—from reservoir
oil in the process of its separation. APG is presented far not in all oil deposits, and
where it is, volumes ﬂuctuate from units to several thousand cubic meters per one
ton of the taken oil.
APG represents valuable power raw materials thanks to its high caloric content
and environmental friendliness, and to the convenience of supply of oil ﬁelds with
the energy from means of small power stations. As the raw materials for oil-and-gas
chemistry, APG allows to receive a net gas similar to natural one, a casing-head
gasoline, liquid gas for everyday needs, and light hydrocarbons that by combustion
can be recycled into rubber, plastics, and components of high-octane petrol.
Russian mass media are telling very much about APS combustion in ﬂares (torches
above oil ﬁelds) as symbols of mismanagement and barbarian attitude to nature.
Combustion of APG is admitted as a problem number two in the activity of
Russian fuel-energetic complex (small percentage of completely recycled oil for

receiving products with high additional cost is considered to be the problem number
one), Fig. 3.13.
Nowadays the problem of useful APG is successfully solved in many countries,
including Russia, Fig. 3.14.
The following factors were obstacles for beneﬁcial use of APG for many years:

• It is difﬁcult and expensive to collect APG. That is why it turns much easier for
oil companies to pay little tax for atmosphere pollution then to invest money
into APG recycling. The APG price regulated by the government is about
400 rubles for one hundred m3. This makes its sale to native home consumers
not proﬁtable and tax for burning gas is little (about 40,000 rubles) and can be
taken only once a year;
• in the period of prosperous growth of oil extraction, building of infrastructure
for APS utilization was not in time with high rate of extracting main raw
materials;
• Law about “associated petroleum gas”, which allows making order in the
question of APG, was accepted only in 2009.
Oil companies have to elaborate the new investment projects in order to change
this situation, and the state has to provide the favorable conditions for their
realization.
The
projects
have
to
be
economically
proﬁtable
or,

Producer of APG ought to have access to gas pipeline system belonging to the
company “Gasprom”. This problem is especially difﬁcult for solving in winter,
when gas pipeline is overloaded. For this purpose, for example, the “Holland
experience” can be used that is, regulation of standard gas extraction so that to
provide APS with admittance to gas pipeline system.
The increase of power of the plants that prepare APG for consumer supply
(removing petrol from the APG) have to be coordinated with the volume of APG
extraction and gas pipeline possibility to take the prepared APG.
In the second half of 2007, the Ministry of Natural Recourses brought to the
government of the Russian Federation the project on measures aimed is to rise
effectiveness of using APG. The document considered the introduction of 95 per-
cent norm of recycled APG to 2011. From 1 January 2011, a progressive scale of
payment for pollution caused by APG has been introduced. The measures of
encouragement have also been foreseen for its using: providing a priority access to
the United National Energy system of providers of electricity produced on power
stations from APG, tax introductions, and customs privileges for enterprises
implementing projects on rational use of APG. At the last few years under pressure
of federal and local administrations, as well as from economic considerations,
oilmen have begun to change its attitude to associated petroleum gas.
3.2.5
Mine Methane (Coal Methane)
In the nearest future, mine methane (MM) can become an observable gain to gas
part of energy balance, raise efﬁciency of small and hydrogen power engineering,
provide the transport with the cheap and ecologically clean fuel. Emissions of MM
make 10% of all anthropogenic methane emissions. World stock of mine methane
3.2

makes about 260 billion m3, and it is they are distributed over the countries as
shown in Fig. 3.15.
Only Russian enterprises of coal branch annually extract from coal layers about
2 billion m3 of MM.
The mine gas is divided into two essentially different classes: (1) ventilating gas
with concentration of methane 0.5–2.0% and (2) methane at decontamination of
coal layers with concentration of about 30–90%. In the hole volume of emissions,
the basic contribution belongs to ventilating emissions—to 85%.
Accordingly, extraction of MM from coal deposits is carried out by two
schemes:
(a) Extraction of MM as associated petroleum gas at coal mining,
(b) Extraction of MM from wells specially drilled in a coal ﬁle as an independent
kind of production.
The ﬁrst scheme is aimed at increasing safety of miners’ work. The second
scheme provides preliminary and fuller extraction of MM and essentially reduces
probability of explosion at coal mining. Duration of work of wells does not concede
to service life of wells on natural (standard) gas deposits. This scheme has been
working for a long time in the USA, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, China,
Germany, and some other countries. Extraction of MM in the USA exceeds 5% of
gas consumption level in the country that makes about 35–40 billion m3. In these
countries MM is supplied into the main gas pipelines, it is used for joint burning
with coal in boiler-houses, and also in internal combustion engines and gas
turbines.

Extraction of methane from coal deposits has a number of advantages in com-
parison with other ways of its extraction:
• Majority of coal deposits is located in already habitable areas with developed
infrastructure, industrial base and manpower resources;
• basically coal layers are located at rather small depths (to 1000 m);
• Volume of prospecting drilling has essentially reduced, since already known
contours of a coal ﬁle at the same time are contours of a gas deposit in depth of
coal layers.
However, there are also serious obstacles for large-scale extraction of MM. The
main is a difﬁcult technology of its extraction in comparison with extraction of
standard (natural) gas. The coal layer gives methane at intensive mechanical
inﬂuences as it occurs in mine or on an open career at destruction of a layer by a
combine or an excavator, or by a hydraulic shock, or an explosive by means of
wells specially drilled for this purpose.
In Russia, the basic emissions of methane occur at coal extraction in Kuzbas
where at the general stocks of methane in coal layers about 13 billion m3 its annual
emissions reach 2 billion m3. At the same time, to meet internal needs, Kemerovo
area imports up to 1.5 billion m3 methane a year. For a heat supply of the enter-
prises and municipal service, more than 2 thousand boiler-houses operated on coal
fuel.
Management of the Kemerovo area intends to develop accelerated rate tech-
nology of recycling MM. It will not only expand resource, but will also give
considerable social and economic effect in the form of increase of safety of miners
work (approximately twice as much), gasiﬁcation of the region, and provision of
new workplaces.
In the USA the stringent laws oblige mine owners to provide obligatory
decontamination of coal layers before their extraction. That is the main reason that
explains why miners in the USA perish seldom. In Russia and many other
coal-producing countries one perish of a miner annually happens per 1 million tons
of coal extracted. It is also necessary to bear in mind that methane, which thrown
into the atmosphere, surpasses carbon dioxide by 20 times as “green house” gas.
Russian government has approved the project of building in the Kemerovo
region a national industrial park, called to ﬁnd modern decisions concerning safety
support in coalmines. Firstly, the project deals with the total elimination of
“gas-killer”, i.e., methane (with its subsequent recycling).
3.2.6
Syngas
Syngas (synthetic gas) is produced by gasiﬁcation of solid or liquid hydrocarbons
according to one of the two technologies: (1) unremitting gasiﬁcation and (2) si-
multaneous production of syngas, coke, and other products.
3.2
Backup Fuel (Subsidiary Mineral Fuel)
45

The highest prosperity of coal gasiﬁcation reached in the ﬁrst quarter of the
XXth century. In 1925, about 12 thousand plants in the USA were processing about
25 million tons coal per year into gas. In the 50 s, the USSR produced about 35
billion m3 of gas per year from coal. The intensive development of oil and natural
gas extraction has led to a loss of interest in this technology. However, since the
date of exhaustion of oil and gas is substantially closer than of coal, in recent years,
interest in this technology has been increased.
Gasiﬁcation technology is characterized by large “unpretentious” and versatility:
(a) it can be any gasify solid fuels—from the very young peat and lignite to
bituminous coal and anthracite, regardless of their chemical composition, the
composition of the ﬂy portion of sulfur impurities, particle size, moisture
content, and other properties;
(b) Flammable gases can be produced in a wide range of composition and prop-
erties: pure hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and mixtures thereof in
various proportions by means of gasiﬁcation.
Components of (CO + H2) are used as a raw material for a wide variety of
chemical synthesis processes, which have already been developed by industry: the
production of ammonia, methanol, dimethyl ether (as a promising alternative to
diesel fuel oil) and the generator gas that can be used in power plants.
Hydrogen is extracted (20–25%) can be used as a motor fuel, raw materials for
electrochemical elements, in biotechnology as a reducing agent in metallurgical
processes of direct reduction of iron and other metals.
The obstacles to the expansion of the scale of production of syngas are:
• Higher capital intensity,
• The high cost of gas puriﬁcation from impurities,
• The need for dozens of gasiﬁcation processes adapted to the characteristics of
raw materials and the requirements for the product (gas). The most promising of
these are:
• Techniques (methods) with a combined production of several products,
• In-cycle gasiﬁcation by coal combustion in furnaces of power plants and
high-power boilers.
In the coalﬁelds with particularly difﬁcult conditions for coal mining, a
promising method of gasiﬁcation is underground gasiﬁcation. In the coal seam, it
is expedient to create controlled burning hearth to produce a combustible gas. For
this purpose, wells are drilled from the surface for the organization of blast and
extraction onto the surface of the product—the combustible gas. All process steps
are carried out from the surface without the use of underground working.
Today, research in this area is intensively carried out in China, where dozens of
plants have been built in recent years, and in Australia, where a large enterprise of
that proﬁle has been built. India, North Korea, and Republic Korea show the
interest in this research.

Since the middle of the 90 of the XXth century, the synthesis of methanol and
dimethyl ether technology based on carbon dioxide industrial emissions are being
developed (coal thermal power plants, metallurgical, chemical, cement plants, etc.)
and electrolytic hydrogen and oxygen is produced by electrolysis of water using
renewable energy sources and nuclear power. The author is a Nobel Laureate
George Olaf says that up to 90% of all polymers and 100% of motor fuel and oil
can be obtained in this way.
In conclusion, the following should be noted: In technology of extraction and
transformation in electric and thermal energy, subsidiary (“backup”) mineral fuel so
far concedes to traditional mineral fuel. This means that the governments of dif-
ferent countries and the management of corresponding companies should render
them comprehensive support, at least until they become competitive enough. In the
countries-exporters of power generating resources, it seems to be logical to take
means for these purposes from super incomes of the oil and gas companies.

Electric Power Production
Over the past century, the electric power industry continues to contribute to the
welfare, progress, and technological advances of the human race. The growth of
electric energy consumption in the world has been phenomenal. In the USA, for
example, electric energy sales have grown to well over 400 times in the period
between the end of the XIXth century and the early 1970s. This growth rate was
50 times as much as the growth rate all other energy forms used during the same
period. The installed kW capacity per capita in the USA was about 3 kW.
4.1
Choice of the Electric Power Generation Type
The reserves of power resources and their output are determined by the efﬁciency of
their consumption. Modernization of technical equipment permitting to utilize more
completely (that is, with a higher efﬁciency) the primary energy resources implies
that a smaller amount of primary resources is required to generate the same energy
amount [1–3]. If we estimate the efﬁciency of utilization of primary resources in
terms of energy output, we are forced to point out that they are transformed into
electric power with a very low efﬁciency at stations of different types (Table 4.1).
Moreover, the efﬁciency of atomic power stations is greatest, and the efﬁciency
of hydroelectric power stations is least. The energy carrier consumption and the
efﬁciency presented in Table 4.1 were reduced to identical powers (1 GW) of
power stations generating 24 GWh a day (86.4  1012 J).
The efﬁciency can be calculated as follows. To generate an energy of 120 
1012 J, 700  106 ton of water must ﬂow through turbines of a 1-GW hydroelectric
power station. This water mass has an internal energy of 630  1026 J. Therefore,
the efﬁciency of water consumption is η = (120  1012/630  1026)  100% = 0.19
 10−12. Analogously, the efﬁciency of TPP and NPP can be estimated. The
efﬁciencies of fuel consumption at these stations are 25–40 and 15–30%,
respectively.

An increase in the efﬁciency of energy generation is a very urgent problem. As a
whole, it increases continuously. Thus, the electric power generation all over the
world has increased by a factor of 3.5 for 15 years (1950–1965). During this period,
the production of primary power resources has been only doubled. This is due to the
increased efﬁciency of electric power systems and the increased amount of primary
resources used to generate electric power [4–6].
The global electric power generation increased from 11.5 billion kWh in 1990 to
19.4–24.4 billion kWh in 2020, that is, by a factor of 1.7–2.1. During this period,
an advanced growth of the electric power generation compared to the consumption
of primary power resources was observed for all variants. The tendency toward an
increase in the electric power consumption per capita was also typical. This
parameter increased from 2.17 thousand kWh per capita in 1990 to 2.4–3.03
thousand kWh per capita in 2020. However, a new tendency was manifested,
namely, a decrease in the electric capacitance of the gross domestic product
(GDP) (by 8–27% to 2020 relative to the level of 1990.)
Among speciﬁc features of the future global electric power engineering will be
centralization of energy distribution and a great diversity of generating sources. Its
characteristic features are combination of large-sized powerful centralized and
relatively small enterprises operating in a common grid, application of hybrid
schemes of electric power and heat generation, compatibility of energy and pro-
duction technologies with complete utilization of wastes and secondary resources,
and formation of interconnected power systems.
Problems whose solution depends mainly on the energy industry initiatives are:
1. Low efﬁciency of energy production
2. Too small scale of subsidiary (auxiliary) mineral fuel use in the energy sector
3. Small share of the distributed power generation in total world electricity
4. Small share of the renewable power generation in the Fuel and Power Complex.
Since mankind has entered into the next 7th environmental crisis (now it has the
global character), we have gradually been involved into technical (technological)
revolution. For electrical power engineering this means development of new energy
sources and new ways of converting them into electrical and thermal energy. The
beginning and pace/rate of this revolution depend upon a number of factors. The

factors determining the onset and rate of the Global Energy Revolution develop-
ment are
1. Economic—requires investment on a huge scale
2. Technology—the inability of quick change of technological structures
3. Social—(a) rapid population growth in developing countries and (b) the
inability to quickly change the existing style of life
4. Global (geographical)—extremely uneven distribution of energy resources over
countries and regions.
The leaders of all levels (state, regional, and municipal), solving the problem of
energy supply to population of the territory, have a wide choice. This choice is
based on the account of two groups of factors.
1. Condition (characteristic) of the region:
• The level and proﬁle of the economy,
• The number and density of population,
• The availability of energy,
• Geographical and climatic conditions,
• The degree of depreciation of ﬁxed assets in the energy sector of the region,
• The possibilities of domestic power engineering companies and the avail-
ability of foreign equipment,
• The opinion of the majority of the population.
2. The current technological and technical level of energy production:
2:1. By the type of primary energy: (1) “fuel triad”, (2) nuclear fuel, (3) sub-
sidiary mineral fuel, and (4) renewable energy.
2:2. Power generating plants and scheme of their connection to consumers: the
network (“big”)—an autonomous/distributed (“small”).
The ranges of possible capacities of individual units of various types are shown
in Fig. 4.1.

Powerful Power Plant Based on Non-renewable
Mineral Energy Resources
Several factors remain important for power plants using mineral energy resources:
• Mineral fuel resources are sufﬁcient, at least until the end of the XXI century,
• The efﬁciency of thermal power plants continues to increase (from 10% in 1900
to more then 50% in 2020), Fig. 4.2.
• Fuel energy becomes more friendly to the environment,
• The efﬁciency of the fuel cell is already more than 70%. When bringing their
main characteristics (unit cost of installed capacity, reliability, service life) to the

level of the stationary energy requirements they may occupy an important place
in it,
• Development of alternative forms of power generation (nuclear power plants,
large-scale hydroelectric plants, power plants using unconventional renewable
resources, etc.) constrained by a number of problems that remain unsolved.

4.2.1
Features of the Use of Coal in the Energy Sector
In modern conditions of strict requirements for environmental protection in the
production of electricity and thermal energy, the most complex problems arise in
the operation of coal-ﬁred power plants. Besides, they have to compete with other
types of power plants. These circumstances and a large proportion of coal-ﬁred
power in the total power generating capacity have attracted more attention to them
in this textbook.
To troubled branches of the fuel-consuming power industry belong also nuclear
power industry and a small (distributed) power industry, which have received
considerable attention in this book.
Gas, fuel oil and gas-oil power plants are less problematic in the aspect of
environmental safety and energy efﬁciency; in addition, electricity and heat pro-
duction technology for them have well been mastered. For these reasons little
attention, is paid to them in the textbook.
The “road map” for the power engineering development in many countries
foresee considerable reduction of gas volume combusted in furnaces of power
plants and boiler rooms and increase in the share of coal.
The main reasons for these changes are:
• Too large share of gas in the energy balance which has been observed in the last
few years as an inadmissible imbalance that has appeared for the last 2.0–2.5
decades and nowadays are known as “gas pause”. Its origin is caused by the low
cost of natural gas in some countries (especially in Russia and some other
countries of Middle East) in comparison with other mineral fuels. (In the
markets of Europe, the USA, Japan, and South Korea the cost of gas is much
higher then that of coal and a little lower then of oil).
• High value of the natural gas as a raw material of chemical industry and
hydrogen power engineering.
The coal is becoming more popular as fuel for power plants and boiler rooms
due to the action of the following factors:
• world-wide coalﬁelds are very rich,
• according to the most optimistic predictions the rate of nuclear energy in the PE
will increase from the present 16.5 to 21–25%,
• rate of hydro energy generation may decrease from 17 to 13.5%,
• Contribution of unconventional renewable power sources will be presented in
small amount (the probable percentage will be only 2–3%),
• Oil products will be used as a source of fuel reserve; therefore, their presence in
the energy balance will not be high.
4.2
Powerful Power Plant Based on Non-renewable Mineral Energy Resources
53

To renew the dominant role of coal in the PE, it is necessary to introduce a new
set of prompt economic, technological and organization actions:
• change the ratio of gas and coal costs (gas will be 1.6–2 times more expensive
than coal),
• increase the coal utilization efﬁciency, and
• Enhance the coal environmental safety in the PE.
There are several obstacles in this way:
• modern and world-wide known gas-turbine and steam-and-gas production
methods of electrical power provide the highest pace of power intensiﬁcation in
the PE (It is of paramount importance due to the increase in energy shortage,
“hunger for energy”),
• due to the existing price ratio of natural gas and coal, the largest heat
gas-stations are in advance due to two main factors: capital outlay in power
plants building and the cost of energy produced,
• the growth of ecological taxes and toughening up the sanctions on the envi-
ronmental damage force power engineering specialists to improve methods of
coal ﬁring and emission puriﬁcation that considerably increase cost per units of
installed power and energy produced.
Taken as a whole, these factors force to put up with the fact that by 2020–2025
the basic signs of “gas pause” in Russia and some other countries will remain, i.e.
gas as the primary energy resource will dominate in the energy production. The rate
of coal production in the structure of heat power plants should gradually increase
from 25 to 36–37% provided that the rate of gas production decreases from 68 to
58%.
The electric and heat energy production by coal-ﬁred power plants is the main
cause of environmental pollution:
• emission of (a) carbon, sulfur, and nitric oxides, (b) ﬂue ash, (c) particulate
matters,
• coal-volatile matters do damage to the atmosphere when coal is kept on the
esplanades of heat power stations,
• the esplanades may cause continuous ecological disturbances such as:
(a) geo-ﬁltration of industrial efﬂuents, (b) erosion and collapse of dam slopes,
(c) Spreading of slurry through breaks in dams and ﬂooding of the adjacent terri-
tory, (d) dusting ash, etc.
In terms of money, ecological damage in Russia caused by electric energy
production coal heat plants makes up 64 cents for 1 kWh, at gas heat plants—2.8
cents, and 0.1 cents at nuclear power plants.
Increase in coal consumption by 2.3 times to 2020 according to “The Power
Engineering Strategy of Russia to 2030” seems to be kind of a challenge that can
only be accepted by adoption of new technologies guaranteeing environmental
protection.

Experience of such developed countries as Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and
South Korea proves that the modern level of PE-technologies allows minimizing
ecological impact of coal power plants at minimum costs.
In the Russian ecological program a set of activities aimed at technical
re-equipment of thermal power plants is foreseen. They, in particular, provide:
• realization of new technologies of coal ﬁring in very powerful coal unit boilers
(450 MW and higher) with critical and supercritical ﬂow parameters,
• development of traditional generating sets of coal plants, i.e., higher steam
conditions have been used and unit rating has been increased,
• High technology employment of atmospheric, soil, and water emission puriﬁ-
cation, realization of a set of activities aimed at technical re-equipment of
thermal power plants, coal plants in particular.
The main methods of coal ﬁring improvement (to make thermal power plants
friendlier to the environment and more effective) include: (1) improvement of the
furnace construction and technology of coal ﬁring, (2) increase of the fuel quality.
4.2.2
Improvement of the Furnace Construction
and Technology of Coal Firing
Improvement of the furnace construction and technology of coal ﬁring provides:
• Converting the coal-steam power-generating units to units with ultra-critical
ﬂow parameters (pressure 24–30 MPa, temperature 580–610 °C, efﬁciency
factor 45–50%),
• putting into operation power-generating units operated by ﬂare coal ﬁring
boilers and boilers with circulating boiling bed,
• development of powdered-coal power-generating unit with the maximum steam
temperature over 700 °C and pressure 37.5 MPa (these parameters are planned
to be achieved by 2015–2020, efﬁciency factor will exceed 50% and will reach
55% with the steam temperature up to 800 °C),
• low-temperature vortex technology of coal ﬁring,
• Adoption of new technology of coal ﬁring and conversion: coal ﬁring and
gasiﬁcation in melted slag (IGCC-technology), coal ﬁring in boiling bed or in
circulating boiling bed, etc.
Combined-cycle plants with closed cycle coal gasiﬁcation have a number of
advantages:
(1) They allow burning down low-grade coal (with content of ashes up to
40–45%),
(2) They also allow reducing the size of gasiﬁcation reactors and boilers,
(3) simplify a system of fuel preparation and supply,
4.2
Powerful Power Plant Based on Non-renewable Mineral Energy Resources
55

(4) Capture mineral part of fuel in ash-and-slag melt.
Special programs aimed at ecologically clean coal consumption are approved in
Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, Russia, and other countries.
There are more then 600 boilers operating on circulating boiling bed, including
Europe—275, Japan—28, China—25, Asia on the whole—126, the USA—155.
In Russia the ﬁrst power-generating unit of this type was built in Novocherkassk
in 2007 (power 330 MW). More Russian power generating companies intend to
carry out the similar projects.
4.2.3
Improving the Quality of Coal Fuel
Production of slurry coal particles in water (coal-water slurry) is one of the
important methods of coal-fuel quality increasing. Water-coal fuel (WCF) was
invented in the 50s simultaneously with the coal hydro-transport technology.
Further improvement of coal-water slurry technology resulted in invention of the
new type of fuel known as “artiﬁcial compounded liquid fuel” (ACLF).
ACLF has a lot of advantages compared with traditional coal fuel:
• high ﬁring effectiveness,
• less level of toxicity and explosion hazard,
• less waste during transportation,
• high stability features,
• Less emission compared to emissions when burning coal and oil.
One of the most signiﬁcant goals for coal PE is considered to be its efﬁciency
improvement, since various economic parameters of different branches and envi-
ronmental conditions totally depend upon it. Even simple adoption of recently
developed and used technologies will help to increase the efﬁciency factor of
Russian power plants from 34–40 to 37–47% (lower limit is relevant to average
value, upper limit to advanced patterns). Apart from spotlighted tendencies named
in the report and concerning coal PE and its efﬁciency improvement, it is of ultimate
importance to get a beneﬁt from positive results of cogeneration usage and opti-
mization of the main power plants machine operation based on minimum fuel cost
criterion.
In this way, modern level of coal technologies development in the PE allows
signiﬁcant increasing in coal share in the energy balance and at the same time,
solving economic and environmental problems. This conclusion is conﬁrmed by the
large difference in the efﬁciency of coal-ﬁred power plants in different countries,
Fig. 4.3. It is promotion to the level reached by advanced countries can provide
enormous positive effects in the world as a whole [7].

4.3
Cogeneration
The traditional way to increase the efﬁciency of thermal power plants and boiler plants
and solving the problem of heating in Soviet and Russian electrical power engineering
was and remains the simultaneous production of electricity and heat. In the West,
where the problem of heating is not so topical, combined method of production of both
types of energy, called “cogeneration” began to evolve relatively recently, but
according to forecasts by the association Cogen Europe, the share of cogeneration
systems in power generation on average in the European countries in the coming years
will reach 20%. Trends for the previous 10 years are shown in Fig. 4.4.
There are several ways to implement cogeneration idea:

1. At condensation power plants (CPP) intended to produce only electricity, utilize
the heat generated in the capacitors and dissipated in the environment. After
complete modernization of CPP, the annual fuel saving in the electricity will
reach 23% (58 million tons of standard fuel), and saving investments—
15.5 billion dollars.
2. The boiler-rooms (ﬁrst of all steam boiler-rooms) in addition produce electricity,
for example, after substitution of the pressure reducer steam for pressure tur-
bines. The consumption of fuel for generation of 1 kWh of electricity is twice
lower than in conventional power stations (140–150 g against 335–345 g of
standard fuel). Electriﬁcation of the boiler-rooms has a capital intensity around
400 USD/kW,

turbines operating on hot water which boils in the expansion nozzle and is
ejected as a two-phase mixture of these nozzles arranged on Segner wheel. The
two-phase mixture rotates it by a jet effect.
4. Boiler-rooms equipped with a superstructure in the form of a gas turbine plant,
causing them converted into mini- CHPP (combined heat and power plant). This
increases the efﬁciency of the boiler and gas turbine.
5. Generation of small power plants (diesel engines, internal and external com-
bustion engines, gas turbines, and gas-piston engines) is equipped with waste
heat recovery system for production of technological heat, Fig. 4.5.

This type of cogeneration is of particular interest to housing and commune
sector (HCS), since it reduces construction costs of communications by 1.5–
4 times as compared with total district heat and electricity;
6. Powerful gas turbines are set to combined cycle—teamwork gas turbine and
steam turbine plants.
A comparison of fuel efﬁciency for separate and joint production of electricity
and thermal energy is shown in Fig. 4.6a–c.
The passing electricity generation by stimulated production of heat (due to the
harsh climate in most parts of Russia) is an important area of restructuring of the
Russian power industry. In accordance with the ES-2030, due to the electriﬁcation
of boilers 1.8 trillion kWh of electricity will be produced and the efﬁciency of its
generation will reach 87–88%. The new cogeneration can be regarded as going
beyond its powerful energy system into a distributed autonomous power on the

basis of traditional fuels and on renewable energy. The beneﬁts of cogeneration
based on the GPI can be shown most clearly in housing and commune sector.
4.4
Small-Scale Power Generation: Current State
and Prospects
4.4.1
Distribution Areas of Small-Scale Power Generation
In the world, many millions of people are not adequately supplied with central
power and consequently suffer from power and heat energy failures. For example,
in Russia about 15 million people, populating 35% of the territory of the country,
are not adequately supplied with central power. Most territory is located in the
North of Russia, its eastern part. More than 70 cities, 360 urbanized areas, and
about 1400 settlements are situated in this area. Its primary sources of electric
power and thermal energy supply are more than 6 thousand diesel power plants
(DPP) and about 5000 thousand minor boiler plants, consuming more than 2 mil-
lion tons of coal (Table 4.2).
In whole Russian minor off-system sources of power energy production (power
less than 1 MW) nowadays produce only 0.8–1.5% (according to various infor-
mation sources) of its total volume. The situation with the heat supply differs;
however, one can say that in this sphere centralized large-scale heat producers
dominate.
The second problem for the regions not supplied with the centralized (system)
electricity is the cost of kilowatt-hour. The cost of diesel fuel which is delivered to

settlements by motor off-the-road transport, river barges, and helicopters reaches
many hundreds of dollars per ton. That results in high net cost of electric power.
(For the following Russian territories such as Republics of Altai and Tuva,
regions of Kamchatka, Magadan, and Chita, Autonomous Areas of Taymyr,
Chukchi, Koryak, Nenets, and Yamal-Nenets, and also for some other territories the
cost of fuel approaches their six-month budgets.)
For such territories of Russia and others countries, the most attractive way of
small-scale power generation development seems to be renewable energy sources
[8, 9]. However, according to the energy strategy for Russia and others countries up
to 2020–2030 and judging by the real pace of increase in utilization of uncon-
ventional renewable energy sources, mineral fuel will be the main power resource
for small-scale power generation during several decades (probably till 2040–2050).
In the nearest future, the production methods of power and heat energy out of
mineral fuel at power plants of low power will be able to make low (distributed)
energy sector competitive in comparison with system energy sector. Their com-
petitive advantages are:
• short construction period (9–18 months),
• quick payback (from 5 years, provided that only power energy is produced, to
2–3 years with full heat utilization in conditions of cogeneration and
three-generation (combined cooling, heating, and power),
• Proximity to the consumer and, as a consequence, absence of necessity for
large-scale power and heat networks in which dozens percentage of electric
power and heat are lost. Today charges on connection of a new house to cen-
tralized sources of heat supply are comparable to capital expenses for installa-
tion in it by a mini boiler house. The important advantages of small-scale power
generation are modularity of generation systems, scalability, and mobility, i.e.,
capacity delivery to their blocks to meet consumer needs, opportunity for fast
connection of new blocks to already working station, and also their dismantle
and moving to new objects.
To number of the factors stimulating the development of small-scale power
generation also concern:
• adaptation of both consumers and power structures to market uncertainty of
power development and prices for power resources that promotes increase in
power safety and decrease in investment risks;
• development of new highly effective technologies;
• Growth in the share of high-quality power resources, ﬁrst of all gas, in energy
saving.
There are few experts who consider that installations of small-scale power
generation can replace out-of-date thermal power stations and condensation power
plants park resources, and that in completely installed gas overpopulated regions of
the world the existence of high power installation is justiﬁed neither economically,

nor technologically. Some of the most common speciﬁcations of the gas-ﬁred
mini-CHPP are given in Table 4.3.
In developed countries, to generate heat and electricity by direct combustion of
wood, wood waste, straw, and peat mini- CHPP are used. In the steam turbine
version, the efﬁciency is 20–25% and power changes from a few kilowatts (for
farmers) to hundreds of kilowatts.
In the last few years, the increasing number of the advanced countries chooses as
the main way of development of power transition to the distributed power gener-
ation. For example, in Belgium centralization of power now does not exceed 20%,
though just recently it reached 40%. Experts consider that for Russia a decrease in
centralization by 10–15% in the nearest 10–15 years would be optimum. Alongside
with other beneﬁts, this will increase efﬁciency of gas utilization.
The system of gas utilization developed in Russia is extremely irrational: the
most part of gas is spent on thermal energy production (64%), the signiﬁcant share
of the electric power is produced on condensation power plants with low efﬁciency
factor; the huge thermal power stations, which are not completely loaded with heat
production, are forced to work in a condensation mode that essentially reduces their
efﬁciency factor.
In the market for small-scale power generation there are specialized companies
manufacturing highly effective equipment and having partners the investment and
leasing companies. Their customers are enterprises and municipal unions, oilmen
and gasmen, builders, owners of summer residences, cottages, farms; rescuers and
ﬁremen, etc.
Systems of independent power supply (IPS) are applied in three situations:
(a) In the absence of the centralized power supply, consumers have only one
choice—to what speciﬁc kind of IPS gives their preference (traditional fuel,
nonrenewable
power-generation
resources,
or
two-three
diverse
energy
assembly combinations);
(b) With poor quality of electric supply (frequent switching-off, ﬂuctuations and
voltage slumps);

the additional effect is achieved due to economy of means on capital construction
old boiler-houses and boiler rooms can be converted into thermal mini power
plants. In the second case—lining of power networks and connections to them are
not necessary. Their speciﬁc cost reduced to 1 kWh of the established capacity
compared with expenses for installation of a cogeneration unit differs sensationally
expenses on cogeneration unit are compensated within 3–5 years due to a difference
between the tariff and the cost price, and expenses on connection to the centralized
source are irrecoverably lost by transfer of newly constructed substations on the
ﬁnancial statement of the power companies. The new order of payment collection
for connection to the energy source was introduced in 2005; it makes power supply
from emergency power supply system even more attractive. They can be used as
basic, as well as emergency, reserve, and meeting the needs for the electric power at
the time of peak loading, they also can be used for associated gas recycling and
production of electric energy alongside with thermal energy.
The special urgency in conditions of restriction of the maximal power con-
sumption and action of double-rate tariff is getting the use of emergency power
supply system to meet the needs for the electric power at the time of peak loading. It
is more economical to users of the given units due to power consumption reduction
at the time of peak loading from the centralized source at the price that essentially
exceeds the daily average.

Small-Scale Distributed Power Generation
Functioning on Organic Fuel
Development and mastering of electric and thermal energy production methods
using low power energy assemblies working on liquid and gaseous fuel are at the
center of attention nowadays. Plants generating small power usually include the
following:
• Gas-turbine installations (GTI),
• Gas-piston installations (GPI),
• Diesel,
• Gas and diesel fuel,
• External combustion engines—Stirling engines (SE),
• Expander—generating installations (EGI).

4.4.2.1
Gas-Turbine Power Installations
Achievements in the ﬁeld of creation of turbines for vehicles in aviation, auto-
mobile, and ship-building branches have a great inﬂuence on development of
gas-turbine methods of electric power productions within the limits of independent
power. Penetration into power production of highly effective (efﬁciency factor up to
55–60%) gas-turbine and steam and gas installations (GTI and SGI) of a wide
capacity range, including small—from units to one or two tens of megawatts begun
in the 1980s. On their basis small GTI heat and power plants for the combined
electric power and heat production (mini-CHPP) were constructed. Distribution of
the gas-turbine technology in Russia was also promoted by emergence on the
market of the ﬁve world “competence centers” in this sphere—companies such as
“Capstone”, “Honeywell Power Systems”, “Kawasaki”, “Bowling Power System”,
and “Eliot Energy Systems”.
Russia can also take a worthy place in the world gas turbine technical equipment
market owing to the last 2–3 decades of successful development of science and
production association “Saturn” and more than ten other enterprises, basically,
enterprises of the former USSR “Aviaprom”. “Saturn” sells a complex of industrial
programs, including those in the sphere of power mechanical engineering, focused
on needs of electrical power engineering in Russia, gas and oil companies, and
municipal unions.
The favorable conjuncture for small-scale power generation and rapid technical
and technological progress in this area make GTPI-heat and power plants more and
more attractive. Terms of commissioning of such power plants, owing to high GTI
factory readiness, make about 1 year. Costs of produced energy at GTI-heat and
power plants in many regions also appear competitive with large power stations.
Their competitiveness essentially increases if to combine gas turbines with steam;
this provides the efﬁciency factor close to 70%. GTI in the cogeneration mode has
effective operating ratio of fuel of 90%. Thus, from 1 kWh of electric capacity,
1.3 kWh of thermal is produced.
The main advantages of GTI in comparison with steam-turbine installations
(STI) are:
1. Low speciﬁc weight, compactness and simplicity of transportation and instal-
lation; modern gas turbines (especially with capacity not exceeding 16 MW) are
available in the form of one or more blocks of full factory readiness, requiring a
minimum amount of installation works, and make low demands to construction
works and infrastructure.
2. Small amounts of harmful emissions into the environment.
3. Possibility of rapid replacement of the gas turbine units.
4. Relatively low capital investment and low (for power plants) payback period.
5. High-speed maneuverability and load set; even for large GTI time to tens of
minutes is required to reach full power, in contrast to the STPI whose start takes
dozens of hours.
64

Electric Power Production

6. Most of the GTI permit of overload i.e. increases in power above the nominal.
This is achieved by raising the temperature of the working ﬂuid. The duration of
such conditions should not exceed a few hundred hours in order to avoid sig-
niﬁcant reduction in installation resource.
7. High economic efﬁciency of the GTI is achieved through cogeneration (creation
of the GTI-CHPP), when they produce not only electricity but also heat
(heating, domestic hot water, heat supply for production needs). GTI in
cogeneration mode have a fuel efﬁciency of 90% and the same time produces
1.3–2.5 kW of heat per 1 kW of electrical power. In cogeneration mode the
electricity cost is reduced by 20–45%, which makes the GTI-CHPP in many
regions competitive with the large power plants in terms of cost of energy
produced [10]. The payback period is 3–4 years.
It is remarkable that in many countries, using in energy sector signiﬁcant vol-
umes of gas, other technologies are forbidden. The increase in the share GTPI-heat
and power plants in the EU countries is illustrated by Table 4.4.
In Russia small GTI heat and power plants now appear effective not only in the
remote but also in developed regions, Fig. 4.7.
Optimistic views concerning the future of small GTI heat and power plants
inspire high interest to them from oilmen and gasmen, experiencing greater needs
for heat and electro supply and having sufﬁcient ﬁnancial opportunities. Gas-turbine
technology allows utilizing associated gas, provides the lower cost of produced
energy, and cuts down expenses on environmental protection.
Expansion of gasiﬁcation sphere on both middle and small cities and settlements
provides their active involving in generation of capacity in many regions of the
country. In the long term the construction of small GTI heat and power plants
instead of the uneconomical and out-of-date boiler-houses in cities and towns will
make 25–35 GW to 2020 and 35–50 GW to 2050, i.e., up to 10–15% of the total
established capacity.
GTI has a number of disadvantages, narrowing the scope of their competitive
advantage:
• Relatively high requirements for the quality of the gas fuel, associated with the
need to prevent the high-temperature corrosion of turbine blades (restrictions are
usually imposed on the total content of sulfur and alkali metals);
• Need for pre-compression of gas fuel signiﬁcantly increases the cost of energy
produced (especially for small gas turbines) and in some cases prevents their
implementation in the energy sector. For modern GTPI with high degrees of air

compression, the required fuel gas pressure may exceed 25–30 kg/cm2 (fuel gas
pressure must exceed the air pressure by not less than 10.5 kg/cm2);
• Sharp drop in the efﬁciency at lower loads, especially inherent in HD-GTI
(heavy-duty GTI); AD-GTI (aero derivative GTI) have more advanced control
mechanism of the compressor blading that partly smoothes this deﬁciency;
moreover, the free variable speed shafts also support multiple levels of efﬁ-
ciency. However, the efﬁciency of gas turbine engine loads below the 60–50% is
problematic;
• Service life of GTI is considerably smaller than that of other power plants and is
generally in the range of 45–125 thousand hours (the lower limit applies to
forced AD-GTI). There is signiﬁcant progress in increasing of the service life of
GTI.
4.4.2.2
Piston Installations
Historically, during many decades and up to now in the majority of small power
installations are used piston engines, working on liquid fuel (mainly diesel engines).
As the share of gas in the general volume of power raw material began to increase,
the share of gas-piston installations (GPI) also began to increase.
Currently, the GPI successfully compete in the low-power engineering with
diesel piston engine and with GTI due to their existing beneﬁts:

• the slower rate of increase of gas fuel cost compared with liquid;
• signiﬁcantly less harmful emissions of gas-fueled engine compared to
liquid-fueled engine, Fig. 4.8;
• rapid development of the gas network;
• low cost of the installed capacity of the unit; CHPP capacity of 10 MW on the
basis of the GPI requires investment of about $7.5 million, and based on GPI—
about $ 9.5 million;
• The best indicator of speciﬁc weight (power to weight ratio). The reason is that
the equipment provides the gas supply to the engine much easier than the
complex aggregates associated with the storage and supply of fuel oil;
• higher efﬁciency factor less dependent on the load;
• Speciﬁc charge of GPI fuel with the capacity of one cylinder more than 15 kW
practically does not depend on capacity. This means that to ensure of ﬂexibility
of the energy production, it is expedient to build at one enterprise several
mini-TPP on the base of GPI.
• Security—the lack of high temperatures, pressures, moments of inertia;
• long service life of GPI—up to 300,000 h or 37 years in operation for 8000 h
per year, making mini-CHPP reliable uninterruptible power supply;
• GPI can be started and stopped any number of times, that does not affect the
overall life of the engine, while 100 GTI starts reduce resource for 500 h;
• time before the load after the start of the GPI is 2–3 min, while of the GTI—15
to 17 min;
• lesser dependence of the efﬁciency factor of the GPI on the ambient temperature;
• mobility;
• a wide range of operating modes—from 15–20 to 110% (in peak mode) rated
capacity in proportional fuel consumption;
• short payback period—3 to 5 years;
• autonomy of mini-CHPP based on them, producing electricity and heat at the
point of consumption and giving a guarantee against interruptions, outages, or
additional energy losses;
• the possibility to solve the issue of uneven daily electricity consumption,
unsolvable for large generating plants relatively easily;
• “omnivorousness”—the GPI can run on natural gas, propane, butane, associated
petroleum gas, coke oven gas, biogas, etc.

Small-Scale Power Generation: Current State and Prospects

The global market for stand-alone power plants is characterized by a wide
variety of required power at different weight, size, and resource base indicators of
generators. There is a shift of demand from the emergency power in the direction of
power for continuous operation.
It is economically preferable to construct mini-CHPP with the combined energy
production on the basis of GPI with capacity up to 3 MW and on the basis of GTI—
with capacity 30–50 MW. Most widespread mini-TPP located in developed
countries work on the basis of GPI with individual capacity from 30 kW to
12 MW. GPI manufacturers and experts in the ﬁeld of the power equipment con-
sider the following three especially perspective spheres of their application: asso-
ciated gas usage, meeting own boiler-house needs in the energy sector, production
of electric and thermal energy for housing and communal services needs. The
tendency of displacement of GPI use from emergency unit’s aside power stations
for permanent operation also should be mentioned.
Among the disadvantages of piston machines it is necessary to note the
following.
1. Limited capacity is 5 MW for a single machine. However, this is not critical, as
several units working in parallel can be installed, if necessary. There are
examples of installation of up to 40 units in a local system. In addition, the
Finnish company Wartsila produces powerful GPI with a unit of electrical
capacity of over 16 MW.
2. Increased need for lubricating oil in comparison with gas and steam turbines.
Lubrication problem for the GPI (as for diesel engines) is converted not only
into technical, but also in economic problem. For production of 50–200 kW
power oil consumption can reach 2.5–3 g/kWh, which is a signiﬁcant proportion
of total operating costs, particularly if the engine runs on the cheap gas fuel.
4.4.2.3
Stirling Engine
Stirling engine (SE) is the most well-known representative of the family of external
combustion engines—an external combustion engine that uses air or an inert gas as
the working ﬂuid operating on a highly efﬁcient thermodynamic cycle, Fig. 4.9.
The SE produced by such companies as “Philips”, “STM Inc.”, “Daimler Benz”,
and “United Stirling” with the capacity from 5 kW to 1.2 MW the have efﬁciency
factor more than 42%, the working resource more than 40 thousand hours, and the
speciﬁc weight from 1.2 to 3.8 kg/kW. Their characteristics and consumer qualities
surpass internal combustion engines (ICE) and GTI.
The SE-based technology can also suggest advantages over turbine-based sys-
tems in low temperature differential applications concerning to low-cost materials,
fabrication, and maintenance. There are the research programs looking at the
potential viability of SE-based power generation systems utilizing low grade heat
sources, where temperature differentials down to around 30 K may be considered.
68

The SE has the following characteristics: low noise level, almost two times
smaller concentrations of harmful substances in exhaust gases (in comparison with
ICE), greater resource, and good characteristics of the twisting moment. It is very
important that SE can work both on traditional liquid motor fuel and on gas of any
origin, and also on a gas condensate. This means that spheres and schemes of its use
are about the same, like other independent energy units.
Despite the above listed advantages, SE has not found a large-scale application
yet, owing to several problems of technical realization of this tempting and, for a
long time (since 1816), known idea. The problems are as follows: great difﬁculties
in building of some units (condensation, regulation capacity systems, etc.), high
requirements to the production methods, necessity of application of heat-resistant
alloys and metals, and new methods of their welding and soldering. First of all these
problems are caused by application of such working substances as helium and
hydrogen.
4.4.2.4
Turbo-expander Generators
Turbo-expander installations are a variety of gas turbines; they are designed for
recycling of heated gases or gas energy under elevated pressure for electricity
production. They are mainly used as turbo-expander generators (TEG) with
decreasing gas pressure in the main and distribution pipelines to the desired user.
Fig. 4.9 One of the possible schemes of the Stirling engine unit

They are promising for the production of electricity in TPP, and a number of other
industries, where the generated via TEG electrical or thermal energy is a byproduct:
in metallurgy (for reducing blast-furnace gas pressure), chemical plants, liquefac-
tion technology, separation of gases, air conditioning, and others.
Leading European countries and the USA have been using this almost free
source of energy for several decades. In Russia, its use began only in the last 10–
15 years. And this despite the fact that the idea of using high-pressure gas into gas
pipelines for generating electrical energy was ﬁrst proposed by the Russian aca-
demician M.D. Millionshchikov in 1947. The technology is based on the fact that
parallel to gas reducing points of transmission and distribution pipelines, turbo
expanders are installed. The latter, acting as gas distributing points (GDP) and gas
distributing stations (GDS), generate electric power, Fig. 4.10.
The appearance of the expander-generating units is shown in Fig. 4.11. Relatively
small expander-generator sets, installed on the GDP and GDS distribution network,
should be used to produce not only electricity, but also cold. This makes possible the
construction at GDS industrial refrigerators, the capacity of which will be determined
by the value of a stable gas ﬂow through the expander. Most TEG with a unit
capacity of 1.5–6 MW can be considered acceptable.
The preliminary study of the project of energy-technological expander plant
based on the GDS with a stable daily gas consumption of 60 thousand m3
(Fig. 4.12) shows that its cooling capacity is sufﬁcient for a typical industrial
refrigerator with a capacity of 270 tons. In this speciﬁc case production of elec-
tricity in the installation of 0.025 kWh/Nm3 and electric generator power of 62.5
kW are sufﬁcient to meet their own needs refrigerator (automation, pumps, lighting,
etc.).

Payback period of projects is from 3 to 5 years. Market energy technological
installations using excess gas pressure drop across the relatively small GDS and
large GDP to generate electricity and cooling of industrial and agricultural refrig-
erators are also great. The main advantages of TEG are:

• lower speciﬁc capital costs;
• lower energy consumption for electricity generation associated with heating of
the gas before the expander heat is released during the combustion of fuel.
The process of gas expansion in the expander can be arranged in such a way that
almost all the gas supplied to the heat is converted into electricity. If you use gas for
heating or high potential of renewable energy sources (RES), heat pumps can
produce electricity without any fuel combustion in TEG:
• High environmental performance (lower volume of emissions into the envi-
ronment in comparison with other power plants). This is due to a lower speciﬁc
fuel consumption for electricity generation (in the limit-up to zero);
• The use of TEG in the TPP and industry, for which electricity is not the main
product, can improve their technical and economic performance by reducing
energy costs.
On the TPP, for which electricity is the main product produced, the use of TEG
improves the technical and economic indicators of the main production (reduction
of speciﬁc fuel consumption for electricity generation). In the event that, for
whatever reasons, there is no possibility of organizing a ﬂow of electricity from one
grid to another, a necessary condition when the TEG is connected to heat circuit
CPP is to keep the power generation station as a whole at the same level as it was
before the inclusion of TEG. That is possible due to reduction of electric power
generated by the steam turbine units and the amount of electric power generated by
TEG.
TEG can be switched on into the thermal circuit of the CPP operating with a
deﬁcit of electric capacity. The nominal ﬂow rate of steam to the turbine in this case
is ensured, Fig. 4.13.

Nuclear Power Engineering

Current State and Prospects for the Development
of Nuclear Power Plants with Uranium Fuel Cycle
About 438 nuclear power units (about 194 nuclear power plants) operated in 32
countries all over the world in the middle of 2016. They generated 400 GW of
electric power (the largest nuclear power station is Kashiwazaki Kariva (Japan)
with 7 nuclear power units generating Ptot = 8200 MW). The largest number of
nuclear reactors is situated in the USA (104), France (58), Japan (51), Russia
(34) and the Republic of Korea (23). 61 nuclear power units with total installed
capacity of 70.6 GW (el.) are under construction. About 300 research and experi-
mental nuclear reactors operate in 56 countries. More than 200 nuclear reactors are
installed in ships and submarines.

The largest shares of atomic power engineering in the total power engineering
have France (76.1%), Belgium (55.5%), Ukraine (46.8%), Sweden (46.2%),
Armenia (45.5%), Bulgaria (45.4%), Slovakia (44%), Switzerland (40.6%),
Slovenia (40%), and Hungary (40%). APS generate approximately 17% of the
global electric power, Table 4.5.
The total generated electric power increased, because old and small NPP had
been taken out of service and new and large reactor units were put into service,
Fig. 4.14.
Strengthening the APE positions allows nuclear engineers to acquire more and
more abilities to pay attention not only to the ﬁrst-level priority problems—safe
operation of NPS and burial of radioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel—but also
to innovations in a wide spectrum of directions in the development of technology
including:
(a) Modernization of the design of high-power reactors and power generating units
and technology of their construction,
(b) Development of nuclear central heating,
(c) Development of low-power nuclear stations (LP NS), including ﬂoating ones
intended for power supply of remote territories,

(d) Mastering of the closed fuel cycle based on fast-neutron (FN) reactors,
(e) Hydrogen production by the water thermolysis in high-temperature atomic
reactors, etc.
Over the past few years, a severe problem of atomic power engineering has
become the protection of atomic objects against acts of terrorism (in particular, after
acts of terrorism in the USA on September 11, 2001 and in Russia in October 2002,
origin of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, 2012).
The nuclear power stations with reactors on thermal neutrons operate in the
mode of open nuclear fuel cycle including three stages:
The 1st stage begins from extraction of uranium ore and ends with the delivery
of fuel assemblies to nuclear power station site,
The 2nd stage begins from fuel utilization in the reactor to generate electric
power and ends with temporal storage of SNF on the NPP site,
The 3rd stage begins from SNF dispatch to a special storehouse and ends with
nuclear waste burial, Fig. 4.15.
The burial and utilization of radioactive wastes from nuclear objects (NPP,
nuclear ships, submarines, etc.) are also severe problems. Members of Greenpeace
adduce arguments conﬁrming a threat to the biosphere from such wastes. Atomic
physicists adduce opposite arguments and simultaneously improve systems of
utilization and burial of radioactive waste.
The modern concept of NPP safety is based on three principles: control,
multi-level protection, and technical engineering means of safety. More than 20
projects of NPP of new generation that differ radically not only in the power and
reactor type but also in the technological, schematic, and design solutions are being
Fig. 4.14 Forecast of development of nuclear energy (dates and regions)

developed by leading energy corporations and companies of industrially developed
countries.
Based on terms of commercial realization and degree of self-safety, NPP are
conditionally subdivided into three generations. The projects of NPP of a new
generation are based on technology and design that have already been mastered and
checked under operating conditions. They are equipped with active and passive
safety systems that allow the probability of serious accidents to be decreased and
the investment price of electric power generation to be reduced by 20%.
Antinuclear motion in many countries has forced governments of some of them
to refuse completely from atomic power engineering (for example, in Germany) and
even to close operating NPP. Vice versa, other countries (for example, France)
continue the development of atomic power engineering and increase the share of
electric power generated by NPP.

As a whole there is a positive revaluation of the role and place of atomic power
engineering in provision of the energy safety with improvement of reactor design
and technology of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. There are several reasons for this:
Cost of generated electric power; nuclear power stations are quite competitive
with coal and gas power stations;
Cost of electric power generated by NPP is less dependent on conjuncture of the
price for fuel due to the fact that uranium is quite accessible and the share of the fuel
cost in the cost of the electric power generated by atomic power stations is smaller
than that in the cost of the electric power generated by coal and gas TPP;
New more reliable reactors change favorably the public opinion about nuclear
power stations;
Considerable stocks of nuclear fuel and absence of problems of its delivery to
the NPS make APE an important factor of ensuring regional, national, and global
energy safety (one fuel tablet of uranium dioxide provides the amount of energy
equal to that from combustion of 882 kg wood, 550 kg coal, or 500 kg oil);
Absence of emissions of “greenhouse gases” and solid particles makes the
nuclear power station out of competition with coal and gas power stations by
ecological compatibility. (The coal power station generating 1000 MW per year
consumes 3 million ton coal or 75,000 railroad cars and 5  109 m3 oxygen; in this
case, about 0.7 million ton of solid wastes are produced.)
Strengthening of the NPE positions allows nuclear engineers to acquire more
and more abilities to pay attention not only to the ﬁrst-level priority problems—safe
operation of atomic power stations and burial of radioactive wastes and spent
nuclear fuel—but also to innovations in a wide spectrum of directions of the
development of technology:
(a) Modernization of the design of high-power reactors and power generating units
and technology of their construction,
(b) Development of nuclear central heating,
(c) Development of low-power nuclear power plants (LP NPP), including ﬂoating
ones intended for power supply of remote territories,
(d) Mastering of the closed fuel cycle based on FNR,
(e) Hydrogen production by water thermolysis in high-temperature nuclear reac-
tors, etc.
Nowadays scientists and engineers are intensively working at one more nuclear
energy source and increase of the efﬁciency of nuclear fuel burning. In Russia
occupying the leading positions in the ﬁeld of nuclear technologies, a number of
projects on modernization of reactors on thermal neutrons have been developed, are
realized, or have already been realized. Among them are
• Completion of works aimed at increasing thermal capacity of operating
WWER-1000 and designing of new nuclear power units with thermal capacities
of 3200 and 3300 MW.
• The 18-month fuel cycle has been introduced in WWER-1000.

• Works are underway on the substantiation and introduction of maneuverable
regimes of operation.
• Positive results of experiments on utilization of regenerated uranium fuel in
WWER have been obtained.
• Preliminary investigations of the possibility of utilization of REMIX fuel
(mixture of uranium and plutonium) and MOX fuel (UO2 + PuO2) are carried
out. (Fast neutron reactors can be found in Sect. 4.5).
4.5.2
Intermediate and Low-Power Nuclear Stations
Including Floating Ones
Nuclear power stations with electric capacity not exceeding 300 MW and thermal
power stations with electric capacity not exceeding 500 MW belong to this class of
stations (LP NPP). A lot of effort has been done in nuclear major countries to
develop small reactor (with capacity 2.0–35 MW) for enhancement of nuclear
peaceful use in district heating and electric power generation in many regions of the
world that have no central power supply (in Russia among them are northern and
eastern regions of the country, see Sect. 4.4). They can be used for seawater
desalination, hydrogen generation and so on.
A wide number of capacities, long period of autonomous operation (for
10–50 years they do not need additional fuel loading), and high degree of pre-
fabrication make them especially attractive for these regions. Heat load distribution
and its local character and short range of economically efﬁcient heat transfer pre-
determine dispersed arrangement of thermal energy sources and their maximum
capacity commensurable with the value of local loading.
The LP NPP can operate as integral parts of large electric systems. In this case,
among their advantages are (a) shorter terms of commissioning and shorter payback
period that make them more attractive to investors in comparison with large nuclear
power units, (b) smaller ﬁnancial, radiation, and technogenic risks, (c) large-scale
economy of natural gas in the spheres of central heating and heat supply of large
cities, (d) preset level of safety of their operation needs much smaller engineering
safety systems. This is provided by means of excluding their occurrence as those
due to rational application of laws of nature, including negative feedbacks in reactor
physics, rather than by means of application of fusers or localizing systems.
South Korea has been developing an integral type nuclear cogeneration reactor.
It is a modular pressurized water reactor and it is expected to be used for
dual-purpose applications of seawater desalination and small-scale power genera-
tion. Since this reactor will be located relatively near the residential area, it should
have highly enhanced safety characteristics compared with current nuclear power
plants. The electric power capacities of the developed reactor are 2, 5, 10, and
20 MW.

In the last few years, the use of reactor units designed by the technology of
shipboard modular reactors to construct nuclear thermal power stations and ﬂoating
LP NS has been studied that together with small nuclear power units based on
traditional fuel and not-traditional renewable energy sources (NRES) would
improve living conditions and economic activities in regions of the world far
removed from the central electric power and heat supply.
In the ﬁeld of low-power nuclear reactor design, Russia occupies the leading
position. Already in the early 1990s there were more than 40 projects of such
reactors of various technology readiness levels. A number of Russian projects have
already been supported by the international community including International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Nowadays more than 50 concepts and projects of low and intermediate power
reactors (300–700 MW) of various types, including water cooled, liquid metal
cooled, and gas cooled reactors are being constructed in 15 developed and devel-
oping countries all over the world. All projects provide increased safety measures of
LP NPP operation, and some of them also envisage long-term continuous operation
without refueling, thereby improving the protection from the spread of ﬁssile
materials allowing one to undertake adequate measures and to guarantee
non-proliferation in the scenario of global large-scale APE development. These
projects combine the advantages of many well-developed technologies—fuel,
cooler, and power converter—that allow reliable and safe operation in any regions,
including regions with extreme geological and climatic conditions.
The innovative project “Sources of Electric and Thermal Energy Based on
Technologies of Nuclear Shipbuilding” has been developed in Russia. Within the
framework of its implementation, the construction of the ﬁrst ﬂoating nuclear power
station (FNPP) “Academician Lomonosov” was started in 2007. Two reactors
having each 35 MW (electric) and 148 MW (thermal) capacities will be mounted
on a transportable barge. This ﬂoating platform is 140 m long, 30 m wide, and
15 m high with displacement of 24 thousand tons will sail to the shore to be
connected with mainland and then will generate energy, Fig. 4.16. An FNPP will
autonomously operate for 4–5 years; its total service time will be about 40 years. Its
permanent staff is 78 people working in shifts.
This project is planned as a serial one, providing construction of 7–10 inter-
changeable stations capable to supply energy to 70% of Russian territory uncovered
by central power supply (including mainly coastal lines of Arctic and Paciﬁc
Oceans). The level of readiness in the middle 2015 was estimated to be 70%. It is
planned to be ﬁnished in 2019. The second station will be put in operation in 2030.
Such nuclear power plants can be of interest for island states of the Paciﬁc region
to produce drinking water the need in which frequently exceeds that in the electric
power.
Experience accumulated in the design of the ﬁrst FNPP and accident with
Fukushima-1 NPP demonstrated that the main FNPP disadvantages are:
4.5
Nuclear Power Engineering
79

High cost of installed capacity unit due to high cost of the ﬂoating platform and
need of connection with the coast (approximately 0.5 billion USD together with the
reactor),
Inadmissibility of application in regions, where tsunami and hurricanes arise.
We must recognize NPE should overcome great difﬁculties in the process of its
development. This is conﬁrmed by the fact that none of the IAEA predictions on the
NPE development has come true, Fig. 4.17.

Proponents of the traditional energy fuels assess the current state of NPE as
stagnation, underlining that the share of nuclear power stations in the total electric
power generation all over the world has been reduced in the last 3–3.5 decades from
17 to 12%.
Nuclear engineers consider this tendency to be temporal and difﬁculties to be
surmountable and distinguish three main stages in the development of atomic
technologies in the XXI st century (according to the materials of the National
Research Center “Kurchatov Institute”):
1. Nearest stage (10–12 years):
Evolutionary development of reactors and technologies of the fuel cycle,
Elaboration and experimental operation of improved and innovative reactor and
fuel cycle technologies.
2. The stage of active growth of atomic power engineering (up to the middle of the
century):
Increase of production volume by four-ﬁve times,
Development of innovative reactor and fuel cycle technologies (expanded
reproduction of fuel using fast neutron reactors, utilization of useful and burning
out of dangerous isotopes, high-temperature reactors, production of hydrogen,
fresh water, etc.).
3. The stage of sustainable development of large-scale nuclear power engineering
(second half of our century):
Deployment of innovative nuclear technologies,
Multi-component nuclear power engineering,
Nuclear-hydrogen power engineering.
4.5.3
Nuclear Power Plants with Fast Neutron Reactors
Escalating volumes of extraction of natural uranium for the existing NPE tech-
nology based on thermal neutron reactors (TNR) (energy of thermal neutrons is
0.025 meV) cannot provide long-term development of large-scale atomic power
engineering. With application of only TNR, the resources of the atomic power
engineering exceed not so strongly those of the conventional one—only by 10%.
This is due to low efﬁciency of utilization of natural uranium in such reactors—only
the U-235 isotope is used whose content in natural uranium makes 0.72%, whereas
the main component is U-238 (99.28%) whose ﬁssion probability in the TNR is
very low. In addition, when current technologies are used, maintenance costs for
radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel (SNF) constantly increase. The society of
the XXIst century will not be satisﬁed with increasing volumes of radioactive
wastes of nuclear power stations, and simple reﬁnement of the existing technologies
will not give the required effect. No less acute problem is prevention of
4.5
Nuclear Power Engineering
81

unsanctioned access to ﬁssile materials and thereby strengthening their nonprolif-
eration regime.
Therefore, the long-term strategy of the NPE development assumes transition to
progressive technology, ﬁrst of all, based on the use of fast neutron reactors (with
energy of about 2 meV; so-called fast neutron reactors—FNR). It is essentially
important that a much larger number of neutrons participating in the transformation
of U-238 into ﬁssile plutonium isotope Pu-239 be formed in the FNR in each
nucleus ﬁssion act (burn up of natural uranium to 30–40%) for subsequent repro-
cessing of the fuel unloaded from the reactors of the NPP for subsequent reburying
of unburned and newly formed ﬁssile isotopes. The energy content of 100 g of
uranium extracted from SNF is equivalent to that of 1 tons of oil, 2–4 tons of coal,
or 1500–3000 m3 gas. 19.5 thousand tons of new nuclear fuel can be obtained from
20 thousand tons of SNF. To obtain this amount of fresh fuel, it is necessary to mine
and to process 6 million tons of uranium ore. Only at the expense of involving
U-238 in the nuclear fuel cycle, the energy potential of the mined natural uranium
can be increased by 100 times. As a whole, the use of “omnivorous” FRs in atomic
power engineering opens a wide prospect for the creation of fuel for nuclear power
stations in the form of artiﬁcial ﬁssile elements for unlimited terms and transfers the
nuclear fuel itself into the category of the renewable power resources.
Simultaneously with this, other positive effects are also reached:
Weapons-grade ﬁssile materials are involved into the manufacture of electric and
thermal energy,
Amount of SNF is reduced,
Thermal effect on the environment is reduced (due to a higher efﬁciency of
nuclear power units);
The non-proliferation regime is strengthen due to the fact that the transportation
of such materials is reduced to a minimum and the FR technology based on the
closed fuel cycle is implemented in protective chambers under remote control with
wide application of automation means. In this case, the third stage of the nuclear
fuel cycle involves SNF delivery to the plant for its reprocessing and only after that
ﬁnal burial of waste of reprocessed FNR fuel.
4.5.4
Closed Nuclear Fuel Cycle
The closed nuclear fuel cycle (closed NFC) differs from the open one by the fact
that after SNF holding in a temporal storehouse situated in the site of the nuclear
power station, it is delivered to a radiochemical plant for reprocessing to extract the
remained uranium (more than 95% of its initial mass) and built-up plutonium and
manufacturing from them a new fuel. Simultaneously, radioactive isotopes of dif-
ferent chemical elements are separated and utilized. In addition, radioactive wastes
are also separated. They are reprocessed and put inside the solidiﬁed glass mass
buried in special burials. In this case, the NFC, including ﬁnal burial of radioactive
waste, lasts from 50 to 100 years.
82

Electric Power Production

However, despite the omnivorous FRs and the feasibility of implementation with
their help of the closed NFC, they are not widespread because of a number of
serious problems with their operation. Along with their seeming simplicity (absence
of retarder and absorber), they are technically more complicated in comparison with
TNR.
A number of serious problems must be solved associated mainly with the fact
that the amount of fuel in the reactor required to obtain the chain reaction should be
no less than a certain value called the critical mass. The FRs possess much larger
critical mass compared to the TNRs (for preset dimensions of the reactor). In order
that the FRs were no worse than the TNRs, it is necessary to raise the capacity
developed for the preset dimensions of the reactor. To reduce the amount of fuel
used per unit output, high density of heat generation should be provided. This leads
to one more problem, because water as a coolant well mastered in thermal reactors
does not suited for heat removal from the FR due to its nuclear properties. It slows
down neutrons and hence, decreases the reproduction rate.
Fused sodium possessing good technological, thermophysical, and physical
nuclear properties was chosen for heat removal from the FNR. It allowed high
density of heat generation to be attained with reasonable measures of ensurance of
high degree of safety. (The eutectic alloy of lead with bismuth is also considered as
a coolant.)
There is one more special feature in the utilization of nuclear fuel in FRs. Under
the inﬂuence of intense nuclear radiation, high temperature, and in particular,
accumulated ﬁssion products the properties of the fuel composition (a mixture of
fuel and raw materials) gradually deteriorate. The fuel forming critical mass
becomes unsuitable for further utilization.
Due to the above-considered special features in FR operation, the cost of
exploitation of nuclear power station built on FR basis (FNR-NPP) under projects
of the 60s has appeared by a factor of 1.5–2 higher than of the NPP with TNR
(TNR-NPS). For this reason, the FNR-NPP has lost the competition with the
TR-NPP. The creation of large atomic power engineering (thousands of GW)
planned already for the XXth century has been realized only partially and mainly
based on TNR-NPP.
The fast-neutron reactors permitting to utilize up to 20 times larger portion of
ﬁssile material than in ordinary thermal-neutron boilers have already been built in
Russia, the USA, England, and France. There are several breeder reactors with
output powers in the range 250–350 MW all over the world. One of them has been
operating in Shevchenko (now Aktau, Kazakhstan) since 1972. By decision of the
government of independent Republic of Kazakhstan in 1999, its operation was
stopped.
According to available predictions, achievement of competitiveness of the
FNR-NPP (with reactors of the 4th generation) is expected only after 2025 with
equivalent uranium price of the order of 200 dollars/kg.
In the USA the decision was accepted in the 70s to refuse from putting in
operation breeder reactors and SNF reprocessing and to rely on the concept of the
open NFC. At the same time, the project of an advanced modular safe (on principles
4.5
Nuclear Power Engineering
83

of natural safety) fast reactor with sodium cooler and the project of improved FR
with closed NFC for burnout of long-living actinides and ﬁssion products have been
developed.
In Western Europe the leader in the FR development is France; however, the
French program of the FNR-NPP development has practically been closed.
Prior to the accident at the NPPFukushima-1, Japan, unlike the United States
and France, was developing a program for FR to sell them to other countries since
2020. However, Fukushima-1 NPP accident has compelled the government to
declare freezing of works on the FR. (The project ﬁnancing has been reduced by
almost 80% in 2012.)
In India the demonstration sodium FNR (PFBR-500) is being developed and a
small series of four FNR with capacity of 500 MW each is planned to be
constructed.
The Russia is the leader in the development of FR of new generation.
Exploitation in the USSR and then Russia of experimental-demonstration BR-5/10
reactor in Obninsk, BOR-60 in Dimitrovgrad, industrial BN-350 fast reactors in
Shevchenko (nowadays Aktau, Kazakhstan), and BN-600 fast breeder reactor of the
Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station in Sverdlovsk Region (has been operating since
1980) during quarter of the century has proved the feasibility of the idea of
regeneration of spent uranium, plutonium, and ﬁssion products to produce new fuel.
(In the names of reactors is used the Russian abbreviation.) This has allowed Russia
to start the development of the reactor of the 4th generation (FR) to proceed in
perspective to the closed nuclear fuel cycle (the project “Proryv”).

Beloyarsk NPP. The IAEA considers it as a perspective model for atomic power
engineering of the XXIst century capable to provide in the near future the leading
positions of Russia in this market. The experimental demonstration complex with

In Seversk (Tomsk Region) the construction of the FR with lead coolant is
planned with implementation of the closed fuel cycle (Fig. 4.18) on its basis
(Project “Brest-300”).
Hopes with closure of the NFC are associated with putting in operation of this
reactor based on burning weapon plutonium in MOX fuel. (MOX fuel is the mixed
oxide uranium–plutonium (UO2 + PuO2) fuel.) Such fuel is planned to be manu-
factured approximately by 2015. By the same time, the FR series will be con-
structed. Modernization of the active zones will allow the most perspective variant
of the reactor with reproduction rate of the new fuel sufﬁcient for the developing
APE to be chosen by 2030. Thus, the problem of utilization of weapon plutonium
initiated works on the closure of the NFC based on the FR having the highest
degree of technological readiness.
The FNR with sodium cooler (BN-800) was put in service at the end of 2015 in
the Beloyarsk NPS. The IAEA considers it as a perspective model for atomic power
engineering of the XXIst century capable to provide in the near future the leading
positions of Russia in this market. The experimental demonstration complex with
nuclear cycle will be put in operation in 2020.

The development and large-scale application of a thorium fuel cycle (with
thorium-232 used as fuel) can be one of the ways of solving the problems of
increasing nuclear fuel resource and reactor safety as well as of improving the
ecological acceptability of nuclear power stations. The increased interest in this
technology in the last few years has been largely caused by the fact that it guar-
antees better the regime of non-proliferation of weapon nuclear technologies. For
this reason, fuel based on thorium and uranium is suggested for utilization of
plutonium in reactors. Works on thorium cycle were carried out or are carried out in
leading nuclear states (there are ready technologies and reactors in the USA and
Germany, but they are conserved because of the high price of electric power
generation) and in India and Brazil. In Russia low-intensive works are carried out in
a number of scientiﬁc centers and universities. For example, the Tomsk Polytechnic
University (Russia) developed the concept of atomic-hydrogen power station with
reactor installations on thorium. The ultimate goal-creation of small power stations
(about 10 MW) to ensure in future electric and thermal energy for remote

settlements and production facilities (mines, etc.). Such systems can operate without
refueling for 10 years and even more.
The destiny of the nuclear power plant on the base thorium fuel cycle will
depend on successes in the development of other NPE directions.
The case in point is controlled thermonuclear fusion, which can become
actually inexhaustible source of the electric power and heat for future generations
(for more detail, see Sect. 9.1).

Electric Power Engineering on the Basis
of Renewable Energy Sources
5.1
Necessity of Searching for New Energy Sources
The primary reason for big popularity of the conversion of heat to electric power
(about 70% of the total electricity production) has been the relatively low cost of
fossil fuel sources (oil, coal, and natural gas) and the reasonably high system
efﬁciencies that can be achieved owing to the high temperature differentials created
by fossil-fuel combustion. Numerous sources indicate that the use of fossil fuels for
power production must reduce to the level of sustainability, which means that
alternative sustainable and environmentally responsible methods must be investi-
gated and commercialized [1]. Evidence of such research and development can be
found in the rapid growth of the international clean energy market from about $110
billion in 2006, to about $450 billion in 2016.
Among numerous factors determining the necessity of further gain in the power
potential, despite a considerable increase in the efﬁciency of utilization of energy
resources in a number of developed countries including Japan, Western and
Northern European countries, and the USA, the following should be emphasized:
• increasing population (from 1.97 billion people in 1950 to more 7.0 billion
people in ﬁrst decade XXIst century),
• increasing electric energy consumption per capita (caused by the development
and modernization of transport in connection with increasing mobility of pop-
ulation and growth of good trafﬁcs, a greater comfort of everyday life, further
growth of urban population, relative increase in the share of country cottages,
etc.), Fig. 1.4.
• further extension of inhabitant regions (1/3 of the Earth is not populated because
of the absence of water, whereas half of the Earth’s population endure a lack of
space on the 1/10 of land); to this end, a cheap energy is required.
Due to the rapid growth of energy consumption and impossibility of its artiﬁcial
limitation on the global scale, even in the face of the global threat of greenhouse

effect and depletion of nonrenewable energy resources, we forced to solve imme-
diately the following problems:
• develop power engineering based on utilization of unconventional renewable
power sources (URPS),
• search for and master new methods of producing electric energy,
• improve the efﬁciency of utilization of energy resources with the use of energy-
and resource-saving equipment, technology, and behavior of population.
Conﬁrmation of the feasibility and high efﬁciency of these approaches can serve
the economy of Denmark, Figs. 5.1 and 5.2.

Figures 5.1 and 5.2 illustrate the effectiveness of implementation of the principle
of 3R in power engineering: Reducing–Recycling (Reusing)–Replacing.
Successive energy policy of the Government of Denmark, which foresees more
efﬁcient use of energy resources and electricity, recycling of resources (the principle
of “Zero Waste”), replacement of non-renewable sources of energy by renewable
enables the country to develop rapidly in the time of simultaneous reducing energy
consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases.
The term unconventional renewable power sources are used for solar, geother-
mal, wind, and tidal sources as well as for small river (the installed capability of
units of hydroelectric power plants (HPP) varies from 0.1 to 10 MW), biomass, sea
wave, and natural temperature gradient sources. As already indicated above, all
these power sources are renewable.
At present, about 2 kW of electric power is generated per capita, whereas the life
standard is 10 kW in the developed countries. (Annual consumption of electric
power by each resident of a number of countries is shown in Table 5.1.) With
allowance for the thermal barrier, the Earth’s population must not exceed 10 bil-
lion people given that early or late the norm of power energy generation per capita

will reach 10 kW. Thus, the development of power engineering based on nonre-
newable energy resources rigidly limits the population growth in our planet.
However, the Earth’s population can reach more than 10 billion people to the
middle XXIst century. Therefore, it follows that already now we must think about
the reduction of the rate of population growth approximately twice; however, our
civilization is not ready to do this. An approaching energetic-demographic crisis is
obvious. This is one the most formidable argument for the development of
un-conventional power engineering.
Many experts in power engineering consider that the only way out from this
crisis is wide utilization of renewable power sources including solar, wind, oceanic,
etc.
There is one more aspect of mastering URPS, especially important for Russia
and some other countries having vast territories and low population densities,
namely, power supply to customers. As already indicated above, the population of
the most part of the vast territory of Russia (in the European North, Siberia, and Far
East), about 12–15 million people, has no access to power supply from centralized
power networks. They are supplied by electric energy mainly from autonomous
diesel engines—low-power generators; fuel for them is delivered from distant
regions using motor and water transport and even helicopters, which makes this fuel
very expensive. Furthermore, these deliveries are unreliable, because they depend
on weather conditions, availability of transport means, and prepayment.
Under these conditions, an alternative to organic fuel resources is the use of
URPS in economically justiﬁed amounts. The humanity has made a great progress
in the utilization of URPS in the last 15–20 years. As a result, due to large capital
investments in this branch and legislative and political acts adopted by many
countries on the intergovernmental level, the stage of development of systems based
on URPS has progressed from research and development to industrial and com-
mercial research. There are examples of elaboration and implementation of
long-term programs. Thus, according to the Report of the European Commission,
the EC activity in the ﬁeld of URPS is aimed at coordination of efforts and
large-scale utilization of URPS to ensure about 15% of energy generation in 2015
by utilization of RPS (including large-scale hydropower engineering). The global
energy strategy of the Federal Government of Germany plans to increase the share
of RPS taken together capacity to 50% by 2050. In addition, this plan is realistic,
because only over the period of 1998–2002, it was increased from 4.6 to 7.1%. This
result was reached only by increasing the competitiveness of units based on URPS
compared to the conventional units. At present, as demonstrated below, conven-
tional units surpass units based on URPS in the majority of technical speciﬁcations
and commercial efﬁciency.
One of the most important characteristics of URPS—the speciﬁc capacity—is
compared with conventional power sources in Table 5.2.
While on the subject of URPS, it should also be noted that many of them
consume large amount of natural power resources per unit generated electric
energy, Table 5.3.

Nevertheless, today considerably powerful power plants are developed which
use renewable energy sources, Table 5.4.
Progress in the creation of reliable, technically perfect, and economically efﬁ-
cient electric power units simple in operation and based on utilization of uncon-
ventional renewable power sources will allow the main problem of decreasing the
cost of a unit of generated power to be solved. From this viewpoint, of interest are
the data of experts presented in Table 5.5.
Comparing conventional and unconventional power units and analyzing per-
spectives of their further development, we cannot but note their economic and
ecological aspects presented in Tables 5.6 and 5.7.
As already indicated above, there are severe geographical, technical, and eco-
nomic limitations on the application of NRPS.
The URPS resources have ﬁxed geographical location. Obviously, tidal energy
can be found at sea coasts, whereas the geothermal energy is generated by natural

springs of hot vapor and water and thermal anomalies. Small HPS, naturally, can be
built on rivers and storage reservoirs. Solar and wind energies are widespread
everywhere, but their utilization is most expedient in regions with maximum solar
irradiation and maximum wind velocities, respectively.
Technical limitations are caused by the problem of stability of power networks
and individual power units with uncontrollable power generation charts. The
problem of the power networks stability is particularly strong when the power
produced from renewable energy sources is approaching or exceeds 20–25% of the
power networks power. The increase in power generating units that use URPS
complicates the task of storing electrical energy, as well as the conversion of
generated direct current into an alternating to increase voltage level up to the

electric converters, fuel cells, some types of WPP. (Brieﬂy, they will be discussed
in Sects. 5.4, 5.5, and 9.2.)
Technical limitations are caused by the problem of stability of power networks
and individual power units with uncontrollable power generation charts.
The economic efﬁciency of power stations is also very important now. The
majority of power stations utilizing URPS are not competitive with traditional ones.
This is due to low ﬂux density (speciﬁc power) of utilized primary energy
(Table 5.2) that leads to material and capital expenditures for systems utilizing
URPS higher than those for systems utilizing conventional energy resources
(Tables 5.6 and 5.7). If expenditures on a power station utilizing URPS are covered
in acceptable time, its initial cost is almost without exception higher than that of a
conventional station, which creates a barrier for URPS utilization; therefore, the
technical policy of many countries in the given ﬁeld provides economic incentives
to the NRPS development consisting in tax and credit privileges or granting

subsidies to the manufacturers and customers of equipment. In these countries, the
appropriate legislative and normative base has been adopted according to which, in
particular, energy companies are obliged to purchase the electric energy produced
by utilizing URPS. These measures are necessary for the NRPS development in the
initial stage in which power generating units and stations based on NRPS can and
must become competitive with the conventional ones.
As noted above, in most countries the share of the non-traditional renewable
power generation (NRPG) in the world Fuel and Power Complex is too small,

Harnessing of Water Flow of Rivers and Energy
of Other Streams
In contrast with non-renewable chemical energy accumulated in an organic fuel, the
kinetic energy of river water is renewable. It is transformed into electric energy at
hydroelectric power plants.
The estimated annual waterpower resources on the Earth are 32,900 TWh, from
which only about 25% can be utilized for technical and economic reasons. This
value is nearly twice as large as the current level of annual electric power generation
by electric power plants all over the world, that is, deﬁnite reserves of waterpower
are still available. Table 5.9 presents the data on waterpower resources in different
countries.

discharge and on small rivers (hydroelectric power micro-plants) has been accu-
mulated together with the experience on building of ﬂuvial and dam HPP, and
hydraulic power engineering itself is among the most signiﬁcant achievements of
the XXth century. It is commonly accepted to identify four types of hydraulic
power systems:
• large HPP that form hydro-engineering complexes,
• pumped storage power plants,
• small HPP operating outside of interconnected power systems,
• hydroelectric power generating units being integral parts of national-economic
complexes.
Currently, the bulk of electricity generated by a water ﬂow accounted for HPP is
built on large rivers. They have been built according to one of the three schemes:
dams, derivative, or combination. The typical design of the hydroelectric unit
(“heart”) of the powerful HPP is shown in Fig. 5.4.
At present, about 30% of the world economic hydraulic potential is utilized.
The relative contribution of hydroelectric power to the total power generation is
rather high in many countries: in Norway and Brazil, it exceeds 90%, in Canada and
Venezuela it is between 50–80%, in India, Egypt, Italy, and China it is about 20%.
The hydropower potential of the rivers in different countries and its imple-
mentation are shown in Table 5.10.
The indisputable advantages of hydraulic power engineering are:
• renewable water-power resources,
Fig. 5.4 Typical design of
the hydroelectric unit of the

• low production cost of electric energy (The average cost of the electric power
produced by HPP in Russia is almost 6 times less than that of the electric power
produced by TPP state district power plant despite of the fact that domestic
prices for fossil fuels in Russia are relatively low),
• the mobility of reserve capacity covering peaking load charts,
• inﬂation stability,
• ecologically clear production,
• the ability to build a giant power HPP, Table 5.11.
The accumulated knowledge allows us to pay more attention to the ecological
factors now, in particular, to positive effects that can be obtained by constructing
objects of hydropower engineering. A comprehensive analysis enables us to eval-
uate the effect of HPP on the environment.
The pace of development of powerful hydropower is globally limited by the
following factors:
1. In some countries, there are no rivers with sufﬁcient hydropower potential (e.g.,
Israel).
2. In some countries it has been involved practically all (e.g., Norway).
3. Many countries with large hydroelectric potential have no money to invest in
construction of such facilities. As is well known, the construction of powerful
hydroelectric power station is characterized by extremely high capital expendi-
tures (billions of dollars) and long construction schedule (up to 10 years or more);

4. Despite the apparent ecological purity of production of electricity from hydro-
power plants, they have a signiﬁcant negative impact on the environment (see
Chap. 8).
More detailed data on the history and state of the art of large-size hydro-power
engineering can be found in the special literature.
5.2.2
Mini Hydro Power Plants
Except the above-mentioned division of HPP by their functionality, the following
classiﬁcation of HPP by their capacity is used:
• stations with capacities smaller than or equal to 100 kW are called micro HPP,
• from 100 to 1000 kW are called mini HPP,
• from 1000 to 10,000 kW are called small HPP,
• more than 10,000 kW are called large HPP.
Their design and principles of their construction can differ essentially.
Historically, the ﬁrst HPP belonged to the class of micro HPP, and the time of
their appearance coincided with successes in industrial mastering of electric gen-
erators. These simplest often half-handicraft systems were widespread, especially in
rural regions. In particular, the share of hydropower engineering in energy supply in
agriculture reached 11% in the USSR in 1937.
In the USSR, in contrast with the majority of other countries where hydraulic
power engineering was developed simultaneously with other power resources, it
began virtually from the very beginning. When small power engineering was
ignored in general and micro HPP were ignored in particular, even the experience
of utilization of small rivers was lost, many operating hydroelectric systems were
closed, and the production of equipment for them was cut down.
Due to achievements in the ﬁeld of electric machine building and semiconductor
and transformer engineering, a new class of valve-type electric machines, which
possess new properties and allow one to solve problems previously unsolvable, has
been developed.
For example, the valve-type electric machines provide the basis for the con-
struction of autonomous electric power supply units that generate high-quality
electric power with minimum requirements imposed on an actuating motor. This
enables one to construct automated hydraulic unit with uncontrollable turbines for
hydraulic power micro-stations. As demonstrated the pre-war experience, exactly
this
direction
in
the
development
of
micro
HPP
meets
best
the
production-technological and operating requirements. Micro HPP with valve-type
electric machines are most widespread now all over the world.
The tendency to a simpliﬁcation of hydraulic engineering equipment of stations
increased strongly the requirements to devices for electric power generation and
stabilization of its parameters.

The main directions in the development of small-scale hydraulic power engi-
neering in Russia for the nearest future are the following: construction of small HPP
on complex water engineering systems; modernization and reconstruction of out-
dated small HPP; construction of small HPP on small rivers; construction of small
HPP on existing water basins, water falls of canals, penstocks for water supply to
and removal from various economic objects.
In 2014 in the Tomsk region (Russia) a mini HPP using sewage waters of two
cities (Tomsk and Seversk), settlement and petrochemical plant was put into
operation. Its parameters are power of 1000 kW, height difference of 96 m, water
pipeline diameter of 1420 mm, and the rate of water discharge 3500–11,000 m3/h,
and the payback period of 3 years.
5.3
Bioenergetics
Bioenergetics can be considered as a variant of solar power engineering (see
Sect. 5.5) based on photosynthesis and subsequent liberation of chemical energy
accumulated in biomass, which is converted into thermal or electric energy. The
biomass is the cheapest and largest-scale form of renewable energy accumulation.
The term biomass involves any material of biological origin, including products of
vital activity and organic wastes. A special place is occupied by peat—one of the
materials of biological origin. (Sometimes it is called the accumulated biofuels.)
Peat is often referred to non-renewable energy resources due to the very low rate of
recovery of its reserves.
The average rate of peat accumulation varies and depends on the prevailing
source of plant grouping, geographical and climatic zones, and hydrological and
other conditions. It varies from 0.2 to 0.4 mm (swamp forest—tundra) to 1–2 mm
(coniferous-deciduous subzone). Modern peat deposits were formed 10–12 thou-
sand years ago.
5.3.1
Biomass
One of the most complicated problems on the paths to implementation of a tempting
idea of plant utilization as a main energy source is a low efﬁciency of photosyn-
thesis as a method of converting solar energy into chemical one. According to
estimates, about 155 billion ton of dry residue of organic mass, mainly cellulose,
which can be used either directly as a fuel or as a material for producing fuel, is
formed annually in the process of photosynthesis. Because of a low efﬁciency of
energy conversion, areas under crop must be increased signiﬁcantly to produce the
required amount of energy. Therefore, investigations aimed at an increase in the
efﬁciency of energy conversion, a search for plants most suitable for this purpose,
and creation of an optimal artiﬁcial gas composition are of great importance. For
102

example, if corn is grown to produce energy rather than to feed cattle, the cost of
energy will be comparable with the cost of fossil fuel in the USA. If coniferous
forest is grown with 6 thousand trees per 1 acre (1 acre = 0.4 ha), and a “harvest” is
gathered every 12 years, the cost of energy produced from it will increase
approximately twice and will be * 3 dollars per 1 million British Thermal Units
(1 Btu = 1.05506  103 J  1.055 kJ) due to slow rate of growth of trees and
some other factors. Perennial plants have one inestimable advantage over annual
ones: the “harvest” can be gathered all the year round when required; in this case,
we need not construct huge granaries for “energy harvest” collected only in deﬁnite
season. Therefore, fast growing deciduous trees, whose roots produce new sprouts
after cutting thereby obviating the necessity of new annual planting, were chosen to
produce energy.
Hybrid poplars are grown in experimental sites of unused arable lands in Central
Pennsylvania. Each of 3700 trees of a hybrid planted on an acre produces energy
that costs from 1.25 to 11.45 dollars per 1 million Btu (compared to a cost of
1.97 dollars per 1 million Btu for oil and 1.31 dollars per 1 million Btu for coal).
This plantation can produce annually *120 million Btu per acre with a power
conversion efﬁciency of *0.6%. To supply with fuel an average electric power
station rated at 400 MW, the plantation with an area of 30 thousand acres is
required. To fuel all electric power stations of the USA, a plantation with an area of
no more than 160 million acres is required even if the coefﬁcient of solar energy
conversion into fuel is  0.4%.
In the present stage, the annual increment of organic matter on the Earth is about
170–200 billion tons of biomass in the re-run of dry organic matter, which is
equivalent to 70–80 billion tons of oil (4  1021 J). This is approximately 10 times
more than global total energy commercial consumption of all humanity (3.9  1020
J), Table 5.12.
Biomass sources can be subdivided into the following main groups:
1. Products of natural vegetation (wood, waste products of wood working, leaves,
etc.).
2. By-products of people activity including industrial activity (solid domestic
wastes, wastes of industrial production, etc.).
3. By-products of agriculture (manure, chicken dung, stems, tops, etc.).
4. Specially grown high-yield agricultural crops and plants.
However, the biomass itself even in large amounts does not imply a solution of
the problem of obtaining different products and substances from it, including fuel.
The unutilized biomass does irreparable harm to the environment.
By-products of woodworking have already been utilized: facilities have been
created and technologies of production of a generator gas and of its combustion are
mastered. The experts believe that 15% of need in fuel can be covered by rational
utilization of wood, by-products of wood working, and fast growing forest plan-
tations. With the modern level of consumption, this will make about 6 million ton
of standard fuel.

At present more than 6% of all thermal energy consumed in China, nearly 6% in
the USA, 5.7% in the EU countries, and 32.9% in Brazil are produced from bio-
mass. In the countries of the equatorial belt, biomass remains the main source of
energy. Its share in the energy balance of developing countries is 35%. The one
sixth of annual fuel consumption in the world is provided by wood and about one
third of all cut-down trees are used for cooking and heating. About half the world
population uses ﬁrewood for cooking and heating (and this is 4/5 of energy
consumption).
Developed and applied various methods of converting biomass into thermal and
electrical energy or liquid and gaseous fuels, Fig. 5.6.
It is possible to distinguish three main methods of producing fuels from biomass.
First, bioconversion is used, that is, decomposition of organic substances of
vegetative and animal origin under anaerobic (without access of air) conditions by
special bacteria with the production of gaseous fuel (biogas) and/or liquid fuel
(ethanol, butanol, etc.). Now in Brazil the urban motor transport and many personal
automobiles work on fuel produced by decomposition of biomass from sugar cane.

In the USA, ethanol is produced from wastes of corn. Ethanol is a good substitute
for gasoline; moreover, biomass is a fast renewable resource unlike oil. The pro-
duction of thermal energy through aerobic microbiologic oxidation of organic
substances also belongs to bioconversion. This is the scientiﬁc term for composting
and bio-heating known to each gardener.
Second, thermochemical conversion is used (pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation, fast pyrol-
ysis, and synthesis) of solid organic substances (tree, peat, and coal) into a synthetic
gas, methanol, artiﬁcial gasoline, and charcoal.
Third, combustion of wastes in special boilers and furnaces is used. Hundred
tons of such wastes are burnt with regeneration of energy all over the world. The
caloriﬁc values of pressed fuel bricks from paper, cardboard, wood, polymers,
sawdust, and garbage are comparable with the caloriﬁc value of brown coal.
The use of secondary resources—agricultural waste and wood processing,
combustible household waste and industrial waste has obvious advantages over the
use of primary biological resources (primarily wood, food, and feed crops):
• does not threaten the biological balance;
• improves the environment;
• does not lead to higher prices for food products as is the case of the large-scale
use of the food and feed grains in bioenergetics.
In developed countries, each person produces about 5 tons of dry organic waste
per year, processing of which in the methane can give in a global scale to
700 billion m3 of methane or 1  109 tons standard fuel. This is sufﬁcient to meet
the needs of all population in the gas for cooking. Such processing can help to solve
environmental problems and to produce fertilizers.
In developed countries, to generate heat and electricity by direct burning of
ﬁrewood, waste wood, straw, and peat mini-power plant (Mini-TPP) is used. In the
embodiment of steam turbine, their efﬁciency is 20–25%, power from a few kilo-
watts (for farmers) to hundreds of kilowatts, Table 5.13.
Increased efﬁciency and lower operating expenses have automatic boilers that
require pre-treatment before combustion of biomass: the manufacture of wood
pellets, wood chips, and briquettes.
Pellets are 20–50 mm granules from dried wood waste manufactured under high
pressure without chemical ﬁxers; their cost is 60–90 Euro/t, and cost of unit energy
produced from these is approximately 30% lower than that of diesel fuel or natural
gas.

Fuel pellet characteristics and some other types of fuel are shown in Table 5.14.
Due to the advantages of pellets, they become one of the most popular types of
fuel in most European countries, Japan, the United States and in several other
countries. In Europe, annual growth in the production of pellets is about 30%.
The main consumers of the pellets are the owners of country houses that use this
fuel in ﬁreplaces and mini-boiler.
Energy chips have a length of 10–150 mm and a thickness of 10 to 100 mm.
Often chips are burned with sawdust, which allows one to recycle waste and to
improve fuel consumption by about 20%.
Briquettes are made from timber waste, straw, tops, etc. Their sizes and shapes
are different: rectangular, cylindrical; size—from meters to centimeters (depending
on the type of boiler and BM). Their caloriﬁc value is close to that for coal,
Table 5.15.
To reduce emissions of harmful substances, to reduce the requirements for
preliminary fuel preparation, and to improve the efﬁciency of fuel conversion, the
following biomass combustion technologies are developed and used: combustion in
swirling furnace (cyclone combustion chamber), and use of the powdered fuel, grill,
rotary kiln, ﬂuidized bed, and circulating ﬂuidized bed. Each of them has advan-
tages and disadvantages. Two latest technologies are the most preferable from the
point of view of ecological cleanness. Boilers with low-temperature furnaces and
ﬂuidized bed allow biomass with humidity of 60% or more to be burned and the
swirling furnace (cyclone combustion chamber) allows pulverized wood and plant
waste to be burned.

Increase in the efﬁciency of the conversion of biomass into heat and electricity
by more than 2 times compared to TPP is possible due to preliminary biomass
gasiﬁcation in the gasiﬁcation modules included in the equipment of set piston and
gas turbine power plants (it can also be used in TPP with steam boilers). Scheme of
gas-producing power plant is shown in Fig. 5.7; main power characteristics of TPP
of this type are shown in Table 5.16.
5.3.2
Peat
The reserves of one more energy source—peat—are also signiﬁcant.
World peat reserves are estimated at more than 500 billion tons (by a 25%
moisture content, they amount to 225–261 billion tons). The area of peat deposits in
the world accounts for 176 million hectares. Deposits of peat are found on all
continents. A relatively small part of the Earth’s land surface (in the zone of
maximum concentration of peat) contains more than 80% of world reserves of peat.

In the Northern Hemisphere, it covers Western Siberia and extends to West Atlantic
coast. A large area of peat accumulation is in the northeastern part of North
America. In the Southern Hemisphere, signiﬁcant deposits of peat are found only on
the islands of Southeast Asia.
According to estimates of the Canadian Peat Resources (2010), the ﬁrst place in
the world reserves of peat take Canada (170 billion tons), the second—Russia
(150 billion tons), the third—Indonesia. The annual increase of peat reserves in
Russia is 250 million tons, which is 50 times higher than the level of annual
procurement.
According to the share of peat in energy production, the leader is Ireland, where
more than 90% of power plants work on peat.
The construction of the ﬁrst power plant using peat as fuel (peat power plant)
began in the late 1870s–early 1880s. (In Russia the ﬁrst peat power plant was built
in 1913, today it is the largest in the world TPP (with power of 1500 MW). In
Russia, the largest plant that can work on peat is Shatura SDPP.
In Finland and Sweden, the power plants working on peat produce a quarter of
total produced electricity. In Finland, peat is used for about 60 TPP owned by
industrial enterprises and municipalities. The power of boilers is 20–550 MW, and
the total capacity of these TPP is more than 7 GW.
In assessing the competitiveness of peat with other fuels, it is conveniently
compared with coal. In this case, heat has the following advantages:
• the replacement of coal by peat signiﬁcantly reduced air pollution by sulfur
oxides (by 4–24 times depending on the ash content and the characteristic coal
basin),
• by 2–19 times reduced emissions of particulate matter,
• utilization of peat ash is simple compared to the utilization of coal slag,
• the development of peat deposits reduces the risk of ﬁres.
Because of low caloriﬁc value, peat has not yet found wide application in electric
power engineering [2].
Low caloriﬁc value of peat causes many problems when it is used in the power
industry: at current prices for mineral fuels, the peat share in the energy balance is
very small.
5.4
Wind Power Plants
The wind energy has long been used in navigation and for turning round mill
wheels too. In recent years, it has been utilized for electric power generation. The
majority of wind power units have a capacity of a few kW, and they are located in
distant regions, for example, on the sea shallows, the so-called offshore wind farms.
During the Second World War, a wind power plant rated at 1.25 MW was con-
structed on the Grandpa Hill, Vermont, USA, which had been operated successfully
5.3
Bioenergetics

for several weeks and generated 61.78 MWh of electric power. Then one of the
rotor blades was broken, and the station was not restored most likely because of a
deﬁcit of materials and the need for saving money during the time of war.
Since the energy crisis in 1973–1974, considerable means have been invested in
the development of wind power engineering. Several experimental stations of
different designs were constructed. The cost of the electric energy generated by
wind power stations is still higher than that generated by power stations on organic
fuel (see Table 5.5). In addition, some more disadvantages peculiar to this source of
primary energy were found. Nevertheless, the wind energy should be considered as
an important energy resource.
It can be easily shown that the unit output power is proportional to the area of
wind rotor blades and to the cube of wind velocity (usually low). In this regard and
due to the fact that the density of air is 846 times less than the density of water, the
overall dimensions of wind high-power plants (in megawatt range) should be very
large compared to hydraulic turbines (Fig. 5.8).
One of the most complex problems hindering widespread use of wind power
plants is the permanently varying wind velocity. Even in high mountains, the wind
velocity undergoes fast variations.
As the rotor speed varies signiﬁcantly, a gearbox is installed to regulate the
speed of the shaft on which the power generator is mounted. A DC-generator is an
easy-to-control system for converting the mechanical energy to electric power.

However, problems associated with the type, quality, and transmission of the power
must be solved in that case. The energy efﬁciency of WPP may be signiﬁcantly
increased based on a synchronous generator with high-power electronic equipment.
In that case, the voltage of the synchronous generator is sent to the input of rectiﬁer,
which may be based on uncontrollable switches in some circumstances. Then,
rectiﬁed voltage is sent to an inverter (Fig. 5.9), which is connected directly to the
grid. Either a voltage inverter or a current inverter may be used. Its operation with
the grid can by greatly improved by using completely controllable electronic
switches. By that means, the inverter may generate speciﬁed active and reactive
power in the grid. It is also possible to insure high quality of the current and to
supply energy from the grid for battery charging.
Another option is to use an induction generator (IG) with a short-circuited rotor,
but that entails regulation of the amplitude and frequency with variation in the rotor
speed. Special methods are required here, for example, combined operation with a
rectiﬁer-inverter cascade. An inverter based on completely controllable electronic
switches mast be used in that case; a step-up DC-converter may also be needed.
However, a more promising approach is to use a source of controllable capacitive
power such as static converter. In that case, the IG can send active energy to the
grid and draw from it the required reactive power, Fig. 5.10.
A fundamentally new approach involves an asynchronized synchronous gener-
ator. Its rotor has two windings, which may effectively be controlled by static
converters. In principle, this generator may operate with the grid as its rotor speed
varies. Power may be supplied to the rotor windings from a frequency converter in
which the voltage is phase-shifted by 90°, and its frequency is the slipping fre-
quency. The resulting magnetic ﬁeld, which turns at the slipping frequency, ensures
synchronous rotation of the exciting ﬁeld and the generators stator. The efﬁciency
of the asynchronized synchronous generator is especially evident at considerable
turbine speeds with a gearbox of limited capabilities. The frequency control of the
voltage supplied to the winding ensures highly stable synchronous operation of the
asynchronized synchronous generator with the grid [3].
In addition, these plants generate electric power only when the wind blows rather
than when required. Unfortunately, there is no convenient, efﬁcient, and economic

method of electric power accumulation in large amounts. In addition to the principle
implemented in WPP, proposals on utilization of electric power generated during
periods of minimum electrical loads for electrolysis of water and production of
hydrogen and oxygen are nominated. These gases can subsequently take part in the
association reaction in a fuel cell to generate electric power. The development of
this technology has only been started. However, it seems likely that in future it can
become economically acceptable.
In the early 2002, the beginning of implementation of an almost fantastic project
was reported in press. According to this project, the synthesis of solar and wind
power engineering is envisaged, independent from weather conditions, time of day,
and season.
The development of wind power engineering in the world began in the early 70s.
The greatest share (up to 3%) of the WPP generation was recorded in 1993 in
Denmark with wind turbines distributed all over the country. The construction of
modern WPS was started here in the late 70s. In the early 80s, especially rapid
growth of WPS was observed in California, USA. The law on tax discounts for
investments to renewable power sources, adopted in addition to federal tax discount
law, has created a favorable situation here. As a result, California is now the world
leader in production of wind electric power. The most powerful wind farm in the
United Kingdom (County Kent) generates P = 300 MW.
The cost of wind energy decreases annually by 15% and even now can compete
in the market; what really matters, it has perspectives for further cost decrease in
contrast with the cost of electric energy generated by atomic power stations (which
increases annually by 5%); moreover, at present the annual rate of growth of wind
power exceeds 25% (Fig. 5.11).

The process of wind power consumption intensiﬁes in different countries. In
2014, 85 countries used wind energy on a commercial basis. To the end of 2015, in
the windy industry were engaged more than one million people worldwide. In some
countries, especially intensively developing wind power engineering, in particular,
in 2015 in Denmark by means of wind turbines was produced 42% of all electricity;
in 2014 in Portugal—27%; in Spain—20%; in Ireland—19%; in Germany—8%; in
the EU—7.5%. Governments of China and city Tianjin (population of 14.5 million
people) decided, that in 2020 more 20% of the electricity consumed by this city
have to be produced with the help of WPP.

makes *140 kW. Until the middle of the 80s, WPP were based on wind-turbine
units (WTU) rated at 100 kW. Since the middle of the 80s, WTU rated at 100–
300 kW have been constructed, and since the late 80s, WTU rated at 600–700 kW
have been built. At present, new models of WTU rated at 500–2500 kW are
constructed based on the accumulated experience. The most common of modern
commercial WTU with horizontal axis have a power of 2500 kW. A prototype of
wind power generator rated at 6000 kW with a wind wheel about 130 m in
diameter has been constructed. Almost all world stock of WTU consists of impeller
units. The work is underway on WTU of other types and on impeller WTU with
higher capacity. However, they are not widely used, and the perspectives for their
application are not clear.
Thus, by the present time, the world wind power engineering has turned into the
branch of electric power engineering making signiﬁcant contribution to electric
power generation in some countries.
One of the projects developed in the USA envisages the construction
of 150,260-m towers with three-blade rotors turning round generators with a single
capacity of *1.5 MW. The density of location of these WTU will be one per
square mile. As a result, their aggregate capacity will be about 225 GW, which is an
Fig. 5.11 Dynamics of installed capacity of WPP in the world, thousand MW

essential share of the aggregate installed capacity of all electric power stations of
the USA. The use of these electric power units is hindered by the following factors:
• The problem of accumulation of electric power generated during minimum load
periods has not yet been solved satisfactorily.
• The design of high-velocity and high-power wind generators with variable
rotation velocity, shafts, control units, etc. is still imperfect.
• There are aesthetic and ecological objections against the implementation of this
project.
The widespread use of WTU in any limited region can cause deep climatic
changes in this region. For example, it seems likely that consumption of a signif-
icant part of wind energy of a gale (*4  1012 J) in the central western region of
the USA will decrease the recurrence and wind velocities of gales at these latitudes.
Of course, there is something positive in this effect. On the other hand, the
remaining existing features of the climate in central western regions can also
depend on gales. A decrease in the gale wind velocities can change the precipitation
regime to such extend that some territories in eastern regions of the USA will
become unsuitable for agriculture, and irrigation will be necessary for the remaining
regions, as in the Far West of the country. The interaction of different atmospheric
phenomena is a very complex process that has not yet completely understood. Any
large-scale changes of natural phenomena on the Earth must be made carefully with
allowance of their possible environmental effect.
Summarizing, we conclude that the wind energy is useful as an additional source
of electric power, but in the nearest future, it will ﬁnd only limited application.
Scientiﬁc and technical progress, especially in the ﬁeld of electric energy accu-
mulation, can change the situation; however, in this case it will be necessary to
evaluate the inﬂuence of large-scale wind energy consumption on the climate.

Solar Power Engineering
The Sun is the source of life on our planet and the source of all types of energy
produced on it. The person has long paid and pays repeatedly attention to the
utilization of solar energy to produce commercially electric energy, hot water, and
vapor.
5.5.1
Electric Energy Production
At present, solar power plants (SPP) of two different types, distinguished by
methods (thermodynamic and photoelectric) of solar energy conversion into electric
114
5
Electric Power Engineering on the Basis …

energy, are built and are in service (Fig. 5.12). (The third method—photochemical
conversion was considered above.)
In the ﬁrst case, solar radiation is converted into heat with rather high potential,
then into mechanical energy (in a turbine or other heat machine), and ﬁnally into
electric energy (in a generator). The photoelectric method is based on direct con-
version of photon energy into energy of current carriers in irradiated semicon-
ducting photoelectric pickoffs called the photoelectric effect.
The photoelectric effect was discovered by Hertz in 1887 and was studied in
detail by A.G. Stoletov in 1888. Practical application of the photoelectric effect for
producing the electric power has become possible only recently due to progress in
physics of semiconductors.
When semiconductors with the electron (n-type) and hole (p-type) conductivities
are in contact, a contact potential difference arises at the interface owing to electron
diffusion. When the semiconductor with the p-type conductivity is illuminated,
electrons in it absorb light quanta and go over to the semiconductor with the n-type
conductivity. In this case, an electric current will run through a closed circuit.
Now silicon photocells illuminated by both direct solar rays and scattered light
have the best characteristics. The efﬁciency of silicon photocells increases as
temperature decreases, that is, they can equally successfully operate in both winter
and summer. In winter, the decrease of the light ﬂux is compensated by the increase
in their efﬁciency at the expense of intensiﬁcation of the photoelectric effect.
Because of complicated production process of semiconductors and their high
cost, silicon photocells are used only for unique equipment, for example, of the
Earth’s satellites and space stations.
Despite the radical difference in the methods of energy conversion, solar thermal
(STPP) and solar photovoltaic power plants (SPVPP) have a number of properties
and limitations in common caused by the nature of the employed power source.
Solar radiation as a power source, in addition to such positive properties as prac-
tically unlimited resources, complete ecological cleanness, and presence every-
where has also negative properties including low density (speciﬁc power) of solar

radiation (no more than 1 kW/m2 on the Earth’s surface) and objective (daily and
seasonal) and random (caused by weather conditions) time variations.
Already implemented and only developing ideas can simultaneously reduce the
impact of shortcomings in the development of solar energetic. There are several
ways to get the required amount of electricity and heat in conditions of a low
surface density of the solar energy:
• predominant use of small power plants, allowing to create architectural and
engineering compositions that organically combine the natural landscapes and
habitats with the power plants. These SPP can form a spatial architectural
compositions which are elements of the facades and roofs of buildings of almost
any designation;
• installation panels of large SPP at a height of 2–3 m above the ground, allowing
the land under them to be used for agricultural purposes (e.g. for grazing), or
placing panels on land not suitable for other applications (e.g., deserts),
• construction of ﬂoating marine-ocean based SPP,
• creation of a balloon SPP which does not require a large area of land; placing a
balloon above the clouds at the same time helps to solve another problem—
dependence of the SPP power on the weather.
The irregular arrival of solar radiation to the Earth’s surface leads to uncon-
trollable energy generation with the help of the SPP. Only the probable output
power of the SPP in the given time of light day can be estimated based on the
long-term meteorological observations. Other plants of interconnected power sys-
tems can compensate for this disadvantage, because a relative contribution of SPP
to the output capacity of these systems is sufﬁciently low. In future, if the share of
SPP in the electric power generation signiﬁcantly increases, this disadvantage can
become important. Scientists and engineers are trying to overcome these negative
properties of solar radiation in four main directions: (1) the construction of giant
solar panels in areas of the earth surface is not suitable for other applications
(Fig. 5.13) or on the surface of oceans, seas, and big lakes, (2) placing solar panels
on the Earth orbit or on the surface of the Moon, (3) more efﬁcient solar radiation
capture and converting it into electrical or thermal energy, (4) accumulation of
energy during periods of excess electricity production or in the form of primary
(electricity) or converted into other forms of energy: chemical (hydrogen produced
by electrolysis of water), potential energy of water (pumped storage hydroelectric
power plants). The real way to overcome the temporary instability of the solar
energy input to Earth is the construction of the so-called “solar-fuel power plants”.
The essence of this concept is a combination of a solar thermal power plant with a
maneuverable fuel unit compensating for the disadvantage of thermal energy
supplied to a steam generator when the solar energy is lacking or insufﬁcient. Such
combined solar-fuel plants have sufﬁciently stable characteristics and can balance
electric power.
The perspective direction is space-based solar power engineering (up to 10 TW
of aggregate capacity) with energy transfer to the Earth surface. The available
116

scientiﬁc and technological potential of astronautics creates premises for solving the
problem of utilization of solar energy by several methods. They are:
• power supply of the Earth’s regions with the help of orbital power plants
converting the solar energy into microwave or laser radiation and transmitting it
on the Earth. In future with increase in the number and capacity of these power
plants, it will be economically expedient to construct them from lunar materials
and to locate them on the Moon (see Fig. 5.14);
• lighting of near-polar regions of the Earth with the help of orbital solar reﬂectors
made from thin ﬁlm mirrors;
• increase of biomass production on the Earth by increasing the duration of light
time of day;
• increase of the electric power generated by solar ground-based stations at the
expense of additional illumination;
• heat supply to ground-based energy-technology complexes with the help of laser
radiation generated on the Earth’s orbits by conversion of solar radiation.
The speciﬁc mass of full-scale SPVPP rated at a few GW having classical
conﬁguration with silicon photoelectric converters and a microwave system based
on electronic vacuum devices (magnetrons and amplitrons) with unit power in the
range 100–1000 kW and moving in a geostationary orbit (at an altitude of
36,000 km) will be about 10 kg/W. It is expected that the efﬁciency of the entire
process will be sufﬁciently high.
Space-based solar plants can be rated at 3–20 GW and even more. The size of
the solar cell of the plant with an output power of 5 GW can be evaluated
Fig. 5.13 Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (Desert Mochava, USA). Characteristics:
power—392 MW, footprint on the Earth—13 km2, mirrors quantity—350 thousand, boilers at

proceeding from an efﬁciency of 15%. The surface area of the solar cell of this plant
will be *20 km2. In this case, the transmitting antenna should have a diameter of
1 km, and the receiving antenna should have a diameter of 7–10 km. The energy
density of the beam of ultra-short waves propagating from the space-based station
to the Earth will be only 1/5 of the solar energy density; therefore, it will represent
no hazard to ﬂying vehicles or birds. The problem of radio interference will not be
serious.
At present, there are no power limitations for SPP. In principle, SPP rated at any
preset capacity, depending on the receiving antenna aperture, can be constructed.
Therefore, such characteristics as, for example, the output electric power, is con-
venient to express per 1 m2 of the receiving antenna aperture.
It is expected that the efﬁciency of the conversion of solar radiation into
electric power will be sufﬁciently increased. Now the efﬁciency of solar energy
conversion by single crystal cells is 11–12%; a 16% maximum efﬁciency was
reported in the literature. It is assumed that 20% efﬁciency can be realized by
improving semiconductor cells. Gallium arsenide single crystals provide an efﬁ-
ciency of 14%, and individual cells have an efﬁciency of 18%.

However, now in the laboratory is reached the solar energy conversion efﬁciency
equal to 30–35%, and the possibility of its increasing to 40–45% in the foreseeable
future is considered.
The share of solar modules on the base of crystalline silicon in annual photovoltaic
panel’s production is 93%. Most of the rest of the production—a thin-ﬁlm amorphous
silicon solar cells, including complex cascade; about 1% of the total manufacturing—
the thin ﬁlm solar module with solar cells that do not contain silicon such as poly-
crystalline thin ﬁlm elements based on CdTe and CuInSe2 (CIS).
Improving solar cells (photoelectric converters) is conducted in several
directions:
(a) Improving the efﬁciency of solar cells with the use of expensive single-crystal
substrates and composite allows one to extend the part of the spectrum of
sunlight converted into electricity. Solar cells are elaborated that convert into
electricity not only light, but also heat. Radical increase of the efﬁciency solar
of cells (40%) can be achieved by using crystalline silicon instead of GaAs.
(b) Reduction of the price of production technology of traditional materials, while
maintaining the achieved level of efﬁciency. Despite the fact that silicon—the
second most common element on Earth, the production of solar cells from it is
expensive due to the complexity of the process of cleaning it from impurities.
The cost of solar modules has decreased by 10 times over the past 30 years.
(c) Development of ﬂexible (including optically transparent) solar cells, which
makes their use easier and more versatile (for example, setting them in win-
dows of houses).
(d) The use of redox reactions in the electrolyte, similar to the photosynthesis of
plants; real efﬁciency of such conversion is 10%, and theoretical efﬁciency is
33%. Converters can be produced from cheap materials with the help of simple
technologies.
A number of other criteria determines competitiveness of the SPP:
• the overall efﬁciency of the SPP should not be lower than 20%;
• SPP should generate energy as many hours per day as possible and throughout
the year;
• SPP service life must be at least 50 years;
• the cost per installed kilowatt power should not exceed $1.000;
• the volume of production of the semiconductor material for solar cells should be
more than 1 million tons per year at a price no higher than $12/kg;
• materials and components of the SES technology should be ecologically clean
and safe.
Systems based on solar cells are essentially DC-sources. Up to 10 kV, AC power
is obtained by means of an inverter connected, in general case, to a single-phase
AC-grid. In the absence of a grid, and with low-quality requirements on the output
current, we may connect the output of solar cell directly to an inverter, which
supplies the consumer. In the presence of a grid, an additional DC-converter is
5.5

required (Fig. 5.15), because of the extreme instability of the output voltage from
the solar cell. In addition, most systems include battery storage, to ensure stable
voltage at the DC-bus, Fig. 5.15 [3].
The conversion efﬁciency of solar energy into electrical energy by a thermo-
dynamic cycle depends on efﬁciency of transformation in all stages: the concen-
tration of sunlight by using a system of mirrors, converting sunlight into thermal
energy and thermal energy into the mechanical one and, ﬁnally, the mechanical
energy into the electrical energy.
According to forecasts of the International Energy Agency (IEA), by means of
solar energy about 5 thousand TWh of electricity will be produced to 2050, which
is approximately 12% of the needs of all humanity. As the key to the implemen-
tation of these giant plans can be considered such a fact, that many oil and gas
companies are considering solar power engineering as one of the promising trends
in the diversiﬁcation of their business. (For example, oil companies Shell, BP and
others buy plants for the production of solar cells and execute in developing
countries solar energy programs.)
Even today in countries with a predominance of sunny days per year, on the
share of solar energy falls a signiﬁcant part of electricity production. For example,
in the Chilean capital Santiago, 60% of the electricity consumed by the under-
ground is produced with the help of the SPP (and yet 16%—with the help of the
WPP). The SPP with power of 100 MW is now constructed in Chile.
5.5.2
Thermal Energy Production
The solar energy can be used directly for heating water, buildings, and air condi-
tioning. The advantage of solar energy consumption for these purposes is its

absolute ecological cleanness. Getting thermal energy from the Sun by direct
heating of the coolant (usually water) in solar systems is the most effective and
economical way of solar energy conversion. The total cost for the construction of
SPP, related to the collector area of 1 m2), today accounts for about 400 euros;
investments in the 1 kW are 230 euros. (If take thermal productivity of 1 m2 solar
panel equal to 1.75 kW (the average for the day.) This is 22 times less than the
photoelectric conversion of the solar energy.
The most widely used four types of water heating systems by solar radiation are:
1. Single-seasonal solar installation of hot water supply (HWS). Installation with
acceptable dimensions can provide heating of 100 m3 water to a temperature of
55–60 °C, which is quite sufﬁcient for domestic needs. They are used in sea-
sonal objects: in cottages, summer recreation centers, sanatoriums, camping, etc.
The service life is 15–20 years, and the payback period is 3.5–5 years.
2. Dual all-weather solar HWS installation. The ﬁrst circuit of this installation is
almost similar to a single-seasonal system, but is ﬁlled with liquid not freezing
to—40 °C and is equipped with the necessary shut-off and regulating valves,
circulation pump (10), and automatic control unit (4), Fig. 5.16.
To heat water up to the technological standards in the cold season, there is a
second circuit with an external heater (12) working on electricity or any form of
traditional fuels. Here, the ﬁrst solar circuit is an additional source of heat, which
saves fuel or electricity.
3. Dual-circuit all-weather combined solar installation of HWS and heating is the
second type of installation, retroﬁtting the boiler system, heating panels,
expansion vessel, and circulation pump. Installation does not provide heating
completely by solar energy, but solar circuit saves traditional energy resources.

4. Single-contour all-seasonal solar power installation for HWS is an electric water
heater equipped with a special solar power panel with cavitary absorbent for
trapping solar energy and transmitting it to the heating water. All elements of the
system including the tank—water accumulator—are located in a single housing.
Such devices can be produced with capacity up to 120 L, which allows their use
in apartment buildings. They can be built into the window openings, installed on
balconies, loggias. Device with capacity up to 30 L can be produced in a por-
table version, which inﬁnitely expands the scope of their application, up to ﬁeld
conditions.
The effectiveness of solar thermal energetics continues to increase due to
improved performance of all elements of the system; in the best models of instal-
lations, the efﬁciency already reaches 80–85%.
Possibility to place solar cells and solar collectors on the roofs of buildings is
very handy in a densely populated country like Japan. When you have reached the
appropriate efﬁciency, it is necessary to place on the roof of the cottage only 6–
9 m2 of solar collectors to meet needs of the average family of four in hot water and
heat.
In the USA, Germany, and Japan the number of homeowners who have solar hot
water and heating system has already reached several million people. In Spain, a
law according to which from January 1, 2005 each newly built house has to be
equipped with solar collectors was enacted. In several other countries: in Israel, the
UK, Switzerland, France, China, Greece, Portugal, Australia, and Cyprus a sig-
niﬁcant part of the needs of the residents of private homes in hot water and heating
is met by solar collectors. The total area of solar water heating systems in the world
exceeds 150 million m2, most of which are built in China (59%) and Europe (15%).
Saving fuel consumed in huge volumes for heating in several northern hemi-
sphere countries (Russia, the Scandinavian countries, Canada, etc.) can be provided
with large-scale use of passive solar heating systems in the construction of build-
ings. They provide a natural circulation of hot air and the required parameters of air
in the room without additional energy due to the following methods:
• use of helio-aktive external walling;
• use of thermal insulation;
• choice of materials for building construction with appropriate thermos-
cold-accumulating properties;
• use in a heating system more thermo-cold-accumulating materials;
• equipping the premises with special elements (curtains, blinds, valves) allowing
ﬂexibility to adjust the air temperature in the room.
Considerable attention is given to the perspective of solar energy consumption in
the intermediate process of fuel production. Thus, problems of constructing large
solar stations the energy of which can be used for synthesis of hydrocarbon-based
fuel, for example, from methanol, limestone, and water were discussed at different
scientiﬁc conferences. This liquid fuel will allow one to avoid the problem of
122
5
Electric Power Engineering on the Basis …

storage and transmission of electric power at long distances. The liquid fuel can
then be distributed and used as a conventional one.
To overcome the energy crisis, considerable attention is also given to an analysis
of the role of solar energy in future power engineering. Already today solar power
engineering is developed at an accelerated pace. Since the early 90s, the annual
increase of the share of solar power engineering is 16%, while the annual oil
consumption in the world increases only by 15%.
Solar power-generating units are most widespread in some EU countries
(Greece, Portugal, Spain, and France), in the USA, Japan, Israel, Australia, and
China. Each of these countries has from a few to tens of millions of square meters
of solar panels. Nowadays, 1 m2 of a solar collector generates: electrical energy—
1070 to 1426 kWh a year, heat—130 to 175 L of water to a temperature of 50 °C.
It saves annually:
• 1070–1426 kWh,
• 110–145 m3 of natural gas,
• 0.18–0.24 ton of coal,
• 0.95–1.26 ton of ﬁrewood.
Solar collectors with an area of 2–6 million m2 provide generation of 3.2–
8.6 billion kWh of energy and save 0.42–1.14 million ton of standard fuel annually.
Undoubtedly, interest in utilization of solar energy—the main energy source—
will further increase, and a realm of its application will expand, Fig. 5.17.
To increase the solar energy contribution into the saving of non-renewable
energy resources and to reduce the negative impact of power engineering on the
environment, scientists and engineers are considering others approaches not men-
tioned above. At present, many of them are perceived as exotic.
Among implemented in Russia projects belonging to solar energy, the most
appropriate is the construction of SPS 10 MW in the Mountain Altai. Despite the
low power, it is of great importance for the saving of this unique nature reserve.

Construction of TPS or hydroelectric power stations on small rivers could cause
irreparable damage to nature.
5.6
Tidal and Wave Power Plants
5.6.1
Tidal Power Plants
The energy of marine tides sometimes called the “lunar energy” has been known
since antiquity. Already in past historical epochs, this energy was used to actuate
various mechanisms, in particular, mills. In Germany, ﬁelds were irrigated using the
tidal wave energy, and in Canada it was used to saw woods. A tidal lifting machine
supplied London with water in England in the 19th century.
The potential of electric power generation from marine tidal currents is
enormous.
The total tidal energy of the Earth surpassed full of river hydropower and
estimated at 3 billion kW. The potential of tidal energy is estimated at 15% of the
current electricity consumption.
Considering tidal currents, osmotic and thermal energy developments are rec-
ognized as a resource to be exploited for the sustainable generation of electrical
power. The high load factors resulting from the ﬂuid properties and the predictable
resource characteristics make marine currents particularly attractive for power
generation and advantageous when compared to other renewable energies.
Moreover, international treaties related to climate control have triggered resurgence
in the development of renewable ocean energy technology. Therefore, several
demonstration projects in tidal power are scheduled to capture the tidal generated
coastal currents [4].
There are a huge number of witty projects of tidal equipment. Only in France
more than 200 inventions had been patented by 1918. In the early 20th century,
some attempts were undertaken to construct large tidal power plants (TdPP). The
construction of the Quoddy TPS rated at 200 thousand kW was started in the USA
in 1935. Soon the construction, on which 7 million dollars had already been spent,
was stopped, because it was found that the cost of electric power would be too high
(it would exceed by 33% the cost of electric power generated by heat power
stations). According to the project developed in the USSR in 1940, the Kislogubsk
tidal power station would produce energy whose cost would be twice as great as
that of river power stations.
The advantage of TPS over river power stations is that their operation is gov-
erned by space phenomena and is independent, unlike the river power stations, on
numerous random weather conditions.
However, TdPP have two signiﬁcant disadvantages, namely, irregular operation
and large volume of investments.
124
5
Electric Power Engineering on the Basis …

The irregularity of tidal energy within the lunar day and lunar month that differ
from solar ones does not allow TPS to be used systematically during periods of
maximum loading in power systems. The irregularity of TdPP operation can be
compensated by their combination with pumped storage power plants (PSPP).
When there is an excess output power of tidal power stations, PSPP operate in the
pump mode consuming this excess power and pumping water to the upper reser-
voir. During periods of minimum output power of tidal power stations, PSPP
operate in the generation mode supplying the electric power to the system. This
project is technically acceptable but expensive, because large installed capability of
electric machines is required.
The tidal power stations can also be combined with river HPP having a storage
reservoir. When these stations operate together, the HPP increase their output power
when the output power of tidal power stations decreases or when they are stopped;
when the tidal power stations generate sufﬁciently high power, PSPP pump water to
the storage reservoir. Thus, both daily and seasonal irregularity of operation of the
tidal power stations can be compensated.
Work cycle of the simplest (classical) TdPP includes ﬁlling the pool with water
during high tide through holes in the dam, inclusion the turbine and connected to it
the electric generator at low tide when the water pressure becomes sufﬁcient.
Today is considered cost-effective construction of TdPP in areas with tidal
ﬂuctuations in the water level of at least 4 m. Efﬁciency of TdPP is possible to
increase the use of turbines, working during both high tide and low tide. Such TdPP
are able to generate electricity continuously for 4–5 h with intervals of 1–2 h four
times per day. To increase the operating time of the turbine, there are more
advanced schemes—with two, three and more pools, but the cost of these projects is
very high.
The TdPP operate under conditions of fast turbine head change; therefore, their
turbines must have high efﬁciency at variable heads. A rather good compact hor-
izontal double-ﬂow turbine is now in the market. An electric generator and some
parts of the turbine are enclosed in a watertight capsule, and the hydraulic unit is
immersed in water. Rotating vanes of the turbine provide high efﬁciency at different
heads starting from 0.5 m.
The hydraulic unit can operate both in generation and pump modes. When the
generator is switched off, the hydraulic unit can pump water directly from the sea to
the reservoir and back; in the pump mode, it can pump water from the sea to the
reservoir and by that to increase the head.
The nature of Russia allows tidal power stations with an aggregate installed
capability of about 150 thousand MW to be built. Long-term scientiﬁc investiga-
tions and projects have led to a conclusion that of interest is the construction of a
few tidal power stations, rated from several hundred to several thousand MW.
Three powerful tidal stations operate: (a) in France (the Rance tidal power station
rated at 240 MW in France having 24 units; put into operation in 1967), (b) in
China (the Tsansyan tidal power station rated at 3.2 MW; its six units were laun-
ched in 1980–1985), and (c) in Canada (the Annapolis tidal power station rated at
19.6 MW, having 1 unit built in 1984). In addition, tens of tidal power micro- and
5.6
Tidal and Wave Power Plants
125

mini-stations being integral parts of complexes used for irrigation, drainage, nav-
igation, etc. were built in China.
A large number of tidal power station units are severe obstacle for their con-
struction, because to build such a number of units, it is necessary to involve all
power industry of the country.
5.6.2
Wave Power Plants
A promising source of renewable energy sources are waves of the oceans, seas and
large lakes that can develop the greatest speciﬁc power, among others renewable
energy sources. The waves of all oceans, sees, and big lakes in the future are able to
provide up to 2 TW of electric power, enough to meet the needs of all mankind.
With the present level of technology, wave power plants (WavePP) with a total
capacity of up to 10 billion kWh can be created.
The trend in the development of WavePP as power plants using other energy
renewable resources—a complex of single intermediate power modules (approxi-
mately 1 MW). A WavePP module has a size of about 50 m along the wave front.
Complexes with hundreds of meters in size and the total capacity of tens of
megawatts are often constructed of these modules. The low-power modules (tens of
kilowatts) with a sufﬁciently broad consumer niche had been developed. As in the
case of tidal energy, a number of technical solutions currently proposed and par-
tially implemented can be grouped into two groups faced on prevalence of kinetic
energy or energy rolling surface, which is converted into electrical energy. By
design, WavePP can be divided (rather conventionally) on the ﬂoat-WavePP and
Fig. 5.18 Principle of operation the ﬂoat-WavePP
126

chamber-WavePP. The principles of their work are shown in Figs. 5.18 and 5.19,
respectively.
There are two main variants of the chamber. One of them is WavePP in which
the kinetic energy of waves used. In this variant, a reception pipe of a very large
diameter (in the general case—the chamber of large cross section of any shape) is
established in the way of the waves. Incoming waves rotates a turbine which drives
a generator.
Another variant of the WavePP is because tidal waves passing through special
chamber displace the air contained in this chamber. Compressed air under pressure
passes through the turbine rotating it and electric generator. As a result, electricity is
produced.
Figure 5.20 shows the photograph of the chamber-WavePP.
Tests of a WavePP prototype have demonstrated that such system can operate
not only in the coast where waves are permanent, but even in large lakes. The
inventors believe that it is expedient to connect such units in series to form a battery
thereby creating a reliable and cheap source of high electric power. Of course, these
reasoning must be conﬁrmed under operating conditions.

Geothermal Power Plants
Globally, one of the largest sources of sustainable and environmental friendly heat
that can be used for electric power generation is geothermal resource. Even so,
owing to the lower steam temperatures (as compared to ﬁred systems), plant efﬁ-
ciencies have been limited (to around 15%), which has correspondingly limited the
economic lower range of geothermal temperatures that can be used. However, the
current and projected rising cost of power generation is constantly pushing down
that lower limit boundary, such that new low-grade geothermal sources and waste
heat from existing ﬁred generation or industrial process can be considered eco-
nomical for power generation. As the temperature differentials reduce, different
technologies must be considered when trying to meet commercial requirements.
According to the methods of the Earth heat extraction, of the following classi-
ﬁcation of geothermal systems is used, Fig. 5.21.
It is well known that the temperature increases by about 1 °C as the Earth’s depth
increases by 30–40 m. Therefore, water boils at depths of 3–4 km, and the Earth’s
temperature reaches 1000–1200 °C at depths of 10–15 km. In some regions of our
planet, the temperature of hot natural springs is sufﬁciently high even near the
Earth’s surface. These regions are most favorable for the construction of geothermal
power plants (GTPP). Thus, geothermal stations generate 40% of electric power in
the New Zealand; 6% of electric power is generated by geothermal stations in Italy.
These stations in other countries generate a signiﬁcant part of electric power.
Italy was the ﬁrst country that started industrial utilization of heat of the Earth’s
bowels. This was promoted by the lack of conventional energy resources there.

The scheme of underground heat utilization is simple. Hot underground water
produces vapor utilized in geothermal power stations and other technical facilities.
Vapor of the Earth’s bowels, unlike steam produced by steam generators of TPP,
contains impurities of different aggressive gases that destroy the equipment of
stations. Therefore, vapor of bowels is either preliminary directed to heat
exchangers to obtain pure vapor or special corrosion-resistant equipment is used. In
the ﬁrst method, about 25% of heat is lost. The second method is considered as
most expedient now.
The base mode of operation is preferable for such GTPP, since wells allow no
sharp changes in pressure and discharge.
The examined GTPP are geographically attached to natural springs of hot vapor
and water; therefore, regions of their utilization are limited. GTPP on thermal water
with temperature in the range 100–2000 °C can become more widespread; these
GTPP should have two contours with a working agent of the secondary contour
boiling at low temperatures.

The potential reserves of thermal waters with the above-indicated temperatures
are concentrated in Northern Caucasus in water stratums at depths of 2.5–5 km and
provide the basis for the construction of GTPP with an aggregate capacity of a few
million kilowatts. However, whereas GTPP on natural springs of hot vapor and
water are commercial facilities, GTPP on thermal water with the above-indicated
potential require testing. Similar GTPP can also be combined with vapor
hydrothermal GTPP to utilize the heat of separated water. This can increase electric
power generation by *20%. The wells in ﬁelds of thermal water admit the dis-
charge control; therefore, the output power of double-contour GTPP can be con-
trolled without losses of the heat carrier.
Figure 5.22 shows the block diagram of a GTPP for volcanic regions.
Figure 5.23 shows the block diagram of a GTPP for volcanic regions with
resources of thermal water having a temperature of 100 °C at depths accessible to
modern drilling engineering, and Fig. 5.24—typical appearance of GTPP.
In the distant future, high-temperature (up to 1000 °C) mantle layers will pro-
duce vapor from water pumped to an artiﬁcially created volcanic mouth. Of course,
the energy so produced will be pure and will not inﬂuence the biosphere (the huge
mantle mass eliminates the effect of heat taken away on the mantle state).

Other Renewable Energy Sources for Electricity
Production
Among these energy sources are: (1) sea and ocean currents, (2) temperature dif-
ference between surface and deep sea and ocean waters in tropical latitudes,
(3) air/sea temperature difference in the Arctic (Antarctic) region of the Earth,
(4) distributed (low-potential) heat of sea and ocean waters and other large reser-
voirs, and (5) phenomenon referred to as osmosis.
5.8.1
Ocean and Sea Currents Energy
Global ocean currents, such as Gulf Stream, Curoshio Current, and Florida Stream
transport water at rates of 83, 55, and 30 million m3/s, respectively, with velocities
of 2, 1.8, and 1 m/s and possess huge energy. From 1 m2 of the cross sectional
current area, a capacity of about 1 kW can be obtained. Currents in Gibraltar, La
Manche, and Kuril Straits as well as tidal currents are also of interest for power
engineering.
One of the methods of conversion of this energy into electric one is imple-
mentation of the idea that combines two technical solutions—a wind-wheel and a
tidal power station unit. This allows hybrid HPP operating in free running water to

be built whose units possess advantages of both wind-wheel and tidal power
station:
(1) They have much smaller water propeller sizes and hence, reduced material and
labor consumption. To receive a power of 1 MW, aqueous two-blade propeller
diameter should be about 18 m, and the propeller—about 55 m. The aqueous
two-bladed rotor with a diameter of 1 m at a ﬂow rate of 2 m/s can provide
power of 7 kW.
(2) Compared to TdPP and HPP, the unit of installed capacity for them is by about
an order of magnitude cheaper (primarily due to the absence of a dam).
(3) They allow operational characteristics to be estimated much more correctly due
to a better predictability of the sea current parameters in comparison with the
wind parameters.
(4) They are invisible and do not change the landscape and the natural state of the
coastal line. The hydro turbine (comprising a water propeller and an electric
generator) is mounted on a completely submerged support and is lifted out of
water only during repairing or servicing, Fig. 5.25.
The world’s ﬁrst commercial electric power station of this type (operating in free
running water) with a capacity of 1.2 MW has been connected to the National
Electric Grids of Northern Ireland. The dual rotor turbine is used. Rotors of the
turbine are 16 m in diameter and rotated with an optimal velocity of 14 rpm. The
rotor blades are equipped with a control system and can be rotate to change the
angle of attack. Marine Current Turbine Ltd. that built this power station has
already started a new project on building a power station at the coast of Northern
Wales with a capacity of 10.5 MW.
In the USA, the program Coriolis had been developed which envisages instal-
lation of 242 turbines in the Florida Strait; every turbine will be equipped with two
driving wheels 12 m in diameter rotating in opposite directions. The whole system
with total length of 60 km will be oriented along the main current; its width with
turbines installed in 22 rows 11 turbines in every row will be 30 km. The units will
be submerged at a depth of 30 m not to interfere with navigation. The capacity of
each turbine will be 400 kW, and the entire complex will generate about 100 MW.
Intensive works on the development of hydropower stations intended for oper-
ation in free running water are underway in France that has great possibilities for
the development of renewable electric power of this type, since strong ocean cur-
rents with velocities up to 15 m/s, caused by tides, run near beaches of Normandy
and Brittany. Building of three electric power stations is planned: two in Brittany
with a capacity of 1 and 2 GW, respectively, and one on the seaside of the Cotentin
Peninsula. The total output of these stations will be about 25 thousand GWh that
will make 5% of the total installed electricity produced in France. The payback
period for the electric power stations is 7 years.

motion of kelp plants. The external view of these units resembles the seaweed with

provide electricity to Australian State Victoria including its capital Melbourne.

Thermal Energy of Ocean and Sea Water
To use the temperature difference between surface and deep sea and ocean waters in
tropical latitudes, warm ocean water (24–32 °C) is directed to a heat exchanger
where liquid ammonium, Freon, or propane are converted into steam that rotates the
turbine and then enters the subsequent heat exchanger for cooling and condensation
by water with a temperature of 5–6 °C taken from depths of 200–500 m. The
electric power generated by such power plants (called ocean thermal energy con-
verter (OTEC) stations) can be transmitted to the coast or consumed in the place
(for example, in oil and gas platforms to extract mineral raw materials from sea
water, to desalinate it, and so on). The idea of generating electricity in this way was
made public as early as 1881. However, the ﬁrst power plant of this type was built
under the direction of French engineer Georges Claude in 1930 in Cuba.
This unconventional renewable power source (URPS) possesses important
advantages over many other sources: (a) the temperature difference of various
layers of ocean water is a more stable energy source than the wind, the sun, sea
waves, and small river discharges; (b) such factory-assembled power stations can be
easily delivered to any region of the World Ocean; and (c) their energy potential is
estimated to be about 1013 kWh/year.
Their wide application is hindered by two serious disadvantages: (a) geographic
reference to the tropical latitudes (between 20 and 29 S), where water temperature at
the ocean surface reaches, as a rule, 27–28 °C, and where such power stations are
economically efﬁcient and (b) large mass and overall dimensions. The ﬁrst
experiments on harnessing of NRES of this type within the framework of the joint
project of the Japanese and Indian scientists gave positive results. As far back as in
the 70s of the last century the developed countries started the design of pilot OTEC
stations representing complicated large-size structures with installed capacity of
several ten to several hundred megawatts.
The main units of the OTEC are an evaporator to produce steam of working ﬂuid by
means of heat exchange with seawater, a turbine for the drive of an electric generator, a
condenser for spent steam, and pumps for pumping sea water and cold air. The large
speciﬁc dimensions (per unit generated capacity) are caused by low efﬁciency of the
thermodynamic cycle of the OTEC station (the Rankine cycle). For this reason, the
OTEC station consumes huge amounts of warm and cold waters of the order of several
thousand cubic meters per second. Thus, the ﬂoating OTEC with a capacity of 40 MW
should have 70thousand tons displacement, cold water pipeline diameter of 10 m, and
a working surface of the heat exchanger of about 45 thousand m2.
In the last few years, projects of an OTEC with relatively small capacity have been
developed in which already commercially available main units (turbines, electric
generators, evaporators, condensers, and pumps), placed in a 20 foot (6.1 m) con-
tainer that can be delivered to any required place, can be used. The installation that
falls within these clearance limits can provide a capacity of 300–350 kW.
Recent discovery of hydrothermal sources on the ocean ﬂoor (with temperatures
up to +350°) gave rise to the idea of building underwater OTEC stations harnessing
134

the temperature difference between the sources and surrounding waters. A much
greater temperature difference between hot water near geysers on the ocean ﬂoor
and remaining water masses will provide much higher efﬁciency of the thermal
station. However, extreme exploitation conditions of such OTEC stations can bring
to nothing this advantage.
Recently, the US Company Makai Ocean Engineering built in Hawaii the
world’s largest facility of this kind, capable of generating electricity from tem-
perature differences. It is planned that the plant will provide power about 120 kW
nearby households. Its simpliﬁed diagram is showed in Fig. 5.26.
In the majority of regions of the Arctic Ocean the average long-term winter
(November–March) air temperature does not exceed 26 °C. Warmer freshwater dis-
charge of large rivers (such as Yenisei, Lena, and Ob’) heats seawater under ice to
+3 °C. Electric power stations harnessing this energy can operate by the conventional
scheme based on the closed cycle with working liquid boiling at a low temperature.
Large positive experience has been accumulated on harnessing of low-potential heat
by the heat pump scheme. The scheme is simple—seawater is heated to the temperature
required for heating of hot water supply systems. For example, in Sweden Baltic
seawater with temperature of +4 °C is heatedto 75 °C using heat pumps and is thenused
for home heating. This appears more proﬁtable than to use black oil or gas for heating.
5.8.3
Osmotic Energy
The idea of generating electric power taking advantage of the osmosis phenomenon
(slow penetration (diffusion) of a solvent into a solution through a thin membrane

impenetrable for dissolved substances) well known in chemistry and biophysics
was proposed 50 years ago. As applied to generation of the osmotic energy, the
case in point is penetration of fresh river water from one half of a reservoir into
another ﬁlled with sea water through a translucent membrane. As a result, in this
half of the reservoir the pressure is created that can be equivalent to that of the water
column 100–120 m high, Fig. 5.27.
The potential of the energy source of this type is 1600–1700 TWh/year. Power
engineers are interested in this energy source due to its renewability, ecological

purity, and sufﬁciently high stability of power characteristics (only insigniﬁcant
seasonal variations are observed). For a long time it was impossible to implement
commercially this idea, since the manufactured membranes were too thick and did
not provide necessary osmosis rate and hence, efﬁciency of electric power gener-
ation. The world’s ﬁrst osmosis power plant (OPP), built by the Statkraft, a
Norwegian electricity company, was put in operation with ﬁnancial support of the
state and some other companies only in November, 2009. The station with a
capacity of only 5 kW is located 60 km from Oslo in the mouth of a river running
into the North Sea and is in essence a pilot station intended to elaborate technical
solutions to build a commercial power station within several years. The cost of the
project including a study of the possibilities of osmosis application for electric
power generation and building of a prototype was about 27 million dollars.
The main problem here remains the manufacture of very thin (<0.1 lm) com-
mercial membranes which would provide power density at a level  5 W/m2. The
membranes for desalinization of seawater provide a power density of  1 W/m2.
The largest companies-manufacturers of the membranes (General Electric,
Hydranautics, and Today Industries) can start manufacture of the membranes for
the OPP no earlier than in 2015–2020.
In conclusion, to this chapter, it is necessary to underline that when solving the
problem on expedient volumes of URPS harnessing, a multilateral approach is
required in which the following factors should be taken into account:
(1) URPS technical and economic potentials in the given country and its regional
distribution;
(2) Economic, ecological, and social efﬁciencies of power supply using NRES of
various kinds which, in turn, are determined by such characteristics, as the cost
of mineral fuel, average annual URPS power production, remoteness from the
centralized power supply system, state of the road network, requirements of
consumers to the quality of both electric and thermal energies, reliability and
cost of NRES stations, etc. These characteristics should be evaluated in each
concrete case.
(3) Technical feasibility of the project of URPS power supply.
The attitude to the NRES was radically revised in the West in the mid-70s
primarily due to the adoption of a complex of regulatory legal acts that provided the
legal, economic, and organizational bases for its subsequent development.
The URPS power engineering was supported (and is continued to be supported) by
both legislative and executive branches of governments. This is especially urgent in
the stage of its promotion, formation, and adaptation in the power market.
Despite more than 30-year experience of state regulation and the progress made
in this branch of economy, the advanced countries do not weaken and, on the
contrary, strengthen their attention to NRES improving stimulation and support
mechanisms. The effective ﬁnancial and economic mechanisms of stimulation of
NRES development in a number of countries are green certiﬁcates. They conﬁrm
the fact of generation of this or that amount of energy using deﬁnite NRES. The
5.8
Other Renewable Energy Sources for Electricity Production
137
www.ebook3000.com

green certiﬁcates are produced by special bodies (one for each country), and their
number corresponds to the amount of electric energy produced using URPS.
Moreover, organizations that failed to comply with their obligations on URPS
energy generation can report for their fulﬁllment by purchasing green certiﬁcates
from organizations that produced excessive amount of URPS energy. The primary
goal of the green certiﬁcates is to get additional source of ﬁnancing for the
development of ecologically clean power technologies.
The active state participation in the development of renewable power is also
characteristic for many developing countries. Direct administrative regulation and
economic stimuli are also used. In fact, in China, India, and some other countries
funding is moved from the sphere of traditional power (mainly coal) to the NRES
sphere. The development of renewable power, ﬁrst of all independent, could
become a solution to the problem of power supply in the poorest countries that do
not have a modern power infrastructure—the developed network of the centralized
power supply. However, they have no money to purchase sufﬁcient quantity of the
corresponding equipment.
The experience accumulated by the EU countries, the USA, Japan, etc.
demonstrates that the problem of URPS harnessing can be solved only with active
participation of private investors. To involve investors in business that does not
bring fast proﬁts, it is necessary to use the whole mechanism of stimulation created
and approved by the countries—leaders within the last 30–35 years. Today the
most effective mechanism of URPS project implementation is the private-state
partnership. Business should solve the following problems:
• To estimate commercial attractiveness of projects,
• To provide marketable competitive production,
• To form the investment policy to organize mass production of the equipment
and to create the RE infrastructure.
Table 5.16 gives the dynamics of global consumption of various renewable
energy sources, including large hydropower ones. (According to the scenario
developed by the European Council on the issue of renewable energy sources on the
data basis of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.)
Based on the data presented in Table 5.17, renewable energy future is quite
optimistic.

6.1
Main Stages in the Development of Power
Transmission Systems in the XXth and
in the First Part of the XXIst Century
The initial stages in the development of power transmission systems were discussed
in Chap. 2. Here we brieﬂy describe the steps of further development of these
systems in the XXth century and in the ﬁrst decade of the XXIst century and
organizational problems appearing in this process.
All countries now have a power system which transports electrical energy from
generators to consumers. In some countries several separate systems can exist, but
the growth in size of power plants and higher voltage equipment was accompanied
by interconnections of the generating facilities. These interconnections decreased
the probability of service interruptions, made utilization of the most economical
units possible, and decreased the total reserve capacity required to meet
equipment-forced outages. This integrated system (often known as the “grid”) has
become dominant in most areas and is usually considered as a major factor in the
well-being and level of economic activity in a country. All systems are based on
alternating current, usually at a frequency of either 50 or 60 Hz. (50 Hz is used in
Europe, Asia (partly), India, Africa and Australia, and 60 Hz is used in North and
South America and parts of Japan.)
This was accompanied by use of sophisticated analysis tools such as the network
analyzer. Central control of the interconnected systems was introduced for reasons
of economy and safety. The advent of the load dispatcher heralded the dawn of
power systems engineering, an exciting area that strives to provide the best system
to meet the load requirements reliably, safely, and economically, utilizing
state-of-the-art computer facilities.
Already since 1901–1905 three-phase electric power stations, which at the
beginning were predominantly stations of plant-factory type, have been built.

Three-phase engineering allows large electric power stations to be built in places
of fuel extraction, at waterfalls, or on a suitable river and to deliver generated
electric power through transmission lines to industrial regions and cities. Such
electric power stations were called regional. They provided the basis for the
development of electric power engineering in the 20th century.
The ﬁrst regional electric power station was the Niagara hydroelectric power
station. Regional electric power stations have been built intensively from the
beginning of the 20th century. This was promoted by an increase in the current
consumption connected with increasing industrial applications of the electric driver,
the development of the electrical transport, and electrical illumination of cities.
Electric power stations became large industrial enterprises that produced electric
power; different stations were integrated, and ﬁrst electric power systems were
formed. By the electric power system, we mean a set of electric power stations,
transmission lines, substations, and central heating systems having the common
operation mode and uninterrupted process of production and distribution of elec-
trical and heat energy.
It was elucidated that joint operation decreased the power reserve at each station,
the equipment could be repaired without switching off the main consumers, and
conditions arose for equalization of the production load of the main stations to
increase the efﬁciency of utilization of power resources.
The subsequent consolidation of electric companies enabled economies of scale
such as capital cost of generating facilities, the introduction of equipment stan-
dardization, and utilization of the load diversity between areas.
Extra high voltage (EHV) has become dominant in electric power transmission
over great distances, Fig. 6.1.
The major ac transmission systems in chronological order of their installations
are shown in Fig. 6.2.
The power transfer capability is approximately P = V2/Z1, which for an over-
head ac system leads to the following results:

The appearance of two AC OTL of different voltage classes of single-circuit and
double-circuit design is shown in Figs. 6.3 and 6.4. Today, transmission voltages of
230 (220), 287, 345 (330), 500, 735 (750), and 765 kV are commonplace, with the
ﬁrst 1100 (1150)-kV line already energized in the early 1990s. (In parentheses are
the nominal OTL voltages, adopted in Europe, including Russia.) The trend is
motivated by economy of scale due to higher transmission capacities, more efﬁcient
use of right-of-way, lower transmission losses, and reduced environmental impact.
The two main requirements to transmission systems: (a) the interconnection of
stations and neighboring systems to provide security, economic operation and the
exchange of energy on a buy–sell basis, and (b) the transport of electrical energy
from remote generation to load centers are met by selection of the most economical
overhead line design, commensurate with the various constraints imposed by
environmental and national considerations. The design and approval process for
new lines can take many years; following public enquiries and judicial proceedings
before planning, permission is ranted and line construction begins. Typical objec-
tions to new overhead lines, particularly in industrialized countries, are:
• visual deterioration of open country areas,
• possibility that electromagnetic ﬁeld propagation may cause interference with
television, radio, and telecommunications and with an increasing awareness of
• public health issues,
• emission of noise by corona discharges, particularly at deteriorating conductor
• surfaces, joints, and insulation surfaces,
• the danger to low-ﬂying aircraft,
• a
preference
for

supply,

as

and
local
environment-friendly power generating plants including solar cells and wind
power turbines, or measures for reducing electric energy demand, such as the
better thermal insulation in houses and commercial premises, lower energy
lighting, natural ventilation in place of air conditioning, and even changes of
lifestyle. Power system planners are required to show that extensive studies
using a range of scenarios and sensitivities have been carried out, and that the
most economical and least environmentally damaging design has been chosen.
Impact statements are also required in many countries to address the concerns
regarding many issues raised by local groups, planning authorities, and others.
Technically, the key issues, which have to be decided are:
• whether to use an overhead line or an underground cable,
• the siting of substations and their size required to contain the necessary
equipment for control of voltage and power ﬂow,
• provision for future expansion, for an increase in demand, and in particular for
the likelihood of tee-off connections to new load centers,
• the availability of services and access to substation sites, including secure,
144

Energy Transmission and Distribution

• communications for control and monitoring,
• whether to use a three-phase lines that are duplicated on one tower or
mixed-voltage systems on a single tower [1].
Due to the rapid growth of the power grids and increasing requirements of
consumers to the electricity quality energy management is improving. Energy
management is the process of monitoring, coordinating, and controlling the gen-
eration, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy. The physical plant to be
managed includes generating plants that produce energy fed through transformers
to the high-voltage transmission network (grid), interconnecting generating plants,
and load centers. Transmission lines terminate at substations that perform switch-
ing, voltage transformation, measurement, and control [2, 3].
The creation of United Electrical Power System (UEPS) in the USSR and others
developed countries went in the following way:

Further development (increase of scales) and perfection (improvement of qual-
ity) of systems of transportation and distribution of the electric energy depend on
solving a number of problems:
• Planning of the perspective development of the EPS grid subsystem under
conditions of highly uncertain initial conditions;
• Necessity of creation of high-power energy bridges caused by very large no
uniformity of distribution of electric energy manufacturers and consumers in a
particular country and on the global scale;
• Creation of steady-state grid subsystems in countries with high proportion of
alternative electric energy sources integrated into the traditional power supply
system;
• Spatial restrictions on building of transmission lines in cities and densely
populated regions;
• Creation of electric interconnections of power supply systems with different
nominal frequencies;
• Solution of complex scientiﬁc and technical problems associated with creation
of active-adaptive electric grids and development and application of satellite
information-measuring systems;

relatively small enterprises operating in a common grid, application of hybrid
schemes of electric power and heat generation (cogeneration), compatibility of
energy and production technologies with complete utilization of wastes and sec-
ondary resources, and formation of interconnected power systems. Known advan-
tages of parallel operation of power plants led to intensive development of electric
networks (grids) of higher voltage classes, expansion and consolidation of the
electric power systems, and formation of large, geographically extensive, including
interstate, power systems [4]. Positive experience on the creation and operation of
large interconnected power systems in Western Europe, North America, the former
USSR, and Eastern European countries has been accumulated.
There are all prerequisites for the development of the electric power engineering
of the world economy in this direction.
The tendency observed in the past few decades, namely, formation of large
national and international interconnected power systems is of particular importance.
An important role in the formation of united power system in the Eurasian continent
the is played by Russia having large fuel and energy resources and the largest in the
world centralized interconnected power system called United Power Grid of Russia
(UPGR)—Joint-Stock Company.
Before the formation of independent states from the USSR, there were three large
interconnected power systems on the European continent: the UCPTE including 12
countries of Western Europe (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Greece, Italy,
Yugoslavia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, and Portugal), the
NORDEL System including four countries of Northern Europe (Norway, Denmark,
Finland, and Sweden), and the Mir Power System including countries-members of the
former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Asynchronously with the UCPTE,
the Great Britain Power System operated through a dc cable.
The installed capability of electric power stations included in the UCPTE
amounted to more than 390 million kW; it amounted to 85 million kW for the
NORDEL System and to more than 400 million kW for the Mir Power System. The
Mir Power System was connected to the UCPTE through three DC inserts having net
capability of 1750 MW and with the NORDEL by a dc insert having a capability of
1100 MW. Power systems of Eastern European countries and the UPG of the former
USSR were connected by three 750-kV overhead transmission lines (OTL), four
400-kV OTL, and four 220-kV OTL to deliver electric power from the USSR to
Eastern European countries. The energy supply amounted to *40 billion kWh in
separate years.
The integration processes in the UCPTE and NORDEL System are intensiﬁed. In
1994, a dc cable line between Switzerland and Germany having a length of about
250 km and capability of 600 MW was put into service. Two projects of connecting
the Norway Power Grid to the continental Europe are being considered. The ﬁrst
project is aimed at interconnection of Norway and Germany power systems, and the
second project is aimed at interconnection of Norway and Holland power systems.
The feasibility of building an interconnecting dc transmission line between Sweden
and Poland was justiﬁed. The feasibility of connecting Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
power systems to the NORDEL System and UCPTE will be examined further.
148

Energy Transmission and Distribution

In 1994, the electric power exchange in the UPCTE, including the third coun-
tries, amounted to 155.9 billion kWh or 10% of the net electric power generated by
UCPTE countries, and the corresponding exchange in the NORDEL System
amounted to 39.3 billion kWh or 11.2%.
In the Mir System, disintegration processes started just after disintegration of the
USSR, and the mutually advantageous electric power exchange inside the system
signiﬁcantly reduced. In October 1995, the CENTREL interconnected power sys-
tem including Hungary, Czech, Slovakia, and Poland interconnected power systems
and the interconnected power system of the eastern part of Germany joined the
UCPTE. The installed capability of the extended UCPTE amounted to more than
470 million kW. The integration of Bulgaria and Romania power systems to the
UCPTE is also planned. At the end of September—beginning of October 1995, the
Bulgaria power system was disconnected from the Ukraine UPG and was switched
to synchronous operation with Romania, Greece, Albania, and the former Soviet
Federal Republic Yugoslavia power systems. This experiment was considered as a
step toward connection of power systems of Southern European countries to the
UCPTE. Turkey is the next candidate for connection to the UCPTE. The feasibility
of interconnection of the Turkey power system with power systems of countries of
the Mashreq economic zone (from Syria to Egypt) is studied. After commissioning
a deep-sea ac cable connecting Spain and Morocco, power systems of Morocco,
Algeria, Tunis, and Libya (countries of the Maghreb zone) joined the UCPTE. The
feasibility of interconnection of power systems of Mashreq and Maghreb countries
is studied. Thus, a large interconnected power system of countries of the
Mediterranean Sea basin is being built. This interconnected power system will
operate in parallel with the UCPTE. It is also planned to study the feasibility of joint
operation of the Turkey power system with power systems of Trans-Caucasian
republics including Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.
At the same time, the UPGR continues to operate synchronously with power
systems of Baltic countries, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Moldova, and Kazakhstan.
Power systems of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia have retained the feasibility of
synchronous operation with the UPGR.
Under these conditions, a central problem in cooperation of countries of the
European continent in the ﬁeld of electric power engineering has become the use of
already existing 11 OTL connecting the Commonwealth Independent States
(CIS) and Eastern European countries in the building of which large sums of money
were invested. Different ways of further development of this cooperation are sug-
gested. One of the variants envisages the transfer of dc inserts to the boundaries of
CIS and Eastern European countries.
The best way of cooperation on the Eurasian continent is the creation of a
common electric power market as a basis for an interconnected power system.
A number of international projects are aimed at solving this problem.
Baltic Electric Power Generating Ring. This project is aimed at creating a
high-power grid connecting power systems of 11 Baltic countries including
Denmark,
Sweden,
Norway,
Finland,
Russia,
Estonia,
Latvia,
Lithuania,
Byelorussia, Poland, and Germany, Fig. 6.7. Another project of the East–West

Power Bridge envisages the building of a 4000-MW dc transmission line con-
necting power systems of Russia, Byelorussia, Poland, and Germany and is con-
ceptually a part of the ﬁrst project.
It is assumed that the Baltic Ring will allow the operation of power systems of
participating countries to be improved and as a whole, will foster the economic
development of Baltic countries.
A meeting of 17 electric power-generating companies from 11 countries of this
region devoted to the creation of the Baltic Electric Power Generating Ring was
held.
It should be noted that positive experience on cooperation of the UPGR with the
NORDEL System has already been accumulated. Work is underway on an increase
in the capability of the dc insert with Finland up to 1400 and then to 2000 MW. The
feasibility of connection of the Karelian and Kola power systems with power
systems of countries included in the NORDEL is being studied.
Black Sea Interconnected Power System. The majority of countries involved in
the Black Sea Economic Community (BSEC) including Ukraine, Romania, and
Bulgaria supported the proposal of the JSC UPGR to create the BSEC United
Power Grid. Its formation is aimed at interconnection of regional power systems
into the high-power grids; some of them already exist. Such an interconnected
power system will allow BSEC countries to develop electric power engineering in

the entire region in the best way, to use rationally the available power resources, to
increase reliability of electric power supply to customers, to exchange electric
power to mutual advantage, and to affect positively the economic development of
all countries in the region. High-voltage grids built by countries-members of the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will provide the basis for the intercon-
nected power system, including 400- and 750-kV power grids connecting Russia,
Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Romania in the southwest, 330- and 500-kV
power grids connecting Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan in the southeast,
and 220-kV OTL connecting Trans-Caucasian countries and Turkey.
Other projects of interconnected power systems. Variants of the connection of
power systems of Central Asia and Iran and Turkey are being considered, and
problems of integration of interconnected power systems of Russia and China,
Japan, and Korea as well as Russia and USA are being studied.
Electric power engineering of China develops rapidly; the annual increment of
electric power generation amounts to 7–9%. The net annual electric power gener-
ation in China exceeds 900 billion kWh. China is interested in the electric power
transfer from Russia. Potential sources of electric power for export are located in
Siberia (Boguchansk, Bratsk, and Ust-Ilim HPS and Berezovskii State District
Power Station (SDPS)) and Far East (an APS in Khabarovsk Region, HPS and TPS
in the Amur Region and Yakutia, and a tidal power station in the south of the
Okhotsk Sea). 500-kV ac OTL with dc inserts having a dc carrying capacity of 1.5–
2 million kW can be used to transfer electric power. In the East interconnected
power systems, Amur, Khabarovsk, and Far East power systems are considered as
transmitting one. OTL at voltages up to 500 kV inclusively can be used to export
electric power.
The main premises for electric power import by Japan consist in the absence of
its own fuel and energy resources and extremely high population density.
Sakhalin TPS burning a shelf gas or South-Sakhalin coal, HPS and APS of the Far
Eastern Interconnected Power System, and a tidal power station in the south of the
Okhotsk Sea can be considered as potential sources to export electric power from
Russia to Japan. For this aim, transmission lines can be built through Sakhalin
Island and two shallow and narrow channels (Tatarskii and Laperuza) or through
the territories of China and Korea and the Korean Channel 200 km wide.
With allowance for long transmission lines, the electric power transfer to the
USA is planned in small amount if the main expenses on building of the OTL
through the Bering channel and mastering the hard-to-reach coastal zone of this
channel will be covered by the headquarters of building of transcontinental railway
through the Bering channel.
The implementation of the above-considered international projects as well as of
the suggested variants of interconnected power systems will allow the Japan–
China–Siberia–Kazakhstan–European part of Russia–Western Europe powerful
extended electric power system to be formed and will be an important stage in the
creation of the Interconnected Power System on the Eurasian continent with the net
electric power of the order of 60% of the electric power of all power stations in the

world in which the UPGR, by virtue of its geopolitical position, can become a
central link.
The required transfer capability of intersystem connections can be estimated
based on the practical recommendations of the UPG of the former USSR according
to which the net transfer capability of intersystem connection in cross sections
dividing the powerful interconnected power system into two parts should be of the
order of 2–3% of the maximum load of the smaller part of the examined inter-
connected power system. With allowance for this condition, the required transfer
capability of intersystem connections for the Eurasian Interconnected Power
System in the territory of Russia and Kazakhstan should exceed 10 GW. Such
transfer capability can be obtained only with the use of the super-high voltage
(1150 kV of ac and 1500 kV of dc) transmission lines.
The North American transmission system is interconnected into a large power
grid known as the North American Power Systems Interconnection. The grid is
divided into several pools. The pools consist of several neighboring utilities, which
operate jointly to schedule generation in a cost-effective manner. A privately reg-
ulated organization called the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC)
is responsible for maintaining system standards and reliability. NERC works
cooperatively with every provider and distributor of power to ensure reliability.
NERC coordinates its efforts with FERC as well as other organizations such as the
Edison Electric Institute. Figure 6.8 shows a diagram of high-voltage transmission
lines of the United States.

NERC currently has four distinct electrically separated areas. These areas are the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Western States Coordination
Council (WSCC), the Eastern Interconnect, which includes all the states and pro-
vinces of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains (excluding Texas), and
Hydro-Quebec. These electrically separate areas exchange with each other but are
not synchronized electrically.
The electric power industry in the US is undergoing fundamental changes since
the deregulation of the telecommunication, gas, and other industries. The generation
business is rapidly becoming market-driven. The power industry was, until the last
decade, characterized by larger, vertically integrated entities. The advent of open
transmission access has resulted in wholesale and retail markets.
Trends in the development of electric power systems of the USA united at the
state, interstate levels formed in the second half of the XXth century acquired
clear-cut temporal, and territorial guidelines to which the world electric power
engineering adheres in the new century.
Nowadays interstate electric energy associations operate in the Western and
Central Europe (Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity—
UCTE), Northern Europe (NORDEL), North America, CIS countries, and so on.
The EPS integration and formation of large electric energy associations are
underway in Asia, Africa, and Southern and Central America.
The Trance-European Synchronously Interconnected System (TESIS) is formed
by Trans-European Western, Central, and South-Eastern European countries.
Further development of this electric energy association can proceed in collaboration
with CIS electric energy association (established in 1992) based on intensiﬁcation
of interconnections on alternating current and construction of electricity transmis-
sion lines on direct current within the limits of widely discussed complex projects
“Baltic Ring,” “Direct Current Energy Bridge,” and “East–West.” Analogous way
of development of high-power electric grids is characteristic for energy associations
of North America.
Energy association of the countries of Central Asia (Southern Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan) continues to work suc-
cessfully. In future intensiﬁcation of its interconnections with the United Energy
System (UES) of Russia and Southern countries is expected. India intensively
develops electric power engineering and is in the way of creation of the national
energy association and development of its integration with neighboring countries.
Interstate energy association is formed on the Indochina peninsula.
One of the promising regions from the viewpoint of creation and development of
interstate energy associations is Northeast Asia including Eastern Siberia and Far
East of Russia, Mongolia, China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan. For this,
there are essential prerequisites associated with different territorial deployment of

energy resources and centers of energy consumption as well as with essential
potential system effects caused by the formation of interstate energy associations.
The infrastructure of the main electrical grid in this region is also developed.
Russia is interested in the formation of united energetic and energy transport
infrastructure in adjacent regions of Europe and Asia, in the development of
international energy transmission systems including electric grids. For these pur-
poses, the state encourages participation of the Russian joint-stock companies and
ﬁrms in working out and implementation of large-scale international projects on the
creation of electric energy associations “Baltic Ring,” “United Energy System of
Caspian and Black Sea Countries” and energy bridges “East–West,” “Siberia–
China,” “Sakhalin–Hokkaido,” etc., Figs. 6.9 and 6.10.
For several years, experts in energy and politics have been considering various
versions for creating the Asian Energy Super Ring.

Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex
6.3.1
Provision of Uninterrupted Electric Grids
The uninterrupted electric power supply of consumers by qualitative electric power
is determined by the reliable work of the energy system that requires a successful
solution of problems listed in Sect. 6.1.
Their solution must provide:
• required (standard) margin of static stability of the transmitted power in normal
and post emergency regimes;
• required (standard) margin of static stability on the voltage of load units of the
grid;
• heat resistance of grid elements (lines, transformers, switches, etc.) in normal
and post emergency regimes;
• voltage levels admissible for the equipment of a power supply system;
• necessary operative margin of power to maintain the development of the
competitive market of electric energy and power;
• decrease in electric power losses during energy transmission;
• maintenance of high-quality electric power.

The parameter reliability includes such EPS properties as survivability,
non-failure operation, durability, repair ability, stability, and controllability of the
regime [5].
Reliability has special deﬁnitions, which differ from the usual planning or
operating usage. A relay can misoperate in two ways: it can fail to operate when it is
required to do so, or it can operate when it is not required or desirable to do so. To
cover both situations, there are two components in deﬁnition reliability:
Dependability—which refers to the certainty that a relay will respond correctly
for all faults for which it is designed and applied to operate;
Security—which is the measure that a relay will not operate incorrectly in case
of any fault.
Most relays and relay schemes are designed to be dependable since the system
itself is robust enough to withstand an incorrect trip out (loss of security), whereas a
failure to trip (loss of dependability) can be catastrophic regarding system perfor-
mance [6].
Continuous increase in capacity and the expansion of territories served, as well
as the emergence of new technologies for the production, transmission, and dis-
tribution of electricity increase demands on the reliability of the protection of the
electric transmission lines. Each electrical element will have problems unique to
itself, but the concepts of reliability, selectivity, local and remote backup, zones of
protection, coordination and speed that may be present in the protection of one or
more other electrical apparatus are all present in the considerations surrounding
transmission line protection.
Since grids are also the links to adjacent lines or connected equipment, their
protection must be compatible with the protection of all of these other elements.
This requires coordination of settings, operating times, and characteristics.
The purpose of electric power system protection is to detect faults or abnormal
operating conditions and to initiate corrective action. Relays must be able to evaluate a
wide variety of parameters to establish that corrective action is required. Obviously, a
relay cannot prevent the fault. Its primary purpose is to detect the fault and take the
suitable action to minimize the damage to the equipment or the system. The most
commonparameters, which reﬂect the presence of a fault, are the voltages and currents
at the terminals of the protected apparatus or the appropriate zone boundaries. The
fundamental problem in electric power system protection is to deﬁne the quantities
that can differentiate between normal and abnormal conditions. This problem is
compounded by the fact that ‘‘normal’’ in the present sense means outside the zone of
protection. This aspect, which is of the greatest signiﬁcance in designing a secure
relaying system, dominates the design of all protection systems [7].
Improvement of electric power system parameters of the developed countries
also involved such elements, as supports and wires of overhead transmission lines
(OTL). Works are underway on construction and putting into practice of OTL
towers and aesthetic supports. The towers allow long spans to be designed for
crossing water, woody, and boggy areas. In this case, the height of the overhead
phase conductor exceeds 40 m, and the total height of the design reaches 60 m. The
aesthetic supports should be graceful, aerial, and ﬁt harmoniously into the
156
6
Energy Transmission and Distribution

surrounding landscape as independent design objects adapted as much as possible
to aesthetics of the environment from near and far observation points.
Creation of new wires is intended to meet increasing requirements—high
mechanical strength, thermal stability, and low ohmic resistance.
In the last quarter of the 20th century (up to now), increase is observed of the
share of underground distribution transmission lines (UDTL). All-underground
construction—widely used for decades in cities—now appears in more places.
UDTL is much more hidden from view than OTL, and is more reliable. Cables,
connectors, and installation equipment have advanced considerably making UDTL
not so expensive. One of the main applications of UDTL is underground residential
distribution and underground branches or loops supplying residential neighbor-
hoods. The use of underground construction is beneﬁt for mounting substation exits
and creating systems for serving industrial or commercial customers, for crossing
river, highway, or OTL.
Underground construction is expensive, and costs vary widely (from 25 to 1000
doll/m). The main factors that inﬂuence UDTL costs are:
(1) Degree of development—roads, driveways, sidewalks, and underground utili-
ties; these and other obstacles slow down construction and increase costs;
(2) Soil condition—rocks and frozen ground increases time and cost of cabling.
(3) Nature of the terrain on which the cable will be laid: urban construction is more
difﬁcult not only because of concrete, but also because of trafﬁc; rural con-
struction is generally the least expensive per length, but also lengths, as a rule,
are much larger.

Transmission cable lines are especially attractive for overcoming the big water
obstacles (sees, big lakes and straits).
The choice of ways of solving the problem controllability of EPS is based on
results of studying information about such properties of EPS: observability, pre-
dictability, and identiﬁability. Theory of transient processes and EPS stability has
been developed and continues to be improved based of general theory of dynamic
systems.
To provide reliability and efﬁciency of functioning of EPS and electric power
market within the limits of the preset reliability level, preservation and strength-
ening of the centralized hierarchical system of real-time dispatch control and
automated systems of dispatch EPS monitoring that have been developed in many
countries (the USA, the USSR, Germany, France and some others) by the end of the
last century have special importance.
It should be emphasized that the unconditional fulﬁllment of dispatch discipline
have assumed great importance in connection with the accelerated development of a
distributed (decentralized) energy sector.

It becomes more and more obvious that in the nearest future traditional
approaches to the development of electric power grids will not meet new require-
ments on reliability, quality, and efﬁciency of electric power supply. A radical
solution of these problems is provided by the new concept of EPS transformation
into intellectual systems according to concept “Smart Grid” (see Sect. 6.3).
6.3.2
Minimization of Electric Power Transmission Losses
Electric power is different from other products in that it is transported at the expense
of spending part of the product itself and, therefore, power loss is inevitable. In this
regard, only a fraction of the electric power, which does not arrive to the consumer
from the producer, can be attributed to the “net loss” or “real loss”. The other part
reasonably is called “technological power consumption for transmission
through electric grids.” Below, for brevity, all the electricity not supplied to the
consumer, is called “losses” (Fig. 6.11).
In electric grids of electric power and electriﬁcation enterprises with voltage of
220 kV and lower, the electric power losses make 78% of the total losses, including
28% in 110–220 kV grids, 16% in 35 kV grids, and 34% in 0.38–10 kV grids.
The electric power losses independent of loading (conditionally constant losses)
make 24.7%, and the loading losses (dependent on the electric power transmitted
through the grid) make 75.3% of the total losses. The loading losses involve 86% of
Fig. 6.11 The structure of electricity losses on the transmission stages and distribution
158

Energy Transmission and Distribution

losses in power transmission lines (PTL) and 14% of losses in transformers. The
conditionally constant electric power losses involve 67% for idling transformers,
11% for internal needs of substations, and 22% for other losses.
The level of electricity losses during transportation in different countries lies in a
wide range—from 4.6 to 16.6%, Table 6.2.
According to international experts, an amount of electricity losses during
transmission and distribution can be reduced to an economically justiﬁed and
technically achievable value—4–5% (a value close to the limit determined by
physical laws). The potential for reducing losses in the grids (real today) exceeds
20% of the total losses.
The reduction of excessive power losses in grids in addition to limiting the
growth in electricity tariffs can be an important source of investment (along with
other sources) into the electric power systems for a radical improvement of their
technical condition.
The study of the dynamics and structure of the electricity losses have revealed a
number of important conformities:
1. The transition from centralized (state) to market mechanisms of energy man-
agement is accompanied by an increase in electricity losses in grids. The effect
was observed not only in the Russian electric power system during and after the
1998–2008 reform, but in other countries that went to the privatization and
decentralization of this sector. The main reason—the weakening of the
institutional/executive and technological discipline.
2. The relative power losses in the grids the lower, the higher is the share of
industrial consumption in the productive supply.
3. Inclusion of the loss ratios in tariff for electricity transmission leads to a dan-
gerous trend ﬁt these standards under the actual losses.
Each of this conformity includes dozens of items.
The set of measures to reduce technical losses of electric energy in an enlarged
form is shown in Fig. 6.12.

Reduction of power losses in grids is a difﬁcult complex problem. The problem
solution depends on information, methodical, mathematical, logistical and organi-
zational support.
Numerous and diverse technical/technological and organizational measures to
reduce the losses of energy in grid can be represented in the form of 4 groups:
(1) energy-saving solutions in the construction, reconstruction and development of
electricity networks, putting into operation energy-saving equipment;
(2) optimization of circuit topology and regime parameters in operation and
operational management of electricity networks;
(3) improvement of calculations of loss ratios, power balances feeders, power
centers, and electric networks in general;
(4) training and motivation of staff to reduce losses, control of its efﬁciency,
improving the organization of work.

Energy Transmission and Distribution

Problems of energy losses in electrical networks considered in textbook in detail
in [8]. Here we conﬁne ourselves only brief remarks regarding the reduction of
losses of electricity in transport and the maintenance of its standard quality by
reactive power compensation.
The most simple, but difﬁcult feasible way to reduce electricity losses during
transmission is reduction of electric resistance of conductors and/or the current
density.
There are several ways to reduce the resistance of a wire:
1. To use for an electricity supply all the line (Not advisable to have a backup line);
2. To reduce the resistance of the lines and the extent of the increase in
cross-section of cable and overhead lines, as well as to use conductors with a
lower speciﬁc resistivity;
3. To design a network with a minimum of contact connections, and to perform a
junction of the cable cores and conductors with the use of special clamps and
couplings to ensure minimum contact resistance.
6.3.2.1
Increasing the Power Factor
Increasing the power factor today is the more widespread and effective method of
energy loss decrease during transmits. Power factor is the ratio of the effective
power in kilowatts to the apparent power in kilovolt-amperes (cosu). The latter is a
geometric sum of the active power that performs active work due to the use of
energy and the reactive power (RP) that provides magnetic and electric ﬁelds in
electrical equipment and power exchange between them necessary for a number of
power consumers.
By means of the choice of an economically viable cross section of conductors
(wires) and reactive current compensation (equalization of its inductive and
capacitive components), it is possible to increase the power factor (in the limit to
one) and to reduce the voltage drop in the transmission line and power losses
(Table 6.3).
The voltage drop and power loss in the conductors are determined by the total
current, comprising the active and reactive components, and are given by the
formula

Get DP ¼ P2r0=ð3U2 cos2 uÞ, that is, with an increase in the power factor, losses
in the power lines decrease. This also reduces the voltage drop, since it is inversely
proportional to the power factor. Thus, it is expedient to pass only to the energy
corresponding to the resistive load of the consumer.
Full power is calculated as a geometric sum of active and reactive powers. It
determines the total power requirements for generating, grid, and distribution
structures—all network equipment (generators, transformers, transmission lines,
distribution systems, etc.) have to rely on the power, signiﬁcantly exceeding the
useful (active power). Energy companies face additional costs for equipment and
additional energy losses, forcing them to charge customers an additional fee in
cases where the proportion of reactive power exceeds a certain threshold value.
Usually, as the threshold value, cosu is chosen not less than 0.9. In practice,
cosu after reactive power compensation is in the range 0.93–0.99. In the aspect of
reducing the losses of energy in the lines, it is desirable fully compensate for the
reactive power, but this cannot be realized, because the implementation of such a
solution requires the installation of special compensating devices with costly RP
regulation.
For each node of the power system the so-called technical condition of reactive
power compensation must be carried out, namely RP balance at any node of grid,
breach of which varies the voltage at this node. From the viewpoint of maintaining
the necessary voltage mode by the consumers, it is unacceptable deﬁcit of RP.
In addition to technical speciﬁcations, there are technical and economic condi-
tions that reduce the ﬂows of RP, which lies in the fact that in the RP is com-
pensated directly by consumers:
(1) reducing the current transmission network elements, allowing to reduce the
cross-section of wires:

plants.
Industrial companies feeding power system set the economic value of reactive
power Qe, it may refer to the period of peak grid load. Knowing the reactive load
Qent. of an enterprise or its maximum load Pmax, it is possible to determine the
capacity of compensating devices Qcd. to be installed on industrial enterprise:
Qcd: ¼ Qent:  Qe ¼ Pmaxðtanguent:  tangueÞ
ð6:3Þ
where tang uent—the actual ratio of the reactive load of the enterprise; tang ue is the
reactive load factor corresponding to Qe.
6.3.2.2
Regulation of RP in Power Systems
In power systems, RP sources are used in the grids of 110 kV and above for the
following tasks:
• reduction of active power losses and power energy,
• load voltage regulation in the nodes,
• increase in the capacity of electric power,
• increase in the stock of the static stability of electric power transmission lines
and generators of power stations,
• increase of the dynamic stability of power transmissions,
• surge suppressor,
• balancing mode.
Employed in the device of targeting RP balance (RP sources) are divided into two
radically different groups: (1) synchronous machines (power generators, compen-
sators, motors), and (2) static RP sources or static reactive power compensators
(capacitor banks, reactor—based transducer device (rectiﬁers, inverters) with artiﬁ-
cially switched thyristors or combinations thereof). The main parameter of RP source
regulation is the voltage at the point of its connection or reactive power load; to
regulate for reactive power load, RP source or a combination of both can be used.
Sources of RP of the ﬁrst group allow ﬂuently adjust the RP in regime of
generation and consumption (in terms of “production” and “consumption” of the
RP there is a certain conventionality, but in doing so, is emphasized that the
6.3

interaction of capacitive and inductive elements in the grid has compensating
character).
Sources of RP of the second group allow one to regulate the RP only stepwise.
For their switching in networks with voltage up to 1 kV, conventional contactors
are used, in networks with voltage greater than 6 kV, circuit breakers or thyristor
keys are used.
RP consuming by reactors can be controlled both stepwise using the same
method as for capacitors and switching equipment and ﬂuently using thyristors.
Special group includes the swinging reactors capable to change of ﬂuently con-
sumption of RP parametrically (without regulator) depending on a voltage applied
at the connection point.
For RP compensation, improving the manageability of the modes large electric
power systems use modern means of regulation reactive power compensation:
block of static compensators (BSC), static thyristor compensators (STC), shunt
reactor (SR), controlled shunt reactor (CSR), automated control system (ACS),
static compensator (STATCOM), Fig. 6.13, and vacuum-reactor groups (VRG).
Creating these efﬁcient devices and circuits for their switch on was made pos-
sible due to the rapid development of power electronics in the last decades.
As an example, in Fig. 6.14 is shown the scheme of parallel compensation based
on capacitors and a thyristor-controlled reactor: (a) circuit and (b) current and
voltage waveforms [9].

Combined use of capacitors and a reactor with thyristor control permits smooth
regulation of the reactive power, whether it is capacitive or inductive. Note that
switches S1–4 turn on the capacitors at zero voltage. For the thyristor compensator,
the range of reactive—power regulation is

where C and L are the total capacitance in the line and the reactor inductance,
respectively; W is the angular frequency of the grid; and U the effective grid
voltage. This device is not only fast, but also reliable.
Various versions of the device are currently in use. An alternative to series
thyristors is the biased reactor. Its beneﬁt is that only low power is required to
control the bias current. This is usually a low-voltage, low current device. It also
permits modiﬁcation of the compensating power by regulating the inductance.
Two main circuits are used for series capacitor compensation based on thyris-
tors, Fig. 6.15.

First, the capacitive sections are shunted by antiparallel thyristors in series,
Fig. 6.15a. To eliminate malfunctioning of the semiconducting switches under the
action of the capacitors discharge currents, these devices are switched on when the
voltage in the corresponding capacitor section passes through zero. Second, the
capacitors and reactors are connected in series with antiparallel thyristors,
Fig. 6.15b. The reactor operates analogously in the system with parallel compen-
sation. The current is regulated by phase control of the thyristors. Depending on the
thyristor control angle, the reactors compensate the series capacitance in the line. In
the absence of capacitor compensation, the reactors are switched on to shunt the
capacitors and are switched off in total compensation.
Additional expenditures for the means of regulated compensation in the back-
bone network (compared to uncontrolled) are justiﬁed not only by reducing the loss
of energy. Their use can be justiﬁed when the additional positive effect is reached—
an increase in the stability of the power and stability of the load, as well as increase
of the power quality in the network.
6.3.2.3
Regulation of RP in the Power Supply Systems with Nonlinear
Load
In industrial power supply systems, RP sources are used to compensate for the RP
consumed by sharply variable powerful load balancing. To do this, the RP sources
are used that can generate it—synchronous machines and capacitor banks.
However, the former, allowing one smoothly adjust the RP; have a high inertia due
to the time constant of the excitation system, which is a disadvantage. On the
contrary, the capacitor battery (CB), especially switched thyristors, have a high
speed (10–20 ms) with a stepped regulating PM. In those cases (for example,
providing static of power stability) when the step regulation is unacceptable, a
combination of RP sources is used, which enables one to smoothly adjust the PM at
high speed. They usually consist of a stepwise adjustable CB and smoothly con-
trolled reactor connected in parallel.
In power supply systems with nonlinear (non-sinusoidal) load generating har-
monic currents, RP sources can function as ﬁlter-compensating devices.
To reduce the consumption of power by the RP, it is advisable to carry out
activities that do not require installation of special compensating devices, as in the
Fig. 6.15 Series capacitive compensation: a the thyristor-switched capacitors and b the
thyristor-controlled circuit
166

Energy Transmission and Distribution

production of reactive energy, where compensation devices consumed active
energy efﬁciently. These activities include:
(1) increasing the download process units and keeping it as constant as possible
over time, which is accompanied by an increase in the load factor of electric
motors and cosu, while reducing up to 40% the power consumed by asyn-
chronous motor; supply voltage reduction of switching windings of a star with a
triangle reduces engine power by 3 times;
(2) use of thyristor voltage regulators motor to control signals from the sensor cosu
and other technical regimes of electric motors and transformers;
(3) replacement, rearrangement, and disconnection transformers downloaded on
average by less than 30% of their rated power. Particular attention should be
given to the automation of two-transformer substations: when the load of
transformers is reduced below 35%, they must be switched off for this period
without affecting the automatic transfer switch;
(4) replacement of low-loaded engines by engines by engines of smaller capacity;
(5) replacement of induction motors and their synchronous application in all new
installations of the drive where it is acceptable for technical and economic
reasons;
(6) automatic control of excitation of synchronous motors and if necessary—
switch-capacitor banks.
Means for cosu adjustment are most effective if they are used in close proximity
to the load. Since cosu may vary over time due to changes in the characteristics and
composition of the equipment, its adjustment must be performed at regular intervals
from 3 to 10 years (depending on the nature of the enterprise, parameters, and
modes of operation of the equipment).
6.3.2.4
Decrease of Energy Losses in Transformers
Energy losses in transformers are divided into two main types—conditional per-
manent loss or “iron losses” (i.e. in the core) and load losses or “copper losses” (i.e.
in the windings). The “iron losses” are proportional to U2 and about 0.2–0.5% of
the rated power of the transformer. They can be reduced due to a decrease of the
thickness of the electrical steel sheets and using higher quality steel. “Copper
losses”—the omics losses proportional to I2 are about 3.1% of the rated power of
the transformer (when fully loaded).
The following ways are used to increase the efﬁciency of the transformer
substations:
• if the power consumed by the load is less than 40–50% of the nominal (Pn), the
energy-saving measures are advisable to disable one or more transformers and
thereby to bring the load to other optimal values;
• if the power consumption of the load exceeds 75% Pn, then the efﬁciency of
transformers can only be optimized by the installation of additional capacity;
6.3
Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex
167
www.ebook3000.com

overcapacity creates conditions for uninterrupted operation in the event of
failure of one or more transformers;
• modernization of the transformer substations or only replacement of worn-out
transformers is preferred to installation of transformers with low loss level,
which allows them to be reduced by 20–60%; in this case, the payback period,
as a rule, is only about a year.
Improvement of the parameters and modes of operation of transformers in
addition to reducing the “iron losses” and “copper losses” is also focused on
ensuring the efﬁciency of the network by maintaining appropriate quality electricity
supplied to consumers, and regulation of load voltage.
6.3.3
Power Quality
Production processes largely depend on the quality of electric power. In general, the
low quality of electricity can be described as changes in power supply, leading to
disruptions of the production process or damage to electrical equipment. According
to some experts, over the next 20 years the quality of power supply will be the
biggest problem in the power industry, translated into most sectors of the economy.
The basis for achieving a high quality of electricity are three components: pro-
duction of high-quality electricity, uninterrupted transmission, and distribution of
reliable networks [10].
The damage caused by non-compliance with regulatory requirements for power
quality parameters can be subdivided into two parts: technological and electro-
magnetic components.
Technological component damage manifested in the reduction of electrical
performance and manufacturing process that may increase the energy consumption
due to the increase in the duration of the process or a mass marriage of products,
reduce the efﬁciency of the equipment, etc. On energy, efﬁciency primarily affects
technological component damage. Accordingly, as the level of energy efﬁciency
associated with the power quality can be accepted optimal power mode, providing
maintenance of a particular group power quality index at an acceptable level.
Determining the number of them depends on the sensitivity to them of speciﬁc
consumers.
Electromagnetic component damage is associated with reduced life of power
equipment in connection with its accelerated wear, with an increase in the mea-
surement error of the instrument electrical quantities and metering of electricity,
with the failure of automation systems, relay protection, a shutdown or failure of the
capacitor system as a result of resonance phenomena at higher harmonics, with
increased levels of power and energy losses, etc.
It is clear that there can be completely different deﬁnitions for power quality,
depending on frame of reference. For example, an energy company may deﬁne
power quality as reliability and show statistics demonstrating that its system is
168
6
Energy Transmission and Distribution

99.98% reliable. Criteria established by regulatory agencies are usually in this vein.
A manufacturer of mains powered equipment may deﬁne power quality as those
characteristics of the power supply that enable the equipment to work properly.
These characteristics can be very different for different criteria.
Power quality is ultimately a consumer-driven issue, and the end user’s point of
reference takes precedence. Therefore, the following deﬁnition of a power quality
problem is used in this textbook: any power problem manifested through deviations
of voltage, current, or frequency that results in failure or misoperation of customer
equipment.
Power quality, like quality of other goods and services, is difﬁcult to quantify.
Here is no single accepted deﬁnition of quality of electricity. There are standards for
voltage and other technical criteria that may be measured, but the ultimate measure
of power quality is determined by the productivity of end-user equipment. If the
electric power is inadequate for those needs, this means that the “quality” is lacking.
Energy companies and end users of electric power are becoming increasingly
concerned about the quality of electric power. The term power quality has become
one of the most often used words in the power industry since the late 1980s.
There are four major reasons for the increased concern:
1. The increasing emphasis on overall power system efﬁciency has resulted in
continued growth in the application of devices such as adjustable-speed motor
drives and shunt capacitor for power factor correction to reduce losses. This is
resulting in increasing harmonic levels on power systems.
2. The equipment of consumers with microprocessor-based control devices and
power electronic devices is more sensitive to power quality variations than
equipment used in the past.
3. End users have an increased awareness of power quality issues. Utility cus-
tomers are becoming better informed about such issues as interruptions, sags,
and switching transients. As a rule, they demands from suppliers’ improvement
of the quality of delivered energy.
4. Many components are now interconnected in a network. Integration processes
mean that the failure of any component has much more important consequences.
The common thread running through all these reasons for increased concern
about the quality of electric power is the continued push for increasing productivity
for all utility customers. Manufacturers want more productive and more efﬁcient
machinery. Energy companies encourage this effort because it helps their customers
become more proﬁtable and helps defer large investments in substations and gen-
eration by using more efﬁcient load equipment. Interestingly, the equipment
installed to increase the productivity is also often the equipment that suffers the
most from common power disruptions. In addition, the equipment is sometimes the
source of additional power quality problems. When entire processes are automated,
the efﬁcient operation of machines and their control becomes increasingly depen-
dent on power quality. The engineers are now attempting to deal with these issues
using a system approach rather than handling them as individual problems.
6.3
Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex

Some discoveries that have had an impact on electric power quality have been
done during the last decades:
1. Throughout the world, many governments have revised their laws regulating
electric utilities with the intent of achieving more cost-competitive sources of
electric energy. Deregulation of utilities has complicated the power quality
problem. In many countries, there is no longer tightly coordinated control of the
power from generation through end-use load. While regulatory agencies can
change the laws regarding the ﬂow of money, the physical laws of power ﬂow
cannot be altered. In order to avoid deterioration of the quality of power sup-
plied to customers, regulators must expand their thinking beyond traditional
reliability indices and address the need for power quality reporting and incen-
tives for the transmission and distribution companies.
2. During last decades interest increases in distributed generation (DG), that is,
generation of power dispersed throughout the power system. There are a number
of important power quality issues that must be addressed as part of the overall
interconnection evaluation for DG [11].
3. Solving power quality problem facilitated the creation in recent decades of new
types of high-power electronic devices. New electronic devices not only elim-
inate those problems, but also permit the development of equipment that
improves power-transmission systems.
Based on power electronic technology we can, for example, control the mag-
nitude and sign of the reactive power and hence the power factor cosu; improve
the harmonic composition of currents and voltages; stabilize at speciﬁed points
of the line; and ensure symmetry of the load currents and voltages in three-phase
systems. (More information can be found, for example, in [9].)
4. Globalization of industry has heightened awareness of deﬁciencies in power
quality around the world. Companies building factories in new areas are sud-
denly faced with unanticipated problems with the electricity supply due to
weaker systems or a different climate.
5. Key ﬁgures have been developed to help with evaluation of power quality in
various
aspects.
Regulatory
agencies
have
become
involved
in
performance-based ratemaking, which addresses a particular aspect, reliability,
which is associated with interruptions. Some customers have established con-
tracts with energy companies for meeting a certain quality of power delivery.
As was mentioned above, the energy companies and customers often have very
different points of view. While both tend to blame about two-thirds of the events on
natural phenomena (e.g., lightning), customers, much more frequently than per-
sonnel of energy companies, think that energy companies is at fault. When there is a
power problem with a piece of equipment, end users may be quick to complain to
the energy company. However, the energy company records may indicate no
abnormal events on the feed to the customer. It must be realized that there are many
events resulting in end-user problems that never show up in the energy company
170

Energy Transmission and Distribution

statistics. Transient overvoltage is most often the cause of disruption of power
supply of consumers.
In addition, there are also power quality problems that may be related to hard-
ware, software, or control system malfunctions. Electronic components can degrade
over time due to repeated transient voltages and eventually fail due to a relatively
low magnitude event. Thus, it is sometimes difﬁcult to associate a failure with a
speciﬁc cause. It is becoming more common that designers of control software for
microprocessor-based equipment have an incomplete knowledge of how power
systems operate and do not anticipate all types of malfunction events. Thus, a
device can misbehave because of a deﬁciency in the embedded software.
In response to this growing concern for power quality, energy companies have
programs that help them respond to customer concerns. The philosophy of these
programs ranges from reactive, where energy companies responds to customer
complaints, to proactive, where the energy companies are involved in educating the
customer and promoting services that can help develop solutions to power quality
problems. Since power quality problems often involve interactions between the
supply system and the customer facility and equipment, regulators should make
sure that distribution companies have incentives to work with customers and help
customers solve these problems.
It is not always economical to eliminate power quality variations on the supply
side. In many cases, the optimal solution to a problem may be replacement of a
particular piece of very sensitive equipment to an equipment less sensitive to
electricity quality variations. The level of electricity quality required is that level
which will result in proper operation of the equipment at a particular facility.
Any signiﬁcant deviation in the waveform, magnitude, frequency, or purity is a
potential power quality problem. Of course, there is always a close relationship
between voltage and current in any practical power system. Although the generators
may provide a near-perfect sine-wave voltage, the current passing through the
impedance of the system can cause a variety of disturbances to the voltage.
The ultimate reason that we are interested in power quality is economic value.
There are economic impacts on energy companies, their customers, and suppliers of
load equipment. The quality of power can have a direct economic impact on many
industrial consumers. There has recently been a great emphasis on revitalizing
industry with more automation and equipment that is more modern. This usually
means electronically controlled, energy-efﬁcient equipment that is often much more
sensitive to deviations in the supply voltage than were its electromechanical pre-
decessors. Thus, industrial customers are now more acutely aware of minor dis-
turbances in the power system. There is big money associated with these
disturbances.
The electric utility is concerned about power quality issues as well.
Meeting customer expectations and maintaining customer conﬁdence are strong
motivators for energy companies. With today’s movement toward deregulation and
competition between energy companies, they are more important than ever. The
loss of a disgruntled customer to a competing power supplier can have a very
signiﬁcant impact ﬁnancially on an energy company. Besides the obvious ﬁnancial
6.3
Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex
171
www.ebook3000.com

impacts on both utilities and industrial customers, there are numerous indirect and
intangible costs associated with power quality problems. Residential customers
typically do not suffer direct ﬁnancial loss or the inability to earn income because of
most power quality problems, but they can be a potent force when they perceive
that the energy company is providing poor service. Home computer usage has
increased considerably in the last few years and more transactions are being done
over the Internet. Users become more sensitive to interruptions when they are
reliant on this technology. The great number of complaints require energy com-
panies to provide stafﬁng to handle them. In addition, public interest groups fre-
quently intervene with public service commissions, requiring the energy companies
to expend ﬁnancial resources on lawyers, consultants, studies, and the like to
counter the intervention.
Many manufacturers of energy consuming equipment are also unaware of the
types of disturbances that can occur on power systems. The primary responsibility
for correcting inadequacies in load equipment ultimately lies with the end user who
must purchase and operate it. Speciﬁcations must include power performance cri-
teria. The useful service that energy companies can provide is dissemination of
information on power quality and the requirements of load equipment properly
operate [12].
6.3.4
Electromagnetic Compatibility
The problem of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is closely related with
problem of power quality; very often, they are being considered together.
For example, in Russia power quality standards established by all-Union State
Standard (GOST 13109-97 “Power quality limits in the supply systems”), are the
levels of electromagnetic compatibility of power supply systems and electric grids
of electricity consumers. Under electromagnetic compatibility the ability of devices
and equipment of energy consumers and all elements of electrical networks is
understood to function under conditions of exposure to electric and magnetic ﬁelds
and do not cause harmful interference to each other and to other objects.
In other words, EMC is achieved when equipment and systems operate satis-
factorily in the presence of electromagnetic disturbances. For example, the electrical
noise generated by motor-driven household appliances, if not properly controlled,
can cause interference to domestic radio and TV broadcast reception. The EMC
affects the quality of life, operational reliability, and safety of life, where
safety-related systems are present.
The electromagnetic environment in which a system operates may comprise a
large number of different disturbance types, emanating from a wide range of
sources including:
172
6
Energy Transmission and Distribution

• mains transients due to switching,
• radio frequency ﬁelds of radio transmitters,
• electrostatic discharges from human body charging,
• surges, dips, and interruption of power supply in electrical network,
• magnetic ﬁelds from electrical networks and power—frequency transformers.
In addition to adequate immunity to all these disturbances, equipment and
systems should not adversely add electromagnetic energy to the environment above
the level of interference-free radio communication and reception.
Among sources are electromechanical switches, commutator motors, high-power
semiconductor devices, digital logic circuits, and radio frequency generators.
The electromagnetic disturbances can propagate to the receivers through this
path, in particular, this is case for a radio receiver, which contains a semiconductor
device that responds to the disturbance and causes unwanted response, i.e.,
interference.
For many equipment and systems, EMC requirements now are an integral part of
the overall technical performance speciﬁcation. All apparatus placed on the market
or taken into service must be immune to electromagnetic presented in the envi-
ronment and must generate its own disturbance no greater than that permitting
interference-free radio communication.
The EMC Directives currently in force in all developed countries refers to
relevant standards which themselves deﬁne the appropriate immunity levels and
emission limits. The path by which electromagnetic disturbance propagates from
source to receiver comprises one or more of the following, Fig. 6.16:
Fig. 6.16 Coupling
mechanisms for
electromagnetic disturbance
6.3
Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex
173

• conduction,
• capacitive or inductive coupling,
• radiation.
Conduction coupling is observed where there is a galvanic link between the two
circuits, and dominates at low frequencies where the conductor impedances are low.
Capacitance and inductive coupling takes place between reasonably long
colocation parallel cable runs. Radiation dominates where conductor dimensions
are comparable with a wavelength at the frequency of interest, and efﬁcient radi-
ation is observed.
Designers and installers of electrical and electronic equipment need to be aware
that all three coupling methods exist so that the equipment can be properly con-
ﬁgured for compatibility. Analogue circuits respond adversely to unwanted signals
in the order of millivolts. For malfunction of digital circuits, only a few hundred
millivolts is usually sufﬁcient. When high levels of transient disturbance in the
order of several kilovolts are present in the environment good design is critical for
compatibility.
To demonstrate how difﬁcult is to solve the problem of electromagnetic com-
patibility of electric power source with its consumers, we now consider methods of
protection against electromagnetic disturbances of one of the most sensitive devices
—Printed Circuit Board (PCB.)
The ﬁeld strength is higher for shorter distances and higher frequencies (shorter
wavelengths).
There are four main methods for ensuring satisfactory EMC:
• shielding,
• cable screes terminations,
• PCB design and layout,
• grounding.
The preferred and most cost-effective approach to the achievement of EMC is to
incorporate control measures into the design. At the beginning of the design stage,
attention should be given to the basic principles of the EMC control to be applied in
the design and construction of the product. The overall EMC design parameters can
be determined directly or from the EMC standards, either as part of the delivery
speciﬁcation or as part of the legal requirements for market entry.
Two options for EMC control—shielding and ﬁltering and board level control
are shown in Fig. 6.17a, b.
For shielding and ﬁlter solution, all external cables are or unscreened leads
connected via a ﬁlter. The basic principle is to provide a clear—cut barrier between
the inner surface of the shield facing the emissions from the PCBs and the outer
surface of the shield interacting with the external environment. This solution
requires utilization of a metal or metal-coated enclosure. If this is not possible, the
board level control alternative is appropriate, where the PCB design and layout
provide inherent barriers to electromagnetic energy transfer. Filters are required at
all the cable interfaces, except where an effective screened interface can be used.
174

Energy Transmission and Distribution

Emissions from the PCB tracks can be reduced at high frequencies if the devices
have slow switching rates and slow transition (i.e. long rise and fall) times.
Choice of the device can also improve immunity by means of bandwidth control.
The smaller the bandwidth, the less likely it is that high-frequency disturbances will
appear within the passband of the circuit. Although rectiﬁcation of the disturbance
Fig. 6.17 Options for EMC control (PCB here is printed circuit board))
6.3
Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex
175
www.ebook3000.com

can proceed in the out-of-band region, the conversion process is more inefﬁcient
and higher immunity usually results.
The tracks on PCBs can act as antennas and the control methods should reduce
their efﬁciency. The following methods can be used to good effect:
• reduce the area of all track loops,
• minimize the length of all high-frequency signal paths,
• terminate lines in resistors equal to the characteristic impedance,
• ensure that the signal return track is adjacent to the signal track,
• remove the minimum amount of copper on the board, i.e. maximize the surface
area of the 0 V (zero-volt ground) and VCC (Voltage at the Common Collector)
planes.
The latter two items are generally used where a multilayer board conﬁguration is
employed. These measures are highly effective; they reduce board emissions and
improve circuit immunity to external disturbances. Multilayer boards are sometimes
considered relatively expensive, but the extra cost is compared with the total costs
of other measures that may be required with single or double-sided boards, such as
shielding, ﬁltering, and additional development and production costs.
Grounding is the method whereby signal returns are controlled, and it should
not be confused with earthling aimed at protection from electrical hazards.
Grounding is important at both the PCB level and circuit interconnection level.
The three main schemes of grounding are:
• series ground,
• single-point ground,
• multi-point ground.
The ideal scheme is the multipoint ground. Generally, single-point grounding is
used to separate digital, analogue and power circuits. Multipoint grounding is used
whenever possible within each category of analogue or digital circuit. Some series
ground techniques may be employed where the coupled noise levels can be
admitted.
Typically, the overall optimal solution is obtained from good basic design and
successive experimentation.
Test methods for electromagnetic compatibility of equipment are regulated by
international or national standards. For example, the EU countries used three types
of EMC standards:
• basic standards,
• product-speciﬁc standards,
• generic standards.
Basic standards comprise the test methods and test levels at limits, but do not
specify a product type.
176
6
Energy Transmission and Distribution

Product standards comprise comprehensive details on how the product should
be conﬁgured and operated during the test and what parameters should be
controlled.
Generic standards are used in the absence of a product standard and concern all
products, which may be operated within a deﬁned environment. Both product and
generic standards refer to basic standards for their test methods [13].
The problem of electromagnetic compatibility in modern world is so complex
and actual that scientists in all developed countries deal with it, publishing a large
number of original articles, reviews, monographs and textbooks. The state experts
regulate the levels of electromagnetic interference suggest and measures to limit
their impact. For example, in Russia more than 15 State Standards (GOST) address
this problem. Comprehensive information on the problem of electromagnetic
compatibility may be found, for example, in [14].
6.4
A Look at the Future Development of Power
Transmission Systems
Below we consider three main areas for further development of the transport system
of electrical energy: (1) development of micro-grids, intended primarily to serve the
independent sources and independent consumers of electric power, (2) improve-
ment or radical transformation of the powerful lines of a three-phase AC trans-
mission, (3) expanding the scope and applications of DC transmission in the “big”
power industry. Scientists and experts continue to search for radically new ways to
transfer large ﬂows of energy, but they have not yet come to power, which are
required in the “big” power industry. One can talk about the laboratory stage of
their development and application (microwave transmission, transmission using the
ﬂuxes of charged particles on the vacuum-processed paths, etc.).
6.4.1
Micro-grids
An increased portion of distributed generation stimulates creation of micro-grids
(MG) often—called virtual power stations since they are, in fact, program packages
for control over electricity demand and the distributed energy sources that allow the
operator to model them as electricity resources. The MG allow the electric power
companies to control over considerable number of consumers with large volume of
energy consumption (energy capacity), inﬂuencing a set of their options concerning
commercial operations. In this respect, the application of the MG provides a closer
interaction of retail markets via the control over the system of the main transmission
lines and the distribution system that form a bilateral electricity and money streams
6.3
Technical Problems of the Electric Grid Complex
177

that provides deeply integrated system of optimization of everything that is nec-
essary for efﬁcient control over complex Smart Grids.
For consumers making decisions concerning the use of services of power sup-
plying organizations and guided by the efﬁciency and utility criteria, creation of
MG is a natural stage of creating conditions for the development of their own
generating and accumulating capacities, ﬁrst, non-polluting energy sources based
on nontraditional renewable energy sources. The development of the MG, inte-
grated both into a grid and the electric power and capacity market, will promote the
increased role of the consumer in control over the power supply system.
By analogy with the central grid, the MG can generate, distribute, and regulate
the electricity to the consumers. Intellectual MG include local sources of backup
power supply and energy accumulation, are more ﬂexible, and allow wider range of
generating energy sources to be connected, including electric power stations har-
nessing wind, solar, and other energy types using URPS those integration repre-
sents a problem for the central electric power system.
The MG will be integral parts of the national electric power system: they are
connected with regional grids and through them with the national electric grid.
Electric power generation by small-distributed generators becomes economically
expedient if there is a system support in the form of the main connection line. The
electric power from micro-grids will be delivered to consumers and back into the
regional grid depending on the supply and demand conditions. Real time moni-
toring and regulation will provide information exchange and will allow all supplies
to be fulﬁlled on the national level. In this case, consumers can correct the elec-
tricity supply according to their requirements. Energy consuming devices inside
residential buildings and factories are connected with a micro grid via systems of
gauges and regulators.
In the last few years, great attention has been given to the development of micro
grids of four basic types (designations):
(1) Remote MG isolated from the uniﬁed electric power grid and intended for
power supply to remote consumers (settlement, military bases, or individual
consumers);
(2) Micro grids of enterprises/campuses with individual owner;
(3) Commercial/industrial micro grids with several owners;
(4) Micro grids of municipalities and electric power supplying companies inter-
connected with larger microstructural objects.
Micro grids of the ﬁrst type are, in essence, hybrid power complexes. Their
distinctive feature (except the ﬁrst type) is the ability to be disconnected from the
grid belonging to a power supplying company in the case of voltage dip or failure.
By 2015, about 2000 MG with total capacity more than 3.1 GW have been
created. In 2010, their number was less than 100 MG. In the process of MG
exploitation, contradictions appeared between the electric power suppliers and
consumers on problems of possession and control. Search is underway of ways of
their elimination [15].

Strong Grid on the Basis of Flexible Alternative
Current Transmission Systems
Fast growth of distributed electric power engineering, ﬁrst of all renewable (8%
annually), in the developed countries with energy shortage necessitated essential
changes in electric power engineering and comprehension of advantages of inte-
gration of local power systems on the state and interstate levels based on uniﬁed
administrative and information technology, i.e. on construction of Smart Grid.
Many developing countries with severely limited economic potential should
choose from two variants or their combination:
• The ﬁrst variant more simple for implementation envisages overcoming the
technological gap by modernization of existing grids and their transformation
into the Strong Grid with large throughput and increased reliability.
• The second variant, more difﬁcult and expensive, envisages implementation of
the Smart Grid concept providing complete automation of the process of electric
power transmission and distribution and radical change of the principles of
interaction of the grid and generating companies with consumers. In this case,
the principle of succession and technological compatibility should be one of the
key principles: the modernized equipment of electric power companies must be
matched with new technologies and integrated into a new electric power system.
Among problems of transformation of existing (traditional) electric grids, the
important place is occupied by high-power electronics, automatic control, and
protection systems of new generation for solving problem of full observation and
control of Uniﬁed Energy System (UES) electric regimes in real time. This should
essentially increase controllability and efﬁciency of UES and provide an increase in
the reliability of electrical supply of consumers to 0.9990. Wide introduction of
Flexible Alternative Current Transmission System (FACTS) and perfection of
complexes for automatic emergency protection and operator control is provided.
The FACTS comprises alternating current transmission systems equipped with
modern high-power electronic devices. The FACTS technology transforms the

Energy Transmission and Distribution

Nowadays the FACTS devices, as a rule, are taken to mean a set of devices of an
electric grid intended for stabilization of voltage, increase of controllability, opti-
mization of distribution of energy ﬂow, decrease in losses, damping of
low-frequency ﬂuctuations, increase of static and dynamic stability, and as a result,
increase in the grid throughput and decrease in losses. The essential role in all
variety of FACTS devices is played by high-power electronics based on various
modiﬁcations of voltage converters using controllable semiconductor valves. Wide
introduction of easily adjusted or self-adjusted innovative elements of high-power
electronics and new generation of converter equipment, the latest technologies in
the ﬁeld of high-temperature superconductivity (cables and storage devices), and
microprocessor systems of automatic control and regulation (yet on the limited
scales) allow new qualities to be given to already existing grids.
The Strong Grid concept based on the FACTS technology possesses important
advantages: (a) introduction of modern equipment and means in already existing grids
allows large expenses for construction of lines with high throughput to be avoided,
(b) the technology admits (and even envisages) gradual (step-by-step) expansion of
allowable power limits of transmission lines in the process of investments where
required and when necessary. It allows to provide in advance the progressive scenario
of sharing of mechanical switchboards and gradually entered controllers FACTS so
that to reach an object in view by stage-by-stage investment. In the conditions of
ﬁnancial restrictions, it is a solid argument in favor of Strong Grid. Gradual innovative
technical and technological transformation of EPS, and corresponding updating of
basic principles and the purposes and problems of development of electric power
engineering will transform Strong Grid in Smart Grid.
6.4.3
Smart Grid
According to the concept of Smart Grid, the future power system is considered as
an infrastructure similar to the Internet intended for maintenance of power, infor-
mation, economic and ﬁnancial relations between all participants of the power
market and other interested parties. Smart Grid is the concept of innovative

transformation of electric power engineering as a whole rather than of its individual
functional or technological segments based on revision of the existing basic prin-
ciples, purposes, problems in the development of electric power engineering and
scales following from it, and character of problems to be solved considering pre-
dicted social, economic, scientiﬁc, technical, ecological, and other consequences of
their implementation [4, 16, 17].
For example, in the USA such program has the national status and is implemented
with direct support of the country leaders. In the EU countries, the Smart Grid
Technological Platform European Power System of the Future was organized still in
2004 for coordination of works and elaboration of uniform strategy of the develop-
ment of electric power engineering. Its ultimate goal is elaboration and implemen-
tation of the program for developing the European Power System until 2020 and later.
The main ideologists of working out of the concept were the USA and the EU
countries; it was subsequently recognized and developed practically in all large
industrially developed and dynamically developing countries that invest consider-
able money for its implementation: China—70, the USA—19, India—10, the EU
countries—7.0, Great Britain—3.0, Austria—1.0, Canada—0.5, and South Korea
—0.3 billion of US dollars.
Smart Grid represents an integral automated mechanism uniting manufacturers
of the electric power, electric grids, and consumers. This mechanism is controlled
by a computer center which collects data on electric power consumption level from
millions digital controllers in real time. Specialized software helps to trace the
operating regime of all participants of the process of electric energy generation,
transmission, and consumption. Table 6.5 shows the basic connection technologies
according to Smart Grid concept.
The main advantage of the Smart Grid is that it automatically responds to
changes in various parameters in the power supply system and allows uninterrupted
electrical supply with maximum economic efﬁciency. In this case, the inﬂuence of
the human factor in the Smart Grid operation is reduced to a minimum.

Energy Transmission and Distribution

In fact, the Smart Grid is a combination of possibilities of information tech-
nologies that already became habitual in many spheres of industrial activity with
high-power electronics and electrical power engineering.
Within the limits of the Smart Grid concept a variety of requirements of all
interested parties (state, consumers, regulators, power companies, sales and
municipal institutions, proprietors, manufacturers of equipment, etc.) is reduced to a
group of the so-called key requirements (values) of the new electric power engi-
neering formulated as follows:
Availability—supply of consumers with energy without restrictions depending
on when and where it is necessary for them and on its paid amount;
Reliability—possibility of overcoming negative physical and information con-
sequences without total power switching-off or high expenses for operation
recovery, restoration (self-restoration) as fast as possible;
Proﬁtability—optimization of tariffs for electric energy for consumers;
Efﬁciency—maximization of the efﬁciency of utilization of resources of all
kinds, technologies, and equipment in the process of power generation, transmis-
sion, distribution, and consumption;
Friendliness to the environment—the maximum possible decrease of negative
ecological effect;
Safety—avoiding situations in electric power engineering dangerous to people
and environment.

The Smart Grid concept, leaning against the strategic vision of electric power
engineering in future, involves principles of construction of such grids and key
requirements to them from which functional properties (characteristic) also follow:
administrative, technological, standard, and informational.
Simpliﬁed diagram of the implementation of the concept Smart Grids is shown
in Fig. 6.18.
As already indicated above, only grids do not limit the Smart Grid concept—it
covers all links of the technological chain from electric power generation to its
consumption, Fig. 6.18.
It provides for each of them the achievement of the following purposes using the
corresponding means:
Generation—increase of the reliability and proﬁtability of electric power pro-
duction using modern highly intelligent control and management devices, including
Fig. 6.18 Priorities in the development of smart grids in the EU countries

Energy Transmission and Distribution

IT, integration of renewable energy sources, distributed generation and energy
storage devices;
Transmission electric grid—provision of reliability of electric power trans-
mission and electric grid controllability via large-scale monitoring of regimes and
control over them taking advantage of new means and technologies (FACTS,
Power Management Units (PMU), artiﬁcial intelligence, etc.) as well as via
increased use of pilotless ﬂying machines for control over technical PTL state as
scheduled (every 1.5 years) and off-scheduled (after each natural anomaly)
inspections;
Substations—maintenance of the reliability and controllability of substations at
the expense of modern electro technical equipment and automation based on
modern diagnostic tools, monitoring, and management using information and
computer technologies;
Distributive electric grid—increase of controllability and reliability by means of
application of distributed automatics and protection systems on modern micro-
processor basis using new information, computer, and Internet technologies;
Consumers—their supply with high-intellectual systems for monitoring and
accounting of the consumed electric power, regulation of power consumption and
management by loading, including emergencies.
Creation of an intellectual grid provides application of a large set of new
technical means and processing methods (Their list and characteristics can be found
in the special literature).
Attempt to provide a quantitative estimation of the effect from implementation of
the Smart Grid concept as of 2025 be undertaken in the USA, Table 6.7.
As of the end of 2010, there were 90 pilot projects of Smart Grid creation all
over the world. In the process of their implementation, it becomes obvious that the
Smart Grid concept carried out on the national stage undergoes considerable
changes caused by distinctions in regulation regimes, available infrastructure of
electric power systems, and national economic priorities. In the countries with
limited mineral and power resources, the strategy is largely focused on the creation
of favorable conditions for the development of renewable power sources, stimu-
lation of energy saving, and increase in the efﬁciency of consumption of power
resources.
For Russia with its large reserve of power resources, huge length of electric
grids, high degree of depreciation of the equipment, the problem of maintenance of
reliability and efﬁciency of the electric grid complex operation with limited
investments and deﬁciency of time occupies the ﬁrst place. The concept itself
envisages the creation of power supply systems with the combined grid—combi-
nation of Strong Grid and Smart Grid.
The scale of expected transformations in the process of future intellectualization
of electric power engineering is comparable with that of revolutionary changes in
communication and information spheres that have made a habitual reality the
Internet, mobile communication, and a number of other contemporary achievements
that unrecognizability changed everyday life.

6.4.4
Direct Current Transmission Lines
It is interesting to note that in the period of fast development of three-phase
high-voltage (up to 150 kW) transmission lines, M.O. Dolivo-Dobrovolskii, based
on technical-economic calculations, concluded that when power was transmitted at
a distance of a few hundred kilometers at voltage above 200 kV, it would be
expedient to generate and to distribute the alternating current and to transmit the
high-voltage direct current. The DC line at the beginning and end should be con-
nected to an inverter substations equipped with mercury rectiﬁers. He had come to
this conclusion not knowing at all such problem of high-power AC transmission
lines as stability.
Nowadays his prediction is justiﬁed, and in many countries, super-high-voltage
DC OTL lines operate successfully, Fig. 6.19. Although the bulk of the world’s
electric transmission is carried on AC systems, recent progress in high-voltage
direct current technology has enabled the development of large-scale DC trans-
mission by overhead lines and submarine cables, which have become economically
attractive in long-distance transmission of large bulk of power. Currently, numerous
installations with voltages up to 800-kV DC are in operation around the world.

Energy Transmission and Distribution

In 1954, the Swedish State Power Board energized the 60-mile, 100-kV DC
submarine cable utilizing U. Lamm’s mercury arc valves at the sending and
receiving ends of the world’s ﬁrst high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link con-
necting the Baltic island of Gotland and the Swedish mainland. Figure 6.20 shows
the external appearance of the experimental DC OTL of the highest class of 1500
kV, and in Fig. 6.21—the appearance of the operating DСOTL.
Currently, numerous installations with voltages up to 800 kV dc are in operation
around the world. Only in one decade (from 1987 to 1997), about 50 DC
high-voltage lines went into operation around world. The power of many DC
high-voltage lines is as much as 2000 MW, at voltages of 600 kV and above. By
2010, the total power transmission DC approached 40 GW. In Europe, to date, 24
DC OTL have been built and inserted with total capacity of 12.5 GW. Note that, in
DC-transmission, the power losses in the line are 20–30 times less than those in
AC-transmission. That is why the issue of energy losses in DC transmission lines in
Sect. 6.3.2 is not considered.
When using DC-links, one option is to introduce an array of voltage inverters on
the DC-side. A bank of capacitive batteries is attached to the DC-buses. As a result,
the actual DC-transmission line disappears. This short link is often known as a B2B
(back-to-back) system. Thus, in this case, there is practically no transmission line
due to localization of the converters. The routs of the DC cable lines in Europe are
shown in Fig. 6.22.
The development of dc power transmission systems is constrained by a number
of shortcomings speciﬁc to them:
• high price, limited overload capacity converters (rectiﬁers and inverters), and
switches (For example, circuit breakers HVDC are difﬁcult to manufacture,
since they require the presence of a built-in switch mechanism to reset the
current, or the arc will be formed and are accelerated wear contacts);
Fig. 6.19 Major DC transmission system in chronological order of their installations
6.4
A Look at the Future Development of Power Transmission Systems
187

• high price of high-voltage cables with a rather complex design necessary to
overcome the large water barriers (oceans, seas, and large lakes), Fig. 6.23.
• complexity of creating a control circuit used for switching on and off thyristors
of HVDC line; with small length of the HVDC line the losses in the converters
can be greater than in the AC power lines;
• Problems with the implementation of multi-terminal systems. Management of
power ﬂow in a multi-terminal DC system requires good switching devices
between all terminals.
As seen in Fig. 6.24, the cost of UHV DC line when the transmission range is
500–1200 km is close to the value of the UHV AC line. At a distance of about
2000 km, the cost of UHV DC line ±600 kV transmission capacity of 4000 MW is
already lower than the cost of UHV AC line by 1.4 times. The length of UHV DC

Energy Transmission and Distribution

line and UHV AC of equal value for the line 4000 MW ultra-high voltage is about
900 km and of the lines of 1000 MW—around 600 km.
Electric power transmission system using a direct current is becoming somewhat
simpler and less expensive when using short link often known as a B2B
(back-to-back) system. When using DC-links, one option is to introduce an array of
voltage inverters on the DC-side. A bank of capacitive batteries is attached to the
DC-buses. As a result, the actual DC transmission line disappears. Thus, in this
case, there is practically no transmission line due to localization of the converters.
In future, the pace of development of DC cable systems of power transmission
over long distances will largely depend on the success in the development of
industrial-scale high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) [18]. The complexity
and high cost of providing the liquid helium environment prevented commercial use
of the phenomenon of superconductivity at liquid-helium temperatures, which was
discovered in 1911.
The situation began to deteriorate drastically since the late nineties of the XXth
century. In late 1986, a ceramic material LaBaCuO was discovered to be supercon-
ducting at 35 K and in 1987; the material YBaCuO was found to have a critical
temperature of 92 K. Since that time, the critical temperatures of these HTS materials
have progressively increased to over 130 K. The enormous signiﬁcance of these
discoveries is that these materials will be superconducting in liquid nitrogen, which
has a boiling point of 77 K and is much easier and cheaper to provide than helium.

Much work has been directed towards ﬁnding materials with higher Tc values
but this has remained at 133 K for some time. However, considerable effort with
resulting success has been directed to the production of suitable HTS conductors.

The HTS material is very brittle and it is deposited using laser deposition onto a
suitable substrate tape.
The tape is 3 mm wide and cables of up to 600 m in length have been produced.
There are many trials being made of the application of the HTS cables
throughout the world including USA, Europe, and Japan. There are prototypes of
underground power cables, power transformers, large motors, and generators,
inductive energy storages (see Sect. 7.2.3) and others in active development and in
use.
Detroit is being re-equipped with HTS power cable for its transmission system
and copper cables weighing over 7 tons are being replaced with HTS cables of less
than 0.12 tons. The electricity supply of the city Geneva in Switzerland is com-
pletely provided by power transformers wound with HTS conductors. It is expected
that there will be deﬁnite power saving from the use of HTS.
In conclusion to Chap. 6, it must be emphasized that today great concern of
power engineers all over the world is not the transportation of electricity, but
provision by primary energy resources and the development of energy efﬁcient and
environmentally safe methods of converting them into electricity and heat.

Energy Accumulation (Store)
7.1
Systematization
At present, the electric power is the product that is compelled to be consumed during
manufacture. The use of energy storages (ES) provides division in time of the pro-
cesses of electric power generation and consumption and, as a consequence, [1]:
(1) Improves the maneuverability of the ES for load capacity and due to this
allows:
• to reduce capital investments in generating capacities (by about 30%),
• to reduce exploitation expenses for basic capacities,
• to reduce losses from intersystem overﬂows of excessive capacities during
periods of minimal loading;
(2) Improves the EPS technical and economic characteristics, helps to implement
the Smart Grid concept thanks to the following:
• provision of static and dynamic stability and hence, increase in the relia-
bility of EPS operation,
• maintenance of the voltage frequency and level and improvement of electric
power quality,
• increase of the throughput of intersystem connections.
Among the ES parameters that deﬁne their suitability for EPS are:
• maximum capacity,
• total power consumption,
• operating time,
• time of power reverse (change of “charging–discharging” and “discharging–
charging” regimes).
A typical scheme for connecting an electrical energy storage device to a grid is
shown in Fig. 7.1.

Owing to a wide variety of ES, it is expedient to classify them according to the
accumulated energy type:
1. Electric energy storages (EES) form a class of storages accumulating directly
electric energy. They possess the highest rate and the widest range of power
consumption. Thanks to these properties, they are suitable for increasing the
stability and reliability of EPS operation and alignment of loading schedule.
They are reliable in operation since they have no moving parts, are insensitive to
the connection place either in the centre of the load or directly at the consumer.
The EES involve:
1:1. Capacitor storages (CSs),
1:2. Electrochemical storages—storage batteries (SBs),
1:3. Superconducting inductive energy storages (SIESs).
2. Potential and kinetic energy storages:
2:1. Pumped storage power plants,
2:2. Air-compressor energy storages,
2:3. Inertial energy storages (ﬂywheels and super-ﬂywheels),
2:4. Electromechanical energy storages.

Electric Energy Storages
7.2.1
Capacitive Energy Storages
Capacitors are simple devices: two metal plates sandwiched around an insulating
dielectric. When charged to a given voltage, opposing charges ﬁll the plates on
either side of the dielectric. The strong attraction of the charges across the very
short distance separating them makes a tank of energy. Capacitors oppose changes
in voltage; it takes time to charge the plates, and once charged, it takes time to
discharge the voltage.

The most widespread capacitor storages of electric energy are conventional radio
engineering capacitors. However, as applied to electric power engineering, they
have the following main disadvantages: low working voltage, low speciﬁc stored
energy density and hence small (in comparison with other storage types) capaci-
tance, and a minor of energy storage that seldom exceeds several hours. It took
many years of research and development in the ﬁeld of manufacture of capacitors to
produce the capacitors that meet the requirements of electric power engineering in
the greatest possible measure. The developers succeeded in increasing the speciﬁc
capacitance of the capacitors by 108 times (several tens of farads per 1 cm3) and the
energy storage time by an order of magnitude (up to *100 h). The modular design
allows high-power capacitor batteries at several tens of kilovolts, several kilo
amperes, and power capacity 1011–1012 J to be developed. The block diagram of
the CSs based on a capacitor battery is shown in Fig. 7.2.
At present, the ﬁeld of applicability of the capacitor energy storages in electric
power engineering is still limited by their disadvantages that have not yet been
eliminated. The main disadvantages are the following:
• High price,
• Necessity of changing the polarity when proceeding from the charge to the
discharge regime and vice versa,
• Devices of control over CS operation based on thyristor converters generate
higher harmonics that distort sinusoidal waveform of alternating current.
As a result, the ﬁeld of application of the capacitors in electric power engi-
neering is limited mainly by short-term electric power accumulation and current
rectiﬁcation, correction, and ﬁltration in electric power engineering circuits.

Storage-Batteries
They use electric energy for implementation of chemical reactions that converts it
into chemical energy in the charge regime and returns it to the same form of electric
energy in the discharge regime. In this case, the composition of the electrode
material is changed, and the electrolyte is spent. Such storages are called accu-
mulators, and are combined in groups; they are called storage batteries or secondary
battery systems.
Nowadays a number of companies have started production and sufﬁciently wide
practical
application
of
high-capacity
storage
batteries
in

engineering.
Electrochemical storages have sufﬁciently high efﬁciency (65–70%), their
capacity ranges from 100 mAh to 2000 Ah and speciﬁc energy capacity (200–
300 kWh/m3); the operating lifetime for perspective models is predicted on a level
of 20 years. This will depend, among other things, upon the number of charge–
discharge cycles and the type and construction of the battery employed.
Among the disadvantages of the electrochemical accumulators are a limited
number of charge-discharge cycles (in most cases 1–2 thousands), sensitivity to
temperature, long charging time sometimes exceeding by several orders of mag-
nitude the discharge time, inadmissibility of deep discharge for lead accumulators
and, on the contrary, necessity of the complete charge-discharge cycle for metal
hydrate and many other accumulator types. The charge storage time is also rather
limited—from several days to several months.
These disadvantages can be levelled in an electric power complex including the
electrochemical energy storage and the electrochemical generator (ECG). The
electrochemical generator is the power complex including systems of fuel prepa-
ration, conditioning, energy output, waste recycling, etc. The key element—the
heart
of
such
generator—is
actually
the
energy
converter—fuel
element
(FE) representing a galvanic cell in which the electric energy is generated in the
course of oxidation-reduction transformations of reagents arriving from the outside
(it was patented in the ﬁrst half of the XIXth century). It directly transforms the fuel
energy into electricity, passing by ineffective, proceeding with high losses, burning
processes (Biochemists have established that the biological hydrogen-oxygen fuel
element is built into each living cell). The FE can be referred to chemical energy
storages, since with its help the synthetic fuel generated by electric power under
minimal loading (for example, hydrogen produced by electrolysis) is transformed
into the electric power required under maximal loading. Nowadays this device is
especially attractive for creation of effective energy source and hence is considered
in Chap. 8 of this manual entitled “Unconventional methods of electric energy
production.”

7.2.3
Superconductive Inductive Energy Storages
Inductive energy accumulation is the most effective in superconducting magnets,
since energy accumulation and output in them are practically not accompanied by
losses. The principal advantage of the inductive storages consists in the fact that the
energy in them is reserved in the same type in which it is used—electromagnetic.
There is no need to convert one energy type into another, which provides high
efﬁciency (97–98%) and fast response of the device. Therefore, the unique prop-
erties of the superconductive inductive energy storage (SCIES) are the capability of
almost instantaneous transition from the energy accumulation regime to the regime
of its delivery and a high speed of power takeoff. This property of the SCIES was
ﬁrst in demand in high power physics and pulsed power.
Discovery in 1957 of superconductors of the second type possessing high values
of critical current density and magnetic induction caused avalanche increase in
interest to the practical application of this phenomenon. Under the heading of
conductors, there are continuing advances in superconductors, which are now able
to operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
In all advanced countries (the USA, the USSR, Great Britain, France, Japan, and
Germany), works were underway on creation of both individual elements of
superconducting systems (wires, cables, and induction coils) and systems them-
selves (SCIES, superconducting magnets for accelerators, etc.). These works gave a
powerful impetus to the perfection of accelerators, thermonuclear installations,
cable lines, etc. Almost simultaneously, work was started in the interests of the
electric power engineering.
High rate of SIES response in EPS allows active and reactive power to be
controlled synchronously. The SIES can store energy as much as long in the form
of magnetic ﬁeld energy. This allows systems with high level of readiness (time
from giving a command to energy delivery to a load is *1 ms). An important
feature in practical SIES implementation is the capability of its energizing from a
source with low electric power. It is obvious that for long application of such
storage, additional expenses on cooling will be required; however, the beneﬁt from
their application, as a result, will signiﬁcantly cover these expenses. To participate
in daily regulation of the energy ﬂow in the system, the energy of the order of
1012 J must be accumulated and the power of several hundreds of megawatt must
be produced. Two decades ago the USA begun serial production of SIES with
power from 460 to 2500 kVA intended for compensation of voltage rise and
decline during 100 ms. Works are continued on the SIES modernization for energy
capacity from several units to several hundreds of megajoules to produce energy
capacity of 10 MW during 100 s. These storages are quite competitive with stor-
ages of other types.
In 1986 materials were synthesized with high-temperature (near 100 K) super-
conductivity. The synthesis of the materials possessing superconductivity at room
temperature would mean break in the spheres of electric power engineering,
transport, astronautics, pulsed power, and defense technology.

7.3
Potential and Kinetic Energy Storages
In traditional methods of electric power generation, the primary energy storage (in
non-electric form) is placed in front of the electric generator. For example, water
stored in a water basin of HPP; coal, gas or black oil of TPP; nuclear fuel of
NPP. To compensate for (to level of) the instability of electric energy generation
and consumption, storages of energy in non-electric form, as well as storages of
electric energy, are placed (inserted) between the generator and the consumer.
When the capacity in a system is deﬁcient, they generate additional electric power
and hence increase the power.
There are several types of non-electric energy (mainly potential or kinetic)
storages used in electric power engineering or promising for such application:
• pumped storage power plants,
• air compression energy storages,
• inertial (ﬂywheel) kinetic energy storages,
• electromechanical energy storages.
7.3.1
Pumped Storage Power Plants
Electric power generation by electric power plants and its consumption by different
users are interrelated so that according to physical laws, the electric power con-
sumption at any time must be exactly equal to the electric power generated at that
time.
For ideal regular electric power consumption, power plants would be operated
under regular loads. Actually, the majority of individual users have irregular electric
load schedules, and the total electric power consumption is irregular. Many
examples of irregular operation of setups and devices consuming electric power can
be given. A plant working in one or two shifts consumes electric power irregularly
during 24 h. The electric power consumed by it during non-working time is close to
zero. Streets and ﬂats are illuminated only at deﬁnite hours. Household appliances,
ventilators, vacuum cleaners, electrical stoves, heating devices, TV sets, radio sets,
and shavers consume electric power also irregularly. The load of municipal services
is maximum one in the morning and evening hours.
The electric load schedule of a region or city is a time history of total power
consumed by all customers. It has minima and maxima. This means that at certain
hours, a larger aggregate capacity is required, whereas at other hours, a part of
generators or electric power stations must be switched off or must operate with a
reduced load. The number of electric power stations and their aggregate capacity
are determined by a relatively short maximum of electric load of customers. This
leads to under-loading of the equipment and increases the cost of power systems.
200

Thus, a decrease in the operation period of large TPP from 6000 to 4000 h annually
causes the cost of generated electric power to increase by 30–35%.
An analysis of mechanisms of electric power consumption demonstrates that its
irregularity will further increase with improving well-being of people and an
increase in the load from community enterprises in the process of increase in the
power supply per production unit and decrease of night shifts. Reduction of
working time also increases the irregularity of power consumption. In the majority
of countries of Western Europe, the irregularity of power consumption is such that
the load can change by 30% of the peaking capacity within one hour, and further
increase of the irregularity is expected. It is very difﬁcult to change radically the
character of power consumption, because it depends strongly on the human bior-
hythms and on a number of objective circumstances independent from people.
The power engineers try to balance the schedule of the total load of customers
whenever possible. Thus, the cost of electric power depends on the time of day. If the
electric power is consumed during periods of maximum loading of an electric power
system, its cost increases. This makes customers to be interested in reorganization of
their job to reduce the electrical load during periods of maximum power consumption
in the electric power system. As a whole, the capabilities of balancing the power
consumption are rather low. Therefore, electrical power systems must be sufﬁciently
maneuverable and capable of fast changing the output of electric power stations.
In most countries, considerable portion of electric power (up to 80%) generated
by TPP is very sensitive to a regular load schedule. TPP units are badly adapted to
power control. Boilers and penstocks of these stations admit load changing only
within 10–15%.
Periodic TPP switching on and off does not allow the problem of power control
to be solved. In the best case, several hours are required to put a thermal power
station into operation. In addition, the operation mode of large TPP with a sharply
varying load is undesirable because of increased fuel consumption and higher rates
of wear of the equipment and hence reduction of its reliability. We must also take
into account that TPP with high vapor parameters have the minimum technically
allowable power equal to 50–70% of the rated power of the equipment. The
foregoing is true not only of the conventional TPP but also of nuclear power
stations. Therefore, the deﬁcit of maneuverable power (peaking load) is covered
now and will be covered in the near future by HPP for which the aggregate capacity
can be increased from zero to the maximum value in 1–2 min.
The output of an HPP is controlled as follows. When the load in the system is
minimum, the HPP has low output, and water falls a storage reservoir. In this case,
the energy is accumulated. When the load maximizes, the units of the HPP are put
into operation, and their output increases by a desired amount.
The energy accumulation in storage reservoirs on ﬂat rivers leads to ﬂooding of
vast territories, which in many cases is very undesirable. Small rivers are unsuitable
for output power control in the system, since they have no time to ﬁll the storage
reservoir with water.
The above-mentioned problem (removal of peaking loads) can be solved by
PSPP operating as follows, Figs. 7.3 and 7.4.

When the electrical load in interconnected power systems is minimum, PSPP
pump water from the lower storage reservoir to the upper one and thus consumes
electric power from the system (Fig. 7.3a). In the mode of short peak loading, PSPP
generate electric power and spend water stored in the upper reservoir.
Only in the European part of Russia about 200 PSPP can be constructed. In
power systems of central, northwest and southern parts of Russia, where the deﬁcit
of maneuverable capacity is at maximum, natural slope of the relief allows plants
with a small head (80–110 m) to be constructed.
Figure 7.5 shows a photograph of the PSPP near the city of Zagorsk (Moscow
region).
Regions with slope of the relief favorable for the construction of PSPP with a
head of *1000 m are far from the centers of consumption of maneuverable power.
The cost of transmission lines in these cases can signiﬁcantly exceed the cost of
PSPP construction.
The importance of PSPP increases, once high-duty (rated at >1000 MW) nuclear
power plants (NPP) have been put in operation, since NPP operate most efﬁciently
with a constant load, and load changes must be balanced by PSPP.
The Lorch-on-Rhein (Germany, 2400 MW), Cornwall (the USA, 2000 MW),
and Loch Lomond (England, 1200 MW) PSPP are among the largest ones.
The PSPP capacity depends on the water discharge and head. For a limited
volume of the upper reservoir, the capacity can be increased at the expense of a
higher head. Therefore, mountainous regions are more convenient for the con-
struction of PSPP.
For example,
a huge
head
(about
1800 m)
has
the
Reusseck PSPP in Austria. Natural water reservoirs are used as upper storage
reservoirs whenever possible. For example, a high-mountainous pond is used for
the Loch Lomond PSPP in England. In Japan, a crater lake is used as the upper
storage reservoir of the Numatsavanuma PSPP.

The construction of artiﬁcial reservoirs is laborious and expensive. In addition,
water can leak from the upper reservoir, and a leak of even several percent reduces
signiﬁcantly the efﬁciency of HPS. Therefore, careful waterprooﬁng is required.
Water in the upper reservoir can be heated using warm water of condensers of a
thermal power station. Closely arranged PSPP and TPP are well combined with
each other. PSPP generate electric power at peak hours, the TPP cooling reservoir is
used as a lower PSPP reservoir, and warm water from it is pumped to the upper
reservoir.
PSPP penstocks through which water from the upper reservoir runs to turbines
must not introduce large power losses. The ducted penstocks of large diameters
covered from inside with concrete or metal are most convenient. The number of
penstocks should be no less than two because in the case of repair of one of them,
another penstock can be used. Metal penstocks are less desirable because of large
wall friction losses, since these penstocks have relatively small diameters and hence
a lot of them must be used.
Penstocks (PS) and generators (G) were used in ﬁrst PSPP generating electric
power, and electric motor (M) and pumps (P) were used to pump water to the upper
reservoir (Fig. 7.3b). These stations were called four-machine stations according to
the number of machines. By virtue of the independent operation of the generator
and
pump,
the
four-machine
conﬁguration
is
sometimes
most
efﬁcient
economically.
For example, generators of the Grimsel PSPP in Switzerland are arranged on one
river, whereas pumps are placed on another river ﬂowing above. In this case, the
energy spent to pump water to the upper reservoir is less than the energy generated
by water running through turbines.
A decrease in the number of machines reduces signiﬁcantly the SPS cost and
opens perspectives for their wide application. Functions of a generator and motor
combined in one machine gave rise to three-machine conﬁguration of plants
(Fig. 7.3c). A few tens of such plants have been built worldwide. For example, the
Hesse Stadt plant rated at 130 MW was built in Germany in 1958, and the
Festiniong plant rated at 300 MW was built in England in 1961.
The PSPP became especially efﬁcient after the appearance of reversible
hydraulic turbines operating as turbines and pumps (Fig. 7.3b). The number of
machines in this case is reduced to two. However, plants with two-machine con-
ﬁguration have lower efﬁciency because of the necessity to increase the head by a
factor of 1.3–1.4 in the pump mode to overcome friction in penstocks. In the
generator mode, the head is lower because of friction in penstocks. In order that the
unit operated with equal efﬁciencies in the generator and pump modes, its rotation
velocity in the pump mode must be increased. Different rotation velocities in
reversible generators complicate their design and make them more expensive.
The perspectives of PSPP application depend in many respects on their efﬁ-
ciency, which for these stations is deﬁned as a ratio of the energy produced by the
station in the generation mode to the energy spent in the pump mode.
In the early 20th century, the efﬁciency of the ﬁrst PSPP was  40%; the
efﬁciency of modern PSPP is 70–75%. Among the PSPP advantages, low
204

construction cost should also be mentioned. Unlike conventional HPP, it is not
required to dam a river, to construct a high dam with long tunnels, etc. HPP on large
rivers need 10 m3 of concrete to be spent to generate 1 kW of installed capacity,
whereas large PSPP need only a few tenth of cubic meter of concrete.
PSPP and wind power stations distinguished by unstable operation are well
combined with each other. However, it is difﬁcult to rely on the output of wind
stations during peak loading of power systems. Given that the electric power
generated by wind power stations is accumulated in water pumped to the upper
reservoir of PSPP, in the required periods it can be utilized in the electric power
system. The lack of reliable methods of electric energy accumulation will promote
the PSPP spread.
7.3.2
Air-Compression Energy Storages
This method of energy accumulation was patented in 1949, and the ﬁrst system was
built in 1978 in Germany. In systems of this class, the energy is accumulated in a
compressed gas. When the electric power is excessive, the compressor with an
electric motor drive pumps a gas in a tank. When it is required to use the stored
energy, the compressed gas is supplied into a reversible pneumatic machine with
synchronous electric machine operating as a generator or in a turbine or other
device directly performing the required mechanical work. There is a considerable
number of devices with low capacity directly using the energy of the compressed air
(for example, pneumatic weapon, pneumatic brake mechanisms of wheel means of
transportation, engines of miner air ducts, etc.).
This technology as applied to the EPS is in the initial stage of development
because of the disadvantages inherent in it:
(1) Low efﬁciency (high losses, up to 30–40%, are caused by gas heating during
compression; in the storage regime, heat is transferred to the environment),
(2) Special requirements to the deployment site (presence of underground empti-
ness of natural or of techno genic origin),
(3) Comparatively large time of power reverse (about 10 min).
Proponents of this technology and power plants based on it (air accumulating
power stations—AAPP) emphasize that their use in some cases is reasonable and
effective:
• The number of cavities in the earth suitable for creation of AAPP in densely
populated areas is larger than the number of rivers, where creation of HPP is
possible;
• Some experts show that the construction of AAPP does not damage the envi-
ronment, but improves it;
• There are projects which allow the application of heat produced during air
compression for subsequent utilization. The rise of the air temperature in air
7.3
Potential and Kinetic Energy Storages
205

reservoirs of AAPP with gas expander causes its increase to the levels which
make AAPP implementation economically efﬁcient not only as an accumulator
and electrical energy generator, but also as a source of thermal energy applicable
for heating systems;
• There are other AAPP modiﬁcations with improved working characteristics. For
example, there is the modiﬁcation that provides application of two-section air
reservoir which is to be only once ﬁlled by air taken from the atmosphere; the
pressure of this air must be different in each of the sections; then the sections are
to be isolated from the atmosphere. The compressed air then circulates from the
section of lower pressure level to the section of higher pressure level—with the
help of a compressor, and from the section of higher pressure level to the section
of lower pressure—passing through the gas-expander connected to the shaft of
the electric power generator, Fig. 7.6.
The proposed methods of increasing the efﬁciency of air-compressor energy
storage at the current level of technology are feasible mainly in low-power systems.

7.3.3
Inertial Energy Storages (Flywheels
and Super-Flywheels)
Inertial (dynamic) energy storages (IES) operate as follows: the engine drives a
ﬂywheel—the ﬂywheel accumulates energy—the generator rotated by a ﬂywheel
generates electric energy. Their practical application begun in the end of the XIXth
century for short-term energy production in various technical systems (sea torpe-
does, rolling mills, and melting furnaces). From the middle of the XXth century,
their application has signiﬁcantly increased in connection with the development of
new types of weapon (beam, electro kinetic, and other similar weapons) with the
development of high-energy physics. IES with cyclopean overall dimensions have
been manufactured having the characteristic parameters: ﬂywheel (steel) diameter
of 3–5 m, length up to 6 m, mass of *200–250 t, output (discharge) power of
several tens of megawatts, power capacitance up to 10 MW, and ﬂywheel rotation
velocity 1000–1500 rpm have been manufactured.
Works on IES modernization have led to several original technical solutions on
reduction of energy losses: the ﬂywheel is placed in the environment of light gas
(hydrogen or helium) or in vacuum; gas static, gas dynamic, or magnetic supports
(bearings and toes); ﬂywheels of complicated design are used, and composite
ﬁbrous materials are used as a ﬂywheel material rather than steel, Fig. 7.7.
Such ﬂywheels were called super-ﬂywheels, since they possess a number of
advantages over steel ones, ﬁrst, high speciﬁc power capacity (5–15 MJ/kg or 1.4–
4.17 kWh/kg) practically unattainable for all known storages. This is provided,
basically, by two factors: (a) high mechanical strength of the ﬂywheel allowing to
drive it to 7000 rpm and even greater and to accumulate a considerable amount of
the kinetic energy, and (b) capability of accumulating potential energy in the form
of elastic ﬂywheel deformation. Modern superﬂy wheels are manufactured from
nonmetallic ﬁbers with low density and high mechanical strength (organic ﬁber—
kevlar, ﬁberglass, and carbon ﬁber). Fibrous materials are elongated under the
stretching action of centrifugal forces in the rotating ﬂywheel and reserve, except
the kinetic energy, the potential energy. The amount of the latter is determined by
relative deformation of ﬁbers and deformation can be commensurable with the
kinetic energy for high ratio of the admissible pressure to the elasticity modulus (to
the Young elasticity modulus) for the ﬂywheel material. Such ﬂywheel can deliver
considerable portion of the total stored energy for comparatively small change of
the angular velocity during deceleration, i.e., in the discharge regime.
The IES intended for application in the EPS to level peaks of power con-
sumption, must work together with the reversible electric machine mounted on the
shaft common with the ﬂywheel. The electric machine in the charge regime is
7.3
Potential and Kinetic Energy Storages
207

energized from an alternating current system (50 or 60 Hz) through a frequency
multiplier and spinning the ﬂywheel until the rated velocity. In the discharge
regime, this machine is rotated by the ﬂywheel and operates as an electric energy
generator delivered to the EPS. The time of power reverse—transition from the
charge to the discharge regime—takes a few tenth of a second. The IES projects (as
a rule, vertical conﬁguration) for energy from 70 to 200 GJ with a set of disk
ﬂywheels having diameters from 4.5 to 18 m, total height from 6 to 10 m, with
rotation velocities up to 7200 rpm have been developed.
It is considered that the application of the IES in the EPS will be expedient if
they have the following characteristics:
(1) Power capacity greater than 103 MWh,
(2) Speciﬁc capital investments less than 1000 dollars/kW,
(3) Service lifetime about 30 years,
(4) Speciﬁc power capacity no less than 3.5 kW h/m3,
(5) Efﬁciency no less than 80–85%.

At present, they are too expensive because of high cost of materials and com-
plexity of construction of such storage system. For example, because the angular
ﬂywheel velocity is much greater than the velocity of electro-generators, trans-
mission devices are required that not only complicate and make more expensive the
design, but also cause additional energy losses. The same effects will be caused by
application of several tens of ﬂywheels of smaller sizes and more technological
rather than one huge ﬂywheel (its mass would reach 1000 t). Special protective
measures from possible destruction (rupture) of the ﬂywheel should also be
provided.
7.3.4
Electromechanical Drive Storages
As a rule, in the electromechanical storage (EMS) the kinetic energy of the ﬂywheel
and rotor of the electric machine (EM) connected to it is stored. In some EMS there
is no ﬂywheel as the element independent or structurally combined with the EM
rotor, and functions of energy storage are fulﬁlled by the rotor (along with the
functions in the electromechanical EM processes). As a generator, the same EM,
which serves as the electric motor for ﬂywheel drive, is used or another EM also
mounted on the EMS shaft. The EMS represents not only the storage, but also the
power ampliﬁer (energy compactor). In the charging regime, the EM engine con-
sumes a rather small power from the power supply, and in the mode discharge, the
EM generator delivers much higher power for a shorter time. Depending on des-
ignation, the EMS can be constructed based on EM of various types: alternating
current (synchronous or asynchronous) and direct current ones, including collector
or opposite and unipolar valves.
The block diagram of the power complex with EMS is shown in Fig. 7.8.
The EMS of two types: (1) synchronous machines with frequency converters in
the primary circuit and with ﬂywheels on the shaft and (2) asynchronous machines
with ﬂywheels on the shaft have found the widest application in electric power
engineering.
Nowadays there are no practical restrictions on the creation of units of the ﬁrst
type with capacity to 300–400 MW and of the second type with capacity to 800–
1600 MW. In the pulsed (forced) regime the commercially available synchronous
electric generators used in electric power stations, can produce a capacity up to
109 W for several fractions of a second. In this case, up to 10 MJ per pulse is
supplied to a load with efﬁciency of kinetic energy supply from the ﬂywheel of
2–3%. The synchronous impact generator can produce 1000 MJ pulses of power up
to 100 MW. By the stored energy level, the synchronous generators can generate a
pulse train (with period between pulses of several minutes required to restore the
frequency of rotation of the rotor). The exploitation of synchronous generators is
constrained mainly by a low efﬁciency of energy transmission to a load.
In the last decades the development and implementation of the Smart Grid
concept and the increase of the fraction of the distributed electric energy (including
7.3
Potential and Kinetic Energy Storages
209

on the basis of URPS) in the electric power balance as well as the increased severity
of consequences (economic, social, etc.) of interruptions or undersupply of electric
energy have increased the importance and role of the energy storages.

8.1
Power Engineering as the Threat to the Biosphere
As noted above, the world in its evolution has reached the stage that calls for the
development of new global approaches to a solution of the most complicated
current problems. Among these problems is “ecological infarct.” Under these
conditions, of primary importance is prediction of the mankind future, associated
with the state of the environment, to understand contradictions it will face and
measures that will have to be undertaken to make them less acute as well as limits in
which this will be achieved and at which cost. For many decades, the annual
increment of energy production has been about 3%. If such rate of energy increase
is retained, the allowable heat limit will be attaining in 60 years. Then by the
middle of the 21st century, the production of these types of energy will have been
stabilized. In this case, a difﬁcult question arises on quotas of energy production for
each state. This will initiate a global crisis of our civilization that will be of
geopolitical importance.
Actually, the power of only stationary power plants all over the world is about
1.9 TW, and the power of all systems producing energy is no less than 10 TW,
which is approximately equal to powers of such natural phenomena as moisture
vaporization from the Earth’s surface (0.5 TW), sea and ocean tides (2–3 TW),
thermal gradients in oceans and dry land (2–2.5 TW), and even of such colossal
forces of nature as earthquakes (1.5–100 TW). The energy of anthropogenic origin
inﬂuences natural processes proceeding on our planet. The energy of all fuels
extracted from the planet per year is *60 thousand TWh. It makes less than
0.015% of the solar energy reaching on the Earth’s surface, but even for such value
of energy produced, its thermal effect on the heat balance of our planet is notice-
able. This energy inﬂuences the climate, especially in most “energetically stressed”
territories.

Figure 8.1 and Table 8.1 show the relationship between powers of anthro-
pogenic systems of energy conversion and powers of natural origin expressed in
watts.
Practical and economic human activities were historically developed so that, as a
rule, their ecological consequences on the environment were disregarded. This was
allowable until their scales and power resources brought into action were
insigniﬁcant compared to powers of environmental phenomena.
In some cases, unfavorable changes were observed in local regions. Thus, for
example, when forests had been cut and soil had become infertile because of
irrational agricultural management, the human activity could be organized in
another place.

Power Engineering and the Biosphere

Nowadays people feel the consequences of sometimes extremely unfavorable
effects on the environment already in their everyday life. Intense pollution of the
atmosphere by harmful substances changes its gas composition, forest areas fast
decrease, the ecological balance between the atmosphere and the global ocean is
disturbed due to contamination of ocean water by oil and other products of human
activity, and the so-called thermal pollution of water and air heated by various
industrial wastes is observed [1].
Anthropogenic emissions are particularly dangerous in that they reduce the
stocks of drinking water and cause a dangerous rise in temperature of surface
and the atmosphere because of the greenhouse effect and thermal pollution. The
pollution of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere causes a decrease in the
quality of drinking water of open sources (rivers, lakes, ponds, artiﬁcial reservoirs)
and underground water too. Groundwater sources are, in the opinion of hydroge-
ologists and environmentalists, the last hope of people to meet their needs for
drinking water in the near future. Per capita of water consumption, like the energy
consumption, characterized by a large difference between water consumption in
different countries and regions. Already more than 1 billion people live in condi-
tions of shortage of drinking water.
Since humanity has entered into the seventh environmental crisis (now it has the
global character), we are gradually drawn into technical (technological) revolution.
For power engineering it means the development of new energy sources and new
ways of converting them into electrical and thermal energy. The beginning and
pace/rate of this revolution depend upon a number of factors:
1. Economic—requires investment on a huge scale
2. Technology—inability of quick change of technological structures
3. Social:
(a) rapid population growth in developing countries, and
(b) inability to quickly change the existing mode of life
4. Global (historical and geographical)—extremely uneven distribution of energy
resources across countries and regions.
At present, these problems have grown up to scale that rises a question whether
the scientiﬁc and technical progress threatens to destroy the civilization because of
its harmful effect.
A power system in which electrical and thermal energies are produced is directly
connected with a system providing primary power resources (Fig. 8.2). There are
also feedbacks of various factors of human activity with the state and development
of power engineering. Exactly for this reason, power systems should be considered
as subsystems of an integral global system of functioning of the human society.
Creation and preservation of a power system and conditions of its operation in
many respects are determined by natural factors, for example, by the availability of
water reservoirs and geographical location of power resources and customers.
A state of the biosphere and a degree of its pollution connected with the operation
8.1
Power Engineering as the Threat to the Biosphere
215

of power systems impose deﬁnite limitations on their characteristics and working
conditions. Direct relationships and feedbacks between the biosphere and a power
system are traced here.
Efﬁcient management of a power system must consider its inﬂuence on the bio-
sphere, social functions of a system offuel supply, demands for energy of industry and
transport, and other factors. Not only energy production in the power system, but also
its consumption by various branches of economy must be managed.
Modern power systems, as indicated above, are closely related with many-sided
human activity. They inﬂuence directly a great diversity of branches of economy
(industry, transport, and agriculture), economics, social conditions, state of the
biosphere, etc.
Interactions of power systems with the related economic system and the bio-
sphere must be considered in the process of managing the power system, predicting
and designing its future development, and carrying out scientiﬁc research. The
development of power engineering inﬂuences directly the general state of tech-
nology. In turn, achievements in different branches of technology are reﬂected in
the state of power engineering. The power engineering, the biosphere, and the
social and economic human activities are interrelated.
The most important difference between the two above-discussed types of power
sources (renewable and non-renewable) is their effects on the biosphere. Power
engineering based on non-renewable sources results in additional heating of the
habitat, that is, the energy of these sources is added to the energy of heating of our
planet by the Sun.
Renewable power sources do not heat our planet; therefore, this type of energy is
called “non-adding” or “green.” Indeed, in this case, using, for example, solar rays
Fig. 8.2 Different factors
inﬂuencing the operation of a
power system
216

Power Engineering and the Biosphere

in power systems located on the Earth, we eliminate their energy from the heating
cycle of the planet. After usage, we return this energy to the planet as the same
amount of heat. The same is true for the wind or oceanic energy, namely, as much
energy is returned to the habitat in the form of heat as is taken from the power
background. The non-adding energy can be called waste-free, whereas the adding
energy should be considered as the energy polluting the habitat.
Calculations demonstrate that the production of only 1% of the adding energy
(for example, chemical, nuclear, or thermonuclear energy) to the total solar energy
will cause the average temperature of the biosphere to increase by *1°C.
It is generally recognized that such an increase in the average temperature of the
biosphere will cause disastrous global consequences not only on the Earth’s
geography and climate, but also on animal and vegetable kingdoms.
Discovery of processes in atmosphere, which was made by means of satellite,
has shown that water vapor produced in increasing amount due to the increase of
temperature destroys ozone layers. As is well known, ozone layers protect people
and animals from ultraviolet radiation.
Increased threatening changes in the nature are illustrated in Figs. 8.3, 8.4, 8.5,
8.6, 8.7, and 8.8. Over the last century the atmospheric temperature has risen by
0.74 °C (Figs. 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5), and the level of the oceans annually increased by
3 mm (Fig. 8.6).
Global warming will unpredictably change the rate and character of all processes
proceeding on the Earth and will considerably change the atmospheric circulation
and soil moistening. As a result, zones optimal for agriculture and other types of
economic activities will be strongly displaced.

These changes would affect vital interests of billions of people, would cause the
massive migration of population (including crossing of national boundaries), the
resettlement of people to zones without developed infrastructure and, as a result,

disastrous social consequences. It is especially unpleasant that all these changes will
occur very fast on the historical time scale, and it will be very difﬁcult to adapt to
them.
Over the past few years, the problem of global greenhouse effect has attracted a
close attention of the scientists.

Unfortunately, it turns out that it is very difﬁcult to predict the future correctly
because of a high degree of uncertainty of this problem due to our poor knowledge
of many processes proceeding in the atmosphere, soil, and ocean. It is not surprising
that predictions of different scientiﬁc groups differ radically from each other. An
optimistic prediction implies that the temperature will grow by 1 °C as the amount
of carbon dioxide is doubled, whereas a pessimistic prediction implies that the
temperature will grow by 5 °C. An average value of 2.5–3 °C is taken as the most
probable value of temperature rise. Predicting the performance of these processes is
complicated by the fact that the temperature on the Earth depends on the
little-known processes of cosmic scales.
How fast will carbon dioxide accumulate actually? If the rate of carbon dioxide
increase retained, in 50 years the carbon dioxide concentration will increase by 15–
20% compared to its value at present. However, since the consumption of fossil fuel
grows, it seems more probable that 25% and more by the early 40s will increase the
carbon dioxide concentration. In the context of the most probable prediction, this
would correspond to a temperature rise of *1 °C, which would be very dangerous.
Most likely, a safe limit of adding energy will not exceed one tenth of percent of
the power of solar energy incident on the Earth’s surface, that is, will be about
100 billion kilowatt. Nowadays the Earth’s civilization produces an adding energy
power of 10 billion kilowatt for consumptive use (in industry, everyday life, and
transport), that is, only 10 times less than the allowable limit.

Power Engineering and the Biosphere

The population growth and the intensity of its activities to improve the quality of
life reinforce the technological impact on the environment thanks to changes in the
following areas:
(1) structure of the earth’s surface (plowing up of steppes, deforestation, land
reclamation, creation of artiﬁcial lakes and seas, and so on);
(2) composition of the biosphere, circulation and balance of its constituent sub-
stances (removal of mineral resources, creation of dumps, and emissions of
various substances into the atmosphere, ground and water);
(3) heat balance of certain regions of the globe and the planet (heat emissions from
fuel combustion—thermal pollution, “green house” gases (GHG), and so on);
(4) biota (the extermination of certain breeds of animals and varieties of plants,
moving them to new habitats).
In contrast to natural ﬂuctuations, the anthropogenic impact leads to sharp, rapid
changes in the state of the environment in the region. As part of the natural envi-
ronment, new components are characterized by the term “pollution.” Nature
responds to these effects increasing the instability and unpredictability of weather,
including in the form of negative phenomena. Over the past 30 years, the annual
number of natural disasters has increased by 4 times, and the economic damage
from them—by 7 times.
There are scientists—climatologists (they are in the minority), which explains
the direction and causes of climate changes in a different way. Proponents of the
alternative point of view call “Global Warming” “the largest political-scientiﬁc
fraud in the history of mankind.”
Their arguments are:
• No warming on the Earth has been observed already for about 20 years; the
warmest year in the last decades was 1998; since then the average temperature
of the planet has not increased.
• Abnormally cold winters from which the Europe and even North Africa have
suffered affected in the last few years are perceived dy a number of experts as
symptoms of future global cooling.
• Warming in the 90s was connected which the coincidence of peaks of two—
200-years and 60-years natural of “warming—cooling” cycles.
• Cooling in the 40–70-ies of XX century was observed during the period of rapid
growth of industry and emissions of greenhouse gases.
• Near-ground measurements of temperature are incorrect, because many mete-
orological stations are located in big cities or near them; thereby, they overes-
timate the indications of thermometers.
• Facts of deliberate information distortion or its hiding to reinforce the hypoth-
esis of global warming have been established.
According to the opinion of climatologists, the share of anthropogenic inﬂuence
on climate is 25%, natural (space) processes making up the rest/In our climatic
system, 60-year cycles are observed. The phase of warming has started in the
8.1

1970s; nowadays it is coming to an end. The temperature rise similar to that
observed at present was already observed 1700 and 1000 years ago when the
mankind could not inﬂuence the climate. Future climate changes will be inﬂuenced
by these two factors. At present, an increased number of accidents, which all us
observe, accompanies the temperature rise.
8.2
Short Analysis of the Trends in Electric Energy
Generation and Consumption in Aspect
of the Inﬂuence on Environment
First, we must bear in mind that the share of energy accounts for about 50% of all
emissions into the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.
Consumption of power resources grows rapidly due to a continuous increase in
the world production. According to the data of the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the consumption of primary energy will have
been increased to *24 billion ton of standard fuel annually by 2030, that is, it will
double compared to 1988. The annual increment of primary energy consumption
is *1.5–2%. The remaining reserves of oil and natural gas are sufﬁcient for the
coming 50–100 years. Of course, these data are approximate; nevertheless, they
give us an insight into the future. Table 8.2 summarizes the data on the global
consumption of the most important energy carriers in 1990 and the corresponding
data predicted for 2020.

Obviously, planning and designing power systems as well as their subsequent
development and maintenance must consider all their effects on the environment. In
this connection, experts in power engineering must have extensive knowledge of
the nature and natural phenomena.
Under conditions of a rapid growth of electric power engineering and many
other engineering branches when problems of pollution of the biosphere are of great
importance, renewable power sources attract much attention (see Chap. 5). Of
interest is to trace the consumption of different energy resource types since the
beginning of the XXth century, Fig. 8.8.
The muscular energy of the human and animals, sometimes called biological
energy, was the sole energy source in former times. Today its share is less than 1%
of the total energy consumption (it is not shown in Fig. 8.8). The share of muscular
energy will further decrease. This demonstrates that the high level in the devel-
opment of productive forces has allowed the human to throw almost completely
efforts on manufacturing essential products using machines. In order that machines

do this work, the human, based on laws of nature that he perceived and imple-
mented in practice, should set to work huge powers applying them to instruments of
production. These powers of modern instruments invariably exceed the maximum
power of biological sources.
The ﬁrst heat sources were various organic remains and wood. For a long time,
wood was the main energy carrier. Later on, as other energy sources with higher
energy content (coal and oil) were mastered, the consumption of wood decreased.
Utilization of wood can be stopped almost completely in the near future. Early in
the 20th century, the greatest share (of the order of 70%) of all utilized energy
resources fell on coal. As the consumption of oil, gas, and electric power increased,
the share of coal decreased, though the total amount of extracted coal signiﬁcantly
increased.
A model of the power engineering development was constructed in 1992 (by I.
A. Bashmakov), which allows one to forecast the needs of six different energy
sources, six secondary energy carriers as applied to six sectors of economy. The
starting point of an analysis was a scenario based on the common sense. Then the
capability of accelerated addition of oil, coal, gas, nuclear energy, and renewable
energy sources to the global energy balance was estimated together with the fea-
sibility of resolving contradictions arising in global power engineering. One more
modiﬁcation was added to six modiﬁcations of the basic scenario, namely, a sce-
nario with accelerated energy saving. Table 8.3 gives the global energy balance
predicted for 2020 based on this energy balance.
The evolution of the debit side of the global energy balance is determined by two
opposite tendencies: (a) gradual approach of the structure of power resource pro-
duction to the structure of available reserves and (b) improvement in the quality of
consumed energy resources and energy carriers.
The ﬁrst tendency determines an increasing share of coal in the global energy
balance. The second tendency determines increasing shares of oil, gas, and nuclear
fuel in the global energy balance.
The increased consumption of primary power resources will decrease shares of
three main organic fuel types, but they will dominate in the structure of the global
energy balance until the middle 21st century and even later.
Undoubtedly, a rational combination of different energy resources and a smooth
development of power engineering would allow difﬁculties, sometimes disastrous
in character analogous to those observed in 1973–1974 in a number of countries, to
be avoided. These difﬁculties called the power crisis were due to many-year
predatory utilization of national raw resources by international monopolies.
Despite of all the difﬁculties to meet the growing electricity needs of each
individual and the increasing world population, in the ﬁrst place among the prob-
lems facing humanity, is environmental protection.
Ecologists have come to a conclusion that “… the mankind has approached a
certain critical limit, having faced in their development new external borders …
these borders are deﬁned not only by subsurface area resources or accessible energy
sources, but the number of biosphere possibilities aimed at neutralization of
growing anthropogenic pressure.”

As discussed in Chap. 5, humanity hopes to preserve the ecological well-being
in the world are connected with the transition to a “clean” energy—primarily based
on the use of renewable energy sources.
No harmful emissions and excessive heat during operation of such sources of
electricity and heat help one fully compensate for anthropogenic impact on the
environment during their manufacture. For example, projected for 2050 electricity
production by means of SPP will help one to prevent annual emissions of 6 billion tons
of greenhouse gases (CO2 and about ten other harmful gases). In the production of
solar cells, the level of contamination does not exceed the permissible level for the
microelectronic industry enterprises in the production of components for thermody-
namic SPP, hot air, or thermal circuit for general engineering company.
8.3
Main Sources of Threats to the Environment
in Different Sectors of Fuel and Energy Complex
According to estimations of international experts, up to 40% of the total gross
domestic product in developed countries connected with extraction, processing and
consumption of energy resources. In the last decades, even non-professionals have
realized that industrial-type economy dominating in the world does not adequately
consider ecological and social consequences of economic activities; it also produces
a lot of problems and dangers threatening human civilization. Ecological threat
began to emerge faster than the positive changes in the energy balance (consecutive
transition to fuel with a lesser content of carbon or not containing it at all) and in the
environmental protection activity.
The experience has proved that in terms of fuel and energy complex
(FEC) improvement of ecological basic technologies indicators for ecological
safety concedes in struggle to other approach—increase in the efﬁciency of power
resource use at all stages of their service life cycle—from extraction to consumption
of electric and thermal energy. It is a more radical solution, since it is aimed at
elimination of reasons (power consumption growth), instead of consequences (in-
crease in ecological damage because of energy generation growth). Energy saving
character is relevant to economic reorganization and objectively caused by (eco-
nomic and ecological factors) quality of the present stage of world economy
development. Correlation between amount of investments into energy saving
actions and expenses on corresponding quantity of energy generation are estimated
as 1: 5–8. Goals which are put forward by energy saving are getting of paramount
importance among obligatory actions of environmental protection activity.
The World Commission on Environment and Development has developed the
concept of the sustainable development, which has received the ofﬁcial status
within the frame of the UN as “strategy of world development” in which necessity
of searching new interaction society model, economy, and the state interaction
model is proclaimed. In the report of Intergovernmental Committee on United
226

Nations Climate Change “Struggle against climate changes: human solidarity in a
divided world” the unequivocal and well given conclusion contains: climate
changes occur because of the human being activity. All over the world energy
sector emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere will increase from 23.9 billion tons in
2001 to 37.1 billion tons in 2025 if, of course, extraordinary measures are not
undertaken for environmental protection.
There are three basic ways of decrease (or at least reduction of rates of increase)
in pressure on the environment of growing energy consumption.
1. Change of balance towards increase in the share of more non-polluting primary
energy sources: fuel with smaller carbon content or not containing it at all:
uranium, renewable energy sources, and in the long term—fuel for implemen-
tation of controlled thermonuclear fusion. It is a perspective way of prevention
of ecological accidents, but as the experience of the advanced countries has
proved, replacement of traditional hydrocarbon fuel kinds by alternative and
non-polluting energy sources demands huge capital investments.
2. Increase in ecological cleanliness of extraction technologies, primary processing
and transportation of conventional power sources and generation of electric and
thermal energy.
3. Reduction of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere by burying them in the under-
ground storages. (About 12 power stations have been equipped with such
storages in EU by 2015.)
8.3.1
Activities in the Resource Sectors
The greatest damage to the nature of the activity of enterprises of the FEC resource
sectors inﬂicts extraction and transportation of oil and natural gas. This damage is
expressed as follows:
1. Pollution of all spheres of the Earth that affects the development of living
matter: the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and the earth’s surface.
2. Impact on the deep layers of the earth (10–15 km): pollution of underground
drinking water and reduced in situ pressure, which can cause earthquakes and
soil subsidence.
3. The output from agricultural land about few percent of the total area of farmland
is lost annually (a huge number of wells—hundreds of thousands, extended
permanent and temporary roads, rail and waterways, pipelines, and overhead
transmission lines).
4. A huge number of vehicles producing polluting fuel, oil, and exhaust fumes.
5. Large volumes of water consumption for technological, transport, economic—
household and ﬁreﬁghting—needs, and the same volume of discharge of pol-
luted wastewater.

ered the most economically sound solution: prevention oil spills due to pipeline
damages, automated control of pipeline condition and pipeline sites where pipelines
need replacement or capital repairs. Such activity seems to be economically proved
in most cases. Land restoration is considered one of the important activities, which
should take place after ﬁeld facility liquidation, i.e., territory reduction in that
condition in which it stayed before investigation and extraction of power raw
materials.
Extraction and transportation of natural gas in comparison with oil represent
essentially smaller ecological danger since gas has relative density 0.6 and emitted,
quickly dissipates in the atmosphere. Durability of gas pipelines is not rated, but
experts consider 30–40 years to be a no-failure service life. A number of actions
provides relatively high degree of technological safety: mainly underground lining
and placing gas pipelines outside housing estates, and regular and rigid control of
all pipeline system elements, their condition. As a result, failure frequency has
decreased approximately by 2.5 times for the last 20–25 years.
The essential harm to the nature is done by extraction and preliminary prepa-
ration of solid fuel (coal ﬁrst): land alienation and landscape destruction when
extracted by open quarry, surface subsided by mining, gangue storage problems,
etc. When coal is transported, it is almost impossible to avoid such problems as
pollution of the grounds adjoining to railways and highways.
Serious damage to the environment does extraction and primary processing of
uranium ore:
1. In the production by the mine (approximately 50%) or pit method of uranium
ore, it is spread by wind and water over long distances.
2. In the course of processing the ore at the concentrators, a huge amount of waste
is produced—the “tails” (more than 500 million tons), which will remain
radioactive for millions of years.
3. When processing uranium concentrate into nuclear fuel gaseous and liquid
radioactive wastes are formed (fortunately, the radiation dose from them is much
less than in the stages of extraction and processing of uranium ore).
Radical improvements of ecological conditions cannot be achieved only by
taking inactive measures aimed at environmental protection (various clearing
device application) owing to economic restrictions. For instance, unit cost of fume
clearing from SO2 and NOX increases by several times at the attempt to raise the
efﬁciency of gas cleaner units over—5–85%.

Energy Generation
The biggest environmental problems, as mentioned above, are due to the production
of electricity and heat at power plants and boilers that burn fossil fuels, forming
“fuel triad”—coal, oil, natural gas, Fig. 8.9.
Power industry development based on coal fuel, simultaneously with the solu-
tion of a problem concerning reliable power supply (due to huge world coalﬁelds),
aggravates an environmental contamination problem. Annual world emissions
produced by power units constitute: carbonic gas—(2–3)  1010 t, particulate
matters—2.5  1010 t, NOX—1.2  109 t, SOX 1.5  108 t, and considerable
amount of toxic components. One coal power plant with capacity of 150 MW and
average technical characteristics produces more than 1 million tons of greenhouse
gases emissions a year. Centralized heat supply provided by means of thermal
power plants and nuclear power plants is accompanied by large amount of
low-grade heat emissions produced by industrial water cooling systems and by
additional fuel expenses on delivery of water heating.
Experience of the advanced countries (ﬁrst of all Germany, USA, England,
Denmark, Japan, South Korea) has proved that modern level of technologies allows
reducing ecological impact of coal power stations to a minimum, which is possible
only if additional measures are implemented, at the same time making construction
and operation of such thermal power stations more complicated and expensive.

Table 8.4 gives the estimation of atmospheric emission reduction because of
implementation of two action groups: technological and organizational.
Nuclear fuel and renewable energy sources produce the so-called fuel “triad” in
terms of environmental pollution. It is necessary to bear in mind that nuclear-power
engineering, as well as renewable, can be related to “pure” generation if consider
operation of power installations only. However, enterprises, which provide their
functioning, are the sources of environmental contamination (indirect damage to the
environment). After Chernobyl and Fucusima-1 nuclear power plant accidents
ecologists are seriously concerned about safe operation of nuclear power plants,
storage of the spent fuel and radioactive wastes, treatment of the spent nuclear units,
and after New York terrorist attacks in 2001—physical protection of nuclear units.
In technologies of electricity generation from renewable energy sources, there
are no processes of oxidation, which could pollute environment; however, they
have negative direct and indirect impact on the environment. Among direct impacts
are earth alienation, audible noise, bird migrations blocking (wind power), earth
surface shadowing (solar power), corrosive solution release (geothermal power),
etc.
In order to increase economic and ecological efﬁciency of conventional fuel
usage some approaches are applied.
1. Increase in the parameters of boiler power units with traditional coal burning,
and with boilers, which have circulating ﬂuidized bed combustor. It will raise
the efﬁciency up to 53–54% in the nearest future (see Sect. 4.2).
2. Improvement of fuel combustion technology: application of low-toxic burners,
boiler transfer to a technology of three-stage fuel combustion, combustion
chamber modernization, and introduction of automatic combustion mode
management.
3. Special treatment of fuel before its combustion (thin reduction and preliminary
coal gasiﬁcation, coal-water slurry preparation and water black oil emulsion,
etc.).
4. Introduction of CHPP and GTPP, providing both high energy and ecological
efﬁciency and reducing speciﬁc fuel consumption by 32–37%. (Prevailing part

when energy resources were cheap and that is why nowadays they do not meet
the requirements of cost-effective use of resources and ecology.)
5. Cogeneration—co-production of electric and thermal energy (see Sect. 4.3).
6. Low-grade energy recycling: recycling of reduced steam energy, development
of turbo expander technologies, recycling of heat energy produced by techno-
logical and household dumps, etc.
7. Wide use of modern highly effective heat exchange devices.
The essential economic and ecological effect provides involvement in energy
production of backup fuel (see Sect. 3.2) and renewable energy sources (see
Chap. 5).
8.3.3
Energy Transmission and Distribution
Damage caused by transmission and distribution of electric and thermal energy is
not so considerable compared with its generation and production. Nevertheless, the
transmission of energy over long distances and its distribution among the con-
sumers as well as the early stages of the “life cycle” of energy and power have a
negative impact on the three main subsystems: environmental, economic, and
social.
1. Environmental and economic subsystem:
• Violation of the soil-plant complex and relief,
• Changes in habitat of animals, birds, insects, and their gene pool,
• A negative inﬂuence on the biological processes in the vegetable world,
• Limiting and changing migration routes of animals and birds,
• Rejection of valuable agricultural land,
• Deforestation for the track OTL.
2. Social subsystem:
• Deterioration of living conditions of population close to power lines
(acoustic noise and television and radio interferences),
• Negative aesthetic impact on the landscape, human settlements, recreation,
cultural and natural monuments, etc.,
• Negative impact of electromagnetic ﬁelds of OTL on the human in the
conservation zone.
Measures to reduce the negative impact of OTL on the environment are diverse.
They can be summarized as follows:
1. Increase the economic interest of grid companies to reduce damage to the
environment (fee for the use of land, forest, and other natural resources
according to their real value).
8.3

2. Use of cable lines in densely populated areas.
3. Regulation of the behavior of population and economic entities in the area of
inﬂuence of OTL on the grounds of safety.
4. Protection of workers from the adverse effects of electromagnetic ﬁelds and high
voltage installations
5. Use of technical (technological) measures:
• Optimization of the design of transmission lines supports (for example,
compact transmission lines) and their routes, taking into account environ-
mental effects, Figs. 8.10 and 8.11.
• Use of the combined power transmission lines—placing on the electricity
supports of high and ultra-high voltage transmission wires of lower voltage
class,
• Creation of a transmission plant array of trees and shrubs (preferably fruit
and berry species) with plant height slightly exceeding the height of a man.
Failures in pipelines, while transmitting thermal energy, can lead to city land-
scape destruction (owing to excavations and ﬂooding) and even to human victims.

of the Environmental Protection Problem
Global environmental changes and local environmental disasters have contributed
to the realization to the mid XXth century scale of the problem, especially by the
industrialized countries, which are major polluters of the environment. After the
Great London Smog (5–9 December 1952), which claimed the lives of up to
12 thousand people, scientists began systematic studies of contamination of all
geospheres, regulation of emissions, discharges, and waste disposal, improvement
of cleaning systems, introduction of low-waste technologies, the formation of
regulatory framework environment protection, and management of natural
resources.
The attention to the protection of the environment was moved to the level of
parliaments, governments and international organizations formation of international
environmental organizations (including the UN Commission on Illustration quality
thermal insulation of pipes of thermal energy transport systems. Environment and

Development), and intensive improvement of the relevant legislation. In 1968, a
group of scientists and businesspersons from different countries organized the
Roman Club—the international non-governmental organization aimed at investi-
gating global problems and methods for their solution. The ﬁrst Club report written
by Donella and Denis Meadows, Jorgen Randes, and B.B. Berens entitled “Limits
of Growth” was published in 1972. This report attracted attention of politicians and
scientists all over the world; it stated that the uncontrollable growth of population,
ruthless exploitation of natural resources, and pollution of the environment brought
the threat to the future of humanity. Some people have perceived “Limits of
Growth” as a prediction of the close end of the world.
More than 30 years later the authors of the ﬁrst report have corrected their
computer model and published in 1992 one more report entitled “Outside: Global
Catastrophe or Sustainable Future?” and book entitled “The Limits to Growth: The
30-year Update” [1]. A new Roman Club Report entitled “Factor 5: Transforming
the Global Economy through 80% Increase in Resource Productivity, [2], in which
new solutions of old problems trapping humanity on the way to sustainable
development were suggested. (According to opinion the most of scientists and
experts, this book is one of the best publications devoted to these problems.)
Is the correct style of your life? How to life further? These are the main questions
the authors of this book try to answer. This book deals with economics, technology,
natural resources, and free market. Since the time of industrial revolution, the term
progress taken to mean an increase in the labor productivity. A new approach to the
progress is suggested in the book, which makes an increase in the productivity of
resources the corner stone of the progress. As the authors stated, we could live
twice better and at the same time, spent half as many resources as at present. This is
necessary for the sustainable future development of humanity. A solution is to
increase the efﬁciency of utilization of energy, water, fuel, materials, fertile soil,
etc., often without extra costs and even with proﬁt. As the book demonstrates, the
majority of engineering solutions of our problems have already been obtained; they
must be used right now.
We reasoned in due time about energy-saving policy the quintessence of which
can be expressed in the well-known notice on walls of institutions: “Before leaving,
switch off the light!” Thus, the productive utilization of resources is not new. What
is new is the huge number of unrealized capabilities we have. The authors give tens
of examples from everyday life. They not only provide recommendations (some-
times rather simple) but also realize many of them in practice. The book abounds
with practical examples of technologies that permit more efﬁcient utilization global
resources. It can become a reference book for those who want to understand how
the technology serves purposes of sustainable development and environmental
protection. Unfortunately, in our everyday life we face tens of counterexamples
from taps through which seas of precious pure water escape up to heating mains in
cities that are rebuilt every 3–4 years and nevertheless, their thermal insulation is
such that in winter snow melts over them, Fig. 8.12.

Power Engineering and the Biosphere

There have been numerous attempts to explain how to organize the markets and
to reorganize the system of taxation so that the welfare of people could grow
without increase of the consumption of resources [2].
There are several different approaches to the problem and focuses on whole
sectors of the economy (construction and operation of buildings, production of steel
and cement, agriculture, transport), which are in the world consume the greatest
amount of energy, water and mineral resources and create the greatest amount of
greenhouse gases. It is shown that in all the sectors actually achieve the ﬁvefold
increase resource efﬁciency.
By the early 90s of the XXth century the basis of the concept of sustainable
development well known today has been formed. The concept was adopted in June
1992 at a conference in Rio de Janeiro and conﬁrmed 10 years later in
Johannesburg.
In order to unite the efforts of countries to prevent dangerous climate change and
to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a relatively safe
level, it was adopted in 1994 and entered into force on United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Member countries of the Convention
concluded that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced on a mandatory basis;
controversy is only safe level of emissions.
The global nature of the problem was adopted at the Third Conference of Parties
of the UNFCCC in 1997 in Kyoto (a Japanese city) by a special document, ﬁxing
quantitative commitments by developed countries and countries with economies in
transition limit and reduce greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere, as well as
mechanisms of implementation of these commitments by 2012.

The document is called Kyoto Protocol. According to this document, countries
have committed themselves to control and limitation of polluting emissions into the
atmosphere.
Among the countries that signed the KP, there were those for whom its
implementation carries obvious beneﬁts: economic, social, political, and environ-
mental. However, there were those for whom the manual is not very proﬁtable in
the usual “mundane” sense, primarily because of its “inhibitory” effect on the pace
of industrial development.
One of the main barriers to more efﬁcient utilization of resources is a contra-
diction between the developed and developing countries. For the letter, saving of
resources and careful attitude to nature often retreat in the face of momentary
problems of eradicating poverty they try to solve by choosing the western way of
the development, alas, not free of many errors.
The results obtained for the years of the KP execution (1997–2012) lead to the
conclusion that the KP is only a pilot phase of a global, long-term process aimed at
preventing human impact on climate, and the environment and that the KP
mechanisms are not fully debugged.
The international community will have to overcome the contradictions on the
measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing
countries. (The latter insist on allocating those funds for environmental protection
as a compensation for the pollution of the planet by developed countries in the
past.)
The consequence of these contradictions is modest progress in the development
and coordination of post-Kyoto agreement at international forums in 2009—
Copenhagen (Denmark), 2011—Durban (South Africa), and 2012—Doha (Qatar).
Their main result can be considered as a development scenario for further actions to
limit GHG emissions. In it, all countries are divided into three groups according to
the level of socio-economic development, which deﬁned their obligations to the
world community:
1. Developed countries should cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 60–80%.
2. Major developing countries must start to reduce GHG emissions within 2020–
2030 years.
3. African countries in the XXIst century do not take the commitment to reduce
GHG emissions.
The latest summit dedicated to environment protection (limitation of the
greenhouse
gas
emission)
was
held
in
Paris
(from
30 November
to
12 December 2015.)
Representatives of 196 countries and leaders of 150 countries attended the event.
Some of them took advantage of this podium to emphasize the critical importance
of developing a common approach to solving this problem. Because of nearly two
weeks of discussion, it was concluded the ﬁrst ever global and binding agreement to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions was developed. Governments agreed mandatory,
236

following rigid and transparent rules, to ensure that all countries fulﬁll their com-
mitments. All countries agreed to pursue decline of global warming to below 2 °C.
This made a signiﬁcant contribution to efforts to achieve the declared objectives
in the UN aim—“to save succeeding generations from the disasters.” The agree-
ment resolved the controversy over the ﬁnancial side to solve the problem between
developing and developed countries—in the period before 2020 developing
countries
will
receive
from
other
countries
100 billion
dollars
annually.
UN Secretary General Pan Gi Mun called the agreement “health insurance for the
entire planet.”
For many developing countries, the revolution in the efﬁciency can give the
unique opportunity of prosperity for a sufﬁciently short time period. However, as
was discussed in the World Ecological Forum held in Rio-de-Janeiro in 1992, the
new way of thinking was acceptable not for all people.
In conclusion, of this chapter, we consider one more extremely efﬁcient way of
preservation of the Earth as a cradle and a unique suitable human habitat. This way
of conscious self-restraint and change of the lifestyle is extremely difﬁcult in use.
Life in developed countries differs by an extraordinary high rate of consumption
of natural resources. In particular, these countries burn more than halve the fossil
fuel whereas their population is only 20% of the Earth’s population. Such rate of
consumption of resources is determined by the life standards that have already been
reached by the majority of population of these countries and for which the
remaining countries strive: a separate rather large house and one or better two cars
per family, an opportunity to travel, etc. These standards ﬁnally determine the vital
needs of the society in black and non-ferrous metals, cement, plastic, wood, etc. and
through the necessity to extract, to treat, and to transport all this demands in energy.
A question arises: can the population of developed countries anyhow change
their life standards? Do the old life standards (large house, two cars, etc.) remain so
much attractive if we take into account that following this lifestyle we will soon
convert our Earth into a desert?
Is there any acceptable alternative to this lifestyle? Freedom of moving can be
met with the developed system of public transport, which is certainly more eco-
nomical than personal cars. In addition, as to a large house, may be the life in small
houses (or even in blocks of ﬂats) surrounded by almost wild nature is more
attractive? Such questions evoke a smile now, but it is feared that they will be
unavoidably posed soon in the course of world evolution.
By the way, the transition to this style of life for residents of developed countries
will not necessarily be accompanied by their feelings of loss. Most likely, rea-
sonable self-restraint in combination with high tech will only increase the quality of
life in these countries, though due to new components in comparison with already
existing ones.
It should be emphasized that ecological actions are not attractive to investors and
consequently can be carried out, basically, at the state level for the account of
rationing, stimulation, and budgetary appropriations. For environmental protection,
it is necessary to include in ecological programs actions of all levels aimed at
energy saving, as they are more investment-attractive.

Unconventional (Alternative) Methods
of Electric Energy Production
Most research associated with alternative methods of power generation have con-
centrated on relatively high efﬁciency systems, as this makes commercial realiza-
tion more readily achievable. To eliminate a threat of the forthcoming energy
shortage, we are pinning our hopes on mastering of new power sources and on an
increase in the power of already mastered methods of direct thermal, nuclear, and
chemical energy conversion into electric energy. These methods will radically
increase the efﬁciency of utilization of materials involved in power generation
processes and signiﬁcantly increase the amount of planetary resources accessible
for practical utilization.
In these sources, 2 types of effects are used:
• Physical ones that are manifested in different forms including synthesis of light
elements, photoelectric effect, thermo-electricity, etc. (fusion reactors, ther-
mionic generators, photoelectric batteries, thermionic-emission generators, etc.)
• Chemical ones that are manifested in an energy release in redox reactions of
chemical reactants (galvanic cells, accumulators, etc.).
Controllable thermonuclear fusion (tokamak and inertial (pulsed) thermonuclear
fusion), electrochemical generators (hydrogen power engineering based on fuel
cells) together with thermoelectric, thermal emission, and radioisotope power
sources belong to unconventional methods of electric energy production. At pre-
sent, only the ﬁrst two non-traditional method of producing electrical energy meet
the requirements of large-scale electrical engineering. However, their large-scale
use in the energy sector can be expected only after a few decades. Other methods
mentioned above have already been well utilized for power supply of low-power
consumers. The output of a large power is unlikely and so in this textbook, they are
not considered.
The direct power generation has found the widest acceptance in autonomous
low-power sources for which reliability, compactness, and convenience in service,
and low weight rather than the economic efﬁciency are of great importance. They
are mainly used for data acquisition in almost inaccessible localities of the Earth, in

space, and on board airplanes, vessels, space vehicles, etc. As a rule, conventional
generators, based on combustion of chemical fuel and large-scale method of ther-
mal energy conversion into electric energy, require regular service; therefore, they
are unsuitable for the considered purposes.
The aggregate installed capacity of millions of autonomous electric energy
sources, despite their moderate sizes, exceeds the capacity of all stationary power
plants taken together.

Thermonuclear Power Engineering (Controlled
Thermonuclear Fusion)
One of the possible ways to satisfy the world’s population energy needs is mas-
tering of controlled fusion of light elements—controlled thermonuclear fusion
(CTF)—since virtually inexhaustible power source will be obtained.
The main portion of energy of stars and the Sun, as was proved by Hans Bethe in
1939, is released in the process of synthesis of light elements. If one succeeded in
creating conditions for a controlled thermonuclear reaction of light element fusion
(deuterium, tritium) to occur on the Earth, this, ﬁguratively speaking, will mean the
appearance of the artiﬁcial small suns on our planet capable to satisfy energy needs
of many generations.
For practical use in the energy sector today is considered basically three
reactions:

3H, 4H
three and four helium nuclei, i.e., alpha particles
More clearly, the thermonuclear reaction of fusion of hydrogen isotopes—deu-
terium and tritium is shown in Fig. 9.1.
The reactions (9.1) and (9.2) call priority interest. The ﬁrst—thanks to the largest
number of energy released, the second—because of a simple solution to the
problem of “fuel” and the lack of induced radiation.
It is very important that the fuel for fusion reactors is easily extractable.
Deuterium occurs naturally in water: one of 6700 hydrogen atoms has a deuterium
core. Tritium is less widespread. It is radioactive and has a half-life of 12.3 year, so

that it does not occur naturally in large amounts. However, tritium can be produced
from the lithium or lithium salts in the blanket of the vacuum chamber. Neutrons
ﬂying out of the plasma by reaction with lithium give the most part of energy for
heating lithium and production of tritium.
Reaction (9.2) is attractive, the ﬁrst of all, because Helium-3 (3He) in large
quantities (approximately 500 million tons) is available on the Moon, wherefrom it
can be delivered to the Earth. Several countries have announced plans for mining
minerals on the Moon, especially helium-3: United States, Russia, China, India,
Japan, the European Space Agency, and others. The US has already developed an
appropriate working draft. NASA management proposes to make the project of an
international lunar base, the type of the International Space Station. At that time the
efforts of physicists focused on the technological embodiment of reaction (9.1), i.e.,
on the synthesis of deuterium and tritium, releasing energy in the quantities of
interest to the “big” power engineering. Concerns about fuel for controlled ther-
monuclear fusion (CTF) commercial scale are somewhat premature, taking into
account the complexity of problems in its implementation, on which physicists have
been working for about 60 years.
Despite many-year studies of controlled fusion, construction of an industrial
reactor is still many years in the future. To overcome the natural electrical repul-
sion,
the
nuclei
must
have
signiﬁcant
energy.
The
temperature
of
a
deuterium-tritium mixture must reach, at least, 50 million degrees (for comparison,
the temperature in the center of the Sun is about 15 million degrees). Measured in
electron volts (eV), this temperature is 4500 eV. At this temperature, the electrons
are turned loose from nuclei (in fact, the energy of only 13.56 eV is necessary for
hydrogen atom ionization). The deuterium-tritium mixture in this case represents a
plasma—an electrically neutral gas consisting of positively charged nuclei and
negatively charged electrons.
The maintenance of high plasma temperature is one of the main problems of
thermonuclear research. The plasma loses energy as a result, of several processes.

For example, charged particles in plasma radiate electromagnetic energy in the
process of collisions with each other. In thermonuclear reactions, a huge number of
fast neutrons, which then easily escape from plasma, are produced. The radiation,
heat conduction, and turbulent convection of particles in the plasma are among the
processes resulting in plasma cooling and a decrease in its temperature.
The “plasma ﬁre” can be continuously supported by energy supply from the
outside with the help of radio frequency waves or high-energy beams of neutral
particles. However, there is an efﬁcient self-sustaining source of additional heat—
fast a-particles generated in plasma. These helium nuclei are the “ash” of ther-
monuclear reactions. They are generated with energy of about 3.5 million eV and
are easily conﬁned with a magnetic ﬁeld because they have a double positive
charge. In the process of collisions with plasma particles, a-particles give up energy
to them in the form of heat. Up to now, the researchers have failed to generate
sufﬁcient number of high-energy a-particles in order that to compensate completely
for thermal energy losses.
The researchers call the total average time during which the plasma looses heat
the time of energy conﬁnement or the energy time s. The product of s and plasma
density n characterizes the capability of plasma to conserve heat and is called the
parameter of heat conservation quality. In order that thermonuclear reactions were
self-sustained and gave useful power, the product ns must be greater than 2  1020,
where time is in seconds and density is in the number of particles per cubic meter, at
the temperature T = 10,000 eV (about 100 million degrees). Thus, the thermonu-
clear research is aimed at obtaining the product of three values: n, s and T of about 2
 1024 s eV/m3 (Lowson criterion).
9.1.1
Tokamak
Thermonuclear systems called tokamaks are best suited now for this purpose.
Russian scientists A.D. Sakharov and I.E. Tamm invented this system in early
1950. The name of this system is an abbreviation of Russian words “the toroidal
chamber with a magnetic ﬁeld.” The principles underlying the system operation
with a magnetic ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 9.2.
First the plasma is ignited in a vacuum chamber shaped as a torus. The system of
electromagnets arranged outside of the chamber creates a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
directed along the torus axis. The ﬁeld acts as a hose, which maintains the pressure
inside the plasma and prevents its contact with chamber walls.
Other system of electromagnets arranged in the center of the torus (in the hole) is
used to induce an electric current running in the toroidal direction in the plasma.
This current heats the plasma to a temperature of about 1000 eV. The plasma
current creates its own magnetic ﬁeld encompassing the toroid. This ﬁeld prevents a
drift of plasma particles outside of the region of magnetic conﬁnement. Finally, the
external conductors of the poloidal ﬁeld magnet generate a vertical magnetic ﬁeld

conﬁning the plasma column from upward and downward drifts as well as from
drifts to the left and to the right inside of the chamber.
Up to the middle 60s, the tokamak concept had been systematically investigated
only in the former Soviet Union. L.A. Artsimovich with colleague from the
I.V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy have managed to gain knowledge which
convinced physicists from other countries that the period of energy conﬁnement and
the temperature of plasma in tokamaks are promising for CTF implementation.
Their achievements gave impetus to the research of tokamaks in a number of the
world’s leading countries.
It is important that research on controlled thermonuclear fusion is international
in character. When visiting England with our governmental delegacy in 1956,
Academician I.V. Kurchatov told about the most interesting results obtained in this
area in our country. Later other countries followed the example of the Soviet Union.
It turned out that, working independently and secretly, the scientists of different
countries came to the same ideas of implementation of controlled thermonuclear
fusion. Since then these studies has become open with wide exchange by the results
and discussion of perspective ideas.
As a result, the tokamak design has been signiﬁcantly improved. In the middle
70s, a temperature of 3000 eV and a parameter of conﬁnement quality of about
1018 s/m3 were realized in tokamaks. At present, a plasma temperature of
30,000 eV and a conﬁnement quality parameter of 2  1019 s/m3 are realized in the
most powerful experimental systems of this type including JET (Joint European
Torus), JT-60 (Japan), and TFTR (Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor being an exper-
imental thermonuclear reactor) tokamaks and DIII-D system (USA). In 1970–1990,
the product of density, conﬁnement time, and temperature increased more than
100 times.

Qualitatively new stage of collaboration in solving the CTF problem started in
1985, when the leaders of the USSR and USA (M.S. Gorbachev and R. Reagan)
appeal for international collaboration in mastering thermonuclear energy for the
beneﬁt of humanity when they met in Geneva. In respond to this appeal, the engineers
and scientists participating in four leading programs of research on thermonuclear
fusion carried out in the European Community Countries, Japan, the USSR, and the
USA decided to start in 1987 joint design of the experimental thermonuclear system.
They called it International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).
Despite a deﬁnite progress in experiments on tokamaks, some problems still
remain to be solved. The researchers have not yet elucidated the fundamental nature
of turbulent heat and particle transfer crosswise the force lines of a magnetic ﬁeld—
the process that reduces the plasma temperature. The knowledge of physics of
combustion and sustenance of thermonuclear combustion is also incomplete. These
problems will be investigated on the ITER. The ITER Project is aimed at the
provision of conditions of ignition and long-term thermonuclear combustion, typ-
ical of an actual thermonuclear reactor, as well as at testing and demonstrating
technologies of practical application of controlled fusion, Fig. 9.3.

The experimental reactor under construction will be largest of tokamaks ever
constructed: its altitude is 30 m and its diameter is 30 m. The plasma volume in the
reactor (850 m3) is also very large; the current in the plasma is 15 MA. A designed
capacity of the thermonuclear reactor will be 500 MW for 400 s. This time will
then be increased to 300 s to enable the researchers to study for the ﬁrst time the
physics of thermonuclear combustion in the plasma.
According to the expert estimates, the cost of the ITER design and construction
will be about 7.5 billion dollars. More than 200 institutions are involved in the
project implementation only from the Russian party.
Upon completion of the reactor, the ITER program will consist of two main
stages. The ﬁrst stage, called physical one, will last for 6–8 years. In this time, the
researchers will try to provide conditions for ignition and long-term combustion
typical of high-power thermonuclear reactor. After putting into operation and full
testing, research will be focused on the sustenance of the stable plasma and the
provision of conditions for deuterium-tritium fusion. Effects of plasma heating by
a-particles, dynamics, and control of plasma combustion will also be studied
together with diffusion and elimination of helium once the helium nuclei have given
up all their energy to the plasma. The second stage will be a long-standing program
of solving technical and engineering problems. Many technologies will be
demonstrated already at the physical stage. The most important among these
technologies are the operation of superconducting electromagnets, systems of
plasma heating and maintenance of the current, systems for fuel feeding and
deleting “ash,” instruments for remote servicing and maintenance, and external
supporting systems. In the technological stage, the integral characteristics and
reliability of the equipment will be tested as well as alternative materials and
designs.
The design and engineering work must result in the creation of the ITER reactor
with a design capacity of 1000 MW generated in the process of fusion of deuterium
and tritium. This will be a considerable achievement. The expected thermonuclear
yield will be about three orders of magnitude greater than that already produced by
the JET being the most powerful thermonuclear reactor now.
The capability to generate thermonuclear power 1000 times greater than that
produced by the existing experimental systems will make the ITER the penultimate
stage for the practical implementation of controlled thermonuclear fusion.
After repeated corrections due to unforeseen technical and organizational
problems, the coordinating center has approved the following schedule of the
project:
• 2010–2019—the construction of ITER,
• 2020—a pilot launch,
• 2020–2037—experimenting, testing of all ITER systems,
• 2050—creation of the demonstrational thermonuclear power plant (project
“DEMO”). Its most likely power circuit shown in Fig. 9.4.

Now the USA, Russia, EU, Japan, China, South Korea and India are involved in
the project ITER. Brazil, Kazakhstan, Canada, Mexico also express the desire to
take part in the project.
9.1.2
Inertial (Pulsed) Thermonuclear Fusion
Almost simultaneously with the development of tokamaks, another scheme of the
thermonuclear reaction of fusion was launched—the creation of pulsed systems
using the effect of pinching (compression) of the plasma column containing ther-
monuclear fuel or compression of deuterium-tritium target with the help of the
compression effects of powerful ion beams or laser pulses.
The compression fusion reactors with gaseous or solid thermonuclear fuel in the
initial state enclosed in a spherical shell is exposed to ion beams or high-power
pulses of electromagnetic radiation (laser or X-ray) from external sources. Under
the action of radiation, shell material evaporates and creates a reactive force that can
compress and heat membrane and fuel to the densities and temperatures under
which the Lawson criterion is fulﬁlled, Fig. 9.5.
This reaction is called “Inertial thermonuclear fusion (ITF)”. Developed coun-
tries (the USA, the USSR, GB, France et al.) have started the realization this idea in
the 60s the last century.
This direction, which is in many respects alternative to the ﬁrst one, instead of
the conﬁnement of unstable plasmoids, is oriented at the creation of conditions (the
plasma density) under which the main portion of thermonuclear fuel would be
depleted faster than these plasmoids are separated. The time-dependent parameters

deuterium and tritium

Unconventional (Alternative) Methods of Electric …
www.ebook3000.com

of this process are determined by the inertia of the fuel mixture. In the creation of a
pulse thermonuclear reactor, the problem of plasma conﬁnement is transformed into
the problem of plasma heating for a very short time. At present, the creation of
pulse thermonuclear reactors is at the stage of substantiation of conceptual projects.
In order to achieve the desired results in the ﬁeld of the laser pulse and ion beam
ITF, technical problems of enormous complexity must be solved. It is necessary to
ensure that:
• high-power lasers and accelerators (with a peak power at 1015 W) operated in
high-frequency mode (10–100 shots per second);
• their efﬁciency is increased from current 0.3 to 10–15% (at least);
• compression of the target by means of laser pulses or ions beams is uniform;
• long-term resistance to shock loads of materials at high temperatures must be
provided (in explosion of only one target energy is released of several tens of
kWh), and others.
The application of pulsed thermonuclear reactors for the construction of power
plants will also face economic challenges: extremely high cost of construction and
operation of stations and, as a consequence, high price of electricity produced.
Nevertheless, nevertheless, it is the direction in the development of fusion continues
to develop in England, France, America, Japan, and Russia.
The efforts of scientists have resulted in the fact that now pulse thermonuclear
fusion starts to compete by a number of parameters with the more conventional
magnetic plasma conﬁnement.
The development of thermonuclear reactors operating in the short pulse mode
upon exposure to laser or ion beams depends largely on the creation of
high-efﬁciency lasers and high-current accelerators. Nowadays their efﬁciency is
still very low.

The complex problem is the development of a system of utilization of ther-
monuclear energy that would be capable to escape harm under conditions of
repeated explosions of deuterium-tritium tablets upon exposure to laser or ion
beams. To obtain an acceptable energy output, rather high frequency of explosion
repetition is required, similar to that of ignition of a fuel mixture in an internal
combustion engine.
Assessing the prospects for thermonuclear power engineering, we can say that it
is promising given if it not were comparing with coal or gas power engineering. By
physical principles, it is closer to nuclear power engineering. In this case, we can
expect beneﬁts from the thermonuclear power engineering.
1. Caloriﬁc value of the thermonuclear fuel is signiﬁcantly higher than that of
nuclear—in synthesis 1 g of D-T mixture, is 8 times more energy is released
than in fusion of 1 g of uranium (10–20 million times more than by burning of
1 g of fossil fuel).
2. Thermonuclear power plant is approximately two orders of magnitude safer,
then nuclear power plant. The fusion reactors are environmentally safe. The
random start of the reactor is impossible, since the amounts of deuterium and
tritium in the unit in any given moment are very small. During uncontrollable
combustion, all fuel will be fast spent, and the process will be terminated. In
addition, only not radioactive fast neutrons and a-particles (helium nuclei) are
created due to fusion of deuterium and tritium nuclei. The main problems of
irradiation are due to the secondary processes. The high-energy neutrons can
cause the transmutation of nuclei in the reactor materials and components, and
they can become radioactive. However, investigations have demonstrated that
the proper choice of structural materials will allow such induced activity to be
kept on a very low level.
The above materials explain the reasons for caution in forecasting the timing of
the creation of fusion power plants and even the possibility of solving this problem
in the near future [1].
9.2
Hydrogen Power Engineering (Based on Fuel Cells)
Hydrogen energy technologies in most EU countries, the USA, Japan, as well as in
Russia, are included in the list of critical technologies, the level of which depends
on the economic well-being and security of the country. The results of research in
recent years, escalating energy and environmental issues determine the main
directions of development of a new market of hydrogen technologies and the use of
hydrogen as a clean energy source in the near future.
A common term “hydrogen economy” refers to the economy based on the
complete replacement of non-renewable sources; hydrogen fuel energy can reduce
emissions of greenhouse gas and harmful substances into the environment. Global
250

demand for hydrogen to 2050 will be 200–300 million tons, and by 2100–800–
1000 million tons.
Hydrogen as an energy source is characterized by the following properties:
• Hydrogen stocks are practically non-exhaustible, but in free state it is virtually
absent in nature;
• Hydrogen is an universal energy source; it can be used as fuel for electricity
generation in the working cycles of different types and as an energy carrier, it is
suitable for the transportation in gas, liquid, and bound states;
• Hydrogen can be used for energy storage.
Among other types of fossil fuels, hydrogen has the greatest caloriﬁc value per
unit weight and the least negative impact on the environment. The energy content of
1 g of hydrogen is equivalent to the energy content of about 3 g of gasoline. When
using hydrogen in fuel cells due to their high efﬁciency (1.5–3 times higher than
that of the internal combustion engine), hydrogen fuel efﬁciency is 4–10 times
higher.
When switching to hydrogen fuel, new technical problems inevitable—after
receiving it must be compressed, liqueﬁed or saturated by special materials (metal
hydrides, chemical hydrides, carbon-based structures) to accumulate it in large
amounts, and then transported by care or marine vehicles and stored in storage
systems to deliver to user. The life cycle of hydrogen is complete after its
consumption.
The main methods producing of hydrogen today is the steam reforming of
hydrocarbons (ﬁrst of all methane) and electrolytic decomposition of water. It is
planned to produce hydrogen by thermalizes of water at temperatures higher than
2000 °C achievable in high-temperature nuclear reactors and in the focus of sun-
rays. There are suppositions on possibilities of its extraction as a fossil raw material
or using step photo catalysis in a set of chemical reactions characteristic of living
plants.
Two ways of hydrogen utilization are used today:
• Direct conversion of hydrogen into electricity with help of fuel cells, which can
be used simultaneously as electric energy storage devices.
• Burning of hydrogen as the ordinary fuel in some critical technologies:
– To increase the activity of coal fuel in the powerful boilers of TPP (com-
bustion of hydrogen with the steam can signiﬁcantly improve the parameters
of the steam and consequently achieve a higher efﬁciency of the steam
turbine (55%);
– To boost operation of turbine unit in the thermal and nuclear power plants
during peak load in the electrical network;
– To overheat steam in order to increase the efﬁciency of turbine generators
(by 1–7.5%) in operation of TPP and NPP.
The fuel cell (FC) is the device, which converts the energy of a chemical reaction
directly into electrical energy. The process here involves the oxidation of an
9.2
Hydrogen Power Engineering (Based on Fuel Cells)
251

external fuel, which is normally a hydrogen-rich gas, and an oxidant, which is
usually atmospheric oxygen, Fig. 9.6.
The oxygen-hydrogen cells are most developed. The cell can operate at room
temperature and atmospheric pressure, but the efﬁciency of electrochemical process
signiﬁcantly increased with temperature and pressure.
The electrodes in the fuel cell are porous. The positive hydrogen ions are
transferred through the electrolyte to the anode. The remaining electrons produce a
negative potential and are displaced to the cathode in the external circuit. The
oxygen atoms located on the cathode attach electrons and form negative ions; the
latter are combed with the hydrogen atoms from water and then are transferred into
the solution in the form of hydroxyl ions OH–. The hydroxyl ions, combining with
hydrogen ions, form water molecules. Thus, with continuous supply of hydrogen
and oxygen, the continuous reaction of fuel oxidation by ions takes place with the
simultaneous ﬂow of current in the external circuit. Since the voltage on the cell
leads is low (of the order of 1 V), the cells are connected in series to form a battery.
The efﬁciency of fuel cells is very high. Theoretically, it is close to 100%, and in
practice, it is 60–80%. The generation efﬁciency is much higher in a FC cell at
scales even up to several megawatts, it has a higher power density, lower vibration
characteristics, and reduced emission of pollutants. (In 1893, German physicist and
chemist W. Nernst calculated, that the theoretical efﬁciency of electrochemical
process of coal chemical energy conversion into the electric one is 99.75%.)

Utilization of hydrogen as the fuel leads to high total expense of operation of the
fuel cells; that is why the opportunity of using other fuels, primarily natural and
gases from special enterprises, is explored. As is will known, gas is a relatively
cheap fuel. Unfortunately, the rate of gas oxidation reaction is high enough only at
high temperatures (800–1200 K), which gives no possibility of using aqueous alkali
solutions as electrolytes. In this case, solid electrolytes with ionic conductivity must
be used.
Another complication is that many fuel cells cannot operate effectively using a
raw hydrocarbon fuel; most types require a reformer, which converts hydrocarbon
into a hydrogen-rich gas suitable for passing directly into the fuel cell. There are
many types of FC. The two main types of FC being developed at present are the
Solid Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) and the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).
The type of electrolyte used therein distinguishes these two main classes. This in
turn determines their operating temperature.
The PEFC is based upon a proton conducting polyﬂuorosulphonic membrane
with ﬁnely dispersed platinum electrodes upon a porous carbon matrix. Machined
carbon or steel plates are utilized as bipolar plates to form series stacks. The PEFC
operates at temperatures below 100 °C. It is a potentially clean method of gener-
ating electricity, which is noiseless, robust and efﬁcient. Some PEFCs are com-
mercially available for demonstration or early application at 1–5 kW for combined
heat and power production and up to 25 kW for transport. Expected lifetime is still
only a few thousand hours for the stack, but system lifetime is expected eventually
to be in the range of 8–20 years.
The SOFC typically comprises a nickel zirconia cermet anode, yttrium stabilized
zirconium electrolyte, lanthanum strontium manganite cathode, and a chrome-based
alloy interconnect. The SOFC operates at much higher temperatures than the PEFC,
in the region of 850–1000 °C. It has high electrical efﬁciency together with
high-grade exhaust heat. Therefore, important applications for the SOFC are in the
combined heat and power production and in other applications where a signiﬁcant
heat load is present.
Advantages of the SOFC are very high electrical efﬁciency, the ability to utilize
conventional fuels such as natural gas with limited processing. Typical power
ratings are in the range 150–250 kW and life expectancy is 5–20 years, with
adequate maintenance. The ﬁrst demonstration systems in the range 1–2 kW have
recently become commercially available, normally in combined heat and power
production with about 10 kW thermal output.
At present, the work is underway on the creation of efﬁcient high-temperature
fuel cells. The speciﬁc output power of fuel cells is still low. It is several times
lower than the speciﬁc output power of internal-combustion engines. However,
advances in electrochemistry and structural modernization of fuel cells will make
the use of fuel cells for motor-vehicle transport and power engineering quite pos-
sible. The fuel cells are noiseless; they do not pollute the atmosphere.
In the USA the project FutureGen and in China the project GreenGen for the
construction of power plants based on fuel cells are realized. Because of the project
9.2
Hydrogen Power Engineering (Based on Fuel Cells)
253

GreenGen realization, total capacity of power plants in China will amount to
650 MW.
Focusing on the achievements of research and development, we can predict the
further decrease in unit cost of alkaline fuel cells due to the development of
large-scale production. These cells with capacity from 10 to 40 kW are already used
in stationary and mobile power plants.
Because the FC permits not only generation of electric power from fuel, but also
production of hydrogen from water in regeneration, it has a relatively broad
spectrum of functional capabilities. Promising and already implemented applica-
tions of the FC (power range from mille watts to megawatts) are:
1. Stationary applications:
• production of electricity (at power plants),
• emergency power sources,
• autonomous power supply.
2. Transport:
• electric vehicles,
• sea transport,
• railway transport and mine equipment,
• auxiliary transport (forklift trucks, airport equipment, and so on).
3. On-board power supply:
• aviation and space,
• submarines and maritime means of transport.
4. Mobile devices:
• portable electronics,
• mobile phones,
• chargers for the army.
When using fuel cells in power engineering, problem arises of their connection
with a grid to transfer electric power to it. FC is used with a three-phase grid when
their power is above 10 kW. With an increase in power, DC-converters with gal-
vanic uncoupling of the output buses from the power sources are mainly employed.
Inverter directly connected to the grid or load is also based on completely con-
trollable switches of the corresponding power [2].
Powerful hybrid systems (10 MW or more) operate with output voltages up to
10 kV, based on integrated gate-commutated turn-off thyristors (IGCT) and insu-
lated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). Micro turbine has a generator producing
voltage sent to a three-phase rectiﬁer and then to the common DC-buses of the
system. The output inverter of the system, based on IGCT, corresponding to an
input voltage of 6 kV.
Low-power systems (up to 10 kW) are usually employed with a single-phase
grid. The source for the fuel cell is selected so as to ensure the mean rated power,
254

Unconventional (Alternative) Methods of Electric …
www.ebook3000.com

whereas the peak loads must be covered by an energy store such as a battery.
A simpliﬁed block diagram of the fuel cell connection is shown in Fig. 9.7.
The basic power components are a DC-converter and an inverter. To produce a
more compact system, a high-frequency element is generally included. Its output is
connected to a transformer T with the required output voltage. In such structures,
both DC and AC-output channels are possible. To improve the size and mass of the
unit, DC-converter with galvanic uncoupling may also be employed. In that case, an
inverter without an output transformer is connected to the output of the
DC-converter.
FC has been successfully used in uninterruptible power sources (UPSs). The FC
is connected to a traditional UPS with battery storage. This signiﬁcantly increases
the possible operating period of the uninterruptible source.

Conclusion
In conclusion, I would like to formulate two points that, I hope, will help you to
distinguish the reality from speculation that loaded mass media.
1. Currently, the main problem in the world energy is not a lack of energy
resources, but lack of sufﬁcient investment in their exploration and transfor-
mation into electrical and thermal energy. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, the global
shortage of energy resources does not threaten to humanity.
In the more distant future, output is likely to be found in the form of a transition
to a fundamentally new technology, not yet known to us. The founder and head of
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Sheikh Ahmed Zaki
Yamani, said: “The Stone Age ended not because the world ran out of stones. So
the oil age will end not because oil is over, but because there will be new
technologies.”
2. A real threat to the sustainable development of civilization comes from
increasing destructive impact of industry on the environment, primarily from
companies and enterprises fuel and power complex.
In the textbook it has been shown on the basis of actual quantitative data that
both problems are inﬂuencing just now on all sides of public life: politics, life
standard, health of people, technology etc.
Present and, especially, next generations of scientists and experts have to be
ready to eliminate these threats, to undertake measures for their removal or, at least,
for their decrease. There are not so many methods (ways) to do this:
1. Increase of the efﬁciency of non-renewable power generating resources. It
means energy—sawing behavior of the energy producers (suppliers) and energy
consumers, which includes:
• application of energy saving technologies of energy production, transmis-
sion, distribution, and consumption;
• energy saving behavior of people in everyday life, including corresponding
correction of the way of life.

2. Radical enlargement of the scale of unconventional renewable energy sources
use.
3. Search for and mastering of new (unconventional) methods of electric and
thermal energy production.
4. The governments of different countries and the management of corresponding
companies should render comprehensive support to the use of renewable energy
sources and new ways of producing electricity, at least until they become suf-
ﬁciently competitive.
5. Realization of measures for environmental protection from any kind of
pollution.
To achieve the goals, they need to be fully realized.According to forecasts of
scientists, the implementation of these measures will be the essence of the global
energy revolution, which will happen in the twenty-ﬁrst century and will be an
essential part of the third industrial revolution.
Four groups of factors will determine the beginning and the pace of
development:
(1) economic—the need for investment in large volumes,
(2) technological—requiring rapid change of technological modes,
(3) social—(a) rapid population growth in developing countries, and (b) inability
to quickly change the existing way of life,
(4) global (in the historical and geographical aspects)—the uneven distribution of
energy resources across countries and regions.
The most likely scenario for the development of civilization, in which electric
power is mainly based on conventional primary energy—coal, gas, oil, and hydro
and nuclear fuel, expanded use of renewable energy sources, and some of the
known non-traditional ways to produce electricity. In the coming decades, any new
sources of energy or fundamentally new methods of producing electricity and heat
cannot be seen.
In the face of increasing globalization, the main feature of the electric power
industry of the XXIst century will be further development of electric power systems
and their integration as a cross-country in Eurasia and North America, as well as
full implementation of the concept of Smart Grid.
To eliminate the global threat to peace, it is vital to create of a civilized energy
market—the market—providing a balance of interests of buyers and sellers.
