Preface to the Second Edition
Since the ﬁrst edition was written (2007–2009), many changes in the energy posture of the USA
as well as the rest of the world have taken place. The second edition has been signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by these changes. Two chapters have been added: one addressing electric and hybrid
vehicles (Chapter 16) and one examining enhanced oil and gas recovery (via hydraulic
fracturing) and its ramiﬁcations (Chapter 17). All of the chapters have been revised and
modernized and have had, in many instances, substantial additions. When possible, quantitative
information has been updated to the current data available. These data include documented
energy usages, energy resource/usages projections, and energy systems’ and components’
performance metrics and availability. The number of web sites cited in the second edition is
substantially greater than in the ﬁrst edition. All cited web sites were active as of December 2016.
However, web sites are updated (and renamed) frequently, but using a search engine with a
reasonably complete descriptor will usually redirect to an appropriate site. Since the ﬁrst edition,
useful quantitative information in many company and government agency web sites has been
reduced in favor of more words, pictures and illustrations. If sufﬁcient quantitative information
is not available on a company/agency web site, queries to that company/agency will often result
in securing such metrics.
The theme of the ﬁrst edition, namely alternative energy sources and the alternative use of
existing energy sources, has been continued in the second. Chapter 16, Transportation and
Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, was added because electric and hybrid vehicles offer alternatives
and efﬁciency enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine powered vehicles.
Chapter 17, Hydraulic Fracturing, Oil, Natural Gas, and the New Reality, was added because
enhanced oil and gas recovery has dramatically shifted the energy posture/outlook of many
countries. Every topic has been impacted by advances in technology and changes in emphasis.
Examples include consideration of new installed hydroelectric capacity, signiﬁcant increase in
wind energy installed capacity, backlog for combustion turbine orders, growth in solar thermal
usage, recognition of passive solar advantages, decreasing photovoltaic cell cost per kilowatt
enhancing economic attractiveness, advances in fuel cell commercialization, combined heat and
power industrial/commercial market penetration, biofuels focus areas diversity, geothermal
energy successes and advances, ocean energy potential recognition, renewed interest in nuclear
power, hybrid/electric vehicle sales up, and hydraulic fracturing impacts. Since the ﬁrst edition,
the energy concerns of the USA have to some extent diminished, but technically, politically,
environmentally, and economically, energy issues, including climate change, have become more
divisive. Indeed, in the year 2000 few predicted that the USA would dramatically reduce its
energy imports and, perhaps, even become an energy exporting nation.
Enhanced oil and gas recovery has resulted in unexpected increases in domestic fossil fuel
production and in the proved reserves of both crude oil and natural gas. However, even if
enhanced oil and gas recovery were to provide, in the short term, acceptable energy resources
for the USA and the rest of the world, other considerations (greenhouse gas emissions,

xiv
Preface to the Second Edition
environmental effects, climate change, long-term availability, for example) require that alter­
native energy sources and alternative uses of existing resources be a part of meeting future
energy requirements. Hence, the topics of this textbook are very germane for the future. The
identiﬁcation of additional fossil fuel resources has essentially provided more time to discover,
implement, and develop other, more sustainable and more environmentally-friendly energy
resources.
Review questions and exercises, at the end of each chapter in the ﬁrst edition, are available on
the companion web site for this book rather than at the end of each chapter.
I appreciate all the comments, corrections, and suggestions for the ﬁrst edition received from
colleagues. The corrections were implemented and the comments and suggestions considered
for the second edition.
Additionally, thanks are due to Professors Tejas S. Pandya, Paul Stewart, Sangaraju
Shanmugam, Samuel Sih, Xianchang Li and Alison Subiantoro who reviewed the manuscript;
their comments were insightful and helpful.

Preface to the First Edition
In recent years much has been made of the impact of the myriad energy problems faced not only
by the United States, but also the rest of the world. These impacts range from energy security
issues (the dependence on imported energy sources) to economic issues (gasoline reached
$4.00/gallon in the summer of 2008) to energy sustainability issues (minimum environmental
and ecological impacts). Many in the engineering, corporate, and political communities
advocate greater reliance on alternative energy sources. Because of the increased interests in
such topics, a number of books on subjects ranging from sustainable energy to renewable energy
to alternative energy have been offered in recent years. However, many of these books contain
mostly qualitative information with little in the way of quantitative information or “engineering”
calculations or procedures. Some also advocate speciﬁc alternative energy scenarios and some
do not present balanced discussions. This textbook was written to address the above concerns.
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications is suitable for use at the senior or beginning
graduate level for students in mechanical engineering or in energy-engineering related ﬁelds.
Familiarity with the basic concepts of ﬂuid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer is
presumed in the development of the topics in the book, but maturity in these subjects is not
needed in order to understand the developments.
The title, Alternative Energy Systems and Applications, is used to convey the idea that the
topics covered encompass both alternative energy sources and alternative uses of existing
energy sources. The solution to the current energy dilemma will contain features of both. The
breadth of topics proposed for the book is delineated in the chapter headings. Chapter 1
critically examines energy usage in the United States. Although not explicitly subdivided into
congruent topical areas, Chapters 2–5 treat turbomachine-based topics (hydro, wind, and
combustion turbines), Chapters 6–9 consider solar-based topics (active, passive, and photo­
voltaic), Chapters 10–11 examine fuel cells and CHP (combined heating and power) applica­
tions, and Chapters 12–15 complete the review of alternative energy concepts (biomass,
geothermal, ocean, and nuclear).
All chapters except chapter 1 broadly ﬁt into one of two categories—(1) a review of the
background information necessary for a topic or (2) an exploration of an alternative energy
source or an alternative use of an existing energy source. Chapters 2 and 6, for example, are used
to review the backgrounds necessary for turbomachines and solar energy, respectively.
Often alternative energy topics are equated to renewable energy resource discussions. In this
book, Chapters 3–4 and 7–9 consider topics usually associated with renewable energy
resources.The chapters dealing with renewable energy topics present the physical principles
involved in harvesting the renewable, review (in most cases) the amount of the renewable
resource available, examine quantitative aspects of the harvesting, point out difﬁculties with
utilizing the renewable resource, discuss limitations and economics aspects, and provide, if
applicable, examples of commercial systems for harvesting the renewable. Where appropriate,
website addresses are cited.

xvi
Preface to the First Edition
The chapters addressing alternative uses of existing energy sources are focused on applica­
tions. Combustion turbines, fuel cells, and CHP systems represent alternative uses of existing
energy sources.The application chapters basically discuss the operation, the thermodynamic
aspects, and the expected efﬁciencies of such systems and provide examples. As with the
renewable energy topics, suitable websites are referenced.
All chapters, except Chapter 1, contain worked examples and review questions and exercise
problems. The focus is on ﬁrst-order engineering calculations. Mathcad® is used as the
computational software system throughout the book. However, the examples/problems are
fundamental, and many other computational systems (MATLAB®, EES, Mathematica®) could
be readily adopted for use with little effort. The intent of the book is to provide students with a
quantitative approach to alternative energy sources and alternate applications of existing energy
sources. Since this is a survey textbook, it does not attempt to provide detailed engineering
information on the topics discussed, but references are provided that do contain detailed
engineering information.
This textbook is the outgrowth of several years of teaching ME 4353/6353 Alternate Energy
Sources in the Bagley College of Engineering at Mississippi State University. The discretionary
funds provided to me as holder of the Tennessee Valley Authority Professorship in Energy
Systems and the Environment at Mississippi State University were very helpful in this endeavor
and are acknowledged. Additionally, thanks are due to Professors Francis Kulacki, James
Mathias, and David Ruzic who reviewed the manuscript.Their comments and insights were
quite useful.

Energy Usage in the USA and the World
1.1
Energy and Power
A review of the customary units used for energy and power is appropriate to initiate a study of
alternative energy sources and applications. Although much of the world uses the SI system
(Le Système International d’Unités), the USA, in addition to the SI system, also uses the English
Engineering and the British Gravitational systems of units. The unit of energy in the SI system is
the newton meter (N m) which is deﬁned as the joule (J). Energy in the English Engineering
system is deﬁned as the British thermal unit (Btu), or alternately, the foot-pound force (ft lbf);
the conversion factor is 1 Btu  778:16 ft lbf. Power is the rate of energy usage or transfer, in
joules per second, British thermal units per second, or foot-pound force per second. Power
expressed in joules per second is deﬁned as the watt (W). The most frequently used power unit
is 1000 W or 1 kW. In the USA, power is sometimes expressed in terms of horsepower (hp),
where 1 hp is 550 ft lbf/s or 0.7457 kW. The kilowatt-hour (kW h) is a frequently used unit of
energy and represents an energy rate (kilowatts) times a time (hour). The conversion is
3412:14 Btu  1 kW h. Anyone engaged in an energy engineering activity needs to remember
the conversion between British thermal units and kilowatt-hours; in most instances 3412 Btu 
1 kW h is used.
Tester et al. (2012) provide a sampling of power expended for various activities. Some of their
results are reproduced as Table 1.1.
The range of power expended is astonishing, about nine orders of magnitude. The entries of
Table 1.1 indicate various levels of power expended referenced to everyday experiences and can
be used to establish a sense of numeracy for power magnitudes.
1.2
Energy Usage and Standard of Living
An irrefutable fact is that developed countries (e.g., USA, Japan, UK) use more energy per capita
than less-developed countries (e.g., Mexico, Indonesia). Figure 1.1 graphically presents the HDI
(Human Development Index) as a function of the kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) per capita
per year. The HDI is a measure of the standard of living, and the kilograms of oil equivalent per
capita per year is indicative of the energy consumption. The industrialized nations have HDI
values in excess of 0.9, while many of the developing countries’ HDI values are dramatically less.
The correlation between HDI and kilowatt-hour usage is functionally very strong. However,
once a threshold of about 3000 kgoe per capita is reached, further increases in electricity usage
do not produce a higher HDI. Iceland has the highest HDI, followed by the USA. Some countries
with the higher kilowatt-hour usage have large infrastructure length scales and traditions of
abundant energy. One of the main themes from Golemberg and Johansson (2004) is that the
only way to increase the HDI in developing nations is to increase their energy usage.

An alternative approach is to examine the gross national product (GNP) per capita as a function
of the energy consumption per capita. Figure 1.2a was developed using World Bank information
from 1992. Figure 1.2b was developed from more recent World Bank data. The more recent data
were mostly from 2012–2013, although data from some developing countries were less recent.A graph is plotted between HDI on the y-axis (on a scale of 0.2–1.0) and per capital energy consumption on the x-axis (on a scale of 0–13000 kgoe/capital) for various countries. The graph represents that the industrialized nations have HDI values in excess of 0.9, while many of the developing countries’ HDI values are dramatically less.

The graph plotted in part (a) is from 1992 World Bank data with the y and x-axes on a scale of 0–350 GJ and US $0–30 (thousands), respectively. The graph plotted in part (b) is from recent World Bank data with the y and x-axes on a scale of 0–10 (thousands) (kg oil per capita) and US $0–70 (thousands), respectively.

data. Source: Tester et al. (2005). (b) Recent World Bank data (www.worldbank.org, 2012–2013).
The energy usage per capita information from the World Bank is presented in kilograms of oil
equivalent per capita; hence, the ordinates for Figure 1.2a and b are in different energy units and
the abscissas, in dollars,are notadjusted for inﬂation. A comparison of Figure 1.2a and b reveals no
signiﬁcant differences in relative positions for the developed countries, but China has made real
gains in GNP per capita since the 1992 data, and, as expected, the energy use per capita has
increased relative to other developing countries since 1992. In Figures 1.1 and 1.2, the USA
exhibits per capita kilowatt-hours and energy usages that are large even for developed countries.
A number of reasonsexist forthehigh energy consumption per capitain theUSA; amongthem are
(1) historically cheap energy, (2) low population density, (3) large area (large infrastructure length
scale), and (4) historically an abundance of domestic energy.
Starting with the ﬁrst “energy crisis” of the late 1970s, low energy costs and domestic energy
abundance seemingly vanished from the USA. From the 1970s through to about 2005, the
USA required increasing energy imports (chieﬂy in the form of petroleum) and nearly

4
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
monotonic energy cost price escalations. The dependence on energy imports dramatically
affected both the economy and the foreign policy posture of the USA. Indeed, the basis of the
ﬁrst edition of this textbook was the need to consider both alternative energy sources and
alternative (read more efﬁcient utilization) energy applications to address the energy
problems faced in the USA. Since about 2005, increased domestic production of fossil fuels
(by enhanced oil recovery via “hydraulic fracturing”) and identiﬁcation of heretofore
undiscovered natural gas reserves have altered the expected increases in both energy imports
and energy prices. In effect, the US energy economy is being given another chance to reduce
energy cost economic impacts via enhanced energy efﬁciency of existing resources.
Chapter 17 examines this topic.
The energy problems in the USA are exacerbated by the demand and expectation of countries
(e.g., India and China) to increase the standard of living for their citizens. World energy
consumption is rising faster than energy consumption in the USA. Section 1.5 examines world
energy consumption patterns.
1.3
A Historical Perspective of Energy Usage in the USA
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy provides a readily
accessible and up-to-date source of energy statistics. The EIA web site is www.eia.doe.gov.
The EIA provides on a timely basis monthly and yearly energy statistics for the USA. These
monthly energy statistics are available in the Monthly Energy Review (MER), and a yearly
energy summary appears in the Annual Energy Review (AER) about 8 months after the end
of the calendar year and can be accessed from www.eia.doe.gov/aer. As of 2012, the AER
has been suspended because of budget concerns. The suspension of the AER is quite
unfortunate as it was arguably the most useful of the EIA periodic documents. The basis for
the information contained herein is from the MERs available online at www.eia.gov/
totalenergy/data/monthly/.

Consider how the USA arrived at its current energy economy. Figure 1.4, taken from the EIA
data, presents a graphical representation of the historical energy utilization. The energy usage
unit used is the quad (quadrillion Btu is 1015 Btu). Until the mid-1800s, energy utilization was
mostly wood, with coal becoming increasingly important after 1850. By 1900, coal usage was
much greater than wood, and petroleum was becoming more important as an energy source.
And in 1950, petroleum usage exceeded coal usage, and natural gas usage was dramatically
rising. At the millennium, petroleum provided the most energy, with natural gas and coal vying
for second and third place. Nuclear power was in fourth place, with hydroelectric and renewable
energy (including wood) sources making the smallest contributions. Details of the energy
utilization in 2014 will be explored in Section 1.4.
The genesis of the energy problem is illustrated in Figure 1.5. Until about 1950, the USA had
little dependence on energy imports. However, with the post-World War II prosperity, energy
exports began to increase since consumption increased faster than domestic production. From
the 1980s to the early 2000s, domestic production increased, but at a rate slower than
consumption increased. The result has been a steady increase in energy imports. However,
starting about 2005, as demonstrated in Figure 1.6, the result of enhanced domestic production
has resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in energy-related imports. Much of the increasedFigure depicting a line graph plotted between energy consumption on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–120 quadrillion Btu) and year on the x-axis (from 1950 to 2016) depicting energy consumption, imports, and exports for the USA.

production has resulted from enhanced oil production from existing oil ﬁelds using hydraulic
fracturing techniques (see Chapter 17).
Further understanding of how the USA arrived at the current energy consumption is
provided in Figures 1.7 and 1.8. Figure 1.7 tracks the per capita energy consumption. Per
capita energy consumption reached 344 × 106 Btu/person in 1980, decreased until 1985, and
reached a peak at 346 × 106 Btu/person in 1995. Much of the behavior during the 1970s and
1980s was the response to the ﬁrst “energy crisis.” Since 2005, the energy usage per capita has
decreased, with the result that in 2014 the per capita energy consumption was 309 × 106 Btu/
person. The 1970s energy crisis resulted in no dramatic decrease in per capita energy
consumption in the USA; these results explain, in part, the current energy dilemma of
the USA. In short, the USA failed to understand and heed the warnings of the ﬁrst energy
crisis. The energy usage per dollar of gross domestic product (GDP) is presented in Figure 1.8.
Since the 1980s, the energy consumed per dollar of GDP has meaningfully declined from near
12 000 Btu/$GDP to the current value of 6120 Btu/$GDP (per chained 2009 dollar). Chained
dollars are dollars that are adjusted to reﬂect inﬂation, “chained” to a base year (2009 in this
case). This decline is attributed to increased energy efﬁciency, especially in manufacturing,
and to structural changes (the migration of much energy-intensive industry to other
countries) in the economy.Figure depicting a line graph plotted between energy consumption on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–500 106 Btu/person) and year on the x-axis (from 1950 to 2020) depicting historical per capita energy consumption in the USA.

US Energy Usage in 2014
The EIA energy ﬂow diagram for 2014, from the EIA Total Energy (EIA, 2015), is arguably the
most informative graphical representation provided by the EIA and is reproduced as Figure 1.9.
In this ﬁgure, all energy usages are in quads (1015 Btu). Energy sources are delineated on the left-
hand side of the diagram (e.g., coal at 20.26 quad). The sources are then summed and expressed
as domestic production (87.04 quad) and imports (23.31 quad). The total supply is 110.55 quad
with exports of 12.22 quad, which yields 98.32 quad for consumption. The end-point energy
usages (categorized as residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation) are shown on the
right-hand side of the ﬁgure. Thus, in 2014, the US energy economy was 98.32 quad of which
23.31 quad was imported. A different perspective of the energy ﬂow diagram is presented in
Figure 1.10, which delineates the connection between energy sources and end-point energy
usages expressed in two different ways: in Figure 1.10a as “transportation,” “industrial,”
“residential and commercial,” and “electric power,” and in Figure 1.10b as the more conven­
tional four, “transportation,” “industrial,” “residential,” and “commercial.” The conventional
four end-point energy usages are displayed on a pie chart in Figure 1.11b. Industrial usage
accounts for 32% of the total energy used, followed by 28% for transportation. The remainder is
almost evenly split between residential and commercial. Since the energy used by no end-use
sector is dominant, alternative sources and applications are needed for all end-use sectors if
signiﬁcant reductions in energy uses are to be forthcoming. Figure 1.10a is especially interesting
since it directly connects, with percentages indicated, energy sources and end-point energy
usages. Mastery of the information in Figures 1.9 and 1.10 is necessary if energy usage in the
USA is to be completely understood.
In 2014, renewable energy from all sources contributed about 10% of the total energy utilized
in the USA. Figure 1.11 itemizes the percentage contribution of renewable energy sources in the
USA for 2014. Perhaps the most amazing statistic is that wood and conventional hydroelectric
power accounted for 49% of the total renewable energy that year! Solar and wind contributed
22% of the total renewable energy (or about 2% of the total energy consumption) in 2014. Hence,
in spite of much interest and media hype, the penetration of solar and wind energy into the
energy mix has not made much progress.
Renewable energy sources have increased in recent years. Figure 1.12 illustrates the contri­
butions of various renewable energy sources since 2000. Hydropower has ﬂuctuated, while
biomass and geothermal have exhibited slight increases. But since 2000 wind power has
dramatically increased and is now the second largest renewable source after hydropower. Solar
has also grown, but not nearly at the rate of wind power. Wind power and hydropower
combined to contribute about 87% of the total renewable energy production (excluding

Every year, the Business Center for Sustainable Energy releases the Bloomberg New Energy
Finance Study that contains some materials presented from federal sources, typically the EIA,
but it also assesses the effects of current events and technologies on the energy scenario.

Prentiss (2015) argues that, through infrastructure changes and energy usage alternatives, the
USA could develop a sustainable energy economy not based on petroleum. She recommends the
use of hybrid and electric vehicles (see Chapter 16) for personal transportation and suggests that
biomass (see Chapter 12) be used as source of jet fuel for aviation. Such an energy economy
would be vastly different from the energy economy of 2015.
Figure 1.13 is a diagram of petroleum ﬂow in the USA for 2014. The format of the ﬁgure is
similar that of Figure 1.9 except that the numbers in the petroleum ﬂow diagram are in millions
of barrels per day (MMBD). Starting at the left-hand side, domestic crude oil production is a
little less than that of the crude oil imported. The reﬁnery output is cast in terms of motor
gasoline, distillate fuel oil, liqueﬁed petroleum, jet fuel, residual fuel oil, and “other.” Motor
gasoline, at 8.92 MMBD, accounted for nearly one-half of the total utilization of petroleum
products in USA in 2014. The right-hand side of the petroleum ﬂow diagram expresses the end­
point petroleum energy usages. Transportation accounts for 71% of the total petroleum.
Industrial usage is about 24%, with residential, commercial, and electric power generation
responsible for the remaining 5%.
Transportation, the dominant end-point petroleum energy usage, warrants more examina­
tion. Much insight can be gained by tracking the cost of a gallon of motor gasoline in terms of
“real” and “nominal” dollars. Real dollars are the chained dollars based on the dollar in 2000,
while nominal dollars are the actual cost during a given year. Real dollars thus account for

inﬂation. Figure 1.14 shows the real cost in dollars per million British thermal units of motor
gasoline from 1978 to 2014. In real dollars gasoline was about $12/106 Btu in 1980, a price not
reached again until 2008. The rapid increase in gasoline prices, exceeding the inﬂation rate, after
the year 2000 resulted in severe economic strain on the US economy in general. In recent years,
the increase in domestic petroleum has reduced the price of gasoline in real dollars. During the
prosperous years of the 1980s and 1990s, relative to inﬂation, gasoline prices declined! No
wonder that conservation, higher gas mileage vehicles, and alternative sources possessed little
appeal or aroused much interest in the public.
The natural gas ﬂow for 2014 is presented in Figure 1.15. Natural gas usage in this ﬁgure is
expressed in trillions of cubic feet. As with the other energy ﬂow diagrams (Figures 1.9 and 1.13),
information proceeds from the left-hand side (sources) to the right-hand side (end-point
usages). Imports account for about 10% of the total consumption. Industrial usage and electric
power generation account for 65% of the total natural gas utilization, with the remainder split
between residential, commercial, and transportation.
The coal ﬂow for 2014 is illustrated in Figure 1.16 and is expressed in millions of short tons. In
a fashion similar to the other energy ﬂow diagrams (Figures 1.9, 1.13, and 1.15), information
proceeds from the left-hand side (sources) to the right-hand side (end-point usages). All coal is
produced domestically, with a small amount exported. Virtually all of the coal usage (93%) in the
USA is for the generation of electricity, with about 7% industrial end-point usage. Coal is the one
energy source that does not have to be imported. However, the extensive use of coal for electric
generation poses signiﬁcant environmental issues. The last few years’ environmental regulations
pertaining to coal usage have become an important political issue in the USA. As a result, coal
production and usage have declined.
Although an end-point energy use rather than an energy source, an examination of the
electricity ﬂow in the USA is appropriate. Figure 1.17 presents the electricity ﬂow diagram for
2014; the numbers in the ﬁgure are in quads. The left-hand side delineates the input energy,
including nuclear electric power. Coal is the dominant fossil fuel (64%) source of energy for
electricity generation in the USA. The right-hand side of the diagram breaks down the end-point
energy usages including transmission and distributions losses (about 9%). With 39.44 quad
consumed to generate 14.78 quad of electricity, the overall thermal efﬁciency of electricity
generation is 37%. Hence, of the 39.44 quad of energy used to generate electricity in the USA in
2014, 24.66 quad represents conversion losses. Hence, saving 1 kW h of electricity through
conservation and energy efﬁciency efforts saves nearly 3 kW h equivalents of fuel! Conservation

and energy efﬁciency are the most cost-effective and energy-effective actions, and should always
be considered ﬁrst in any efforts to reduce energy costs and energy usages.
In 2015 the EIA (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&t=3) reported the 2014
percentage generation of electricity by energy source. As shown in Table 1.2, coal, natural gas,
and nuclear were responsible for 85% of the generation.
In addition to motor gasoline prices, Figure 1.14 also tracks the real cost of electricity in
dollars per million British thermal units from 1960 until 2014. Real dollars are the chained cents
based on the dollar in 1982–1984. Indeed, except for a few years in the 1980s, the real cost of
electricity has been less than in 1960. From 1984 until 2003, the real cost of electricity
monotonically declined. As with motor gasoline, the declining real cost of electricity
during the prosperous years of the 1990s, relative to inﬂation, provided no economic impetus
for conservation or alternative sources. Now with increasing domestic production of petroleum
and identiﬁcation of massive natural gas reserves, the question is whether the USA can take
advantage of these opportunities to increase energy efﬁciency and enhance use of renewable
energy options and applications or whether the lessons of the 1990s will be forgotten.
1.5
Worldwide energy use
Although this chapter has concentrated on the energy scenario in the USA, an examination of
energy usage on a worldwide basis will enhance understanding of the global nature of the energy
problem. Figure 1.18 shows the energy utilization of the world and the counties with the most
energy consumption from 1994 to 2007. Until the Annual Energy Review 2007, the AER
contained a section on international energy usages. However, starting with the year 2008, that
section was omitted. Since the AER is currently suspended, updates from this source are moot.
But the 2007 information is still useful since the relative growth of the major energy-using
economies is illustrated. All data are presented in quads. The increases in energy use worldwide
and by China are evident in the ﬁgure. The energy usage in Russia declined slightly, and the
energy used by the USA increased, but not as rapidly as the energy use by China. The energy

The various curves correspond to Russia, China, United States, and world.

problems of the USA are exacerbated by the increasing demand for energy worldwide, especially
in countries with rapidly expanding economies.
A good annual source of many world energy use statistics is provided by British Petroleum
(BP) in the form of its Statistical Review of World Energy that is released in June of most years.
The data presented in this chapter are from the June 2014 release. Figure 1.19 provides a
convenient summary of world consumption from 1988 to 2013 broken into sources (oil, natural
gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, renewable, and coal). The unit is tonnes equivalent, with each tonne
representing 7.33 barrels or 307.86 gallons. Overall, the ﬁgure demonstrates the same world
trend of increasing energy usage as Figure 1.18. The only decrease occurs in 2008 as a result of
the economic recession; however, by 2009 the trend of increasing usage is reestablished with
growth in all sources. Figure 1.20 delineates world energy consumption by region from 1988
through 2013. This ﬁgure is far more revealing than Figure 1.19 in understanding the energy
usage pattern changes in the world. While North America and Europe and Eurasia demonstrateFigure depicting a stacked area graph with year on the x-axis (from 1988 to 2013) and world energy consumption on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–13000 million tonnes oil equivalent) depicting summary of world consumption from 1988 to 2013 broken into sources, namely, coal, renewable, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, natural gas, and oil.

slight declines during the years approaching 2013, Asia Paciﬁc usage effectively doubled from
2005 to 2013! Continued increases in energy consumption of this magnitude will place severe
strain on the world oil supply. Indeed, if not for enhanced oil recovery and the discovery of
signiﬁcant additional natural gas reserves in the USA, fossil fuel prices would greatly exceed
the current pricing structure. The implication for carbon dioxide production is even more
troubling. North America uses about 25% of the world’s energy, but because of environmental
concerns produces much less than 25% of the world’s CO2. The Asia Paciﬁc region, as evidenced
by Figure 1.20, will in the near future consume signiﬁcantly more energy than North America,
but the CO2 will dwarf the CO2 output of North America because of more lax environmental
regulations in the Asia Paciﬁc region. Muller (2012) presents an interesting discussion of this
issue.

The following three consequences of the second law of thermodynamics are useful for providing
limits to the efﬁciency of a heat engine:
1) No heat engine can be more efﬁcient than an externally reversible engine operating between
the same temperature limits.

2) All externally reversible heat engines operating between the same temperature limits have
the same efﬁciency.

sources, and biological systems. Additionally, Table 1.3 also indicates the energy conversion
path for each entry. For example, for large gas turbines the energy conversion path is chemical to
mechanical (c →m) and the nominal efﬁciency range is 35–40%. Some large components
possess efﬁciencies above 90%, but many widely used components (e.g., internal combustion
engines) have efﬁciencies less than 30%. From a historical perspective, the reason for the demise
of the steam locomotive is also evident.
Much of the electricity generated is used for lighting. As the data in Table 1.3 demonstrate,
even the most efﬁcient lighting source, high-pressure sodium, is only 15–20% efﬁcient.
Incandescent lighting is a woeful 2–5% efﬁcient. Biological systems used for food production,
milk or beef, for example, also exhibit low efﬁciencies. Locally, photosynthesis does not exceed
5% efﬁciency of the incident sunlight, but the global mean is much smaller.
What Table 1.3 ultimately indicates is that much engineering effort is needed to reduce energy
utilization by improving efﬁciencies of various components.

Closure
The information contained in this chapter brings us to the purpose of this book. If we are to
meet the increasing US and world energy demands, then the use of alternative energy sources
and the alternative use of existing energy sources must be considered, even in light of recent
changes in the US domestic energy outlook. The remaining chapters of this book examine
fundamental principles and facts about a wide variety of alternative energy sources and
alternative energy utilization. The level of material covered about each topic is, in most
instances, fundamental. To do detailed engineering work on most topics represented in this
book, additional technical information will be needed. However, the material presented herein
provides an introduction and overview for the many alternative energy scenarios possible.

Fundamentals of Turbomachinery
2.1
Deﬁnition of a turbomachine
Two of the important categories of renewable, alternative energy sources are wind energy and
hydroelectric energy, and one frequently used alternative application for fossil fuels is the gas or
combustion turbine. All of these devices are classed as turbomachines, and the operating
principle of each is similar. The purpose of this chapter is to develop a basis understanding of
and nomenclature for turbomachines. The deﬁnition of a turbomachine is a good place to start:
Turbomachine – a device in which energy is transferred either to, or from, a continuously-ﬂowing ﬂuid
by the action of one or more moving blade rows.
The italicized words in the deﬁnition are important. Energy transfer, not energy transformation,
takes place in a turbomachine. Since the ﬂuid is continuously ﬂowing, a turbomachine is not a
positive-displacement device. The energy transfer that takes place is caused by the action of
moving blade rows.
2.2
Turbomachine classiﬁcations
Turbomachines are oftenclassiﬁed as compressors (orpumps or fans) andturbines.A compressor
or pump or fan is a turbomachine in which energy is added by the ﬂuid as the ﬂuid traverses the
rotor. In a turbine, energy is extracted from the ﬂuid as the ﬂuid traverses the rotor.
Another classiﬁcation is based on the path of the ﬂuid as it traverses the rotor. A turbo-
machine can be a radial device, an axial device, or a mixed device. As the names imply, in a radial
device, the path of the ﬂuid is in the radial direction. In an axial device, the path of the ﬂuid is in
the axial direction. And in a mixed device, the ﬂuid path has both radial and axial components.
Figure 2.1 illustrates some common turbomachines exhibiting radial, axial, or mixed character­
istics. In the radial device, Figure 2.1a, the ﬂow traverses the rotor in a predominantly radial
direction; in the mixed device, Figure 2.1b, the ﬂow traverses enters the rotor with both radial
and axial components of velocity; and in the axial device, Figure 2.1c, a propeller-type turbine,
axial ﬂow is exhibited, and the ﬂow both enters and leaves the rotor with axial velocity but little
radial velocity.

arbitrary location on the inlet control surface the absolute velocity vector V1 is shown. V2
represents the absolute velocity at the exit. In this context, the absolute velocity is measured with
respect to a stationary observer. The arbitrary points are located radial distances r1 and r2 from
the axis of rotation. Three mutually perpendicular velocity components are deﬁned: (1) Va, the
axial component, (2) Vu, the tangential component, and (3) Vm, the radial (or meridional)
component. These components completely resolve the absolute velocity vectors. The compo­
nents’ names are also descriptive of their directions; that is, Va is in the axial direction and is
collinear with the axis of rotation. Turbomachinery analysis is greatly facilitated by using the
velocity components.
Conservation of angular momentum is the fundamental principle used in analyzing a
turbomachine. For a control volume, conservation of angular momentum appears as

equal to the time rate of change of angular momentum within the control volume plus the

turbomachine is the moment about the axis of rotation. Consider, as in Figure 2.3, a
schematic representation of the velocity components at an arbitrary point located a distance
r from the axis of rotation. The x, y, and z axes as well as the unit vectors i, j, and k are
indicated on the ﬁgure.
The vectors r and V then become

The moment or torque of interest is that about the z-axis, the axis of rotation. As Equation 2.4
indicates the only component of the cross product that produces angular momentum about the
z-axis is rV u. Using τ as the summation of moments about the axis of rotation and invoking the
steady state, conservation of angular momentum reduces to
τ 

Since n1, the unit outward normal for the inlet (as indicated on Figure 2.2), is collinear with the

Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
For many turbomachines, either rV u is constant across a control surface or r and Vu are
constant and the “bar” notation is dropped, so that
τ 

(2.9)
m
Equation 2.9 is called the Euler turbine (or pump) equation and is the fundamental application
of conservation of angular momentum for a turbomachine. If r2V u2 > r1V u1, then angular
momentum is added to the ﬂow and the device is called a pump, fan, or compressor. If
r2V u2 < r1V u1, then angular momentum is extracted from the ﬂow, and the device is called a
turbine. The traditional turbomachine sign convention is for torque to be positive for a turbine
and negative for a pump. Thus, the usual form of Equation 2.9 becomes
_
τ 
r1V u1  r2V u2
(2.10)

The power is the torque times the rotation rate:
_
Power  τω 

But rω is the tangential velocity of the rotor at a radius r and is assigned the symbol U in
turbomachinery notation. The power is expressed as
_

m
The “head” change is the power per unit mass ﬂow rate or
Power  H  U1V u1  U2V u2

Equation 2.13 follows the turbomachinery protocol of deﬁning head as the energy per unit mass
(or power per unit mass ﬂow rate).
Two velocities have been introduced, the absolute velocity V and the tangential rotor velocity
U. The relative velocity Vr is deﬁned by the vector equation
_
V  U  Vr
(2.14)
The graphical interpretation of Equation 2.14, the velocity triangle, is provided in Figure 2.4.
Since Vu is the tangential component of the absolute velocity, Vu is identiﬁed as the projection of
V in the direction of U; that is, Vcosα.
The angle V makes with U, α, is often called the “nozzle angle.” The angle Vr makes with U, β,
is the blade angle since Vr represents the velocity with respect to the rotor.
The law of cosines for the inlet and exit velocity triangles can be written as

dynamic

relative
static
The ﬁrst term represents the change in absolute velocity and is called the dynamic effect. The
remaining two terms, the centrifugal and the relative, form the static effect. The total change in
head is the sum of the static and dynamic effects. Some useful physics can be deduced from
Equation 2.17 and the classiﬁcation of dynamic, centrifugal, and relative. In a radial device the
centrifugal effect is often dominant. For a radial-ﬂow compressor, the head H is negative; thus,
the centrifugal effects aid the energy transfer process if U2 > U1 – meaning the exit radius
should be greater than the inlet radius. A turbine is just the opposite, as the centrifugal effects
should be positive, meaning that the inlet radius should be larger than the exit. This principle is
explored in Example 3.3.
The ratio of the static effect to the total change in head is called the reaction and is deﬁned
as
1 U2
1  U2
2  V 2

r2  V 2

U1V u1  U2V u2
r2  V 2
If the reaction R is zero, then the change in head is just due to the dynamic effect – the change in
absolute velocity across the rotor. Hence, the static change in head is zero, and the rotor can be
open (no casing needed). R  0 devices are often referred to as impulse machines since the total
head change is due only to the dynamic effect.
Axial-ﬂow turbomachines are devices in which the ﬂuid motion as it traverses the rotor is
predominantly in the axial direction. A schematic of an axial ﬂow compressor is shown in
Figure 2.5. In an axial turbomachine with stages, rotating blade rows (rotors) are followed by
stators, stationary blade rows in which energy transformation, not energy transfer, takes place.
The stationary blades ahead of the ﬁrst rotor are often called inlet guide vanes. For a given rotor
or stator, the inlet and exit radii are essentially equal so that r  r1  r2, U  U1  U2, andA schematic representation of staged axial-flow device indicating inlet guide vane, stator, and rotor.

Example problems
Some examples exercising the concept developed about turbomachines are in order.
Example 2.1
An axial-ﬂow turbomachine possesses symmetrical velocity triangles as in Figure 2.6. For 
these conditions answer the following questions. 
a) How are the velocity components related? 
b) What is the reaction? 
c) Is this device a turbine or a compressor? Explain. 
Solution
The velocity triangles in Figure 2.6 can be envisioned as appropriate for the rotor 
arrangement of Figure 2.2. In an axial-ﬂow device, the radial component of velocity is by 
deﬁnition zero, and the planes of the velocity triangles are collinear with the axial direction. 
The axial velocity is then the projection of the absolute velocity perpendicular to the tangen­
tial direction. For symmetrical velocity triangles, V 1  V r2 and V r1  V 2. Substituting these 
relations into Equation 2.22 results in

2 Fundamentals of Turbomachinery
Since r2V u2  r1V u1 the device is a compressor (or pump) because the angular momentum
is increased as the ﬂuid traverses the rotor; that is, energy is added to the ﬂuid.
Although given as part of the problem statement, the ﬁrst step in solving any
turbomachinery problem is to construct the velocity triangles. We consider a more complex
problem next.
Example 2.2
A centrifugal-ﬂow turbomachine has the relative velocity components as indicated in
Figure 2.7. Additionally, the following are speciﬁed:
U1  r1ω  3:75 m=s
U2  r2ω  7:50 m=s
m_  57 kg=s
Determine the power, classify the device as a turbine or compressor, and ﬁnd the reaction.
Solution
The ﬁrst step is to complete the velocity triangles. Consider the inlet velocity
triangle. The values of U1 and Vr1, as well as that Vr1 is radial, are known. Three pieces of
information must be known in order to uniquely specify a velocity triangle. The inlet velocity
triangle is a right triangle, and is, thus, completely speciﬁed by the angle and the two velocity
components. Likewise, two velocity components (U2 and Vr2) as well as an angle are known
about the exit velocity triangle. Since V r2 cos30:45  7:5 m=s  U2, the exit velocity triangle
is also a right triangle. The velocity triangles appear as in Figure 2.8.
The velocity triangles must obey the vector expression V  U  Vr. Since V2 is
perpendicular to U2, V u2  0; and with Vr1 perpendicular to U1, V u1  U1. The power can be
computed as

Since the power from a turbine is positive, the dynamic contribution and the relative velocity
contribution are positive, but the centrifugal effect is negative and reduces the power extracted
from the ﬂuid. This device is a radial outﬂow turbine that must overcome the negative
contribution of the centrifugal effect in order to extract power. As discussed earlier, a radial
inﬂow turbine would take advantage of the centrifugal effect.
With the velocity components known, the reaction R can be calculated directly as

4:82  4:412  3:752  7:52  8:72  32
With little change in the absolute velocity, the dynamics effect is small. This value of R shows
that in spite of the relative and centrifugal effects acting opposite, the static change is the
dominant effect in this device.
Example 2.3
A schematic of a radial ﬂow turbomachine is illustrated in Figure 2.9.
The inlet velocity, V 1  18 m=s, makes a 30° angle with the tangential, and the exit velocity
V2 makes a 90° angle with the tangential. The blade (rotor) width is constant at 90 mm. The
rotor is rotating at 764 rpm. Rotation is counterclockwise.

The centrifugal effect is the largest and contributes nearly 50% of the total change in head; the
dynamic effect is the smallest with a very modest contribution. Since the inlet radius is larger
than the exit, the centrifugal effect sign is positive, indicating a positive contribution to the
overall energy transfer process. Hence, for a radial ﬂow turbine, the inlet at a larger radius than
the exit takes advantage of the centrifugal effect. Many radial turbines are, thus, inﬂow (r1 > r2)
turbines.
The reaction is the ratio of the static contributions (centrifugal and relative) to the total.

Using the blade angles, the general shape of the rotor can be deﬁned. Figure 2.11 illustrates how
the rotor blades would appear. With the two blade angles within a fraction of a degree, the rotor
blades have little camber or curvature. Note: the above is a ﬁrst-order analysis, and many effects
(viscous, circulation, and bypass, for example) have been neglected; nonetheless, the ﬁrst-order
analysis captures the most important nuances of the energy transfer process.

3.1
Introduction
Hydroelectric dams are among the best known and largest of man-made structures. Such dams
have a long and successful history in the USA. In the early decades of the 1900s, many
hydroelectric dams were constructed. By the 1930s, the USA was generating about 40% of its
electricity by hydropower. In 2014, as delineated in Figures 1.11 and 1.12, that number declined
to about 3%. Norway, Nepal, New Zealand, and Canada generate more than 50% of their
electricity by hydropower.
For years, hydroelectric power has been viewed as the most environmentally friendly of all
electricity power sources. However, in recent years the environmental impacts of hydroelectric
power have been viewed as less benign and more intrusive. The books by Leslie (2005) and
Scudder (2005) address environmental problems associated with large dams; and Spilsbury
(2011) examines pros and cons of large dams using recent examples. Kumar et al. (2011) present
a reasonable assessment of the future of hydropower and conclude that continued development
of hydropower can provide additional renewable energy, but that environmental and social
impacts will need to be carefully managed.
Large hydroelectric dams require large capital investments and a timescale of years to build
and complete. Figure 3.1, developed from EIA data for 2002, 2009, and 2012, provides a
comparison of the total, fuel, maintenance, and operating costs of electricity generated from
various sources during these years. Hydroelectric power has the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour of
any electricity source. Although the operating and maintenance costs for hydroelectric are
higher than for both fossil fuel steam and gas turbine, no fuel is required so the total cost per
kilowatt-hour is the smallest of the four sources. Nuclear and hydroelectric monotonically
increased during the time span, but both fossil fuel steam and gas turbine had higher costs in
2009 than in 2012 because fuel prices in 2009 were signiﬁcantly higher than in 2012. Although a
few exceptions exist, most hydroelectric dams have long lifetimes and permit electrical
generating output to be quickly varied. The USA has about 2400 power-producing dams.
3.2
Examples of Hydroelectric Dams
Perhaps the most famous dam in the USA is the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River (Table 3.1).
At 726 ft (221 m) high and 1244 ft (379 m) long, it is one of the world’s largest dams and was built
between 1931 and 1936. Hoover Dam is a major supplier of hydroelectric power and provides
for ﬂood control and improved navigation. The electricity is distributed to California (56%),
Nevada (25%), and Arizona (19%). Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the USA, is impounded by
the dam.

historical interest. Figure 3.3 presents a view of the dam from the tailrace looking upstream at
the main structure.
The Itaipú hydroelectric power plant on the Parana River in South America is among the
largest operating hydroelectric dams in the world. Built from 1975 to 1991, the 18 generating
units add up to a total production capacity of 12 600 MW (18 generating units of 700 MW each)
and a reliable output of 75 TW h a year. In 2014, the Itaipú Dam produced 87.8 TW h. This
output, in a single powerhouse, is enough to power most of California. The Itaipú Dam
contributes 25% of the energy supply in Brazil and 78% in Paraguay.

The materials list required to construct the Itaipú Dam is impressive. The volume of iron
and steel would be enough to build 380 Eiffel Towers, and the volume of concrete used
represents 15 times the volume utilized to build the Channel Tunnel between France and
England. Figure 3.4 provides an overview of the dam and reservoir.
Perhaps the most famous contemporary dam in the world is the Three Gorges Dam in the
Republic of China. Table 3.2 contains some statistics of the Three Gorges Dam. Preliminary
work started in 1993, and the dam was completed in 2014. In 2014, the Three Gorges Dam
produced 98.9 TW h, making it then the world’s largest producer of hydroelectric power.
Because of the number of people that had to be relocated and the area of land ﬂooded to form
the reservoir, the Three Gorges Dam generated much worldwide controversy. Nonetheless, the
government of China completed construction. An idea of the size of the Three Gorges dam is
provided in Figure 3.5. Wang et al. (2014) provide an assessment of large dams, including the
Three Gorges Dam, on the people and environment in China.

3.3
Hydraulic Analysis
A quantitative understanding of the hydroelectric dams involves two components: (1) a
hydraulic analysis of the penstock, the ﬂuid’s path between the upper and lower water levels,

40
Alternative Energy Systems and ApplicationsFigure depicting dam schematic arrangement for hydraulic analysis indicating the upper reservoir, dam, turbine, valves, and tailrace.
Figure 3.6 Dam schematic arrangement for hydraulic analysis.
and (2) an overview of the characteristics of turbines suitable for different combinations of ﬂow
rate and elevation difference. This section develops the hydraulic analysis of the penstock ﬂow,
and Section 3.4 examines the different types of turbines suitable for use in hydroelectric
installations.
Figure 3.2 illustrates the penstock arrangement of Hoover Dam. The intake towers feed the
primary penstocks, each 30 ft in diameter. The primary penstock then branches into several
parallel penstocks that feed the turbines located in the power plant. The water traverses the
turbines and is then discharged downstream of the dam. The ﬂow arrangement thus contains an
inlet, lengths of penstock, a turbine, and an exit. A general arrangement is shown schematically
in Figure 3.6. The arrangement shows several valves, several ﬁttings, the turbine, and penstock
lengths.
The hydraulic analysis starts with the application of the conservation of energy equation,
generally just called the energy equation, to the system. The general energy equation from
station “a” to station “b” appears as

the change in head across the turbine, and N is number of pipe segments; gc is used when the

gc can be used with the SI, but it is an identity just deﬁning the newton (N). In Equation 3.1, the
units of the change in head of the turbines are in energy per unit mass (N m/kg or ft lbf/lbm) in
conformance with turbomachinery practice.
The ﬁrst questions to be answered are where to initiate application of the energy equation and
where to terminate application of the energy equation. For the case of a hydroelectric dam as
illustrated in Figure 3.6, the free surfaces of the water levels (a and b in the ﬁgure) upstream and
downstream are taken as the range of application of the energy equation. Since both surfaces are
at atmospheric pressure, Pa  Pb, and since the velocities of the surfaces of the upstream and
downstream reservoir are small, V a  V b  0. The change in head across the turbine becomes

In Equation 3.5, expressions for the friction factor and fully rough friction factor are needed.
In introductory ﬂuid mechanics courses, the Moody diagram (Hodge and Taylor, 1999) is often
used to present the functional dependence of friction factor f on the Reynolds number
ReD  ρVD=μ, and the relative roughness ε=D. However, the Moody diagram is unhandy
for computer-based solutions, and a closed-form expression is desired. In the laminar regime,
the usual expression (Hodge and Taylor, 1999) is

Minor loss terms are sometimes expressed as equivalent lengths using the fully rough friction

Haaland equation, the fully rough friction factor becomes

f T 
(3.9)
flogε=3:7D1:11g

With the aforementioned as the basis for piping system problem solution formulation, some
examples of the uniﬁed approach will be examined and discussed.
The minor loss representations, K and C in Equation 3.5, are available in virtually any textbook
on ﬂuid mechanics and in specialized textbooks such as Hodge and Taylor (1999) and Cengel
and Cimbala (2013). The Crane Company Technical Report 410 (Crane Engineering Depart­
ment, 1957) is frequently cited as a consistent source of major and minor loss information.
Consider the following example.
Example 3.1
A proposed design for a hydroelectric project is based on a discharge of 0.25 m3/s through the
penstock and turbine as in Figure 3.7. The minor losses are inlet, K  0:78, K  1 for the exit
loss and C  32 for two 45° elbows (Hodge and Taylor, 1999).
a) Determine the power in kilowatts that can be expected from the facility, if the turbine
efﬁciency is 0.85.
b) Show that the type of turbine to be installed is a Francis turbine if the desired rotational speed
is 1200 rpm.

Solution
Application of the general energy equation would yield Equation 3.5 minor
losses are not zero. In the classiﬁcation of ﬂuid mechanics hydraulics problems this would
be a Category I problem since the ﬂow rate is given and the head change is to be deter­
mined. Any ﬂuid mechanics textbook has extensive information on the solution technique
for such problems as this one. In this textbook, Mathcad will be used as the arithmetic
engine and is used for the solution of Example 3.1. Figure 3.8 contains the Mathcad work­
sheet with the solution to this problem.
The ﬁrst part of the worksheet deﬁnes the systems with inputs such as pressures, lengths,
diameters, minor losses, and physical properties. The Mathcad solve block procedure is used
to secure the solution. The solve block is initiated by the Given statement and ends with the
Find command, in which the unknown is speciﬁed. The result is that 23 kW is delivered from
the turbine.
With some modiﬁcations, the procedure of Example 3.1, as illustrated in Figure 3.8, can be
used for virtually any penstock problem. Additional details are available in Hodge and Taylor
(1999) and Hodge (2006).
The ﬂuid mechanics of dams, as in Figure 3.6, are interesting. Consider the two
bounding cases of interest for turbine operation. The ﬁrst case occurs when the change in
head across the turbine is equal to the elevation difference between the upper reservoir and
the tailrace. If W t  Za−Zb, then the ﬂow rate must be zero as no head is available for
ﬂow. The other bounding condition is if the change in head across the turbine is zero, in
which case the ﬂow rate Qmax is the maximum possible in the absence of a pump. Since
the power extracted from the ﬂuid is ρQW t, the power extracted from the ﬂuid is zero for
both the bounding cases. However, for the ﬂow rate range 0 < Q < Qmax the power
extracted has nonzero values. Furthermore, as the ﬂow rate increases, the change in head
across the turbine decreases. Such circumstances lead to the power extracted being a
double-valued function that possesses a maximum value of power extracted. For the
conditions of Example 3.1, the maximum available head is 23 N m/kg and the maximum
ﬂow rate for W t  0 is 0.365 m3/s. If a parametric study is performed with the ﬂow rate as
the independent variable and the power extracted as the dependent variable, Figure 3.9
results. The double valuedness of ﬂow rate and power extracted is evident, as is the
existence of a maximum value of power extracted. Thus, for a given system deﬁnition, a
speciﬁc combination of ﬂow rate and head change across the turbine provides for
maximum power extraction. The solution to Example 3.1 is indicated on the ﬁgure. A ﬂow
rate of 0.205 m3/s, not 0.25 m3/s as in the problem statement, yields the maximum power
extracted.

Turbine Speciﬁc Speed Considerations
The hydraulic solution addressed in Section 3.3 does not deal with the details of energy transfer
in the turbine or with any details of turbine speciﬁcation. Realizing the wide range of elevation
differences and ﬂow rates associated with hydropower, additional information related to
turbines is needed.
The starting point for more detailed considerations of turbines suitable for hydroelectric
application is dimensional analysis. A complete set of dimensional variables for a turbomachine
is presented in Table 3.3.

By eliminating D and evaluating the resulting dimensionless parameter at the point of maximum
efﬁciency, the speciﬁc speed results. Since the speciﬁc speed is derived from dimensionless
products by eliminating the diameter, the speciﬁc speed is also dimensionless. General usage is
to deﬁne the speciﬁc speed for a pump in terms of the ﬂow rate and increase in head; for a
turbine, the usual is to deﬁne its speciﬁc speed in terms of the power and the available head.
Thus, the speciﬁc speeds of the two devices differ. The traditional deﬁnitions are as follows:

The customary procedure in the USA is not to involve the density ρ and the acceleration due to
gravity g and to express the speciﬁc speeds using the following units:
ω  rpm
Q  gal=min or gpm
H  ft
W  hp
A result of these practices is that the speciﬁc speed values are no longer dimensionless, but
contain dimensions. The customary dimensional versions of the speciﬁc speeds become

The utility of using the speciﬁc speeds is illustrated in the following composite graphs. When
expressed at the maximum efﬁciency operating point, the speciﬁc speeds for the pump and the
turbine deﬁne global machine geometries for optimum operating conditions. In both of these
plots, the customary dimensional versions of the speciﬁc speeds are used. Although this chapter
is primarily treating turbines as used in hydropower, the pump speciﬁc speed information is
included for completeness and because in some hydropower the system is pumped hydroelectric
which uses pumps as well as turbines.
Figure 3.10 demonstrates why the speciﬁc speed for a pump is so useful in classifying
turbomachines such as pumps. The speciﬁc speed in this ﬁgure is based on the traditional US
procedure and uses Equation 3.17. Below the abscissa on which the pump speciﬁc speed is
indicated are cross-section schematics illustrating the salient features of pumps as a function of
´
speciﬁc speed. At low value of NSP the ﬂow rates are low and the increases in heads are high –
leading to centrifugal (radial) ﬂow pumps in which the centrifugal effect is dominant and the
inlet area relatively small. As the speciﬁc speed increases, the centrifugal effects diminish and the
inlet areas increase – with the result that the pump geometry progresses from radial to mixed to
axial (propeller). Hence, the speciﬁc speed deﬁnes the general geometry of a pump for a given
speed, ﬂow rate, and increase in head across the pump. Also presented in Figure 3.10 are the
nominal efﬁciencies expected from a well-designed pump as a function of ﬂow rate and speciﬁc
speed. Generally, as the size of a pump increases, the efﬁciencies increase since larger pumps are
associated with large ﬂow rates. The reason is that viscous effects become more important as the
pump size (and, hence, ﬂow rate) is decreased and as more of the ﬂow is affected by viscous
effects near surfaces (or walls).

Figure 3.11 is the turbine version of the speciﬁc speed relationship. For hydroelectric
applications, three types of turbines are in common use: the impulse turbine (or Pelton wheel)
for low values of the turbine speciﬁc speed, the Francis turbine for moderate speciﬁc speeds, and
the Kaplan turbine for high speciﬁc speeds. The general cross-sectional shapes of each type
of device as well as expected efﬁciencies are included in the ﬁgure. Figure 3.12 contains a
schematic of a Pelton wheel as well as details of the splitter ridge in the “bucket.” Flow is
accelerated through a nozzle and impacts the moving buckets, the moving blade row,
along the periphery of the Pelton wheel. Angular momentum is extracted at the splitter ridge,
and the ﬂuid is discharged. Figure 3.13 presents schematics of a radial ﬂow Francis turbine and a
Kaplan turbine. Additional information on these different types of turbines will be examined in
Section 3.5.Schematic representation of Francis turbine and Kalpan turbine.

Example 3.2
For the conditions of Example 3.1, determine the type of turbine to be installed if the desired
rotational speed in 1200 rpm.
Solution
The speciﬁc speed will be calculated using the US customary approach with
Equation 3.18. The Mathcad solution is reproduced in Figure 3.14. Mathcad is chosen
because it easily handles units. In Figure 3.14, NS is the dimensionless version of the speciﬁc
speed, and the results are shown as unitless (dimensionless) in Mathcad. Using the customary
deﬁnition, with the units of rpm, hp, and ft, the speciﬁc speed is computed to be 30.047. In
Mathcad, dividing a variable by a set of units results in a unitless (nondimensional) number.
So using customary units with Equation 3.18 yields the appropriate results NCUS. With a
customary value of 30.047, an examination of Figure 3.11 shows that the appropriate turbine
type for this application is a Francis turbine and that an efﬁciency of 0.85 is reasonable.
3.5
Energy Transfer in Turbines
Section 3.4 introduced the turbine speciﬁc speed and discussed its importance in classifying the
type of turbine required for speciﬁc applications. This section examines some details of energy
transfer in various turbines. The Pelton wheel will be examined ﬁrst.
Pelton wheels are appropriate for low values of the turbine speciﬁc speed. Low values of the
turbine speciﬁc speed are associated with large head (elevation difference) availability and
relatively small ﬂow rates. Figure 3.15 is a photograph of a large, commercial Pelton wheel in

which the buckets and splitter ridges can be observed. In reality, a Pelton wheel is more complex
than the stylized schematic of Figure 3.12.
The water jet to the splitter ridge is supplied from a nozzle. In large Pelton wheels more than a
single nozzle may be used. Use of multiple nozzles permits the wheel to be smaller for the same
amount of power extracted, but multiple nozzles complicate the physical arrangement. Voith
Hydro markets a Pelton wheel with six nozzles. The complexity of a six-nozzle arrangement is
illustrated in Figure 3.16. In this ﬁgure, four nozzles are drawn and two are indicated by dashes.
The analysis of a Pelton wheel is initiated by deﬁning the velocity triangles. Figure 3.17
illustrates the splitter ridge and the inlet and outlet velocity triangles for a Pelton wheel. Since

the jet enters and leaves the splitter ridge at the same radial location, U1  U2  U. A Pelton
wheel is an impulse device with no casing; therefore, the reaction is zero. For an impulse device
with U1  U2  U, Equation 2.18 requires that V r1  V r2. The velocity triangles appear as in
Figure 3.16 with the inlet velocity V1 in the tangential direction, and, thus, collinear with the
wheel speed U. The relative velocity component Vr1 completes the inlet velocity triangle. The
exit splitter ridge makes an angle β2 (<180°) with respect to V1 so the ﬂuid can exit the splitter
ridge without interfering with the incoming stream. With Vr2 and U known, the exit velocity
triangle is deﬁned.

Equation 3.24 is a simple expression, but it contains many implications for Pelton turbines.
Implicit in the expression is the relationship between the velocity available at the exit of the
nozzle, the inlet velocity, and the wheel speed. Also, the relationship between power and
the inlet velocity is quadratic. The inlet velocity depends on the elevation difference
available; the larger the difference, the higher the velocity. High inlet velocities can arise
only because of large elevation differences; thus the stipulation that Pelton wheels are
appropriate for dams with high available heads. An example will prove useful.
Example 3.3
What power in kilowatts can be developed by the Pelton wheel shown in Figure 3.18 if the
generator efﬁciency is 85%? The total minor losses are given as K  5:25 and C  1500. What
will be the angular speed of the wheel for maximum power extracted? What is the power
speciﬁc speed? What is the torque?

Solution
For an arrangement such as in Figure 3.18, the energy equation must be applied
between the free surface of the upper reservoir (a) and the exit plane of the nozzle (b) that
feeds the Pelton turbine. The energy equation becomes

As with the earlier hydraulic example, Pa  Pb and V a  0. Unlike Example 3.1, Vb is not zero,
but the nozzle exit velocity Vnoz, and since the Pelton turbine is downstream of b, no energy is
extracted from the turbine between a and b. The reduced form of the energy equation becomes

This equation is interesting in that it states that the kinetic energy available for the Pelton

The Mathcad worksheet used to solve Example 3.1 was modiﬁed for the solution to this
problem. The solution is presented in Figure 3.19. The ﬁrst part of the worksheet presents the
solution for the ﬂow rate. The ﬂow rate solution is a Category II pipe-ﬂow problem, and the
result is 2.79 m3/s. The remainder of the worksheet is concerned with the Pelton turbine
computations. The power extracted, 16 780 kW, is computed using Equation 3.23, and the
wheel rotational speed, 349 rpm, is calculated as V1/2.
The power speciﬁc speed is 3.207. An examination of Figure 3.11 conﬁrms that the power
speciﬁc speed is in the range expected for a Pelton turbine and that the speciﬁed efﬁciency is
appropriate for this device.

For moderate values of the turbine speciﬁc speed, the Francis turbine is the preferred type.
Figure 3.20 is an illustration of a Francis turbine installation.
Francis turbines are the most frequently used of the three types. With the advent of large
dams, Francis turbines have grown in size. In Figure 3.21, Voith Hydro documented the
increase in size and output of the Francis turbines they have manufactured over the years.
The Kaplan turbine is the other type of device frequently used in hydropower applications.
Figure 3.22 is a reproduction of a Voith Hydro Kaplan turbine, and Figure 3.23 schematically
illustrates a typical installation.
Both Francis and Kaplan turbines are reaction, rather than impulse, devices. The general
approach to solve problems concerned with Francis or Kaplan turbines is to construct the
velocity triangles and apply the Euler equation. The next example is typical of the approach
used for these devices.

Example 3.4
A 90% efﬁcient radial-ﬂow Francis turbine produces 111 MW at a speed of 167 rpm. The
blade height is 0.732 m, and the inlet radius is 5.52 m. The ﬂow exits the turbine in a radial
direction.
a) If the angle between the radial direction and the absolute velocity at the inlet is 30°,
determine the volume ﬂow rate.
b) What is the change in head across the turbine?
Solution
This turbine has ﬂow in the radial plane at the inlet and radial ﬂow at the exit;
thus, the ﬂow is radial (no axial velocity component) throughout the turbine. Figure 3.24
illustrates the general arrangement and the velocity triangles. Figure 3.25 shows a side view
with the blade geometry deﬁned.

Example 3.4 is typical of the process used to work problems associated with turbomachinery
devices. Much of the basis for the solution was developed in Chapter 2.
Hydroelectric power generation brings to mind massive dam and penstock systems, such as in
Figures 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, that drive turbines (as examined in this chapter) and discharge the water
in the tailrace below the dam. A different kind of hydroelectric system is the pumped storage
conﬁguration in which pumps are used when electricity rates are low (typically at night) to pump
water into a reservoir which is discharged to drive turbines when the electrical grid demands are
high and electricity is expensive (during peak grid demand periods). Pumped storage systems
thus contain both pumps and turbines. Hydrodynamic losses are incurred when pumping as
well as when generating in such systems; additionally, the pumps, turbines, and generators all
have inefﬁciencies. The net result is that more energy is consumed in pumping than in
generating, so a pumped storage system is a net user of electricity, but from a utility’s standpoint
such systems can be brought on line quickly and provide electrical energy cheaper than can be
purchased from an external source when the electrical demand is high. The Tennessee Valley
Authority’s Raccoon Mountain Pumped-storage Plant is a good example of a modern pumped
storage facility; information is available at https://www.tva.gov/Energy/Our-Power-System/
Hydroelectric/Raccoon-Mountain and http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/216.
In 2015, the EIA reported 42 pumped storage systems, ranging in capacity from 1 to
3000 MW in the USA, with a total capacity of 22 GW. Pumped storage generated 23 × 106 kW h,
but consumed 29 × 106 kW h in pumping – an overall efﬁciency of 79%. Pumped storage in 2015
provided 97% of the utility-size electricity storage capacity. Exercise 3.20 is an exercise
structured about a pumped storage system.

Closure
This chapter has explored hydropower by examining some large hydroelectric sites, developing
and utilizing the concept of speciﬁc speed, considering how a Pelton turbine (impulse device)
works, and demonstrating how to use velocity triangles to solve turbine problems.
As pointed out in Section 3.1, hydroelectric power, while a renewable energy source, does
present economic and environmental issues. A recent study by Kao et al. (2014), sponsored by
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, assessed the potential for hydroelectric power in the USA
through 2040. The results are presented in summary form by Bowman in Figure 3.26, takenA graph is plotted between hydropower electricity generating capacity on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–180 gigawatts) and year on the x-axis (from 1950 to 2040) predicting the hydroelectric growth in the USA through 2040. A dashed vertical line corresponding to 2012 divides the plot into two parts, the left part denoting history while the right part denoting projections.

from the EIA Today in Energy for July 14, 2014. The study identiﬁed the installed hydroelectric
capacity as 101 GW in 2012, but projected only an additional 2 GW to be added by 2040 out of a
potential about 60 GW. These results basically concur with a 2010 study sponsored by the
National Academy of Sciences et al. (2010). Both studies acknowledged that economic issues
and environmental concerns are the primary reason that little additional hydroelectric capacity
is likely to be added in the USA.
Each year the Energy Information Administration releases an Annual Energy Outlook (AEO)
that contains 25-year projections on energy resources and consumptions. These projections are
built around a reference case and various energy scenarios. The AEO 2016 (EIA, 2016), which
projects a 0.1% hydropower growth through 2040, is in substantial agreement with Bowman
(2014) and the National Academy of Sciences et al. (2010) study ﬁndings for hydropower
growth. For a number of years the projections on hydropower have predicted little signiﬁcant
growth. For example, AEO 1998 (EIA, 1997) projected only a 0.1% growth out to 2020, the same
growth rate as AEO 2016.
The issue of hydropower growth was considered settled until July 2016 when the Wind and
Water Power Technologies Ofﬁce within the US Department of Energy Ofﬁce of Energy
Efﬁciency and Renewable Energy (EERE, 2016) issued the report, “HydroPower Vision: A New
Chapter for America’s 1st Renewable Electricity Source.” The Wind and Water Power
Technologies Ofﬁce supports the development, deployment, and commercialization of wind
and water power technologies. This report, which postulated that a hydropower growth scenarioA graph is plotted between new hydropower generator capacity on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–15 GW) and year on the x-axis (from 2010 to 2050) depicting HydroPower Vision conventional hydro summary projections from 2016 to 2050. The various curves correspond to no new development, business as usual, advanced technology, low cost finance, and advanced technology, low cost finance, and combined environmental considerations.

different from low growth was possible, was based on collaboration of experts from more than
150 entities, including federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as industry trade
associations, manufacturers, environmental organizations, utilities, and research organizations.
The majority of participants were from federal agencies. HydroPower Vision ﬁnds, in summary
form:
. . . that U. S. hydropower could grow from 101 GW of capacity to nearly 150 GW by
2050. Growth under this modeled scenario would result from a combination of 13 GW of
new hydropower generation capacity (upgrades to existing plants, adding power at
existing dams and canals, and limited development of new stream-reaches), and
36 GW of new pumped storage capacity . . .
These ﬁndings stand in contrast to the here-to-fore accepted projections of scant hydropower
growth. HydroPower Vision examines several alternative scenarios for conventional hydro­
power: (1) no new development, (2) business as usual, (3) advanced technology, (4) low-cost
ﬁnance, and (5) advanced technology, low-cost ﬁnance, and combined environmental consid­
erations. Figure 3.27, taken from HydroPower Vision, provides an excellent summary of the
different scenarios and outcomes for conventional hydroelectric power. No new development
results in no increase in capacity (gigawatts), while business as usual adds about 5 GW through
2050. Advanced technology is projected to add about 5 GW, while low-cost ﬁnance would
secure an additional about 7 GW. However, if advanced technology and low-cost ﬁnance are

The various curves correspond to no new development, business as usual, advanced technology, low cost finance, and advanced technology, low cost finance, and combined environmental considerations.

60
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
coupled with environmental considerations, the increase in conventional hydroelectric gener­
ation capacity is about 13 GW by 2050.
In addition to conventional hydropower capacity growth (13 GW), HydroPower Vision
considers added pumped storage capacity (36 GW). The pumped storage scenarios are the
same as for conventional hydro, and the projections for pumped storage are displayed in
Figure 3.28. Pumped storage exhibits little growth from advanced technology, but beneﬁts from
low-cost ﬁnance much more than conventional hydro. As with conventional hydroelectric
power, the combination of advanced technology and low-cost ﬁnance coupled with environ­
mental considerations demonstrates the most increase in projected capacity. Indeed, for
pumped storage, low-cost ﬁnance is more important than environmental considerations.
HydroPower Vision points out that pumped storage could become a dominant source of
stored electricity energy capacity by 2050.
Which of these hydropower scenarios (traditional or HydroPower Vision) or what combina­
tion of the two will occur by 2050 cannot be known in 2016. Upgrades of existing hydroelectric
facilities are certainly possible, and the addition of signiﬁcant pumped storage capacity offers
enhanced ﬂexibility for grid management strategies. The HydroPower study does add to the
feasible energy mix and must be considered.

Wind Energy
4.1
Introduction
Wind energy, like solar energy, has captured much media attention recently. Indeed, wind
energy has exhibited the most rapid growth of all renewable energy sources in the last few years.
As shown in Figure 1.11, wind energy accounted for 18% of the renewable energy used in the
USA in 2014, up from 4% in 2007. Figure 1.12 illustrates the rapidity of the increase in installed
wind energy capacity in the USA from 2000 to 2013. Wind energy is also an increasingly
important component of the energy mix in western Europe. The purposes of this chapter are to
develop the fundamental principles of wind energy and to impart a quantitative understanding
of wind energy.
Devices to harvest wind energy are available in many different conﬁgurations. A number of
possible conﬁgurations are illustrated in Figures 4.1 and 4.2. Fundamental designations of a
wind energy device include the HAWT shown in Figure 4.1 and the VAWT in Figure 4.2. The
designation depends simply on the axis of rotation of a wind machine: HAWT devices rotate in
the horizontal plane and VAWT devices rotate in the vertical plane. HAWT devices are more
common than VAWTs, but horizontal devices must have a mechanism – a yaw control – to
keep them pointed into the wind. VAWTs, on the other hand, do not need a yaw control.
Many of the wind energy devices illustrated in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 are speculative; they have
little or no demonstrated functionality and are not available commercially. The most common
conﬁgurations for the HAWT are the two- and three-bladed, the windmill, and the sail wing.
The two- and three-bladed wind turbines can be either upwind or downwind, with upwind
being the most common. In terms of installed kilowatts, the total capacity of the HAWTs
greatly exceeds that of the VAWTs. Figure 4.3 presents photographs of HAWTs and VAWTs;
Figure 4.3a shows a large HAWT, suitable for commercial power generation, and the turbine
in Figure 4.3b is a much smaller device, suitable for a residence. A detailed examination of
characteristics of commercially available horizontal wind turbines will be provided later in this
chapter.
The Savonius and the Darrieus are the most common versions of the VAWT, with most of the
remaining vertical conﬁgurations either in the experimental/developmental or speculative
stage. However, even the Savonius and the Darrieus conﬁgurations have not been extensively
commercialized. VAWTs are generally classiﬁed as drag or lift devices, based on their operating
principle. The Savonius rotor is a drag device, since the drag of the wind on the “cups” generates
the torque on the axis. The Darrieus is classiﬁed as a lift device since the shaft torque results
primarily from lift on the blades. One indication of the dominance of the horizontal conﬁgura­
tion wind turbines is that on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) web site only
one photograph (depicting a Darrieus) of a VAWT is presented in the renewable-energy
photographic section. Figure 4.3c is reproduced from the NREL web site and is a photograph of a

power-available relationship, it is not surprising that the ideal location for wind turbines is
where wind speeds are high. Wind resource information will be examined in Section 4.3. The
most fundamental question relating to Equation 4.2 is how much of the available power can be
extracted from the wind. The analysis of Betz is the traditional approach used to answer the
question.The Betz analysis uses an actuator disk approach. In actuator theory, all energy transfer
takes place in the plane of the actuator, and only energy transformation takes place upstream
and downstream of the actuator. Actuator disk analysis is illustrated in Figure 4.5. The ﬁgure
depicts three distributions: pressure, velocity, and cross-sectional ﬂow area. Each will be
examined in turn. The actuator disk is represented by the blades in the pressure and velocity
distributions and by a solid line in the cross-sectional area distribution. The actuator area, the
area swept by the blades, is A  πD2=4, where D is the rotor diameter. Far upstream from the
actuator, at the point denoted as (e), for entrance, in Figure 4.5c, the velocity is the wind velocity
– c in this analysis. At the actuator disk, the velocity has been reduced to c1  a, and at the
outlet, indicated as (o), the velocity is c1  b. As the velocity is reduced from c to c1  a
upstream of the actuator, the static pressure increases from Pe to P1. When energy is extracted
from the ﬂow at the actuator, the pressure discontinuously decreases to P2. Downstream of the
actuator, as the velocity continues to decrease, the pressure increases from P2 to Po. Far
downstream of the actuator, atmospheric pressure is recovered, so that Po  Pe, the atmo­
spheric pressure. Since the velocity decreases from the entrance to the outlet, the cross-sectional
ﬂow area must increase. Cast in terms of the variables in the ﬁgure, the power available,
Equation 4.2, becomes

arguably the most referenced ﬁgure in wind turbine engineering. This ﬁgure presents the
expected range of power coefﬁcients for well-designed wind turbines of different conﬁgurations.

The Betz limit is shown on the ﬁgure. The Glauert ideal Cp is the result of a more detailed

ideal are the expected Cp values for different wind turbine conﬁgurations. The American multi-

In many recent publications, theA graph is plotted between power coefficient on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–0.7) and advance ratio on the x-axis (on a scale of 0–16 tip speed/wind speed) for different wind turbine configurations. A horizontal line just below y = 0.6 denotes Betz limit and the various curves correspond to Glauert idea;, two-blade, high speed; two-blade, Darrieus; Savonius; American multiblade; and Dutch windmill.

labels for the American multi-blade and the Savonius conﬁgurations have been interchanged,
with the result that the Savonius Cp values are smaller than those for the American multi-blade.
The values presented in Figure 4.6 are correct. This interchange of conﬁgurations designations
has had detrimental effects on considerations of Savonius devices, as the implication is that a
Savonius rotor would not be as efﬁcient as the American multi-blade. As pointed out by Johnson
(2001), such an error will take years to correct. In addition to the Savonius and the American
multi-blade, typical power coefﬁcient values for the Darrieus and the modern, high-speed two-
blade HAWT are presented. The HAWT shows relatively high Cp values over a rather wide
range of advance ratios.

Wind Energy Resources
Section 4.2 treated wind turbine performance in terms of a speciﬁed wind speed and pointed out
the cubic relationship between speed and power from the wind. Since the wind is variable in
terms of the speed, direction, and altitude, the results of the previous section need to be
extended to account for site-speciﬁc wind conditions. Extensive wind data are available at the
NREL web site, www.nrel.gov. The primary wind resources document is the Wind Energy
Resource Atlas of the United States (http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/). This atlas contains
annual average wind resource data as well as regional summaries and extensive explanations and
references for the statistics of wind. A unique feature is as assessment of the “certainty” of the
wind data. The wind data are rated from 1 (lowest degree) to 4 (the highest degree of certainty).
The wind power density distribution across the USA is very useful for ﬁrst-order evaluations
of candidate locations to determine if wind energy harvesting is feasible. The wind power density
is the available average wind power per square meter of wind turbine area. The basis of
the distribution classiﬁcation are the wind power density classes. The wind power density is
measured from class 1 (lowest) to class 7 (highest) and is speciﬁed at nominal 10 m and 50 m
elevations. Table 4.1 presents the wind power density classes and their associated wind speeds.

4 Wind Energy
Each wind class is bounded by a minimum wind power density and a maximum wind power
density. The wind speeds in meters per second and miles per hour corresponding to the
minimum and maximum wind power density values are also indicated in Table 4.1. For
example, class 4 is deﬁned as a wind power density between 200 and 250 W/m2 or wind speed
range between 5.6 and 6.0 m/s, all at 10 m elevation. At a 50 m elevation, the wind power classes
are deﬁned using different power density values than at 10 m elevation.
The most useful summary ﬁgure from the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States is
the annual average wind power density distribution, reproduced as Figure 4.7a. In this ﬁgure, the
darker the color, the higher the wind class. Much of the Midwest is assessed as wind class 3 or 4,
with isolated portions of the mountain west containing embedded regions of class 5 or 6. Except
for areas near the coast, the Southeast region is not generally suitable for wind energy
production. NREL states that wind energy is appropriate only for wind class 3 and above. A
newer NREL-derived ﬁgure is provided as Figure 4.7b: the average annual wind speed at an
elevation of 80 m. Figure 4.7b is likely the more useful of the two as it demonstrates that the USGeographical map of the United States depicting the US annual average wind resources: (a) wind power density and (b) wind speed at 80 m.

Midwest region is a prime location for high wind speeds at an elevation of 80 m –a good height
for large wind turbines.
The wind power density as illustrated in Figure 4.7 accounts for the yearly variation in wind
speed at given locations. In order to understand the basis of development of information such as
is contained in Figure 4.7, the statistics of wind energy need to be explored.
The probability of occurrence of a given wind speed v is expressed by the Weibull distribution:

c
In the Weibull distribution, c is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter. The shape
parameter controls the shape of the distribution; the larger the shape factor, the closer the
distribution comes to being Gaussian. The scale parameter controls the value of the mode (the
most probable speed). The larger the scale parameter, the higher the mode, and the lower the
probability of a given speed less than the mode. The shape parameter is dimensionless, and the
scale parameter must have the same units as the speed. For wind distributions, the shape
parameter value is usually near 2 (Patel, 2005).
Figure 4.8 presents the probability distribution, expressed in percent, for shape parameters of
1, 2, and 3 for a constant value of c  10 mph. A shape parameter of 1 yields an exponential
distribution that has the highest percentage of hours at zero speed, and a shape parameter of 2
results in a distribution skewed toward a higher percentage of occurrence at the lower speeds. A
shape parameter of 3 yields a more symmetrical distribution and starts to resemble the
Gaussian. A shape factor of k  2 provides a generally acceptable match for the wind speed
distribution at most sites.
Figure 4.9 illustrates the probability distribution, expressed in hours per year per mile per
hour, for scale parameters values of 10, 15, and 20 mph for a constant value of k  2. The smaller
the value of the scale parameter, the more hours at lower wind speeds. As the value of c
increases, the mode wind speed values increase and the number of hours per year at wind speeds
greater than the mode increases.
Figures 4.8 and 4.9 provide a visual interpretation of the behavior of the Weibull distribution.
Figure 4.10 was generated from wind data and shows an overlay of a Weibull distribution for
k  2. Although not an exact match, the results do demonstrate that the Weibull distribution isA graph is plotted between percent of hours/year per mph on the y-axis (on a scale of 0–12) and wind speed on the x-axis (on a scale of 0–50 mph) to present Weibull distribution for c =• 10 mph and various k values. The k values for the three curves are k = 1, 2, and 3.

6.36 m/s, and the power density is calculated as 158 W/m2. The mean speed is computed
using Equation 4.19 to be 7.98 m/s with a power density of 311 W/m2. This value is congruent
with what might be expected from a location suitable for wind energy extraction; see
Figure 4.7b. The rmc speed is 9.90 m/s (using Equation 4.21), and the power density at the
rmc speed is 594 W/m2. The use of Mathcad, and its ability to carry units in computations,
simpliﬁes the arithmetic in this example. Since the cubic power of the wind speed is speciﬁed
in the average power density expression, care should always be exercised to differentiate
between the mode, mean, and rmc speeds as the power density manifests signiﬁcant variation
depending on which value is used.
The energy density available for collection over a year per unit area of wind turbine is
speciﬁed in Equation 4.24, since hv; k; c  8760 represents the hours per year at a given wind
speed from the distribution. Figure 4.13 presents the energy density per year per square meter
per meter per second for the wind speed distribution speciﬁed in the problem statement. The
mode for the annual energy density available is near 13 m/s. Although the hours per year at
13 m/s are small (far from the mode, as illustrated in Figure 4.11), the product of this wind
speed and the hours per year is a maximum for the distribution because of the cubic
functional dependence on wind speed.
An estimate of the annual energy extracted for a Cp  0:5 for a given wind speed
distribution is provided by Equation 4.24. Under the assumption of a Cp  0:5, the annual
energy extracted for this distribution is 2600 kW h/(year/m2).
Section 4.2 delineated the performance characteristics of wind turbines at speciﬁed speeds.
This section has described the wind speed distribution description and the statistics of the
wind speed distribution. Section 4.4 assimilates the material in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 and
addresses the operation and control of wind turbines as a function of wind speed.
4.4
Wind Turbine Operation
What should the operating strategy be for a wind turbine as a function of wind speed? The
answer is not to always operate the wind turbine at the maximum power coefﬁcient. Why not
operate the wind turbine at the maximum Cp? Operation at the maximum Cp for all wind

79

speeds would maximize the energy extracted, but factors such as generator capacity,
structural requirements, and safety preclude such operation. The maximum speed-range
will occur for only a few hours for a given wind speed distribution. Thus, sizing a generator
for an input corresponding to the maximum-speed range would result in an oversized
generator that would operate at maximum output only a few hours per year. And if the
maximum Cp were speciﬁed, the advance ratio
would have to be maintained constant. As
the wind speed increased, the rotor rotation rate would have to increase to maintain a
constant Cp. Since the radial stresses in a rotor are proportional to the rotation speed,
operating at high wind speeds and a constant
would require a structurally robust wind
turbine. Additionally, as the wind speed increases, safety issues and structural integrity
become of increasing concern.
But, no matter what operating strategy is used, a wind turbine must contain a controller to
implement the strategy and mechanical elements to respond to the controller. Figure 4.14, from
the NREL web site, graphically illustrates typical HAWT features. The cutaway of the nacelle
shows the gearbox and generator as well as other elements needed for operation. The blades and
tower are also shown. The yaw motor and yaw drive are used to keep the plane of the blade
oriented into the wind. The pitch mechanism on the blades adjusts the angle of the blades (the
pitch) with respect to the wind direction in order to control the power extracted from the wind.
The purpose of the brake is to slow down or completely stop the rotor. All of these element are
needed to implement a control strategy.
The ultimate purpose of a wind turbine control strategy is to regulate the power output of the
turbine as a function of wind speed and direction. Additionally, the control protocol must
ensure safe operation over all wind conditions. Patel (2005) suggests that the power output
versus wind speed characteristic of a wind turbine can be viewed as being composed of several
regions. Figure 4.15, adapted from Patel (2005), illustrates a typical power output as a function of
wind speed and delineates the various operating regimes and conditions. The ordinate variable
is the percentage of generator output.
The ﬁrst condition is the cut-in speed of the system. Below the cut-in wind speed, the system
component efﬁciencies are so low that running the system is not worthwhile. Once the cut-in
speed is reached, the system is operated in a constant-Cp region. In the constant-Cp region, theFigure depicting HAWT nacelle components and features, where blades, rotor, pitch system, wind direction, brake, yaw drive, yaw motor, tower, low-speed shaft, gear box, controller, generator, high-speed shaft, nacelle, wind vane, anemometer are labeled.

turbine extracts the maximum power from the wind, but the power extracted is less than the
rated input to the generator. The rotor speed is varied so that the advance ratio is maintained
near the maximum Cp value. When the wind speed is sufﬁciently high, the power extracted by
the rotor can exceed the rated input of the generator. In this regime, the constant power output
regime, the system is made to produce the rated output of the generator by operating the turbine
at a Cp lower than the maximum Cp. The cut-out speed is the wind speed beyond which
operation would damage the system. For speed in excess of the cut-out, the rotor pitch is set to
unload the rotor, and the rotor is locked with the brake. The total energy that can be extracted
from a given wind distribution is reduced by the rated input of the generator and the cut-in and
cut-out speeds. Example 4.2 will be extended to illustrate these effects.
Example 4.3
The system described in Example 4.2 is speciﬁed to have a cut-in speed of 5 m/s, a cut-out
speed of 35 m/s, and a rated generator input of 0.8 kW/m2. The maximum power coefﬁcient
Cp is 0.45. Determine and plot the following for both the system with no controls and the
system controlled to meet the constraints: (a) the power density of the system, (b) the Cp
versus wind speed required, (c) energy extraction, and (d) the total energy extracted by the
system.
Solution
Much of the information requested for the “no controls” part of this problem was
accomplished in Example 4.2. However, since the results are more meaningful if both the “no
controls” and the controlled versions are compared, both will be examined in the solution.
Mathcad will be utilized for all the calculations. The Mathcad worksheet for the solution to
this problem is given in Figure 4.16.
The conditions and constraints deﬁned in the problem statement are entered in the
worksheet. The range of wind speed is designated by a Mathcad range variable, v╔0, 0.1, . . . ,
40 m/s. This range variable speciﬁes that the velocity v is to range from 0 to 40 m/s. Any time
v is speciﬁed, all of the values in the range are automatically included. The power density

and is graphically illustrated in Figure 4.18. The Cp is zero until the cut-in speed is reached and
zero for speed larger than the cut-out speed. The constant-Cp regime is present, as is the
variable-Cp regime.
The power densities multiplied by the wind speed probability distribution hv; k; c and the
number of hours in a year, 8760, yield the energy densities. Figure 4.19 is a representation of
the energy densities for the controlled and uncontrolled conditions. This ﬁgure is perhaps the
most revealing in the solution. The effects of the cut-out speed and the generator input
restriction are quite evident in the presentation. Since the areas under the curve are the total
energy extracted, the effects of the control constraints are evident, especially at the higher
wind speeds.
The energy densities integrated over all the speeds yield the total energy extracted. For the
case of no control, the total energy extracted is 2340 kW h/(year/m2) (slightly different from
the result in Example 4.2 since the Cp for Example 4.3 is 0.45). The actual energy extracted
corresponds to the case with controls implemented and is 1912 kW h/(year/m2). The capture
ratio is deﬁned as the ratio of the actual energy extracted divided by the maximum possible
(no controls) for a given wind speed distribution. For the conditions of this problem, the
capture ratio is 0.817; that is, 82% of the available energy can be extracted. The only ways to
signiﬁcantly change the capture ratio are to increase the rated input power of the generatorA graphical representation where CpV (ν) is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–0.6 and ν/m/s on the x-axis on a scale of 0–40.

and to increase the cut-out speed. For the stated conditions of this example problem, neither
of these strategies for increasing the capture ratio is appropriate. Increasing the rated input
power would be more expensive and would mean more generator operation at less than the
rated input. For example, doubling the rated input of the generator to1.6 kW/m2 would result
in a capture ratio of 0.941, an increase of only 15% in actual energy extracted. Increasing the
cut-off speed to a value much greater than 35 m/s would require enhanced structural integrity
of the tower, nacelle, and blades.
Vestas Wind Systems, a leading manufacturer, of large (megawatt range) wind turbines,
presents an interesting demonstration of the effectiveness of their control strategy for a
Vestas V52 850 kW wind turbine. Figure 4.20 illustrates the response of the generator output
for a V52 wind turbine subject to variations in wind speed.
The random nature of the wind speed variation is shown in Figure 4.20a. The purpose of
the control protocol is to maintain the generator output at a constant value, 850 kW. In order
to do this the blade pitch and the generator speed are modulated. Figure 4.20b and c
illustrates the required modulations in pitch angle and generator speed. The generator output
is tracked in Figure 4.20d. The success of the control protocol in maintaining a constant
generator output is evident.
Thus far, this section has addressed the operation of a single wind turbine. However, wind
turbine “farms,” employing arrays of turbines, are common for utility applications. For wind
turbines employed in arrays, the recommended space is 2–4 rotor diameters facing the
prevailing wind and 8–12 rotor diameters parallel to the prevailing wind. For more than a
single row of wind turbines in an array, the turbine locations in the succeeding rows are
staggered. Figure 4.21 provides a schematic illustration of the recommended spacing of wind
turbines on wind farms.

Growth in Wind Power Capacity
In the twenty-ﬁrst century, wind energy has exhibited the most increase in capacity of
all renewable energy sources, both in the USA and in the world. Figure 1.12 shows the
growth in various renewable energy resources in the USA from 2000 to 2013; the growth in
wind energy is by far the most impressive. A dramatic indication of the magnitude of the
increase in installed wind generating capacity since 1999 is provided by comparing
Figure 4.27a and b. Figure 4.27a presents the installed capacity in 1999 (end of year),
while Figure 4.27b shows the installed capacity as of September 2014. In 1999, the installed
capacity was 2472 MW, which increased to 62 300 MW by September 2014 – an increase of
2400%!
The rate of increase is expected to remain nearly constant. Recent projections by the EIA
are contained in Figure 4.28. An additional 14 GW of capacity is anticipated by the end of
2015, bringing the total installed wind generating capacity in the USA to 76 GW. Comparing
the wind class from Figure 4.7a and the average wind speed from Figure 4.7b with the installed
capacity in 2014 from Figure 4.27b and the projected installations from Figure 4.28, the
region of highest activity, the “sweet” spot, in the USA is the Midwest. Although the mountain
west offers higher wind power classes, terrain and population demographics favor the
Midwest.
One of the reasons for the continued rapid expansion of installed wind generating capacity has
been the favorable tax envirnoment. The wind federal production tax credit, enacted in 1992,
and continued more or less to the present, allowed eligible wind generators to take an inﬂation-
adjusted tax credit in 2014 of 2.3¢/kW h. This tax advantage is permitted for the ﬁrst 10 years of
operation of a commercial wind installation. Congress in December 2014 extended the tax
credit.
A number of companies, in the USA and worldwide, are engaged in the manufacture,
installation, operation, and maintenance of wind turbines. Figure 4.29 presents a breakdown of

companies (in terms of market share) that were involved in the installation of wind turbines in
the USA in 2012. At 38%, GE Wind captured nearly twice the market share of Siemens and three
times the market share of Vestas. The ﬁgure also serves as a good source of information on wind
turbines via company web sites.
The wind energy growth in the world is similar. Figure 4.30 graphically conﬁrms the
trend. The European Union (EU) has long pursued an aggressive commitment to
wind energy. Figure 4.31 provides a comparison, in 2012, of the EU share of the world’s
wind energy generating capacity. Considering the size and population of the EU
member counties, these results are impressive and conﬁrm the EU stance on renewable
energy.

Combustion Turbines 
5.1 Introduction 
Gas turbines were developed for aeronautical applications prior to and during World War II.
Wilson (1983) provides an excellent historical account of the engineering aspects of the
development of gas turbine engines. Frank Whittle in the UK and Hans von Ohain in Germany
are credited with essentially simultaneously producing the ﬁrst useful, ﬂightworthy gas turbine
engines. In the decades following World War II, the gas turbine engine became the preferred
propulsion system for most aircraft. At the same time, the inherent simplicity (compared with
other prime movers) and operational characteristics of the gas turbine engine resulted in its
adaptation for a variety of uses, including power generation and marine propulsion. When used
for electric power generation, gas turbines are often called combustion turbines to distinguish
them from steam turbines, a long-time mainstay of the electric power industry.
Combustion turbines are used for peaking, base-load, backup/emergency, and grid-independent
power generation as well as power sources for remote or isolated facilities such as offshore drilling
platforms. When used for electric power generation, combustion turbines are operated in two
modes: (1) electric power generation with no heat recovery and (2) electric power generation with
heat recovery. The latter is called combined heat and power (CHP) and is the subject of Chapter 11.
CHP is often referred to as cogeneration – the recovery and use of thermal energy in conjunction
with the decentralized generation of electricity. This chapter develops the principles for combustion
turbines.
5.2 The Combustion Turbine 
Figure 5.1 is a schematic of a combustion turbine showing the primary components: the
compressor, the combustor, and the turbine. Air is compressed as it passes through the
compressor. The work required to drive the compressor is provided by the turbine. Fuel is
burned in the combustor, and the temperature of the air and combustion products mixture is
increased by the combustion process. As the mixture expands through the turbine, the power
extracted by the turbine is used to power the compressor. In the combustion turbine, the
additional energy extracted by the “power” turbine is available as output power from the engine.
The combustion turbine output power is typically used to drive a generator for the production of
electricity. In many combustion turbines, only a single turbine section is present; part of the
power extracted is used to drive the compressor, and the remainder is the output power.
The Brayton cycle is often used as a representation of the gas turbine. The Brayton cycle is
composed of isentropic compression and expansion processes and constant-pressure heat
addition and rejection processes. P–v (pressure–speciﬁc volume) and T–s (temperature–

entropy) diagrams are provided in Figure 5.2 for a Brayton cycle gas turbine. State 1 is the inlet
state to the compressor, state 2 is the exit from the compressor and inlet to the combustor,
state 3 is the exit from the combustor and inlet to the turbine, and state 4 is the exit from the
turbine. The four states are indicated in Figures 5.1 and 5.2.
Most ﬁrst-order gas turbine analysis procedures use an air-standard analysis. Air standard
means that the working ﬂuid is air that is treated as an ideal gas. A cold air-standard analysis
means that the working ﬂuid is treated as air with all properties at their room-temperature
values. Thermodynamic properties for air and combustion products are thus needed for an air-
standard analysis. A thermally perfect gas is described by the thermal equation of state

A calorically perfect gas is a gas for which the speciﬁc heat at constant volume cv and the speciﬁc
heat at constant pressure cp are constant. A gas that is both thermally perfect and calorically
perfect is labeled a perfect gas. The ratio of speciﬁc heats is deﬁned as k  cp=cv.

In a gas turbine, the combustion products cause the properties at the exit of the combustor to
be different from those of air. However, in virtually all gas turbines the fuel-to-air ratio is less
than 0.02, so the actual deviations in combustor exit properties from those of air at the same
temperature and pressure are small. A reasonable estimate is that the thermodynamic constants
in the heat addition (combustion) process are the average of the air and combustion products:

5.3 The Air-Standard Brayton Cycle 
The cold air-standard Brayton cycle is the simplest model of a gas turbine. For the cold air-
standard Brayton cycle, the compressor work (per unit mass) Wc and the expansion work We are

where h represents the enthalpy, which for a thermally perfect gas can be cast as h  cpT. And
the heat supplied is
Qs  h3  h2
(5.5)
The net work out of the turbine is the difference between the turbine work and the
compressor work. In the Brayton cycle, combustion is replaced by heat addition, so the
mass ﬂow rates through all components are the same. The thermal efﬁciency is deﬁned as
the net work divided by the heat supplied. Hence, for the cold air-standard analysis

Thus, for a cold air-standard Brayton cycle, the thermal efﬁciency is only a function of the
pressure ratio. A plot of the thermal efﬁciency as a function of pressure ratio is presented in
Figure 5.3. A pressure ratio of 20 represents a reasonable upper limit for the pressure ratios
expected for typical gas turbines. The ﬁgure also demonstrates that, even for high pressure
ratios, the thermal efﬁciency is not likely to exceed 60%. The cold air-standard Brayton cycle
thermal efﬁciency also represents an effective upper bound for gas turbine engine performance
expectations.
5.4 Actual Gas Turbine Cycle Analysis 
The cold air-standard Brayton cycle is useful for quickly establishing limits and understanding
the working principles of a gas turbine engine, but irreversibilities (inefﬁciencies) must be
included in the component models for more realistic analyses. The usual irreversibilities
considered are losses in the compression and expansion processes and a pressure drop in
the heat addition process. Each will be examined in turn.
Consider the compression process with irreversibilities. Figure 5.4 illustrates a T–s diagram
with an isentropic compression from P1 to P2 and a compression process, also from P1 to P2,
with losses. The actual process is from state 1 to state 2, and the isentropic process is from state 1
to state 2s. The isentropic compression efﬁciency ηc is deﬁned as the ratio of the work required
in the isentropic process to the work required by the actual process, or

Equation 5.13 provides some insight into the thermodynamics of the compression process in gas
turbines. The higher the inlet temperature T1, the more work (per unit mass) required to
compress a gas through a given pressure ratio. Not surprisingly, the lower the isentropic
compression efﬁciency, the more compressor work required. Solving Equation 5.11 for the

Equations 5.11, 5.13, and 5.14 are the “working” expressions needed for the compression
process in a gas turbine. Equation 5.11 provides the isentropic compression efﬁciency given the
inlet conditions (P1 and T1) and the actual exit (P2 and T2) conditions. Given the pressure ratio,
inlet temperature, and isentropic compression efﬁciency, Equation 5.13 can be used to compute
the work required to drive the compressor. Given the pressure ratio, the inlet temperature, and
the isentropic compression efﬁciency, Equation 5.14 yields the actual compressor exit temper­
ature. The isentropic compression efﬁciency is deﬁned using the actual process and a reference

efﬁciency concept is exercised in Example 5.1.

Air enters the compressor of a gas turbine engine at 100 kPa (absolute) and 300 K. If the 
compressor pressure ratio is 8 and the isentropic compression efﬁciency is 0.87, ﬁnd the 
following: 
a) the exit temperature and pressure of the air from the compressor; 
b) the work (per unit mass) added to the air by the compressor; 
c) the exit temperature of the air if the compression process were isentropic.

A similar approach is used in deﬁning the isentropic expansion efﬁciency. The T–s diagram

the isentropic process is from state 3 to state 4s. The isentropic expansion efﬁciency ηe is deﬁned
as the ratio of the actual work extracted in the expansion process to the work that would be

Guidance for the expansion process is contained in Equation 5.19. The higher the turbine
inlet temperature T3, the more work (per unit mass) can be extracted from a turbine for a given
pressure ratio. This dependence on the turbine inlet temperature has been the driving impetus
for the quest for seeking materials that can tolerate higher temperatures in the turbine section.
And the lower the isentropic expansion efﬁciency, the less work can be extracted. Solving

Equations 5.17, 5.19, and 5.20 for the turbine (expansion process) are used in a fashion similar
to Equations 5.11, 5.13, and 5.14 for the compressor. The isentropic expansion efﬁciency, similar
to the isentropic compression efﬁciency, is deﬁned using the actual process and a reference
isentropic process, and is not deﬁned as a work in and work out relationship. The isentropic
expansion concept is demonstrated in Example 5.2.

a) the turbine exit temperature;

Some considerations of the combustor are appropriate. For ﬁrst-order estimates, modeling
the combustion process as a heat addition process does not introduce unacceptable errors. For
the air-standard Brayton cycle analysis, P2  P3; that is, no pressure change across the
combustor. In actual gas turbine combustors, P3 is less than P2; that is, a pressure drop is
_
experienced in the combustor. The pressure drop is caused by two effects: (1) friction and
mixing losses in the combustor and (2) the Rayleigh effect (“simple” heat addition in an open
system results in a loss in pressure) (Hodge and Koenig, 1995). For well-designed combustors,
the drop in pressure is small, typically less than 5% of the pressure at the inlet of the combustor.
The heat of reaction per unit mass resulting from the complete combustion of a fuel is
deﬁned as the fuel heating value. Heating values are speciﬁed either as the lower heating value
(LHV) or the higher heating value (HHV). The HHV means that the water in the combustion
products is in liquid form – that is, the water vapor has been condensed. The LHV value
means that the water in the combustion products is in a gaseous state. For most gas turbines,
the LHV is used since the temperatures are above the condensing temperature of the water
vapor. Table 5.1 provides a compilation of the nominal heating values of typical gas turbine
fuels.

process to the rate of heating of the air, or

The fuel-to-air ratio in a gas turbine is small because the amount of fuel that can be added is
constrained by the high-temperature-limit mechanical properties of the materials used in the
combustor and the turbine. Example 5.3 illustrates the concept.
Example 5.3
A combustion turbine utilizing natural gas as a fuel has a combustor exit temperature of
1500 K and a compressor exit temperature of 690 K. Estimate the fuel-to-air ratio.

The numbers in this example are typical for gas turbines. The fuel-to-air ratio is 0.019, which
veriﬁes that the fuel ﬂow rate is low compared with the air ﬂow rate.
The thermal efﬁciency of an actual gas turbine, neglecting the effects of the fuel ﬂow rate, is
deﬁned as in Equation 5.5:

For a combustion turbine that is producing electricity with no heat recovery, the most

The heat rate from Equation 5.24 is based on the shaft power available from the operation of the

dimensionless heat rate can be expressed as

However, the heat rate, especially for electrical generation, is usually expressed in the units of

both British thermal units per kilowatt-hour and kilojoules per kilowatt-hour. Consider
Example 5.4.

A combustion turbine possesses a thermal efﬁciency ηt of 31% and a generator efﬁciency of

The heat rate states that for every 11 231 Btu of input energy, 1 kW h of electricity is produced by

A more comprehensive example is in order.
Example 5.5
A combustion turbine possesses the following characteristics:
Compressor
97 kPa (abs) and 30 °C, inlet conditions
pressure ratio of 5.5
isentropic compression efﬁciency of 0.84
Combustor

the fuel is natural gas
Turbine

Determine the overall thermal efﬁciency and the heat rate, and sketch the T–s diagram. Is the
fuel ﬂow rate small compared with the air ﬂow rate?
Solution
If the fuel ﬂow rate is small compared with the air ﬂow rate, the thermal efﬁciency
is described by Equation 5.22. T1, T2, T3, and T4 are needed in order to calculate the thermal
efﬁciency. The inlet temperature T1 is given as 30 °C, or 303 K. The compressor exit tempera­

Thus, the fuel ﬂow rate is small compared with the air ﬂow rate.
Taking into account the states (1, 2, 3, and 4) of the combustion turbine, the T–s diagram
appears as in Figure 5.6.
Most of the development to this point has been based on the assertion that the fuel ﬂow
rate is small in comparison with the air ﬂow rate. Equation 5.23 for the thermal efﬁciency of a
gas turbine was formulated based on this assertion. The thermal efﬁciency of a gas turbine
including the effects of fuel ﬂow rate can be developed by considering the power required by
the compressor and extracted by the turbine, or

where f =a is the fuel-to-air ratio. Thus, to account for the effect of the fuel mass ﬂow rate, the
thermal efﬁciency expression with the fuel mass ﬂow rate included is very similar to the thermal
efﬁciency expression, except that the factor 1  f =a appears in the turbine work and heat
addition terms. Cohen et al. (1972) point out that in many gas turbines, 1 or 2% of the
compressed air is bled from the compressor and that the fuel ﬂow rate is 1 or 2% the air ﬂow rate.
Hence, the two essentially cancel out, and, as a result, the mass ﬂow rates through the
compressor and turbine tend to be equal.
5.5 Combustion Turbine Cycle Variations 
Figure 5.1 and most of this chapter has been devoted to aspects of Brayton-cycle-like gas
turbines. However, as fuel prices continue to be a signiﬁcant cost and as the electrical utility grid
becomes more stressed, more thermally efﬁcient combustion turbines are becoming increas­
ingly attractive. Although there are many variations of the basic combustion turbine cycle, two
are especially effective: (1) the addition of a recuperator (regenerator) and (2) the addition of a
compressor intercooler.
As the example problems demonstrate, turbine exhaust temperatures are well above ambient
conditions and offer the potential for heat recovery. A recuperator is a heat exchanger that uses
the turbine exhaust gases to preheat the air exiting the compressor before the air enters the
combustor. Increasing the temperature of the air entering the combustor reduces the amount of
fuel necessary for a given combustor exit temperature. A decrease in Qs, the denominator term
in the thermal efﬁciency expression (Equation 5.23), results in an increased thermal efﬁciency.
The schematic of a combustion turbine with a regenerator is provided in Figure 5.7.

Figure 5.7 Gas turbine with regenerator.
A schematic  di agram o f ga s turbine w ith  intercooler an d two-compression stages.
The other common variation of the basic combustion turbine cycle is produced with the
addition of an intercooler. As Equation 5.13 indicates, the compressor work required to achieve
a given pressure ratio is directly proportional to the inlet temperature. Thus, if the compression
process is broken into two or more stages, the heat removed from an upstream stage results in a
reduction in the inlet temperature of the downstream stage, reducing the compressor work
required for the latter compression stage. Figure 5.8 illustrates a combustion turbine with an
intercooler between the low-pressure and high-pressure compressor sections.
For ground-based gas turbines, such as combustion turbines, the added weight and volume of
a regenerator or intercooler are not problems. The inclusion of a regenerator or intercooler
decreases the heat rate and increases the overall cycle thermal efﬁciency.
5.6 Examples of Commercially Available Combustion Turbines 
Combustion turbines are commercially available in an electrical power output range from
30 kW (micro) to 250 MW. The term “microturbine” is applied to combustion turbines with
electrical outputs less than 60–200 kW. Industrial turbines typically have electrical outputs of

106 
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
0.5–250 MW. The internet is a ready source of general information on commercially available
combustion turbines.
In the USA, industrial combustion turbines are available from a number of companies,
including Solar Turbines, Siemens-Westinghouse, United Technologies Corporation (Pratt &
Whitney Division), Rolls-Royce (North America), and General Electric (GE) Energy. The
examples presented here are a relatively small sample of commercially available combustion
turbines. No recommendation or endorsement of the manufacturers is implied by the inclusion
of the examples in this section; the examples are merely samples of what is commercially
available.
5.6.1
Solar Turbines
Solar Turbines Incorporated, a subsidiary of Caterpillar Incorporated, manufactures a line of
combustion turbines with electrical output in the range 1–22 MW. More than 15 000 Solar
Turbines units have been installed worldwide. Solar Turbines offers combustion turbines
systems for (1) the oil-and-gas industry and (2) the power generation industry. Table 5.2 lists the
family of turbines available for the generally severe requirements of the oil-and-gas sector along
with their nominal outputs (kilowatts and horsepower) and the ISO-rated heat rates (British
thermal units per kilowatt-hour, kilojoules per kilowatt-hour, and British thermal units per
horsepower per hour). Table 5.3 tabulates the family of turbines available for the power
generation industry along with their nominal outputs (kilowatts) and the ISO-rated heat rates
(British thermal units per kilowatt-hour and kilojoules per kilowatt-hour). In common in the
power generation industry, the output is usually expressed in kilowatts and the heat rates in
kilojoules per kilowatt-hour or British thermal units per kilowatt-hour. The two tables
demonstrate only slight differences in the performance metrics between the oil-and-gas and
the power generation sectors. Information for the tables was obtained from the Solar Turbines
product speciﬁcations on their web site.
For the Solar Turbines family of combustion turbines, the effect of size is interesting, as the
heat rate is essentially monotonic with electrical output – the heat rate decreases with increasing
output – except for the Mars and Mercury turbines.

The Solar Turbines web site (https://mysolar.cat.com/en_US/products/gas-turbine-overview

is the Mars 100 combustion turbine with an ISO nominal rating of 11 860 kW. The nominal ISO
performance is for 15 °C at sea level with 60% relative humidity. The Mars 100 data sheet
is
available
at
https://mysolar.cat.com/en_US/products/oil-and-gas/gas-turbine-packages/
compressor-sets/mars-100.html. As with all combustion turbines, the inlet air temperature
has a signiﬁcant impact on the electrical output and the heat rate for the Mars 100. Decreasing
output as the inlet temperature increases is a characteristic of gas turbines. At the ISO rating
conditions, the Mars 100 electrical output is 11.86 MW with a heat rate of 9919 Btu/(kW h) and
an exhaust ﬂow rate of 337 900 lbm/h at 905 °F. The electrical outputs and heat rates vary from
about 13.7 MW and 9810 Btu/(kW h) at 22 °F to about 10 MW and 10 300 Btu/(kW h) at
100 °F in a monotonic fashion.

GE Energy
GE Energy is a major provider of a variety of energy systems in the USA. The company offers
combustion turbines via two end-use designations: (1) oil and gas and (2) power and water.
Table 5.4 contains a partial listing of GE Energy gas turbines used for power generation,
although most of the turbines in the list are also available with mechanical power output instead
of power generation. Their combustion turbines are denoted as aeroderivative or heavy duty.
Details are available on the GE Energy web site (www.gepower.com) and can be accessed as
either “oil and gas” or “power and water.”
The GE Energy aeroderivative combustion turbines are based on their very successful line of
aircraft engines. The company’s aeroderivative line of gas turbines provides an output range of
11–100 MW as well as the ability to utilize a variety of fuels. In addition to power generation, the
GE Energy aeroderivative gas turbines have been used for marine applications and a variety of
oil-and-gas sector applications. Included are the LMS100, the LM6000, the GE10, and the PGT
family (with the compressors from the LM1600, the LM2000, or the LM2500 gas turbines).
Details are available on each of the gas turbines on the GE Energy web site. The LM2500,
perhaps the most successful and long-lived of the GE family of combustion turbines, offers
different electrical output energy rating, different applications (including marine), and different
cycle features. GE Energy offers many variations on their line of gas turbines; the values in

Table 5.4 are representative and are only a sample of available systems. The LM2500 was derived
from the CF6 aircraft engine used on large commercial and military aircraft. The LM2500 and
the LMS100 will be examined in more detail later in this section.
The heavy-duty gas turbines are available with electrical outputs ranging from 26 to 470 MW
(in simple cycle conﬁguration) and were speciﬁcally developed for utility and industrial
applications. The 7F and 9F conﬁgurations have steadily evolved and offer the highest outputs
of the GE Energy gas turbines. In combined cycle operation, the heavy duty 7F and 9F possess
impressive output magnitudes (up to 976 MW) and heat rates (as low as 5570 Btu/(kW h)).
Considering the range of outputs (11–976 MW), the number and variations available, the
output options (power generation or mechanical power extraction), and the number of units in
service, GE Energy is a dominant player in the combustion turbine arena.
Figure 5.9 shows a cutaway drawing of the LM2500. Table 5.4 presents a summary of the
LM2500 gas turbine performance, and Figure 5.10 illustrates the electrical output and heat rate
as a function of the inlet temperature.
The LMS100 is an advanced aeroderivative combustion turbine that utilizes intercooling
between the low- and high-pressure compressor stages. A unique feature of the LMS100 is that
the intercooler heat exchanger is not adjacent to the engine package but is located away from the
engine installation. Discharge air from the low-pressure compressor section is ducted to the

Capstone Turbines
Capstone Turbines manufactures microturbines in the 30–200 kW range and is arguably the
best known of the microturbine manufacturers in the USA. Capstone offers a nominal 30 kW
unit, the C30, a nominal 65 kW unit, the C65, and a nominal 200 kW, the C200. The Capstone
turbines are offered in versions that utilize different fuels and offer a number of options for
exhaust stream heat recovery. The basic, natural-gas fueled, C30 will be previewed herein. The
C30 is 70 in high, 30 in wide, and 60 in deep and weighs 891 lb. Table 5.6 presents the
performance speciﬁcations at ISO conditions. Additional information is available on the
Capstone web site (www.capstoneturbine.com).
A cutaway view of the basic C30 is provided in Figure 5.14. The compact C30 layout is much
different from layouts of the much higher output combustion turbines previously examined
herein. Natural-gas-ﬁred microturbines without recuperators produce electricity at efﬁciencies

around 15%. Thus, most microturbines are equipped with recuperators that result in electrical
generation efﬁciencies from 20% to 30%. Recuperated microturbines yield 30–40% fuel savings
by preheating the incoming combustion air. The C30 recuperator is indicated, as is the casing
for the recuperator. The rotating components are attached to a single shaft and are supported by
air bearings. The air bearings permit rotational speeds as high as 96 000 rpm. Because the
generator is cooled by the inlet air ﬂow and air bearings are utilized, no oil, lubricants, or
coolants are required.
The output electrical power and the electrical efﬁciency as a function of input temperature are
illustrated in Figure 5.15. In a fashion similar to the large power output combustion turbines, the
performance of the C30 decreases as the ambient temperature is increased.
Combustion turbines are relatively inexpensive compared with most decentralized power
generation systems. The basic cost of combustion turbines ranges from $300/kW to $1000/kW
and generally decreases with increasing power output. Combustion turbines cost more than
internal combustion engines with smaller power output but cost less than larger power output
internal combustion engines. Installation costs and the cost of other required components, plus
other owner or miscellaneous costs, increase the initial capital costs by 30–50%. A natural-gas
compressor is an example of a component that is required in sequence, since natural-gas
compressors are needed to meet the high gas pressure requirements of combustion turbines.
Natural-gas compressors increase the costs of a combustion turbine system by 5–10%. Also, if
heat recovery capability is added, the capital cost increases by $100–$200 per kilowatt.
Fully installed, the typical installed cost of a combustion turbine with a heat recovery is in
the $1000/kW to $1200/kW range.

5.7 Closure 
The essentials of combustion turbines have been developed in this chapter, and some typical
commercially available combustion turbines have been examined. In this chapter the focus has
been on combustion turbines uses for the generation of electricity only. However, as is evident
from the exhaust temperatures of the examples, the potential for signiﬁcant thermal energy
recovery exists. Chapter 11 examines the concept of CHP or the decentralized generation of
electricity coupled with the recovery and use of exhaust thermal energy as from a combustion
turbine.

Solar Energy Fundamentals
6.1
Introduction
This chapter and Chapters 7, 8, and 9 will examine solar energy. The purposes of this chapter are
to review radiation heat transfer and to present fundamental solar energy information necessary
to understand the applications of the next three chapters.
6.2
Radiation Heat Transfer Review
An understanding of solar energy must be based on the spectral nature of solar radiation from
the sun. This section reviews the fundamental radiation heat transfer information needed for
solar energy engineering processes.
From a solar energy standpoint, two areas of interest are the characteristics of energy from the
sun and the response of a surface to that energy. The starting point is to consider the
characteristics of radiation heat transfer. Thermal radiation may be viewed as the transport
of photons or the propagation of an electromagnetic wave. For the propagation of radiation in a
medium, the frequency and wavelength are related as
c
λ 
(6.1)
ν
where c is the speed of light in the medium, λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. In a
vacuum, c  2:998  108 m=s.
The electromagnetic continuum is divided into different regimes as a function of the
wavelength. The regimes and wavelength ranges are delineated in Table 6.1.
Of interest in solar energy engineering is thermal radiation in the wavelength range
101 < λ < 102 m. The visible part of the spectrum is in the range 0:4 < λ < 0:7 m and is
bounded by the ultraviolet and the infrared. Part of the ultraviolet and the infrared regimes are
also in the thermal radiation regime.
The magnitude of thermal radiation varies with the wavelength and gives rise to the spectral
distribution. In addition to the spectral nature of thermal radiation, a key feature is the
directional distribution. In order for thermal radiation to be quantiﬁed, both the spectral
and directional attributes must be examined.
A good starting point is to consider the characteristics of a blackbody.
1) A blackbody absorbs all incident radiation, regardless of wavelength and direction.
2) For a prescribed temperature and wavelength, no surface can emit more energy than a
blackbody.
3) The blackbody is a diffuse (independent of direction) emitter.

where C1  3:742  108 W m4=m2 and C2  1:439  104 m K. The spectral emissive power
density Eλ;b is customarily expressed in the units of watts per micrometer per square meter,
which is interpreted as the emissive power per unit area per wavelength. The subscripts λ and b
in Equation 6.2 signify that the power density is per wavelength (spectral) and is from a
blackbody respectively. The total emissive power density of a blackbody is the integral of the
blackbody spectral emissive power density over all wavelengths, or

functional
dependence of the blackbody emissive power is one of the strongest functional dependencies
in physics and emphasizes the importance of temperature is thermal radiation.
Additional examination of Equation 6.2 is warranted. Figure 6.1, plotted in log–log coor­
dinates, presents a graphical study of the blackbody spectral emissive power density for several
different temperatures. T  5800 K is one of the temperatures considered because the spectral
distribution of thermal radiation from the sun is close to that of a blackbody at 5800 K. The
pronounced effect of temperature on the blackbody spectral emissive power is demonstrated by
its range: eight orders of magnitude, from 1 W/( m m2) to nearly 108 W/( m m2). Also of
interest is the location of the maximum spectral emissive power as a function of surface
temperature. For example, at T  300 K, close to room temperature, the maximum occurs near
λ  10 m, but as the temperature is increased the maximum shifts to shorter wavelengths; thus,
at T  5800 K the maximum is near 0.5 m. Not surprisingly, λ  0:5 m is the middle of the
visible spectrum for which vision on Earth is optimally adapted. The thermal radiation range
given in Table 6.1 is congruent with the results of Figure 6.1, as the 101 < λ < 102 m range of
Figure 6.1 contains virtually all the emitted energy for these relevant temperatures. The total
blackbody emissive power is the “area under the curve,” and the blackbody emissive power at
T  5800 K is 140 000 times that at T  300 K.
For many radiation heat transfer considerations, the fraction of energy contained between a
wavelength interval is needed. The basis of obtaining such fractions is the blackbody radiation
function. Using the Planck distribution, the fraction of thermal energy in the wavelength range

Many heat transfer textbooks contain tabulations of the blackbody radiation function, or
Equations 6.2 and 6.4 can be integrated to give the blackbody radiation function values.
However, Howell et al. (2010) devised a closed-form series that replicates, to within a fraction of
a percent, the accepted blackbody radiation function values, but also provides a convenient
expression for use in many problem solutions. Their series appears as

where ζ  C2=λT. Table 6.2 contains a tabular listing of Equation 6.5 as a function of λT.
Table 6.2 and Equation 6.5 will be used in the solution of example problems requiring the use of
the blackbody radiation function. Example 6.1 illustrates the use of the blackbody radiation
function.
Example 6.1
For a blackbody at 5800 K, what is the percentage of energy contained in the visible part of
the spectrum? Contrast this with the percentage of energy contained in the visible spectrum
for a blackbody at 3000 K.
Solution
Two different approaches for obtaining the solution will be presented and dis­
cussed: (1) the use of Table 6.2 and (2) the use of Equation 6.5 and Mathcad. The visible
spectrum spans the wavelength range 0:4  λ  0:7 m. Figure 6.3, with λ1  0:4 m and

119

Figure 6.3 Visible spectrum range for a
5800 K blackbody.
λ2  0:7 m, illustrates the range of interest for the 5800 K blackbody. F0  λ2T provides the
fraction of radiant energy from 0 to λ2, and F0  λ1T provides the fraction from 0 to λ2. The
fraction of radiant energy contained between λ1 and λ2 can be expressed as the difference, or
Fλ2T  λ1T  F0  λ2T  F0  λ1T
(6.6)
Equation 6.6 is the fundamental radiation function algebra relationship.
The Table 6.2 approach will be illustrated ﬁrst. For the blackbody at 5800 K we have
λ1T  0:4 m  5800 K  2320 m K
λ2T  0:7 m  5800 K  4060 m K
Interpolating between the entries in Table 6.2 yields
F2320 m K  0:1244
F4060 m K  0:4913
So that the fractional radiant energy contained between λ1  0:4 m and λ2  0:7 m becomes
Fλ2T  λ1T  0:4913  0:1244  0:3669
Thus, for a 5800 K blackbody, 37% of the radiant energy is contained in the visible part of the
spectrum.
The same procedure is applied for the 3000 K blackbody, except that the temperature used
is 3000 K, not 5800 K. The results can be summarized as
λ1T  0:4 m  3000 K  1200 m K
λ2T  0:7 m  3000 K  2100 m K
F1200 m K  0:0021
F2100 m K  0:0838
Fλ2T  λ1T  0:0830  0:0021  0:0817
Hence, for the 3000 K blackbody only 8% of the total radiant energy is in the visible range.
Figure 6.4 presents the solution using Equation 6.5 and Mathcad. The same procedure is
followed, with the only major difference being the use of Equation 6.5 for the blackbody
radiation function. The use of the Howell et al. (2010) expression is very convenient, as it
obviates the need for table lookups and interpolations to solve spectral distribution problems.
As the remainder of the section will demonstrate, this ability will be important for a number
of thermal radiation problems not limited to blackbody formulations. The results in
Figure 6.4 are more accurate than using Table 6.2 since no interpolation is required, but the
differences between the two approaches are so negligible that for most purposes either will

The source of solar energy on the Earth is obviously the sun. The sun is located
1.50 × 1011 m from the Earth and has a diameter of 1.39 × 109 m. The solar constant, deﬁned
as the ﬂux of solar energy incident on a surface oriented normal to the rays of the sun has a
mean value of 1353 W/m2. However, the solar constant is the ﬂux incident at the outer edge
of the atmosphere. For terrestrial applications, what is important is the solar ﬂux incident on
the surface of the Earth, after the sun’s rays have passed through the atmosphere. Figure 6.5
provides a quantitative assessment of the solar ﬂux. The spectral distribution is illustrated as
extraterrestrial (incident on the edge of the atmosphere) and on the Earth’s surface. The
extraterrestrial solar ﬂux has approximately the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation at
5800 K, but not the total emissive power of a blackbody – as a comparison of Figures 6.1 and
6.2 will conﬁrm.
As the solar ﬂux passes through the atmosphere, it is attenuated by the presence of oxygen
(O2), ozone (O3), water vapor (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). As a result, the solar ﬂux at
the Earth’s surface is signiﬁcantly less than the extraterrestrial solar ﬂux. As the solar ﬂux
traverses the atmosphere, both the magnitude and directional distributions are altered. These
alternations are due to absorption and scattering. The innermost plot in Figure 6.5
demonstrates the absorption of radiant energy by the gases in the atmosphere. In the
ultraviolet regime, 102 < λ < 0:4 m, ozone is responsible for the absorption and results in
virtually no solar ﬂux reaching the surface for λ < 0:3 m. Part of the concern about

depletion of the ozone layer is that without the ozone much more of the thermal radiation in
the ultraviolet regime would reach the surface of the Earth, with long-term, deleterious
results. In the infrared regime, the absorption is primarily due to water vapor, although CO2
also plays a role. For all wavelengths, thermal radiation is also absorbed by the particulates
content of the atmosphere.
In addition to absorption, scattering occurs, resulting in the redirection of the sun’s rays.
Rayleigh scattering, attributable to the gas molecules, provides for virtually uniform scattering
of thermal radiation. The uniformity of Rayleigh scattering means that about one-half of the
scattered radiation is redirected away from the Earth. At any point on the Earth’s surface, the
scattered radiation is incident from all directions. Mie scattering by the particulates in the
atmosphere does little to reorient the sun’s rays. Bergman et al. (2011) provide the following
cogent summary:
That portion of the radiation that has penetrated the atmosphere without having been
scattered (or absorbed) is in the direction of the zenith angle and is termed the direct
radiation. The scattered radiation is incident from all directions, although its intensity is
largest for the directions close to that of the direct radiation. However, because the
radiation intensity is often assumed to be independent of the direction, the radiation is
termed diffuse.
The total thermal radiation reaching the surface is the sum of the direct and the diffuse
components. On a clear day, the diffuse may account for only 10% of the total, while on a
cloudy day it is essentially 100% of the total.

Figure 6.6 Hemisphere surrounding an area
emitting thermal radiation.
With the characteristics of thermal radiation from the sun understood, consideration of
radiation heat transfer fundamentals for a surface is appropriate. Speciﬁc topics include (1)
what happens when thermal radiation is incident on a surface and (2) the emission
characteristics of a surface. Emission will be examined ﬁrst.
The emissive characteristics of a blackbody have been established. Emissions from a non-
blackbody can have directional and spectral characteristics. Consider, as in Figure 6.6, a
hemisphere surrounding an elemental area that is emitting thermal radiation. The hemisphere
about the emitting area dA is a convenient mechanism for visualizing the geometry of thermal
radiation. The spectral intensity Iλ,e of the emitted radiation is deﬁned as the rate at which
radiant energy is emitted at the wavelength λ in the θ; φ direction per unit area of the
emitting surface normal to this direction, per unit solid angle about this direction, and per unit
wavelength interval dλ about λ. The normal to the emitting surface area in the θ; φ direction
is the area dAn in Figure 6.6. If the blackbody surface is used as the basis, the spectral
directional emissivity ελ;θλ; θ; φ; T is deﬁned as the ratio of the emitted radiation intensity in
a given direction at a given wavelength divided by the radiation intensity of a blackbody:
Iλ;eλ; θ; φ; T
ελ;θλ; θ; φ; T 
(6.7)
Iλ;bλ; T
Equation 6.7 provides a process for computing the actual emission in reference to that of a
blackbody and provides a process for computing the actual emission if ελ;θλ; θ; φ; T is known. If
the spectral directional intensity is integrated over 0  φ  2π and 0  θ  π=2, the spectral
hemispherical emissivity ελλ; T results and is deﬁned as
Iλ;eλ; T
Eλλ; T

(6.8)
Iλ;bλ; T
Eλ;bλ; T
where Eλλ; T is the spectral hemispherical emissive power and ελλ; T is the spectral
hemispherical emissivity. Since the angular dependences have been integrated out, the word
“hemispherical” rather than “directional” is used. The transition from Iλ;eλ; T to Eλλ; T is
seamless since the emission intensity is based on the projected area and the emission is based on
the actual area, and they are related as Eλλ; T  πIλ;eλ; T. Details are provided in heat transfer
textbooks such as Bergman et al. (2011). If the spectral hemispherical emissive power is

appears as

EbT
where E(T) is the total hemispherical emissive power and ε(T) is the total hemispherical
emissivity, generally referred to as simply the emissivity. The integration sequence is from
spectral directional to spectral hemispherical to total hemispherical. Values for the spectral,
hemispherical, and total hemispherical emissivities of various materials are available from
handbooks and textbooks and on a number of web sites (e.g., http://www.icess.ucsb.edu/modis/
EMIS/html/em.html).
Example 6.2
A wall at T s  500 K has the spectral emissivity illustrated in Figure 6.7. Determine the total
emissivity and the emissive power of the surface.
Solution
Once the total emissivity is known, Equation 6.9 can be used to calculate the
emissive power. The emissive power of the surface is composed of the individual contribution
for each wavelength range associated with each spectral hemispherical emissivity, or

(6.11)
Thus, by using the spectral emissive description of the surface behavior, the blackbody radiation
function can be used to make computations for non-blackbody surfaces.
The Mathcad worksheet for this problem is presented in Figure 6.8. The total emissivity is
0.6099, and the total emissive power is 2161 W/m2. By comparison, if the surface were a
blackbody, the total emissive power would have been 3544 W/m2.
Equations 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 involve surface emissions of thermal radiation. Radiation incident on
surface is called irradiation and is denoted as G, and the spectral irradiation (the irradiation at a
given wavelength) is denoted as Gλ. Three things happen to thermal radiation incident on a
surface: (1) some is absorbed, (2) some is reﬂected, and (3) some is transmitted. Figure 6.9
schematically illustrates these processes. Consider each of the possibilities in turn. Irradiation, like

emitted radiation, has a spectral nature; but unlike emitted radiation, whose spectral character­
istics are determined by the surface temperature, the spectral characteristics of irradiation are
determined by the source of the irradiation. And just like emitted radiation, irradiation has
directional attributes. Surface properties associated with irradiation are described by three terms:
(1) absorptivity, for the absorbed irradiation, (2) reﬂectivity, for the reﬂected irradiation, and (3)
transmissivity, for the transmitted irradiation. The same hierarchy of spectral directional to
spectral hemispherical to total hemispherical is used. Working deﬁnitions are as follows.

If the spectral absorptivity is equal to the spectral emissivity of Example 6.2, ελ  αλ, and if the
irradiation G of 750 W/m2 has the spectral characteristics of a blackbody at 2000 K, ﬁnd the
total absorptivity, the total reﬂectivity, and the irradiation absorbed if the surface is opaque.
Solution
The spectral absorptivity is known from Example 6.2. Since the irradiation has the
spectral characteristics of a blackbody at 2000 K, the blackbody emission function with the
temperature of 2000 K can be used to describe the spectral distribution of the irradiation.
Since the surface is opaque, the transmissivity is zero. The Mathcad solution is presented in
Figure 6.10. The solution follows the general approach of Example 6.2. Several things are of
interest in the problem. Because of the spectral characteristics of the surface, α ≠ε, which is
an assumption sometimes made for problems such as this. The irradiation is not that of a
blackbody, but the irradiation has the spectral characteristics of a blackbody at 2000 K.
In the problem statement for Example 6.3, ελ  αλ: under what conditions is this a viable
assertion? When is α  ε acceptable? Most heat transfer textbooks address these issues. The
usual question to ask is, when is ελ;θ  αλ;θ? This is always true, since ελ;θ and αλ;θ are
properties of the surface and are independent of the emission or irradiation. The spectral
hemispherical emissivity and absorptivity are equal under two conditions: (1) when the
irradiation is diffuse or (2) when the surface is diffuse. For many problems of interest, one of
these conditions is often approximated. Moving up the hierarchy, when is α  ε? The total
absorptivity is equal to the total emissivity under two circumstances: (1) when the irradiation

Alternative Energy Systems and ApplicationsFigure depicting the Mathcad solution for Example 6.3.
Figure 6.10 Mathcad solution of Example 6.3.
corresponds to that of blackbody or (2) when the surface is gray. A gray surface is a surface
for which ελ  αλ for all λ (in the ranges of interest). Many spectrally selective surfaces, such
as the one in Examples 6.2 and 6.3, are not gray surfaces, and α ≠ε.
Table 6.3 presents the emissivity and solar absorptivity for selected surfaces. The ratio α=ε
of the absorptivity for solar irradiation and the emissivity is a useful solar engineering
parameter, as small values reject heat and large values absorb solar energy.
The foregoing review of radiation heat transfer is sufﬁcient for the needs of this book. The
next section will explore the motion of the sun with respect to the Earth.

Sun Path Description and Calculation
An understanding of the position of the sun relative to the Earth is important for solar
engineering topics. Perhaps the most effective tool for explaining and understanding the position
of the sun is the sun path – the path of the sun in relation to a location on the surface of the Earth.
A number of textbooks, reference books, and web sites contain discussions, descriptions, tables,
and illustrations of sun paths for various locations. However, few describe how to calculate sun
paths or contain software elements to aid in their computation. The purpose of this section is to
provide a procedure for calculating and understanding sun path lines.

Consider the Earth–sun geometric relationship. As illustrated in Figure 6.11, the Earth rotates
at an angle of 23.45° with respect to the ecliptic orbital plane. This rotation angle is responsible
for the seasons (and for much of the difﬁculty in computing sun paths). Although the Earth
moves around the sun, the simplest way to understand the motion of the Earth is to adopt
a Ptolemaic view – to consider the Earth as stationary and the sun as being in motion. In the
Ptolemaic view, the sun’s relation to a point on the surface of the Earth is described by the
solar altitude angle α and the solar azimuth angle as. These angles are shown in Figure 6.12.
The altitude angle is the angle between a line collinear with the sun and the horizontal plane.
The azimuth angle is the angle between a due-south line and the projection of the site-to-sun
line on the horizontal plane. The sun path for June 21 for Mississippi State University (MSU),
33.455°N latitude, is illustrated in Figure 6.13. In addition to the relation between the azimuth
and altitude angles, the solar time is shown in the ﬁgure. At MSU, June 21 has almost 14 h ofA schematic diagram depicting the motion of the Earth about the Sun, where Earth rotates at an angle of 23.45° with respect to the ecliptic orbital plane.

daylight, and at solar noon the sun is nearly vertical (α  80°). The sun rises almost 30° north of
east (as  120°) and sets almost 30° north of west (as  120°). An interesting aspect of this
sun path line is the rapidity of movement of the sun between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm. During this
time, the sun traverses a total azimuth angle of nearly 120° – almost one-half of the total
azimuth angle traverse of 240°. The motion of the sun is also symmetrical about solar noon, with
the difference between morning and afternoon being just the sign of the azimuth angle.
However, as Goswami et al. (2000) point out, the altitude and azimuth angles are not
fundamental but are functions of the location (the latitude), the time (the solar hour angle), and
the solar declination. (As an aside, longitudes and latitudes for locations, as well as an overhead
image, in the USA and many parts of the world can be found at http://www.latlong.net/.) Many
other web sites provide similar information, including Google map locations or Google Earth
images.
The solar declination δs varies between 23.45° and +23.45° and has the same numerical
value as the latitude at which the sun is directly overhead at solar noon on a given day. The solar

where n is the ordinal day, many times called, or confused with, the Julian day number (JDN).
The ordinal day is the number of the day measured sequentially from January 1 (ordinal day 1) to
December 31 (ordinal day 365 for a non-leap year or 366 for a leap year). A convenient ordinal
date table is located at http://www.atmos.anl.gov/ANLMET/OrdinalDay.txt. The Julian date
(JDN) is a count of the number of days starting January 1, 4713 BC. Strictly interpreted, the
number of the day from January 1 is the ordinal day, but in many solar engineering applications
the Julian day is taken as the ordinal day. http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/JulianDate.php is a
convenient web site for determining the Julian day and Julian date. For example, the Julian
day for June 30, 2015, is 2 457 203, and the Julian date for noon on June 30, 2015, is
2 457 203.500 000.
The solar declination as a function of the ordinal day is illustrated in Figure 6.14.
The solar hour angle hs is based on the 24 h required for the sun to move 360° around the
Earth. The motion is 15° per hour with 180°  hs  180°. The solar hour angle at solar noon
(the time when the azimuth angle is zero and the sun altitude angle is a maximum for a given
day) is deﬁned as zero, with values east of south (morning) being negative and values west of

included to ensure that a value greater/less than 90° is obtained. One way to accomplish this is to
determine the hour angle hlimit that corresponds to as  90° (the sun position due west/east).
Then, for all hour angles greater/less than ±hlimit, the azimuth angle must be greater/less than

Sun Path Development Using Mathcad
A number of web-based aids discuss all or some aspects of sun path computations. The
University of Oregon web site at http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html is conve­
nient and generates a pdf ﬁle of the sun path at a speciﬁed latitude and longitude location. The
United States Naval Observatory web site at http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO provides a wide
range of data and computations capabilities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin­
istration (NOAA) web site at www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/azel.html possesses an
online sun position calculator as well as some explanation of the approach. Additionally,
www.susdesign.com/sunangle/presents an online sun position calculator, but with no explan­
ation as to the method(s) used.
Software to compute solar positions and sun paths are also available. For example, the Florida
Solar Energy Center (Cocoa, FL) provides SUNPATH 3.2 at http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/
research/buildings/fenestration/software.htm#Software for computing sun path lines. This
web site also offers other software elements related to solar energy applications. SUNPATH
TM
is available from http://www.sunpathonline.com/csStore/and is designed for determining
lighting issues associated with ﬁlming/photography, but SUNPATH can also be used to generate
conventional sun paths. The out-of-print book by Petherbridge (1996) presents sun paths and
overlays for heat gain calculations.
With the ordinal day and the latitude known, Equations 6.23–6.29 are sufﬁcient to construct
the sun path line for corresponding day and location (latitude). Figure 6.13, the sun path line for
June 21 for MSU, was generated from these equations using the Mathcad software element, as
described next.
Figure 6.16 shows the complete Mathcad worksheet needed to compute and plot the sun path
for June 21 at MSU (Figure 6.13). Only the date and latitude need be changed to generate and
plot the sun path line for another day or location. Since the worksheet represents the kernel
needed to construct sun path lines, an examination of the procedure is warranted.
The ordinal day is used to compute the declination from Equation 6.22. The latitude is
entered, and the hour angle, hss, is speciﬁed to range from solar noon (0°) to solar midnight
(180°). Equation 6.23 is used to calculate the solar altitude angle for every hour angle for the
speciﬁed day and latitude. Equation 6.24 provides the corresponding solar azimuth angles. Logic
is provided to determine solar altitude angles greater than 90°. “hlimit” is the hour angle for
which the azimuth angle is equal to ±90° and is determined using Equation 6.25. The sun path
can then be plotted, or values of the altitude and azimuth angles printed, as a function of hour
angle. The initial computational results cover solar noon to solar midnight. However, since only

the sign of the azimuth angles differs for morning, the complete day’s sun path can be generated
simply by plotting as for the morning hours.
The solar times corresponding to the azimuth and altitude angles are then extracted for every
solar hour (hss = 0, 15, 30, . . . , 180) from the azimuth and altitude angles. The solar times are
added to the sun path plot to complete the presentation in Figure 6.13.
Although the sun path for one day is useful for that particular day, a complete understanding
of the sun’s yearly path at a given location is also needed. Figure 6.17 shows the sun path lines

and solar times for the seven days spanning the year for MSU. Figure 6.18 illustrates the
Mathcad worksheet that is used to generate the sun path for different days of the year. For this
example, the 21st of each month was chosen. Because of symmetry, the sun paths for May 21 and
July 21, April 21 and August 21, March 21 and September 21, February 21 and October 21, and
January 21 and November 21 are the same. Only June 21 and December 21 are lacking symmetry
months. On the multiday sun paths, to avoid cluttered presentations, only the afternoon
portions are presented, since symmetry provides the mornings. The seven sun path lines
representing the 21st day of each month, provide a relatively complete picture of the variations
of the sun’s path (Ptolemaic view) over the year for a given location. The variations in length of
day, in solar azimuth sunset (and sunrise) angles, and in solar altitude angle at noon are evident
on inspection of the ﬁgure. Additionally, the azimuth angles swept per hour can determined.
An examination of Figure 6.18 is appropriate. The solar declinations are computed for each of
the seven days, and the altitude and azimuth angles are generated for each solar hour angle for
each day. The same logic as used in Figure 6.16 for the single day is used in Figure 6.18 for each
day. Thus, the altitude and azimuth angles are arrays rather than vectors (in the nomenclature of
Mathcad).
Obviously, sun path lines could be presented for a wide range of latitudes. In particular, a sun
path at a higher latitude is worth examining. Consider Figure 6.19, which is for a latitude above
the Arctic Circle. Such latitudes are characterized by the phenomenon “the sun never sets”

135

during some summer months. The ﬁgure, for latitude 80°N, illustrates that the sun does not set
from April through August. Even in the summer, the maximum solar altitude angle is only
33.45°, which is relatively low on the horizon. However, if the sun never sets during some
summer months, the sun never rises during some winter months. For the latitude of 80°N the
sun barely rises (has a positive solar altitude angle) during March and September, and, as the sun
path lines indicate, the sun does not rise during October through February. All in all, Figure 6.19
portrays the sun’s path at this high latitude as skirting the horizon in the summer and sinking
below the horizon during the winter.

The National Solar Energy Database
For any quantitative considerations of solar energy applications, hourly, monthly, and yearly
information about the climate, including irradiation (the solar “insolation”) is needed. The US
Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at Golden, Colorado,
provides an astonishingly wide range of climatic and energy engineering information, much of
which is available on their web site (http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/).
The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) contains 30 years (1961–1990) of solar
radiation and supplementary meteorological data from 237 National Weather Service sites in
the USA, plus sites in Guam and Puerto Rico. Figure 6.20 shows the sites for which 1961–1990
NSRDB data are available.

The following data products are included in the 1961–1990 NSRDB on the NREL web site:
1) daily statistics ﬁles (monthly averages of daily totals);
2) hourly data ﬁles;
3) Solar Radiation Data Manual for Buildings – 30-year (1961–1990) average of solar radiation
and illuminance for each month;
4) Solar Radiation Data Manual for Flat-plate and Concentrating Collectors:
a) averages of solar radiation for each of the 360 months from 1961–1990
b) 30-year (1961–1990) average of solar radiation for each month.
Extensive use of the 1961–1990 NSRDB is made in Chapters 7–9. 
The NREL web site also contains updates and additions to the 1961–1990 NSRDB. These 
include:
1) NSRDB 1991–2010 Update The updated 1991–2010 NSRDB holds solar and meteorological
data for 1454 locations in the USA and its territories. Speciﬁc to each of these locations are
a) hourly solar data
b) statistical summaries
daily statistics ﬁles
hourly statistics ﬁles
threshold ﬁles
The web site is http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2010/.
These data are more extensive than in the original, contain more variables, address in
greater detail uncertainties, and more clearly distinguish between measured data and
modeled data. A user’s manual is available at http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54824.pdf.
2) NSRDB 2005–2012 Update The 2005–2010 NSRDB update comprises 30-minute solar and
meteorological data for approximately 1.4 million (0.038° latitude by 0.038° longitude)
surface pixels (nominally 4 km2). The area covered is bordered by longitudes 25°E on the
eastern side and 175°E on the west; and by latitudes 5°N on the south and 60°N on the
northern edge.
3) Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) Since the initial Typical Meteorological Year (TMY)
database release about 1980, the TMY ﬁles have become the accepted weather input to
virtually all building simulation programs. The original TMY was formed from data collected
between 1949 and 1980 in 229 locations in the USA. TMY2 data were based on 239 locations
using 1961–1990 data. TMY3, ﬁrst released in 2005, represents 1020 locations. The updated
TMY3 ﬁles are available on the NREL TMY3 web site at http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/
old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3.
The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements
for a 1 year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion
systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system
types, conﬁgurations, and locations in the USA and its territories. Since TMY3s represent
typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the
worst-case scenarios occurring at a location.
4) US solar radiation resource maps The NREL web site also provides a useful assessment of the
potential for solar energy in the USA. Figure 6.21 shows the average daily direct solar energy
incident on a perpendicular surface tracking the sun path for the USA. The desert southwest
consistently receives 6.5–8.5 kW h/(m2 day), while the southeast, because of cloud cover and
humidity effects, receives about 4.0 kW h/(m2 day). Much of the northeast solar energy
reception is 3.0 kW h/(m2 day) or less. Even though the southwest is the most favored region,
solar energy systems are viable in other parts of the USA. NREL provides a wide range of
maps of various solar and weather details.

The quantity of solar and meteorological data available on the NREL web site has expanded
signiﬁcantly in terms of locations available, variables presented, quality assessments, and usages.
Indeed, the era of “big data” has arrived.
In addition to NREL, NOAA collects, analyzes, and dissimilates meteorological data. NOAA is
part of the Department of Commerce. For a number of years, the National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC) was responsible for weather-related data. Recently, NOAA combined all climate-
related data acquisition activities into the National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI). The NCEI includes the Center for Weather and Climate (formerly NCDC) and the
Center for Coasts, Oceans, and Geophysics as well as NOAA Central Library.

Active Solar Thermal Applications 
7.1 Introduction 
This is the ﬁrst of three applications chapters dealing with solar energy. Although not precisely
deﬁned, solar energy applications are generally classed as active, passive, or photovoltaic –
which are the topics of interest for this chapter and Chapters 8 and 9. Active solar energy
applications are usually concerned with harvesting thermal energy through the use of solar
collectors that employ “active” mechanical components (such a pumps) to collect and transport
heat. Passive systems, typically associated with the built environment, collect and transport heat
by nonmechanical means. Photovoltaics utilize solar energy to directly produce electricity. As
the title indicates, this chapter deals with active solar thermal systems.
Solar collectors provide ubiquitous images that represent solar energy engineering. The two
most common conﬁgurations are the ﬂat-plate collector and the parabolic trough. Figure 7.1a
shows a typical ﬂat-plate collector, and Figure 7.1b illustrates a typical parabolic-trough
collector. Flat-plate collectors are widely used in residences and commercial and industrial
buildings for hot water and space conditionings (heating). The example in Figure 7.1a is
mounted at a ﬁxed angle on the south-facing roof of a residence. The parabolic-trough collector
illustrated in Figure 7.1b possesses the ability to track the altitude angle of the sun. The
parabolic-trough collector in this example focuses the sun’s rays on a single pipe and provides
higher hot-water temperatures than a ﬂat-plate collector. Parabolic-trough collectors are more
expensive than ﬂat-plate collectors and, because of the tracking mechanisms, require more
maintenance. For these reasons, parabolic-trough collectors are more frequently used by
institutional, industrial, and commercial facilities than by residences. Additional conﬁgurations
for solar collectors include Fresnel reﬂector, tubular, paraboloids, and compound parabolic.
The heliostat with a central receiver, shown in Figure 7.2, is most impressive and produces
temperatures much higher than are possible with the conventional ﬂat-plate or parabolic-
trough collector. As illustrated in the ﬁgure, heliostats have many reﬂecting mirrors, with each
mirror capable of being oriented so as to reﬂect the sun’s rays onto a central receiver. The mirror
ﬁeld surrounding the central receiver is circular, so that energy can be directed to the receiver
throughout the day. Very high temperatures are thus obtainable in the receiver.
Thermal solar collectors, except for heliostat-type systems, are based on ﬁve conﬁgurations:
1) unglazed collector
2) transpired collector
3) ﬂat-plate collector
4) evacuated-tube collector
5) concentrating collector.
Figure 7.3 presents schematics of each type with brief explanations of the energy-harvesting
principle.

Figure 7.1 Examples of ﬂat-plate and parabolic-trough solar collectors: (a) ﬂat-plate (NREL 09188); (b) parabolic
trough (NREL 14087).
The unglazed solar collector is the simplest of the thermal solar collectors since it possesses a
receiver plate (high solar absorptivity) through which water ﬂows to absorb the heat. As its name
implies, the unglazed solar collector does not have a transparent cover (glazing). The transpired
solar collector is simple, with a receiver plate to absorb solar energy and a fan that circulates air
through a plenum in the back of the receiver. The air is warmed and used for interior heating.
The ﬂat-plate solar collector is similar to the unglazed type, except that the ﬂat-plate collector
has a glazing (high solar transmissivity and low transmissivity) to retain long wavelength
thermal radiation inside the collector. The evacuated-tube solar collector uses an evacuated
cylinder (high solar absorptivity) to absorb solar irradiation. Water ﬂows through a copper tube
inside the cylinder and absorbs thermal energy. The last of the thermal solar collector types is
the concentrating solar collector. In a concentrating collector, trough or parabolic shaped, solar
irradiation is incident on the surface (low solar absorptivity and high solar reﬂectivity) and is
reﬂected to a receiver where it is absorbed. Concentrating solar collectors provide higher
temperatures than the other types. An examination of typical uses for each type of thermal solar
collector is appropriate.Photograph depicting an aerial view of Heliostat.

Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Figure 7.4 provides a useful delineation of temperature ranges and applications for each of the
ﬁve types of thermal solar collectors. Unglazed and transpired air devices are used for
temperature applications less than 100 °F – typically pool heating and space heating. Flat-
plate collectors are suitable for space heating, hot water heating, and pool heating and are
limited to temperatures not much in excess of 150 °F. Evacuated tube and concentrating solar
collectors can be used for all ﬁve applications. Evacuated tube device working temperatures can
reach 400 °F. Concentrating solar collectors can reach high temperatures depending on the
concentration factor (see Section 7.5). The focus of this chapter will be on ﬂat-plate collectors,
since they are arguably the most frequently used solar thermal collector.
Solar thermal collectors can be either tracking or nontracking. Tracking collectors, as their
name implies, track the diurnal motion of the sun (discussed in Chapter 6) about single— or
dual-axis systems. The azimuth and altitude angles of nontracking collectors are ﬁxed, and a
common arrangement is a zero azimuth angle and an altitude angle set equal to the latitude of
the collector location. Figure 7.5 illustrates arrangements for nontracking, one-axis tracking,
and two-axis tracking ﬂat-plate collectors. Figure 7.6 shows the arrangement for tracking
parabolic-trough collectors.
Generally, ﬂat-plate thermal solar collectors are used to heat water for domestic and/or for
space heating purposes. A simple ﬂat-plate solar collector system is schematically illustrated in
Figure 7.7. The system consists of two ﬂow loops: one from the solar collector to the storage
system and one from the storage system to the load. Water circulated through the collector
system is heated by the collector and stored in a storage tank. Hot water for the load is drawn
from the storage tank and returned at reduced temperature to the storage tank. The auxiliary
heater is used when the solar system is providing insufﬁcient hot water for the load. But, the
system’s primary component is the solar collector. Section 7.2 develops and examines the
fundamental principles of operation of a ﬂat-plate solar collector.

7.2 Flat-Plate Collector Fundamentals 
A cut-away view of a ﬂat-plate solar collector is presented in Figure 7.8. The collector
components are contained in an enclosure that provides structural support and protection.
Glazings are transparent cover sheets (typically made of glass with high solar transmissivities)
that provide protection and pass most of the solar irradiation. The absorber plate is made of a
material that has a high solar absorptivity and a low emissivity. Water ﬂowing through the tubes
is heated by energy from the absorber plate. To minimize heat loss, the collector bottom, which
is in contact with the absorber plated, is insulated.
The energy ﬂow for a ﬂat-plate collector is delineated in Figure 7.9. The useful energy quseful
available is
(7.1)
qabs  qloss  quseful
where qabs is the solar irradiation absorbed by the collector and qloss are the conduction and
radiation losses from the collector to the environment. The irradiation absorbed by the absorber
plate (α, absorptivity) must ﬁrst pass through the glass cover plates (τ, transmissivity) so that

where Ac is the collector surface area and IT is the irradiation intensity. The losses due to
conduction and radiation, expressed in terms of an overall conductance UL, and temperature
difference Tave−Ta can be expressed as
qlosses  AcULTave  Ta
(7.3)
where Tave is the average temperature of the collector and Ta is the ambient temperature.
The useful energy then becomes
 Ta  _
(7.4)
quseful  AcITτα  ULT ave
mcpT out  Tin
which must also be equal to the change in the working ﬂuid energy. This expression provides
some interesting insight on the limiting performance of ﬂat-plate collectors. Consider the case
to minimize losses, T ave  Ta. But if Tave  Ta, the collector and the circulating ﬂuid are at the
ambient temperature, and the temperature of the working ﬂuid is so low that the energy is not
useful. As the collector temperature increases, the losses increase. The meaningful upper
limiting case is for Tave to be so high that qloss  qabs, in which case quseful  0. Energy at a high
temperature is available, but only at a very low ﬂow rate of the working ﬂuid.
The collector efﬁciency is deﬁned as the useful energy extracted divided by the total incident
irradiation, or
quseful
ηc 
(7.5)
ITAc
which, when quseful is substituted in and the expression simpliﬁed, becomes
Tave  Ta
ηc  τα  UL
(7.6)
IT
The collector efﬁciency ηc is thus a linear function of the temperature difference divided by the
irradiation IT, with a slope of UL. Table 7.1 contains typical values of τα and UL for ﬂat-plate
solar collectors (Mitchell, 1983).
The behavior of typical collectors using the values from Table 7.1 is illustrated in Figure 7.10.
This simple analysis conveys most of the important aspects of ﬂat-plate solar collector
performance and is the basis of the procedure used by solar collector manufacturers to describe
the performance of their products.

Even though the τα product decreases as the cover conﬁguration changes from unglazed to
one cover to two covers, the decreases in the UL values are even more pronounced, with the net
result that, for a given temperature difference, the efﬁciencies increase as the glazing progresses
from unglazed to two covers.
The simple analysis expressed the collector efﬁciency in terms of the average collector
temperature Tavg. A more useful expression involves Tin, the inlet ﬂuid temperature, which can
be cast as

η  FR τα  UL

IT
 FRτα  FRUL

where FR is the collector heat-removal factor. Equation 7.7 is sometimes called the Hottel–
Whillier–Bliss equation and is considered the most important equation associated with ﬂat-
plate solar collectors. This approach incorporates the heat exchange process between the
absorber plate and the collector heat exchanger. Collector data are usually represented in terms
of the intercept FRτ α and the slope FRUL. Goswamni et al. (2000) and Dufﬁe and Beckman
(2006) provide excellent discussions of the details of the heat-removal factor.
For more accurate analyses of ﬂat-plate solar collectors, an incident angle modiﬁer K τα is often
added to Equation 7.7:

7 Active Solar Thermal Applications
In the Hottel–Whillier–Bliss equation, the product τα will change with the angle of incidence of
the solar irradiation. But many ﬂat-plate collectors are ﬁxed and the angle of incidence will
change throughout the day. The incidence angle modiﬁer accounts for that variation by
expressing the value of τα as
τα  Kταταn

where τα is for irradiation normal to the collector. K τα is usually cast in the form

Consider the following example.

Figure 7.11 provides the results of a performance test for a single-glazed ﬂat-plate collector.
The transmissivity τ of the glass is 0.90, and the absorptivity α of the surface is 0.92. For the
collector, ﬁnd:
a) the collector heat-removal factor FR;
b) the overall conductance UL in Btu/(h ft2 °F);
c) the rate at which the collector can deliver useful energy when the irradiation incident on the

temperature is 60 °F;

When the ﬂow rate is zero, the “stagnation” condition that results in the maximum collector
temperature is attained. When the ﬂow rate is zero, no useful energy is removed from the
collector by the ﬂowing ﬂuid, and the steady-state temperature of the collector increases until all

Example 7.1 provides insight into the information needed for ﬂat-plate collector engineer­
ing calculations. Slope and intercept data are needed for any ﬂat-plate collector that is to be
considered, and solar insolation data, appropriate for speciﬁc collector azimuth and altitude
angles orientation, are required to assess the performance of a collector. Sources for and
examples of ﬂat-plate solar collector data and solar data are considered in Section 7.3.
7.3 Solar Collector and Weather Data 
Third-party certiﬁcation data on speciﬁc thermal solar collectors and solar hot water heating
systems are available from the Solar Rating and Certiﬁcation Corporation (SRCC). The SRCC
web site, which is well organized and user friendly, is www.solar-rating.org. The SRCC web site
provides, in PDF format, online solar collector ratings. When “CERTIFICATION & LISTING
DIRECTORY” is selected on the home page, the following list appears:
OG-100 Collector Certiﬁcations

• Transpired Collectors
• PV Water Heating Collectors

7 Active Solar Thermal Applications
When one of the three solar collector categories is selected, the ratings directory for that type
is accessed via http://www.solar-rating.org/certiﬁcation_listing_directory/index.html. The
directory contains all the ratings for a particular type, but the opening page permits selection
of speciﬁed collectors according to viewer-speciﬁed criteria, including speciﬁc manufacturers.
The “OG-300 System Certiﬁcations ” leads to an SRCC-developed solar water heating system
rating and certiﬁcation.
The SRCC also maintains an up-to-date list of names (and contact information) of companies
that participate in the SRCC certiﬁcation programs, as well as convenient summary sheets
(company name, model number, collector area, absorber coating, slope, intercept, and average
daily energy collected for standard conditions) for certiﬁed solar collectors. Some examples of
SRCC data presentations are in order.
Figure 7.12 reproduces a data sheet from the “glazed solar collector” selection. These data
were obtained in accordance with SRCC
TM Standard 100-2014-07 Minimum Standard for Solar
Thermal Collectors, which references ISO Standard 9806:2013 Solar energy – Solar thermal
collectors – Test methods. Administrative information is presented at the top of the data sheet.
The “Collector Thermal Performance Rating” section consists of performance metrics in SI and
inch–pound (IP) units for three irradiance conditions (clear, mildly cloudy, and cloudy) and ﬁve
(A–E) temperature categories. The ﬁve categories represent different uses that have one-to-one
correspondences with the inlet ﬂuid and ambient air temperature differences. Table 7.2 contains
information deﬁning categories A–E. “Collector Speciﬁcations,” “Collector Materials,” and
“Technical Information” information is delineated under these headings near the middle of the
page. Slope and intercept as well as quadratic efﬁciency equations are listed in both SI and IP
units, and incident-angle modiﬁer expressions are given. The lower part of the page is devoted to
“Pressure Drop.” Thus, sufﬁcient information is provided in the certiﬁcation-rating sheet to
make engineering calculations.
As with most energy systems components, information on ﬂat-plate solar collectors is also
available from manufacturers. For example, the Alternate EnergyTechnologies web site is accessible
forinformationontheAE-21collector.InadditiontoreferencingtheSRCCdata sheet,Figure7.13is

Solar energy engineering weather and solar irradiance database information was reviewed in
Section 6.5. In addition to data available from by NREL, various textbook authors have provided
solar data needed for performance estimates of solar energy systems. For example, Goswami
et al. (2000) presented hourly solar irradiance information useful for hour-by-hour solar
collector calculations such as in Example 7.1. Their tabulations are for the 21st day of each

For many solar engineering calculations, monthly insolation (irradiance) values for various
orientations and tracking protocols are needed. The NREL website (www.nrel.gov) provides
solar and meteorological information in a number of different data sets (discussed in Section
6.5). The original National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is the most appropriate of the
data sets for use in this textbook. The original NSRDB contains monthly solar and meteorologi­
cal information based on 30-year averages (1961–1990) for the 239 locations shown in
Figure 6.20. The original NSRDB contains the following:
Daily statistics ﬁles
Hourly data ﬁles
The Solar Radiation Data Manual for Buildings (Marion and Wilcox, 1995)
• 30-year averages (1961–1990) of solar radiation and illuminance for each month
• The Solar Radiation Data Manual for Flat-Plate and Concentrating Collectors (Marion
and Wilcox, 1994)
• averages of the monthly solar radiation and meteorological data for each of the
360 months during the period 1961–1990.
In addition the web site contains other broadband solar radiation data and resource maps in
atlas form for buildings and ﬂat-plate and concentrating solar collectors. A number of solar
computer codes, algorithms, models, and calculators are also provided and described on the web
site. The information contained on the web site, as well as references by SRCC and NREL at the
end of this chapter, are logical next resorts for engineering details and procedures beyond the
scope of this chapter.
Solar Radiation Data Manual for Flat-Plate and Concentrating Collectors (Marion and
Wilcox, 1994) provides the necessary data for the next level of solar system analyses and
performance estimates. The data for Meridian, MS, from the manual are reproduced as
Figure 7.14. An examination of the contents of this typical ﬁle is appropriate. The ﬁrst series
of entries contain location information and specify the site as primary or secondary – secondary

for the case depicted in the ﬁgure. The remaining data are divided into solar-radiation-speciﬁc
and climatic-condition-speciﬁc sections. The solar-radiation-speciﬁc data are presented as the
incident solar insolation energy per square meter per day (kW h/(m2 day)) for four solar
collector conﬁgurations. The solar collector conﬁgurations referenced in the data are as follows:
1) Flat-plate collectors facing south at a ﬁxed tilt
i) 0° tilt (horizontal)
ii) latitude 15° tilt
iii) latitude tilt
iv) latitude +15° tilt
v) 90° tilt (vertical)
2) One-axis tracking ﬂat-plate collectors with north–south axis
i) 0° tilt
ii) latitude 15° tilt
iii) latitude tilt
iv) latitude +15° tilt
3) Two-axis tracking ﬂat-plate collectors
4) Direct-beam radiation for concentrating collectors
i) One-axis, east–west horizontal axis
ii) One-axis, north–south horizontal axis
iii) One-axis, north–south tilt at latitude angle
iv) Two-axis
Monthly average insolation values for each solar collector conﬁguration are given for each
month and speciﬁed for minimum, average, and maximum irradiation conditions. For example,
for June for a ﬁxed-tilt solar collector tilted at the latitude angle, the average insolation on the
collector would be 5.6 kW h/(m2 day). The four solar collector conﬁgurations and the orienta­
tion options contained within each conﬁguration provide the insolation data needed for most
applications.
The last segment of the data presents climatic conditions on a monthly basis. The average,
daily minimum, and daily maximum temperatures are listed, as are the record lows and record
highs for each month. The heating degree days (HDD, base of 65 °F or 18.3 °C) and the cooling
degree days (CDD, base of base of 65 °F or 18.3 °C) are provided along with the average relative
humidity and the average wind speed. The HDD and CDD are indicators of the relative need for
heating and cooling respectively and will be deﬁned and used in Chapter 8 on passive solar
energy.
Example 7.2
Evaluate the performance of an Alternate Energy Technologies AE-21 solar collector on
January 21 if the collector is located at 32°N latitude and tilted at an angle of 32°. The water
inlet temperature is 58 °F. The ambient temperature varies from 25 °F at 8 am to 45 °F at
solar noon to 35 °F at 4 pm. Metrics of interest include the hourly efﬁciency, the hourly solar
energy collected, and the percentage of incident solar energy collected.
Solution
Information about the AE-21 is available from the SRCC web site and is repro­
duced as Figure 7.12. Example 7.1 evaluated the instantaneous performance of a solar collec­
tor given the ambient and water inlet temperatures and the incident solar irradiation ﬂux, and
it serves as the basis of the solution for this example. The incident solar energy on January 21
at 32°N with a collector tilt angle of 32° is available on an hourly basis from Appendix A. The
inlet water temperature is taken as constant, since no information about its variation is

158 
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
indicated. The ambient temperature is provided at 8 am, solar noon, and 4 pm. From the
ambient temperature information, estimates of the ambient temperatures at 9, 10, and 11
am as well as 1, 2, and 3 pm can be made. With hourly ambient temperature, water inlet
temperature, and solar irradiation available, the collector performance for every hour of
incident sunlight can be evaluated. The daily performance can be generated by summing
the hourly performance information. The Mathcad worksheet for the solution is repro­
duced as Figure 7.15. Information from the AE-21 SRCC data sheet is entered. Consistent
with SRCC recommendations, the solar collector area is the gross area, not the aperture
area. The hourly input solar irradiation (from Appendix A for 32° latitude and 32°
inclination from the horizontal for January 21), water inlet temperature, and ambient
temperatures are entered. The solar collector efﬁciency for each hour is calculated using
Equation 7.7. The vector symbol over the efﬁciency deﬁnition is a Mathcad operator
indicating that a computation is to be carried out for each nine deﬁned “i” values – the
range variable. The hourly energy harvested is computed utilizing the hourly value of the
collector efﬁciency. The last calculations are for the daily energy harvested (expressed in
kilowatt-hours) and the fraction of incident solar energy harvested. For the scenario
described in the problem statement, the AE-21collector will harvest 7.91 kW h during the
day, or 65% of the incident solar energy that day.
Calculations such as those presented in Example 7.2 indicate how to estimate solar
collector performance for one day; however, for many engineering applications, the
performance over a year is needed. Many simulations programs exist that can accomplish
yearly performance estimates on an hour-by-hour basis using TMY3 weather data. Dufﬁe and
Beckman (2013) provide an excellent discussion of such programs. However, a viable
alternative with accuracy acceptable for preliminary design and analysis purposes is the
f-chart method, which is covered in Section 7.4.Figure depicting Mathcad solution for Example 7.2.

7.4 The f-Chart Method 
The f-chart method is frequently used for estimating the annual thermal performance of an
active solar heating system for a building. Dufﬁe and Beckman (2013), as well as Goswami et al.
(2000), provide much more detail of the development and application of the f-chart method than
is possible here. The f-chart method is a procedure for estimating the fraction f of the total
monthly heating load (space plus domestic hot water) that can be supplied by an active solar
energy system. The procedure is based on a correlation for f as a function of two system

160 
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
parameters. The correlation was derived from the results of a large number of hour-by-hour
solar energy system simulations. The two parameters are the ratio of collector losses to heating
loads X and the ratio of absorbed solar irradiation to heating loads Y. f-charts have been
developed for three system conﬁguration: (1) space and hot water heating using water as the
medium, (2) space and hot water heating using air as the medium, and (3) process hot water.
Only the ﬁrst conﬁguration will be presented here. Figure 7.16 is a schematic of the “standard”
system conﬁguration using a liquid heat transfer medium. The system consists of a solar
collector, three heat exchangers (HX), a main storage tank, a preheat tank, the load, and ancillary
components. Energy harvested by the collector is used to heat water for the main storage tank
via the collector–storage heat exchanger. Water from the storage tank is used in the load heat
exchanger to provide heated air to the house. Potable water is preheated before entering the
service hot-water tank. Auxiliary systems are provided for both the house load and the service
hot-water tank in case the solar system is unable to meet the required loads.
Detailed simulations of the system illustrated in Figure 7.16 were used to develop the
correlation between the two dimensionless variables (X and Y) and f, the monthly fraction
of the load carried by solar energy. The ﬁrst of the two dimensionless parameters is deﬁned as

Example 7.3
An ofﬁce building in Meridian, MS, is to employ Alternate Energy Technologies AE-21 ﬂat-
plate solar collectors for space and hot water heating. The collectors will be mounted facing
south. The estimated monthly load is provided in the Table 7.3.
The solar energy system is to provide all the hot water heating requirements for the
summer months and a yearly solar heating fraction of 60%.
a) How many AE-21 solar collectors are needed to meet the speciﬁcations?
b) If natural gas cost $10 per 106 Btu, how much would be saved by the installation of such a
solar energy system?
Solution
The solution is accomplished in Mathcad. The solution worksheet is contained in
Figure 7.19. For ease of use, MJ is deﬁned as megajoules, and the days of the month are
entered for use in calculating the f-chart parameters X and Y. The average daily irradiation
for each month and the average temperature for each month are obtained from the weather
data for Meridian, MS. Because the solar heating requirement is much larger in the winter
months, latitude+15° was selected as the tilt angle to increase the winter solar energy

gov. The slope and intercept information for the AE-21 solar collector were taken from
the SRCC data sheet that is reproduced as Figure 7.12. Determining the number of AE-21
collectors needed is an iterative process. The required number of collectors is guessed
and the analysis completed to ascertain performance of the guessed number of collectors.

Figure 7.19 Mathcad solution for Example 7.3.
When the required performance is achieved, the iterative procedure has attained conver­
gence. The parameters, X and Y, are computed for each month, and the value of the solar
fraction fall for each month is obtained from the f-chart correlation, expressed as
Equation 7.13. Both X and Y must be positive, so in the calculation of X the value of the
slope of the collector performance curve is taken as positive. Since the required solar
fraction for a given month cannot exceed unity, the value of the solar fraction fall for
months that exceed unity is set to unity by the piecewise continuous “if” statement.

164 
Alternative Energy Systems and ApplicationsFigure depicting the Mathcad solution for Example 7.3.
Figure 7.19 (Continued )
Values of X, Y, fall, and f (the solar fraction) are tabulated in the worksheet. The solar
load for each month is computed. The yearly solar fraction, the total solar energy har­
vested, and the cost savings are then estimated. When the guessed number of required
collectors yields the required solar fraction (60% in the problem statement) and solar
fractions of unity during the summer, the solution procedure has converged. In this
example, 135 AE-21 collectors are needed to meet the speciﬁcations. The savings are
$4141/year.
Example 7.3 illustrates how the f-chart procedure can be used to assess the performance of
a ﬂat-plate solar collector system. The f-chart procedure is based on correlating the outputs
from a number of TRYNS systems simulations and, as such, is an approximate procedure.
However, the f-chart procedure is easy to apply and yields solutions that are much better than
just an order of magnitude. Indeed, with all the uncertainties in many ﬂat-plate solar collector

165 
7 Active Solar Thermal ApplicationsFigure depicting the Mathcad solution for Example 7.3.
Figure 7.19 (Continued )
engineering calculations, an argument can be made that the f-chart approach provides
sufﬁcient accuracy for most initial assessments of such systems.
7.5 Other Solar Thermal Systems 
As is apparent from Figures 7.1 Figures 7.1b and 7.2, solar thermal systems can contain more
than ﬂat-plate collectors. Figure 7.1b shows a parabolic trough collector, and Figure 7.2 shows a
heliostat. Both devices collect solar energy, but they also concentrate solar energy – that is, they
enable higher temperatures to be attained. Since higher output temperatures can be attained by
concentrating collectors, the usefulness of the energy collected increases and activities requiring
higher working temperatures become possible (refer to Figure 7.4). This section reviews some of
the salient features of concentrating collectors.
However, a preliminary review of the fundamentals of concentrating collectors is appropriate.
Concentration of incident radiation is achieved by directing (by reﬂection or refraction) the
radiation on an aperture area Aa to a smaller absorber or received area Ar. A geometric
concentration factor CR is deﬁned as the ratio of the aperture to receiver area:
Aa
CR 
(7.15)
Ar
The energy delivered to the receiver is the incident solar ﬂux Ic at the aperture times the product
of the aperture area and the optical efﬁciency of the aperture to receiver process ηar:

For concentrating collectors, CR > 1. The loss term in Equation 7.20 is thus smaller for
concentrating collectors than for ﬂat-plate collectors (CR∼1), and as a result the efﬁciency for
concentrating collectors is higher. For further details see Goswami et al. (2000), who present a
particularly lucid evaluation of concentrating solar collectors.
Technical and engineering information for ﬂat-plate solar collectors can be obtained from
manufacturers’ web sites and from the SRCC. Such information for concentrating solar
collectors and heliostats is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Most web sites for companies manufacturing
concentrating solar collectors contain little technical information.
One interesting question in relation to concentrating collectors is the limit of the receiver
temperature. Very high temperatures can be obtained in concentrating collectors such as
heliostats (Figure 7.2). The ultimate limit of the receiver temperature is limited by the second
law of thermodynamics to be less than the effective temperature of the sun. Indeed, Goswami
et al. (2000) point out that this conclusion is equivalent to the Clausius statement of the
second law.
7.6 Closure 
Solar thermal systems have become increasingly popular as the cost of energy continues to
rise. The Energy Information Administration monitors the sale of solar collectors.
Figure 7.20 presents data on the yearly installed square footage (in millions of square
feet) of solar collections from 1975 through 2009 (except for 1985, when no data were
collected). Although ﬂat through the last years of the decade of the 1990s, solar collector
sales after the millennium dramatically increased during the ﬁrst part of the decade, but then
decreased signiﬁcantly in the remaining years of the decade. This behavior tracks the
relatively constant energy prices (e.g., see Figure 1.14) of the 1990s and the escalating energy
prices during the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century. The decreases of the last years of
the decade likely represents some loss of luster by solar thermal systems in favor of other
renewable energy sources.
The Solar Energy Industries Association, SEIA (www.seia.org) provides an alphabetical listing
of manufacturers of solar energy-related items, including solar thermal collectors. The SEIA
web site is a good source of addresses and contact information, listing companies manufacturing
solar collectors of all types.

Passive Solar Energy
8.1
Fundamental Concepts of Passive Solar Energy
Passive solar energy is generally deﬁned to include systems in which the ﬂow of solar energy is by
passive (or natural) processes such as natural (free) convection. Passive solar concepts have been
known and practiced since ancient times. The following statements are attributed to Socrates
(∼400 BC) and Aristotle (∼350 BC) respectively:
In houses with south aspect, the sun’s rays penetrate into the porticos in winter, but in
summer the path of the sun is right over our heads and above the roofs so that there is
shade.
For well being and health . . . the homestead should be airy in summer and sunny in
winter. A homestead promising these quantities would be longer than it is deep and the
main front would face south.
In the modern vernacular of modern passive solar practices, these statements mean that a
home should be oriented east-to-west with signiﬁcant southern exposure with overhang such
that in the winter sunlight is incident on the southern exposure but in the summer sunlight is
blocked.
However, even a ﬁrst-order examination of passive solar concepts requires a more formal
examination of fundamental principles. The book Passive Solar Buildings by Balcomb (1992) is
regarded as establishing the basis for modern developments in passive building technology,
while Dufﬁe and Beckman (2013) and Goswami et al. (2000) contain contemporary treatments
of passive concepts. The distinction between an active and a passive system is that a passive
system uses no mechanical intervention to distribute energy, but relies on radiation and free
convection. A passive solar system generally possesses ﬁve components:
1) collector (or aperture) arrangement
2) absorber
3) thermal mass
4) distribution protocol
5) control strategy.
Additionally, most passive solar systems also have a backup energy source for use when
passive solar features are insufﬁcient for comfort or utility.
Passive collectors consist of windows or a more exotic feature such as a water roof. An
absorber is a hard surface with a high absorptivity that is in the direct path of the solar irradiation
entering through the collector. The passive thermal storage mass can be provided by external or
internal walls, ﬂoors, or water walls. These thermal masses receive energy for solar irradiation in

the winter, but are blocked in the summer. The distribution protocol is the method by which the
thermal energy is stored, retrieved, and circulated to different areas of the structure. Controls
are provided to enhance distribution from the collector/absorber/thermal mass arrangement. In
many residences, passive controls include human participation in such tasks as moving panels
or opening/closing dampers, as well as passive features such as overhangs.
If a structure has south-facing glazing but no thermal storage mass, the structure is called sun-
tempered. The use of extensive south-facing glazing, up to 7% of the ﬂoor area, can markedly
reduce the heating energy requirement, especially in a cold climate. If the south-facing glazing
exceeds roughly 7%, then a thermal storage mass is needed to effectively utilize the solar
irradiation incident on the interior of the structure.
Passive solar heating conﬁgurations are categorized as direct gain, indirect gain, or isolated
gain. As the name implies, in direct-gain solar systems the solar irradiation is directly incident
on the interior of a structure. Figure 8.1a is a schematic of a direct gain system, and Figure 8.1b
illustrates a direct gain implementation in a residence. The thermal mass thickness should not
exceed 6 in, and the thermal mass should not be carpeted. Two well accepted rules of thumb, are
that 150 lb of masonry is needed for every square foot of south-facing glazing and that 9 ft2 of
thermal mass storage area is needed for every square foot of south-facing glazing.
Indirect gain systems are characterized by having the thermal mass located between the sun
and the interior space. Figure 8.2 presents a schematic and an example of an indirect passive
solar system with a Trombe wall. A Trombe wall is a thick wall, usually constructed of masonry,
designed to absorb solar irradiation during the day, store it, and radiate heat during the night or
on overcast days. A rule of thumb is that 0.2 ft2 of thermal mass wall is required for every square
foot of ﬂoor area. The recommended Trombe wall thickness is 12–18 in of concrete or 8–12 in
of adobe.
Figure 8.3 illustrates a schematic and an example of an isolated-gain solar system, a sunspace.
An isolated-gain system is separate from the main building, but thermal mass is provided for(a) A schematic diagram depicting direct-gain passive solar system, where soloar irradiation enters into the room through window. (b) Photograph depicting implementation example.

energy storage. For a masonry thermal wall the recommended thicknesses are the same as for a
Trombe wall, but 0.3 ft2 of south glazing is needed for every square foot of ﬂoor area. Ventilation
and shading are generally required during the summer months.

via their web
site http://passivesolar.
sustainablesources.com/ contains recommendations and rules of thumb for the passive solar
features presented in Figures 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 Additionally, Passive Solar Design for the Home
(NREL, 2001) lists recommendations for passive features in residences.
Another important feature often implemented in passive solar is daylighting – the use of
radiant energy from the sun for interior illumination so that the need for artiﬁcial illumination
during daylight hours is reduced. Figure 8.4 illustrates the use of daylighting for the stacks of a
library.
Passive solar features can be implemented in virtually any structure, regardless of size.
Figure 8.5a and b shows photographs of the NREL Solar Energy Research Facility (SERF) and a
residence respectively, illustrating the implementation of many passive (and some active) solar
features.
SERF is a state-of-the-art research facility completed in 1993. The facility faces 15° east of due
south and is built into the site slope to take advantage of earth sheltering. SERF incorporates a
number of energy-saving features, including, daylighting, window shades, evaporative cooling,
and heat recovery systems. Annual energy usage and costs are 30–40% lower than for a similar
building designed to meet federal standards (1990s era). SERF costs less than one-half of what a
typical research facility costs to operate. Photovoltaic arrays, which are not passive solar
elements, have been installed on the roof of the east and west wings.
Figures 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 illustrate the use of south-facing glazing to capture solar irradiation for
heating. An equally important passive solar feature, especially in warm climates, is overhang on
the south-facing walls to block out solar irradiation in the summer. The residence in Figure 8.5b
shows overhang that blocks the sun in summer (high sun altitude angles) but admits solar
irradiation in winter (low sun altitude angles).
The preceding schematics and pictures, as well as the accompanying text, establish the
fundamentals of passive solar energy but do little to quantify expected performance and energy
savings. Sections 8.2–8.4 develop a ﬁrst-order process and a second-order process to quantify
the effects of various passive solar features.

explored in Chapter 7. Perhaps the single most referenced document for passive solar energy
is the Passive Solar Design Handbook (Anderson et al., 1980; Balcomb et al., 1980; Anderson,
1984). Additional information is available from The Passive Solar Design and Construction
Handbook (Crosbie, 1997). A common set of deﬁnitions used to quantify the performance of
passive solar features is examined next.
The most common single-variable method used to express climatological effects on
building energy usage is the “degree-day.” The degree-day is built around the concept of
a no-load (balance point) temperature and an average daily temperature. The no-load
temperature is the ambient (outdoor) temperature for which no heating or cooling
energy would be required for human comfort in a building. Traditionally, the no-load
temperature has been taken to be 65 °F. Thus, heating would be required for ambient
temperatures less than 65 °F, and cooling would be required for ambient temperatures
greater than 65 °F. The average daily temperature is deﬁned as the average of the minimum
and maximum temperature for a given day. The difference between the no-load temperature
and the average temperature is deﬁned as the number of degree-days for a given day.
Hence, if the average temperature is 45 °F during a particular day, that day has 20 heating
degree-days (HDDs). If the average temperature is 85 °F, that day has 20 cooling degree-days
(CDDs). The total HDDs for a given location is the sum of the all the daily HDD, and the
total CDDs are the sum of the daily CDDs for the location. The total values are a useful
metric for estimating energy usage to heat and cool a building since the energy required is
essentially proportional to the HDD and CDD. Energy usage estimated from the HDD

documentlibrary/clim81supp3/annualheatingDD_hires.jpg
is generally more accurate than energy usage estimated from CDD since cooling degree­
days do not consider humidity effects, which can be a signiﬁcant cooling load in a humid
climate.
HDDs and CDDs are available from the National Weather Service and are archived by the
National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The Solar Radiation Data
Manual for Flat-Plate and Concentrating Collectors (Marion and Wilcox, 1994), discussed
in Chapter 7, also tabulates the HDD and the CDD values. Figure 7.14 indicates that
Meridian, MS, has 1358 Celsius HDDs (C HDD). In the NREL data from Figure 7.14, the
Celsius degree-days are referenced to a no-load temperature of 18.3 °C, which is 65 °F.
Using this basis, conversion from Celsius degree-days to Fahrenheit degree-days is simple: the
conversion factor is 5/9. Care needs to be exercised in using SI units for degree-days
since some are tabulated on the basis of 19.0 °C for which the 5/9 conversion factor is
slightly off. Additionally, many heating, ventilating, and air conditioning and solar
energy engineering textbooks provide tabulations for selected cities as well as maps
containing constant HDD and CDD contour lines. For the purposes of this textbook, a
contour map will sufﬁce. Figure 8.6 presents a contour of Fahrenheit HDDs (F HDDs) for the
USA.
The higher the HDD, the more severe is the winter. In Figure 8.6, the HDDs in the north are
much larger than in the south. The HDD values in the mountains of the west show the effects of
elevation and latitude. More detailed contour maps are available from the NCEI (www.ncei.
noaa.gov).
Figure 8.7 shows a contour map of the F CDDs for the USA. As demonstrated in Figure 8.7, the
CDDs in the north are smaller than in the south.

documentlibrary/clim81supp3/annualcoolingDD_hires.jpg.
In addition to the degree-days concept, many passive solar energy applications utilize a
common nomenclature. Consider the following terms:
Ap
vertically projected net south-facing solar glazing (ft2 or m2)
NLC
net building load coefﬁcient; the net heating load of the non-solar portion of the structure per HDD
(kJ/C HDD or Btu/F HDD)
Qnet
net heating load; Qnet  NLC  HDD (kWh or Btu)
Qsolar
heating load provided by solar energy (kWh or Btu)
Qaux
heating load not provided by solar (kWh or Btu)
LCR
load collector ratio; LCR  NLC=Ap (kJ/(m2 C HDD) or Btu/(ft2 F HDD)
SSF
solar savings fraction; the fraction of the total heating energy provided by solar, Qsolar/Qnet
The net heating energy required is the sum of the solar contribution and the auxiliary:
Qnet  Qsolar  Qaux
(8.1)
Dividing by Qnet and solving for Qsolar/Qnet, the solar savings fraction (SSF) is
Qsolar

from which the auxiliary heating energy is found as

The preceding deﬁnitions are used in the two most common procedures for quantifying the
effects of passive solar features. These two methods (Anderson et al., 1980; Balcomb et al., 1980;
Anderson, 1984; Kreith and West, 1997; Goswami et al., 2000) are the ﬁrst-level method (or
rules of thumb) and the second-level method (or LCR method). Each method’s procedures will
be examined in the following two sections.

176
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
8.3
The First-Level Method (Rules of Thumb)
The ﬁrst-level method is based on the observation that residences that effectively incorporate
passive solar features have similar NLC values per ﬂoor area and climate-dependent SSF values.
The NLC per square foot of ﬂoor area in conventional buildings with energy conserving features
are typically in the range 120–160 kJ/(C HDD m2) or 6–8 Btu/(F HDD ft2). These values
(Anderson et al., 1980; Balcomb et al., 1980; Anderson, 1984; Kreith and West, 1997; Goswami
et al., 2000) are reduced by 20% when passive solar features are added, resulting in NLC/ﬂoor
area values of 100–130 kJ/(C HDD m2) or 4.8–6.4 Btu/(F HDD ft2). If climate-dependent, cost-
based optimum passive solar features are used, the expected SSF for the US can be found in
Figure 8.8.
For well-designed passive solar features, the expected LCR values are climate dependent and
are deﬁned (Anderson et al., 1980; Balcomb et al., 1980; Anderson, 1984; Kreith and West, 1997;
Goswami et al., 2000) as follows:
Warm climate
Cold climate
LCR, kJ/(C HDD m2) [Btu/(F HDD ft2)]
610 [30]
410 [20]
When the thermal mass directly absorbs the solar irradiation, sufﬁcient thermal mass to store
613 kJ/(°C m2) or 30 Btu(°F ft2) per unit area of glazing must be available (Anderson et al., 1980;
Balcomb et al., 1980; Anderson, 1984; Kreith and West, 1997; Goswami et al., 2000). If the
storage material is heated from room air, then four times as much mass is needed. A reasonable
value of the speciﬁc heat of typical masonry material is 0.2 Btu/(lbm °F) (837 J/(kg °C)) with a
density of 150 lbm/ft3 (2400 kg/m3). Consider Example 8.1.Geographical map of USA depictting expected SSF values.
Figure 8.8 Expected SSF values (in percent). Source: Anderson (1984).

8 Passive Solar Energy
Example 8.1
A 2500 ft2 house located in Meridian, MS, has an estimated NLC/ft2 of ﬂoor area of 7.5 Btu/(F
HDD ft2). Estimate the characteristics of an effective passive solar design and the auxiliary
heating energy required. Also, estimate the thermal storage mass required.
Solution
Figure 7.11 shows that Meridian, MS, has 1358 C HDDs which converts (multiply
by 9/5) to 2444 F HDDs. A similar number could be estimated from Figure 8.6. The NLC is
thus

per Btu/°F to the product of the mass times the speciﬁc heat:

from which the mass storage requirement is found to be 94 750 lbm or about 630 ft3 with the
typical masonry density.
The results of this problem give some indication of the effectiveness of an effective use of
passive solar features, but the solution does not indicate any of the details of the solar features.
The second-level method incorporates some of the details of the solar features and is examined
next.
8.4
The Second-Level Method (the Load Collector Ratio Method)
Instead of rules of thumb, the LCR method is based on extensive computer-based analyses of
various passive solar features in a variety of sites (or climates). The LCR method is philosophi­
cally similar to the f-chart approach for active solar features discussed in Chapter 7. Ninety-four
different passive solar systems were analyzed to develop the LCR method (Anderson et al., 1980;
Balcomb et al., 1980; Anderson, 1984; Kreith and West, 1997; Goswami et al., 2000). The LCR
method is speciﬁc to a given structure, in that the NLC and projected solar area Ap are required.
From these two quantities, the LCR can be determined by the deﬁnition given earlier:
NLC
LCR 
(8.4)
Ap
Once the LCR is known, the SSF can be found for a given city by matching the LCR with speciﬁc
passive solar features.
The ﬁve different passive solar conﬁgurations considered by the LCR method are as follows:
1) direct gain (DG) 
2) vented Trombe wall (TW) 

178
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
3) unvented Trombe wall (TW) 
4) waterwall (WW) 
5) sunspace (SS). 
Within each of these conﬁguration, different values of various feature parameters are used.
These parameters include thermal storage capacity, wall thickness, number of glazings, night­
time insulation, ρck value, and sunspace details. The parameter variations for each of the ﬁve
types leads to the 94 distinct passive solar systems. For a given city, the SSF is tabulated as a
function of the LCR. Appendix B, tabulated in Goswami et al. (2000) from data in the Passive
Solar Design Handbook (Anderson et al., 1980; Balcomb et al., 1980; Anderson, 1984), is
convenient and useful with LCR method.
Appendix B starts with the common systems descriptions (e.g., masonry density) incorpo­
rated into each analysis. Variations of each of the ﬁve conﬁguration types are tabulated and
assigned a designation – such as TWA1 for the vented Trombe wall system. Tables for
Albuquerque, Boston, Madison, Medford, Nashville, and Santa Maria are provided in which
LCR values for each system variation are tabulated, and from which the SSF can be estimated.
An example is in order.
Example 8.2
A 2000 ft2 home with passive solar features is located in Nashville. A heating load analysis
determines that the NLC is 12 000 Btu/F HDD. The home has 150 ft2 of direct-gain solar
glazing. Characteristics of the direct gain features include double glazing, nighttime insulation,
and 30 Btu/(ft2 °F) thermal storage. Determine the SSF and the auxiliary heating required.
Solution
The LCR is ﬁrst calculated:
Btu
12 000
NLC
Btu
F HDD
LCR 

 80
Ap
150 ft2
F HDD ft2
The system designation is DGA3 for a direct-gain system with double glazing, nighttime
insulation, and 30 Btu/(ft2 °F) thermal storage. Entering the LCR table (Appendix B) for
Nashville with an LCR of 80 Btu/(F HDD ft2) and the system designator DGA3, an SSF of 0.2 is
estimated. The table also provides the F HDD as 3696. The auxiliary heating Qaux is calculated as
Btu
 1  0:2  12 000
 3696 F HDD  35:5  106 Btu
Qaux
F HDD
The thermal mass can also be estimated since system DGA3 has a mass area to glazing area ratio
of 6 and a thickness of 2 in. Thus:
ft
lbm
mass  volume  ρ  6  150 ft2  2 in 
 150
 22 500 lbm
12 in
ft3
The utility of the LCR method is that once a baseline structure is described, the LCR method
provides an easy procedure for ascertaining the effects of changing passive solar features within
the 94 systems in the original computational base.
8.5
Daylighting
Figure 8.4 demonstrates the effectiveness of daylighting – the use of natural lighting, not
artiﬁcial lighting (e.g., incandescent or ﬂuorescent) – to illuminate the interior of a structure.

179
8 Passive Solar Energy
An examination of the salient features of daylighting is appropriate, since signiﬁcant
energy savings are possible for properly designed and effectively integrated daylighting
implementations.
Spaces that are occupied during daylight hours have a high potential for daylighting. For a new
building, maximizing the use of daylighting will likely mean a higher skin-to-volume ratio than
for a conventional building. A standard window produces useful illumination to a depth of 1.5
times the height of the window. Using additional daylighting features, illumination penetration
to 2.0 times the window height is possible. The higher the placement of the window, the deeper
the penetration. The illumination of daylighting is composed of three components: (1) an
exterior reﬂected component, (2) a direct sun/sky component, and (3) an internal reﬂected
component. The ceiling provides the most important internal reﬂected component; ceiling
reﬂectivities above 80% are recommended. Wall reﬂectivities between 50 and 70% and ﬂoor
reﬂectivities between 20 and 40% are recommended. The proportions of a room are more
important than the dimensions for daylighting considerations.
One method of quantifying the relationship between the visible light and the size of a window
(glazing) is the effective-aperture method. The effective aperture is the product of the window­
to-wall ratio and the window transmissivity. The window-to-wall ratio is the window area
divided by the wall area where the window is located. Effective apertures in the range 0.2 to 0.3
are considered good. Consider an example.
Example 8.3
A south-facing wall has a total area of 300 ft2 and a window area of 100 ft2. If the transmissivity
of the glass is 0.7, determine the effective aperture. Comment on the appropriateness of this
conﬁguration for daylighting.
Solution
The effective aperture is calculated as
Awindow
100 ft2
effective apeture 
τwindow 
 0:7  0:233
Awall
300 ft2
Since the effective aperture, 0.233, is between 0.2 and 0.3, the conﬁguration is appropriate for
daylighting.
One way to increase the illumination level without increasing the brightness is to
utilize light shelves. A light shelf is a horizontal light-reﬂecting overhang placed above
eye level with a transom window above the light shelf. Light is reﬂected from the light shelf
into the interior of the building, and the ceiling is used to distribute the light throughout the
room.
The effectiveness of daylighting can be increased by the use of toplighting strategies.
Toplighting features include skylights, clerestory windows, roof monitors, and sawtooth roofs.
However, some of these features have problems and therefore are sparingly used. Skylights seem
a natural for daylighting, but skylights receive the maximum solar gain at solar noon, which can
lead to increased cooling loads as well as severe variations in illumination between the morning
and afternoon. Clerestory windows are vertical glazings located high on an exterior wall. North-
or south-oriented clerestory windows are very effective daylighting features, but east- or west-
oriented clerestory windows can lead to high heat gains and major variations in interior
illumination. A roof monitor is a ﬂat roof section raised above the adjacent roof line with vertical
glazing on all sides. Monitors can result in excessive glazing areas, high heat losses and gains,
and interior glare and shading problems during the day. Some older industrial buildings have
sawtooth roofs. The sloped surface is opaque, and the vertical surface is glazed. South-facing
sawtooth roofs may result in large heat gains during the summer. Thus, taking into account all

180
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
these factors, daylighting features must be carefully considered if satisfactory illumination,
without large heat gains and losses, is to result.
An important part of any daylighting implementation is control of the electrical lighting
within a daylighted area. Light-level sensors are effective in cutting off or dimming electrical
lights when illumination for daylighting features reaches the desired level.
A number of computer programs are available to model and predict daylighting illumination
levels in a speciﬁc building at a speciﬁc site.
The Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) of the National Institute of Building
Sciences presents a good description of daylighting concepts on their web site (www.wbdg.
org/resources/daylighting.php). Included in the WBDG daylighting discussion are descriptions,
applications, operation and maintenance considerations, relevant codes and standards, and
additional resources. The Energy Center of Wisconsin (http://www.seventhwave.org/) provides
examples and discussions on simple tools and calculations, physical modeling, and computer
modeling of daylighting concepts. A number of computer software elements are available for
daylighting; a list of the most common includes: Velux Daylight Visualizer (http://viz.velux.
com), Radiance (http://www.radiance-online.org/), DAYSIM (http://daysim.ning.com/), DIVA
for RHINO (http://diva4rhino.com), DIAL+ (http://www.estia.ch), Evalglare (http://www.ise.
fraunhofer.de), and 3DS Max Design (http://www.autodesk.com).
8.6
Passive Solar Simulation Software
There is a plethora of passive solar software elements and programs available to quantify
building energy usage. Many of the common energy analysis programs incorporate passive
solar features that are more accurate than the methods previewed in this chapter. Indeed,
many organizations have web-based passive solar energy software that can be executed from
the web site. But in many of the web-based passive solar programs, the assumptions and
numerical procedures are not clearly deﬁned or explained, so the user should exercise
caution.
In the ﬁrst edition, Energy-10, then marketed and maintained by the Sustainable Buildings
Industry Council, was cited as a program which incorporated many passive solar features.
Unfortunately, Energy-10 is no longer supported. A program that is downloadable is Ener­
gyPlus, described by the DOE Building Technologies Ofﬁce as a building energy simulation
program used to model energy consumption, which runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
operating systems. EnergyPlus is a professional, state-of-the-art program for modeling low-
energy designs and systems and is the only energy simulation engine provided under a
commercial-friendly open-source license. Information and technical support on EnergyPlus
are available from the following web sites: https://energyplus.net/ and http://energy.gov/eere/
buildings/about-building-energy-modeling. EnergyPlus is comprehensive (and complex) and
requires some effort to master, but it represents a path for quantifying the effects of various
options on building energy savings.
Figure 8.9, taken from the Energy-10 information, presents a graphical comparison of a
conventional building and that same building with extensive energy conservation features,
including passive solar components. As is evident from the ﬁgure, the energy consumption of
the “low-energy” case is about one-third that of the base case.
Computer programs similar in capability to EnergyPlus are necessary for engineering
endeavors involving building energy usage. Much of the passive solar information available
on the web is qualitative, not quantitative. In reality, building owners/operators and home
owners need quantiﬁed energy and cost savings information to justify passive solar
implementations.

Closure
This chapter has reviewed the fundamentals of passive solar energy. Many passive solar features
can be added with little additional cost for a new construction. Retroﬁts of passive solar features
to existing buildings may be more expensive, but are possible with careful consideration.
Additional information is available in the references and on the web. Indeed, a Google search on
the web will produce many “hits.” As with all web information, care must be exercised in
assessing the validity of the information. However, in the case of passive solar energy, the US
Department of Energy web sites provide a range of validated information.

Photovoltaic Systems
9.1
Introduction
“Photovoltaic” refers to the direct generation of electricity by solar irradiation. Dufﬁe and
Beckman (2006) and Goswami et al. (2000) are classical solar engineering textbooks that include
discussions of photovoltaic systems. Patel (2005) examines in detail wind and solar photovoltaic
systems, and the handbook by Kreith and West (1997) contains a chapter on photovoltaic
energy.Like ﬂat-plate solar collectors for thermal solar systems, discussed in Chapter 7, “solar
cells” are well-recognized icons of photovoltaic systems. As an example of a photovoltaic system,
Figure 9.1 presents a photograph of an 18 kW, ﬁxed ﬂat-plate photovoltaic array with dual-axis
tracking. The system shown in the ﬁgure was installed by the Nevada Power Company and is an
example of a very sophisticated application of photovoltaics. However, no matter how
sophisticated the photovoltaic system, the solar cell is the fundamental building block. Section
9.2 develops the fundamentals of photovoltaic cell operation.
9.2
Photovoltaic Cell Fundamentals
Atomic theory and semiconductor theory are good places to start an examination of the
operation of a photovoltaic cell. An atom is composed of a nucleus containing protons and
neutrons, with electrons in orbits about the nucleus. In an atom, the number of protons is equal
to the number of electrons, and that number is the atomic number of an element. For silicon, a
common material extensively used in photovoltaic cells, the atomic number is 14. The electrons
are positioned in orbitals or bands about the nucleus. All inner bands must be ﬁlled before any
band farther out can be partially ﬁlled. The energy of an electron is determined by its position in
one of the various bands. The number of electrons in the outermost band determines the
chemical characteristics of the element. The outermost band an electron can occupy and
maintain its association with the atom is called the valence band. In silicon, the valence band is
partially ﬁlled and contains four electrons; it must contain eight electrons to be ﬁlled.
If the valence band is ﬁlled, the element is chemically inert. If electrons in an unﬁlled valence
band are lightly bound, they may attach themselves to a neighboring atom, which gives that
atom a negative charge, resulting in the donor atom becoming a positively charged ion. The
positively and negatively charged ions form an ionic bond. If the electrons in an unﬁlled valence
band are more strongly attached, they conﬁgure themselves so that neighboring atoms can share
electrons to keep the valence bands ﬁlled. Such sharing of electrons results in a covalent bond.
Electrons in the valence band can become so energetic that they jump into a band that is far
removed from the nucleus. This remote band is called the conduction band. The difference in
the energy between an electron in the valence band and one in the conduction band is called the

band gap energy. Electrons in the conduction band require only a small amount of energy to
move away from the atom, and this is responsible for heat and electrical conduction. Band gap
energies are usually expressed in electron-volts (eV): 1 eV  1:602  1019 J. Insulators are
materials whose atoms possess full valence bands and have high band gap energies, >3 eV.
Conductors are materials whose atoms have relatively empty valence bands. Materials whose
atoms have relatively full valence bands are semiconductors with band gap energies <3 eV. Band
gap energies for some typical materials used in photovoltaic cells are presented in Table 9.1.
Silicon is an example of a semiconductor (four electrons in the valence band). Pure silicon is
called an intrinsic semiconductor, but if a small amount of impurities, usually called the dopant,
is combined with the pure silicon, an extrinsic semiconductor results. An n-type of semi­
conductor results if the dopant has more electrons in the valence band than the base material.
An n-type semiconductor seems to have an excess of electrons even though the semiconductor
is electrically neutral. A p-type semiconductor results if the dopant has fewer electrons in the
valence band than the base material. The p-type semiconductor appears to have a deﬁcit of
electrons, or an excess of “holes,” although it is electrically neutral. The reason for doping a pure

semiconductor such as silicon is that a junction formed with n-type and p-type semiconductor
material enhances the ﬂow of electrons and holes.
Consider the schematic of a photovoltaic cell in Figure 9.2. The PV cell is shown as a p-n
junction with an incident photon. An external load is connected. If the incident photon is
energetic enough to dislodge a valence electron, the electron will jump to the conduction band
and initiate a current ﬂow. For an electron to be forced from the valence band to the conduction
band, the photon must possess at least the band gap energy.

Hence, light with a wavelength of 1.12 m has sufﬁcient energy to dislodge a valence electron in
silicon.
Example 9.1 has important implications for the operation and efﬁciency of photovoltaic
devices. Photons with a wavelength greater than 1.12 m contain insufﬁcient energy to dislodge
a valence electron in silicon; hence, photons with wavelengths greater than 1.12 m will induce

no photovoltaic effect in silicon. Photons with wavelength less than 1.12 m possess more
energy than is required to dislodge a valence electron in silicon. However, a single photon can
dislodge only a single valence electron, and the difference in the band gap energy and the photon
energy is absorbed as heat by the photovoltaic device. The graphical representation Figure 9.3 is
useful in delineating the behavior of a photovoltaic device exposed to solar irradiation.
Figure 9.3 was speciﬁcally generated for silicon, but the same features would hold for any
semiconductor material (or band gap energy) speciﬁed. The solid curve represents the power
spectral density at 5760 K (the temperature that corresponds to the spectral energy distribution
of solar irradiation) normalized by its maximum value. The 1.12 m wavelength is indicated on
the ﬁgure. Wavelengths greater than 1.12 m contain insufﬁcient energy to dislodge a valence
electron, while wavelength less than 1.12 m result in excess energy. If E1.12 represents the
energy required to dislodge a silicon valence electron, then Equations 9.1 and 9.2 can be
converted to ratio form to express that portion of the energy required to dislodge a valence
electron for a wavelength lower than 1.12 m:
E1:12  E

and the excess energy term becomes
E  E1:12  E  E

 E 1 

(9.4)
Thus, the smaller the wavelength, the greater the excess energy of the photon. The generally low
efﬁciencies of photovoltaic devices are attributable to this principle and to additional conversion
inefﬁciencies associated with photon wavelengths less than those corresponding to the exact
band gap energy.
Table 9.2 contains theoretical and measured efﬁciencies for common photovoltaic cell
materials. The theoretical efﬁciencies are the generally accepted values (http://www
.solarserver.com/knowledge/basic-knowledge/photovoltaics.html) while the measured values
were obtained from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) – as reproduced as
Figure 9.4 – and represent laboratory values, not production values. As they are the results
of active and aggressive research programs, the measured efﬁciencies of some materials in the
table are subject to change. NREL, for example, sponsored the Thin Film Partnership Program

reductions in manufacturing costs with a concurrent 25-fold increase in installed megawatts of

A summary of long-term gains in photovoltaic cell efﬁciencies was generated by NREL in 2015
and is reproduced as Figure 9.4. The ﬁgure presents general trends of efﬁciencies of various
photovoltaic cells (and the research entities involved). Except for multijunction devices, the
general trend is a slow, but steady increase in cell efﬁciencies with time. One strategy used to
overcome the relatively low conversion efﬁciencies of solar cells is to provide more than a single
junction; that is, to fabricate two or more junctions, one above the other. Over the last decade,
these multijunction photovoltaic cells have shown impressive increases in conversion efﬁcien­
cies. Indeed, the 2015 maximum photovoltaic value is 46% for a four-junction concentrator
device. However, while multijunction devices exhibit impressive efﬁciencies, manufacturing
costs are high.Figure depicting history of photovoltaic cell efficiencies.

Although the detailed physics of a photovoltaic cell are quite complex, simple models are
available. Consider, as in Figure 9.5, the current density ﬂow at a p–n junction of a photovoltaic
cell. The current density is the current I divided by the surface area A, and is denoted as J.
At the p–n junction, a junction current density Jj is generated. The junction current density is
the algebraic sum of the current density from the p-side to the n-side (the dark current or
reverse saturation current) Jo, and the current density from the n-side to the p-side (the light-
induced recombination current) Jr. In an illuminated photovoltaic cell, the light-induced

By using Equation 9.10 and a speciﬁed value of Voc, the current density versus voltage

variations of JL/Js and the normalized power as a function of the voltage. The power is
normalized with the maximum power to the load, which occurs at V∼0:5 V. The general
functional form of both the current density ratio and the power ratio are similar for most
photovoltaic cells. The load current density decreases slowly as the voltage increases from zero,
but as Voc is approached, the current density rapidly decreases to zero at the open-circuit
condition. At the short-circuit condition, the power delivered to the load is zero, and the power
delivered to the load is also zero at the open-circuit condition. Between these two extremes, the
power reaches a maximum value, usually relatively close to the open-circuit voltage. The voltage
and current at maximum power are shown in Figure 9.7 as Vmp and Imp respectively.
Not surprisingly, the higher the solar irradiation, the higher the power output of a photo­
voltaic cell. Consider as in Figure 9.8 the effect of irradiation on the performance of a solar cell.A graphical representation where current density and power ratios is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–1.2 and load voltage (volts) on the x-axis on a scale of 0–0.7.

As the solar irradiation increases, the open-circuit voltage increases slightly, but the load current
is almost directly proportional to the solar irradiation. The maximum power to the load is also
almost directly proportional to the solar irradiation incident on the cell.
With the fundamental physics of photovoltaic cells discussed, an examination of actual
components and systems is needed, and will be covered in Section 9.3.
9.3
Photovoltaic Components
No matter what kind of photovoltaic systems are examined, the most fundamental element is
the individual photovoltaic cell. Individual cells are assimilated into modules; modules are
assembled into arrays, which are integrated into systems with a wide range of components.

on all photovoltaic systems components.Figure schematically illustrating the sequence of cell, module, and array.

The basic building block is the individual solar cell. Although the internet contains signiﬁcant
information on individual photovoltaic cells, much of the information is qualitative, not
quantitative, and does not provide the full speciﬁcations of a given photovoltaic cell. The
web site for PhotoWatt International (http://www.photowatt.com/en/products/cellules), a
French company, is one that does contain technical speciﬁcations of PhotoWatt photovoltaic
cells. Figure 9.10 reproduces some of the technical details for the PhotoWatt photovoltaic cell
6MB. The ﬁrst portion of the ﬁgure reproduces a visual image of the cell as well as presenting
information on the size and materials used and some construction details. The table in the
middle segment of the ﬁgure delineates the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, efﬁ­
ciency, and ﬁll factor (FF) for a sampling of 6MB cells. The FF is deﬁned as the ratio of the
maximum power VmpImp from the solar cell to the product of Voc and Isc:
V mpImp
FF  V ocIsc
The general irradiation level used for photovoltaic cell testing is 1000 W/m2. The open-circuit
voltage is ∼0.62 V, and the short-circuit current is ∼8.7 A. An examination of the numbers
conﬁrms that if appreciable power and voltage are to be attained, then more than a single cell
will be needed. Modules are devised by placing photovoltaic cells in series and parallel
arrangements.
Series and parallel conﬁgurations of solar cells follow the same rules as series and parallel DC
circuits. For identical components placed in a series arrangement, the voltages add at constant
current, and for identical components placed in parallel, the currents add at constant voltage.
Consider the graphical visualization of placing two identical cells in series and then in parallel in
Figure 9.11. For cells in series, Figure 9.11a, the voltages add at constant values of the current;
hence, placing cells in series results in increasing the voltage. Cells in parallel, Figure 9.11b,
result in increasing the current. Consider Example 9.2.

Example 9.2 illustrates how individual solar cells can be arranged to provide speciﬁed voltage
and power. Such an arrangement is called a module and is the typical product marketed by many
photovoltaic manufacturers. Photovoltaic cells are arranged as described to provide certain
speciﬁcations. However, in order to ensure proper module operation under realistic conditions,
such as failure of an individual cell or shading of a portion of a module, in-series elements in
arrays are usually provided with blocking diodes to prevent reverse current ﬂow and other
inefﬁciencies.
BP Solar was an important international manufacturer of photovoltaic cells and components
until they closed in December 2011. Information on the BP 3160 photovoltaic module is
provided in Figure 9.13 and is typical of what is on the market. BP Solar modules are still
available from the internet.
The BP 3160 measures 62.8 in by 31.1 in by 1.97 in deep and weights 33.1 lb. The price of the
BP 3160 was $719 in 2008 (www.solarhome.org). The price (summer 2015) for 1 kW of BP 3160

modules would be about $5000. A visual image of the module appears in Figure 9.13 next to the
I–V curve. The I–V information is parameterized by temperature but conforms to the expected
shape. Additional performance details of the module are in the accompanying table. All of
Figure 9.13 was abstracted from the BP Solar web site prior to their closing.
The I–V curve and the tabular information are similar to that associated with an individual
photovoltaic cell, which is not surprising since series and parallel arrangements of individual
solar cells retain the same functional forms. The solar irradiation level corresponding to the
performance data for the BP E3160 was 1000 W/m2. Temperature coefﬁcients α, β, and γ are
provided for current, voltage, and power respectively. These permit the effects on module

Estimate the annual kilowatt-hour production of one BP E160 module in Meridian, MS.
Examine two cases: (1) constant tilt at the latitude angle and (2) two-axis tracking.
Solution
The solution is accomplished in Mathcad. The Mathcad worksheet is reproduced
as Figure 9.14. The days in each month are deﬁned. The Solar Radiation Data Manual for
Flat-Plate and Concentrating Collectors (Marion and Wilcox, 1994) provides the necessary
solar data for the performance estimates. The data for Meridian, MS, from the manual are
reproduced as Figure 7.12. For part 1 of the problem, the average monthly data for a surface
tilted at the latitude angle is used for the solar irradiation incident on the module and is
entered in the vector IF. For part 2, the average monthly data for a surface with two-axis
tracking (as in Figure 7.3) is used for the solar irradiation incident on the module and is
entered in the vector IT. The irradiation is given in the units of kilowatt-hours per square
meter per day. The nominal power from the module is 160 W at an irradiation of 1000 W/m2.
The electrical generation per day for part 1 is computed as
160 W

IF
(9.15)
1000 W=m2
This expression asserts that the electrical generation is directly proportional to the irradiation
level. This assertion introduces some error in the calculations, but considering the uncertainties
in the input values the error is acceptable. The monthly electricity produced Et is found by
multiplying the daily production by the number of days per month. The yearly total EtotF is
obtained by adding the monthly values. The same procedure is followed for part 2, except that
the average monthly data for a surface with two-axis tracking IT is used. The yearly electricity
produced by the BP 3160 module tilted at the latitude angle is 286 kWh, while the module with
two-axis tracking produces 368 kWh. For the BP 3160 module placed at Meridian, MS, two-axis
tracking signiﬁcantly increase electricity production. The monthly generation is plotted in
Figure 9.15 for both parts of the problem.

Photovoltaic Systems
Photovoltaic systems come in a wide range of sizes and functions. The two principal
classiﬁcations of photovoltaic systems are stand-alone and grid connected (or utility inter­
active). Stand-alone photovoltaic systems are not connected to the electric grid. Functional uses
in an increasing hierarchy of complexity of photovoltaic systems are as follows:
1) direct coupled
2) systems with battery storage
3) systems with backup (generator) power

Figure 9.17 Direct-coupled photovoltaic system schematics: (a) DC load; (b) AC load.
4) hybrid power systems
5) systems connected to the electrical grid
6) systems for utility power production.
The ﬁrst four in this list are generally stand-alone systems. The Florida Solar Energy Center
(FSEC) presents schematics and some discussion on a variety of photovoltaic systems. Some
of the schematics in this section are adaptations and modiﬁcations of the system schematics
from the FSEC. The website is http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/
types_of_pv.htm.
A direct-coupled photovoltaic system supplies DC power directly to the load or AC power, via
an inverter, directly to the load. The schematics of direct-coupled systems (DC or AC) are
presented in Figure 9.17. Such systems are frequently used for speciﬁc, usually low-kilowatt
requirements – applications for which grid electricity is not available. With no grid connection,
backup generation, or storage capability, stand-alone systems are completely dependent on
solar irradiation for power generation and operation. Nonetheless, these are important “niche”
applications for photovoltaics.
One of the disadvantages of direct-coupled photovoltaic systems is their inability to operate
except when exposed to solar irradiation. A photovoltaic system with battery storage eliminates
this disadvantage and permits operation during the night hours or when the solar irradiation is
insufﬁcient to meet the required electrical demand. Figure 9.18 schematically illustrates a
photovoltaic system with battery storage. The charge controller, a key component, directs the

output of the photovoltaic array to the load and to battery recharging when electricity is being
generated; when the array is not generating, it extracts electrical energy from the battery for the
load. It also provides the capability to direct battery power to an inverter for AC loads.
Conventional AC devices can be powered by a system with an inverter. In 2015, the installed cost
of a nominal 5 kW, non-grid-connected system with battery backup (nominally 20 kWh) was
about $35 000, depending on options exercised. Federal and state tax credits as well as utility
rebates, depending on the location, can be used to offset installation costs for such systems. The
internet contains a number of web sites offering a wide range of solar photovoltaic systems.
Battery characteristics and requirements for photovoltaic system applications are important
and merit review. Typical battery metrics include the voltage, the charge capacity, the cycle
capability, and the depth of discharge. The ﬁrst two metrics, voltage and charge capacity, are
used to specify the energy storage/retrieval potential of the battery. The voltage across the
battery terminals is speciﬁed in volts, and the charge capacity of a battery is rated in the units of
amp-hours. The product of the voltage and charge capacity yields the energy stored in the
battery. For example, a 12 V battery with a charge capacity of 50 A h stores 600 V A h 
600 Wh  0:6 kWh of energy.
Cycle capability refers to the number of charge/discharge cycles expected from the battery.
The depth of discharge speciﬁes how much (what percentage) of the stored energy at full
capacity may be extracted without damaging the battery. Batteries for photovoltaic application
require high cycle capacity as well as high depth of discharge capability. Automotive batteries
require a large amount of power draw over a short period of time (engine cranking time) with
a low depth of discharge. Thus, automotive batteries are not suitable for solar storage
applications.
An example of a deep cycle set is the East Penn’s MK Solar® 8G8D battery (www
.eastpennmanufacturing.com, http://www.mkbattery.com/images/8G8D.pdf). Table 9.3 lists
the depth of discharge versus the number of expected cycles for a Solar 8G8D battery. Each
Solar 8G8D battery provides nominally 188–265 A h and weighs 166 lb. Thus, a six-cell pack
capacity would be 1128–1590 A h, depending on the discharge rate. Prices (summer 2015) per
battery vary from $500 to $700 on various websites or $3000 to $4200 for the stated capacity for
six. Hence, the storage energy in a battery is relatively expensive as the set stores 1128–1590 A h
for $3000–$4200.
As Table 9.3 indicates, depth of discharge signiﬁcantly affects battery life. Most solar
photovoltaic systems require long life from batteries.
Example 9.4
How many Solar 8G8D batteries would be needed to store and retrieve 10 kWh per day for 4

Six battery pack sets of six batteries each would meet the requirement if the depth of discharge
were increased to slightly more than 50%. An alternative solution would be to purchase 12 six-
packs with the expectation of replacing them half as frequently. Table 9.3 shows that decreasing
the depth of discharge from 50% to 25% results in slightly more than double the discharge cycles.
The long-term costs of either option will be approximately the same.
Lazard, a ﬁnancial advisory and asset management ﬁrm, in November 2015 released the
results of a study to quantify the cost of storing and retrieving electricity (Lazard, 2015). The
study showed wide variations in costs depending on the storage technology and usage,
transmission system or photovoltaic system, for example. For photovoltaic systems, the cost
estimates ranged from about $0.13/kWh to over $1.00/kWh, depending on the study parame­
ters, technology, and assumptions. The variations in cost per kilowatt-hour are large for
photovoltaic systems, but on a comparative basis the photovoltaic system costs are approaching
the cost per kilowatt-hour of other storage technologies; pumped hydroelectric’s low estimate
was about $0.10/kWh. The results of the Lazard study are congruent with other cost estimates
for storage and retrieval of electricity. Since the storage/retrieval cost per kilowatt-hour can be
more than a grid kilowatt-hour would cost, photovoltaic systems with battery backup require a
detailed economic analysis in order to establish economic feasibility.
A photovoltaic hybrid system results if a stand-alone system with battery storage is provided
with a non-grid source of electricity (typically a generator driven by a prime mover). A schematic
of a hybrid system is provided in Figure 9.19. The system schematic for a hybrid system is similar
to a stand-alone system with battery storage with the addition of a non-grid source of electricity
and a rectiﬁer. The rectiﬁer is used to convert AC from an AC generator to DC for battery
charging. When photovoltaic output and/or the battery are insufﬁcient to meet the loads

(AC and DC), the “other” source of electricity is then used to make up the difference. Such a
system provides great ﬂexibility, but for grid-connected systems the utility rate structure can be
economically constraining. If large tariffs or penalties are exacted when grid power is used, the
cost per kilowatt-hour of grid power can be excessive.
Photovoltaic systems can be used to supply electricity to the grid. A grid-connected
photovoltaic system schematic is illustrated in Figure 9.20. In any photovoltaic system
connected to the grid, the power from the solar arrays must be compatible with the voltage,
frequency, and phase of the grid. IEEE Standard 1547 (Interconnecting Distributed Resources
with Electric Power Systems) delineates the requirements for grid connectivity of photovoltaic
systems. In 2015, the installed cost of a nominal 5 kW, grid-connected system was about
$20 000, depending on options exercised. Federal and state tax credits as well as utility rebates
may also apply. The internet is a good source of information and costs for a wide range of solar
photovoltaic systems.
One issue with grid-connected systems is the price per kilowatt-hour paid by the utility to the
system owner. Photovoltaic systems with high installed kilowatts may be owned by utilities,
but low-kilowatt residential and commercial systems are likely to be privately owned.
PURPA, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, delineates the federal regulatory
requirements for most public utilities. Because of the complexity of PURPA, the US Department
of Energy provides a web site (http://energy.gov/oe/services/electricity-policy-coordination­
and-implementation/other-regulatory-efforts/public) with details and explanations of many
PURPA features. Under PURPA a utility must purchase any kilowatt-hour offered by the owner
of a photovoltaic system, but the utility is mandated to only pay its levelized cost of producing
1 kWh. In many instances the levelized cost is only 2–3¢/kW h. A much more advantageous
arrangement for the seller is “net metering.” In net metering, power drawn from the grid results
in an increase in kilowatt-hour consumption, while power supplied to the grid results in a
decrease in kilowatt-hour usage. The result is that the utility pays the same for a purchased
kilowatt-hour as for a sold kilowatt-hour, a much better arrangement for a photovoltaic system
owner than receiving the levelized cost for the purchase price of a kilowatt-hour. Since
photovoltaic generating is considered as green power, many utilities are willing to participate
in a net metering arrangement. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires utilities to consider net
metering as well as other retail/wholesale, sale/purchase procedures; however, it does not
require a utility to implement net metering, only to consider it. A formal agreement with the
utility is needed by any owner contemplating selling power to the utility.

Growth in Photovoltaic Capacity
Concerns over energy costs and environmental issues (greenhouse gas emissions and climate
change) have made photovoltaic systems increasingly popular. As part of the Department of
Energy’s SunShot initiative, NREL monitors, analyzes, and reports statistics and costs relating to
installed photovoltaic systems. Results through 2013, and projections through 2016, are
reported by Feldman et al. (2014). Figure 9.21 presents the total installed peak kilowatt capacity
for photovoltaic cells and the annual gigawatt-hour (1 × 106 kWh) generation from photovoltaic
systems in the USA from 2000 through 2013. After being ﬂat through the last years of the decade
of the 1990s, photovoltaic system installed capacity after the millennium dramatically increased.
From 1985 through 2000 (see Figure 1.14), the inﬂation-adjusted price per kilowatt-hour of
residential electricity gradually decreased, but after 2000 the price gradually increased, provid­
ing more economic incentive for solar photovoltaic. Another reason is the dramatic decrease in
the price per watt of installed photovoltaic. Figure 9.22 portrays the installed cost per watt ofA graphical representation where installed system price and global module price index (2013$/WDC) is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–14 and years on the x-axis on a scale of 1998–2013.

1998 until 2013. Also reported in the ﬁgure is the average module selling price per watt, the
global module price index. Since 2001, the cost per watt has monotonically decreased (except for
2007), but since 2009 the decrease in cost has been more pronounced. Overall, the decrease has
been quite dramatic from 2002 until 2013: about 50%! This cost decrease has made photovoltaic
systems more attractive economically. The global module price index has fallen from about
$4/W in 2007 to about $1/W in 2013 – a decrease of 75%! An interesting factoid is that while the
installed price of residential photovoltaic systems in the USA was $3.29/W in 2013, the installed
price in Germany was $2.05/W. Utility-scale projects (>100 kW) costs are more complex,
depending on arrangement (ﬁxed tilt, tracking, concentrating) as well as photovoltaic cell type
(thin ﬁlm, crystalline), but have exhibited installation cost decreases of about 50% since 2007 –
see page 14 of Feldman et al. (2014).
Figure 9.23, from the 2013 Renewable Energy Data Book (Esterly and Gelman, 2014), contains
a breakdown, worldwide, of companies manufacturing photovoltaic cells. The ﬁgure provides an
interesting contrast to Figure 4.30 that shows the production percentages by manufacturer for
wind power in the USA. Whereas, at least in the USA, more than 70% of the wind turbines are
supplied by GE, Siemens, and Vestas, for photovoltaic modules no individual company
worldwide has more than a 7% share of the market. More than 60% of the worldwide market
is supplied by companies with less than a 2% market share each. An interpretation is that
signiﬁcant consolation has already taken place in the wind power sector, but the photovoltaic
manufacturing sector has experienced little consolation. In recent years, BP Solar has exited the
solar photovoltaic arena to concentrate on other sectors. Two additional interesting metrics
from Esterly and Gelman (2014) are (1) in 2013, China installed, at 25 610 MW, 64% of the
capacity in the world and (2) 65% of the photovoltaic cells manufactured worldwide are
multiple-junction silicon.
9.6
Closure
Although solar photovoltaics in the USA have not experienced the growth of wind energy,
decreasing cost of solar photovoltaic systems is likely to impact the installation of such systems.
As Figure 9.22 attests, costs for residential, commercial, and utility-scale photovoltaic systems
have dramatically decreased in the last few years. These cost decreases have made solar
photovoltaic more attractive economically, so that additional growth is anticipated.

Fuel Cells
10.1
Introduction
In a conventional “ﬁred” combustion system, a fuel (usually a hydrocarbon) reacts with an
oxidizer (typically the oxygen in the air) to release the chemical energy stored in the fuel as heat.
In a fuel cell, the chemical energy stored in the fuel is converted directly to useful work,
electricity, without going through the process of combustion. For both combustion systems and
fuel cells, the chemical equation describing the reaction is
Fuel  Oxidizer ! Products  Chemical energy
(10.1)
If the thermodynamic states of the fuel, oxidizer, and products are the same for both cases, then
the heat released from combustion process and the work from the fuel cell’s electrochemical
reaction must be equal.
A fuel cell is not a heat engine, so the Carnot bound on efﬁciency does not apply. One of the
reasons why fuel cells are of interest is that their efﬁciencies are higher than efﬁciencies of heat
engines.
10.2
Fuel Cell Fundamentals
Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that both produce direct current (DC) via an electrochemical
process in the absence of direct combustion of a fuel source. However, a battery can deliver
power only from stored energy (a ﬁnite amount), but a fuel cell can operate as long as proper fuel
and oxidizer sources are available. A fuel cell consists of an anode, an electrolyte, and a cathode.
Weston (1992) presents a useful discussion of fuel cell components and thermodynamics.
Figure 10.1 is a schematic of a typical hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell with a load. At the anode, a
catalytic reaction splits the fuel into ions and electrons, and the ions pass from the anode,
through an electrolyte, to the cathode.
The electrons pass through an external circuit to the load. At the anode, the hydrogen (H2)
dissociates into two hydrogen ions (2H+) and two electrons (2e). The hydrogen ions pass
through the electrolyte to the cathode where they combine with oxygen and the two electrons
that have traversed the load to form water.
The fuel and the electrolyte determine the reactions at the anode and the cathode as well as
the voltage produced by a single anode–cathode pair. Catalysts are generally needed at the
anode and cathode to increase the reaction rates to acceptable levels. The catalysts required by
some fuel cell types are precious metals, which increase the cost per kilowatt for a fuel cell.
Section 10.3 examines the reactions produced by different electrolytes. Although a number of
fuel–oxidant–electrolytes are available, the hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell is the most common.

Alternative Energy Systems and ApplicationsA schematic diagram depicting a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell with a load. At the anode, a catalytic reaction splits the fuel into ions and electrons, and the ions pass from the anode, through an electrolyte, to the cathode. The electrons pass through an external circuit to the load. At the anode, the hydrogen (H2) dissociates into two hydrogen ions (2H+) and two electrons (2e- ). The hydrogen ions pass through the electrolyte to the cathode where they combine with oxygen and the two electrons that have traversed the load to form water.
Figure 10.1 Schematic of a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell.
Individual fuel cells produce between 0.5–0.9 V of DC electricity. Fuel cells are combined into
“stacks” to obtain usable voltage and power output. The same rules apply for combining fuel
cells in series and parallel as for combining photovoltaic cells in series and parallel (see
Chapter 9). A fuel cell “stack” element is illustrated in Figure 10.2.
The repeating unit, a fuel cell stack element, is a single fuel cell and contains the anode,
electrolyte, cathode, fuel ﬂow channel, and oxidant ﬂow channel. The stack is constructed by
assembling the repeating units in series, with the result that the voltages of the units add to each
other, while the transverse surface area determines the amperage.
A fuel cell system is composed of three major components: a fuel reformer (processor) that
generates hydrogen-rich gas from fuel, a power section where the electrochemical process
occurs, and a power conditioner (inverter) that converts the DC electricity generated in the fuel
cell into alternating current (AC) electricity. If a fuel cell is to be connected to the grid, then the
power conditioner must synchronize the electrical output to the grid in accordance with IEEE
1547. A simpliﬁed block diagram of a typical fuel cell system is illustrated in Figure 10.3.

Figure 10.3 Fuel cell block diagram.
Natural gas, which is mostly methane, is readily available and is one of the cleanest fuels (next
to hydrogen) for powering fuel cells. Much research is focused on natural-gas-powered fuel
cells, but fuel cells can also be powered by propane, diesel fuel, fuel oil, and other fuels as well as
bio-derived fuels.
For methane, the fuel processor utilizes steam reforming followed by a shift reaction.
Reforming the fuel with steam concentrates the hydrogen and removes contaminants that
could otherwise poison the catalyst in the cell. The chemical reaction for steam reforming is
CH4  H2O ! CO  3H2
(10.2)
The steam reforming reaction is an endothermic reaction with
H  206 kJ=mol. The carbon
monoxide (CO) in the mixture can be used to produce more hydrogen by the water-gas “shift”
reaction:
CO  H2O ! CO2  H2
(10.3)
The water-gas shift reaction is an exothermic reaction with
H  41 kJ=mol. Taken together
the two processes result in
CH4  2H2O ! CO2  4H2
(10.4)
The output of the fuel processor is thus carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Hoogers (2002) contains a
chapter on reforming techniques and procedures and comparisons of different reactions and is a
good choice for additional information.
10.3
Fuel Cell Thermodynamics Fundamentals
Details of the thermodynamics of fuel cells are provided in references such as Appleby and
Foulkes (1989), Kinoshita et al. (1988), and Li (2006). The energy released in a chemical reaction
is equal to the change in the enthalpy of formation
H.
H is the sum of the enthalpies of
formation for the products minus the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants:
H 
Hproducts 

(10.5)
H is negative for an exothermic reaction and positive for an endothermic reaction. If all the
energy in the chemical reaction were converted into electrical energy, then

charge contained in a kilogram-mole of electrons is thus 9.65 × 107 C/kg-mol-electron, Fara­

NIST web site (http://kinetics.nist.gov/janaf/) contains a very inclusive set of thermodynamic
properties. Care should be exercised to ensure that properties abstracted from different sources
have unit compatibility. For example, results are expressed in gram-moles or kilogram-moles
and in joules or kilojoules. A useful list of enthalpies of reaction at 25 °C and 1 atm pressure for a

The conversion efﬁciency of fuel cells is signiﬁcantly better than heat engine conversion
efﬁciencies since the fuel cell is an isothermal device not constrained by the Carnot limit.
Example 10.2
Determine the effect of cell operating temperature on the fuel cell of Example 10.1. Present
and discuss the appropriate results.
Solution
The effect of cell operating temperature on the output voltage and LHV and HHV
efﬁciencies are the characteristics of interest. Example 10.1 accomplished these calculations
for an operating temperature of 298 K. The same procedure will be followed in this example,
except the operating temperatures will be varied. The results of the sequence of calculations
are presented in Table 10.2.
The cell output voltage and the LHV and HHV efﬁciencies are plotted as a function of
temperature in Figure 10.4.
Although this is a simple thermodynamic model, Table 10.2 and Figure 10.4 capture much
of the behavior of a “real” fuel cell. As the cell operating temperature increases, the cell
voltage decreases and both the efﬁciencies (LHV and HHV) also decrease with cell operating
temperature. Indeed, the effect of cell operating temperature on cell performance is quite
pronounced.
The analysis presented in this section determines the salient features and limitations on the
performance of a fuel cell. Fuel cell performance is limited by transport and chemical kinetics
issues. Ramani (2006) and Brouwer (2001) specify and discuss the following 13 areas associated
with losses in fuel cells:
1) reactant transport to gas–electrolyte interface;
2) reactant dissolution in the electrolyte;
3) reactant transport through the electrolyte to the electrode surface;
4) pre-electrochemical chemical reactions;
5) absorption of species onto the electrode;

These losses are generally grouped into three major categories:
1) activation polarization;
2) ohmic polarization;
3) concentration polarization.
The losses are irreversible and cause the cell voltage to be reduced from the ideal value.
Activation overpotential is the result of chemical kinetics – slow chemical reactions. Ohmic
polarization losses are due to the resistance in the cell to the ﬂow of electricity. Concentration
polarization losses are caused by lower concentrations of reactants at the electrode surface than
in the bulk ﬂow.
Figure 10.5 illustrates the effects and regions of dominance of each of the three major
categories of losses as a function of current density. The theoretical voltage is indicated, and the
various current density regimes for which each of the effects dominate are illustrated. The three
add together for the total loss. Generally, the overall losses due to activation polarization, ohmic
polarization, and concentration polarization are important and cannot be ignored. References
such as Brouwer (2001), Larminie and Dicks (2003), Li (2006), Ramani (2006), and Hoogers
(2002) treat in detail each of the loss categories.
In many thermal devices, economy of scale tends to demand systems with larger and larger
capacities in order to attain near-maximum efﬁciencies. Fuel cells do not beneﬁt for economy of
scale; indeed, making them larger tends to exacerbate concentration polarization losses. Hence,
fuel cells are individually likely to remain relatively small in size. Large power requirements for
fuel cell installations will be met by assembling a number of fuel cells.

10 Fuel Cells
Figure 10.5 Fuel cell losses as a function of current density.
This section has examined the basic thermodynamics of fuel cells and brieﬂy reviewed sources
of losses in fuel cells. The examples were for a generic hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell. In actuality,
the fuel cell operating characteristics and electrochemistry details depend on the oxidant, the
fuel, and the electrolyte. The most common fuel cell types are explored next.
10.4
Fuel Cell Types
Most fuel cells are similar to the schematic illustrated in Figure 10.1, but differ with respect to 
the electrolyte used. The ﬁve main types of fuel cells, as distinguished by the electrolytes used, 
are as follows: 
1) alkaline fuel cell (AFC); 
2) phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC); 
3) molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC); 
4) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC); 
5) proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), including direct methanol fuel cells 
(DMFCs).
Each type will be examined in turn.
AFCs were the ﬁrst type to be perfected and are used extensively in the space program to
produce water and electricity on spacecraft. The electrolyte is potassium hydroxide in water.
The catalyst at the anode and cathode is a non-precious metals, which is an advantage.
Operating temperatures can range from 23 to 250 °C (74 to 482 °F), with about 70 °C being
the most common, and efﬁciencies as high as 60%. But a disadvantage is that AFCs require pure
hydrogen, which is difﬁcult and expensive to produce. AFCs are easily poisoned by CO2, as even
a small amount can affect cell operation, requiring that the hydrogen and oxygen streams be
puriﬁed. AFCs are not considered as a major contender for most applications, although their
niche applications in the space program, along with limited commercial applications, are well
documented.
The electrochemical reactions of the AFC are presented in Figure 10.6. At the cathode, water,
electrons and oxygen combine to form the hydroxyl ion (OH). At the anode, hydrogen and the

hydroxyl ion are combined to form water with the release of electrons (e). The hydroxyl ions
pass through the electrolyte to the anode, and the electrons pass through the external circuit to
the cathode. The reactions are as follows:
Anode reaction:
2H2  4OH ! 4H2O  4e
(10.25)
Cathode reaction:
O2  2H2O  4e ! 4OH
PAFCs use liquid phosphoric acid as an electrolyte and are generally considered “ﬁrst­
generation” fuel cell technology. The PAFCs use platinum as a catalyst and porous carbon
electrodes for both the cathode and anode. The expensive catalyst is part of the cost of the
PAFCs, $4000 to $4500 per installed kilowatt. These fuel cells operate at about 200 °C (400 °F)
and achieve 37–42% fuel-to-electricity efﬁciencies, only slightly higher than simple-cycle
combustion-based power plants. Thus, for a given power output, PAFCs are larger (more
volume) and heavier than some other fuel cell types. However, the technology is mature, and
PAFCs possess an impressive operation history.
The electrochemical reactions of PAFCs are presented in Figure 10.7. At the anode, hydrogen
is split into two hydrogen ions (H+) and two electrons (e). The hydrogen ions pass through the
electrolyte to the cathode, and the electrons pass through the external circuit to the cathode. At
the cathode, the hydrogen ions, electrons and oxygen combine to form water. The reactions are
as follows:
Anode reaction:
H2 ! 2H  2e

(10.26)
Cathode reaction:

MCFCs have the potential to reach 50–60% fuel-to-electricity efﬁciencies and can operate on
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, natural gas, propane, landﬁll gas, marine diesel, and coal gasiﬁca­
tion products. The high operating temperatures, 650 °C (1200 °F), of MCFCs make direct
operation (without a reformer) possible on gaseous hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas,
possible, and dramatically increase the speed of the reaction kinetics, so expensive, precious-
metal catalysts are not needed. MCFCs utilize molten carbonate salt mixtures as electrolytes.
Electrolytes used include lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and sodium carbonate. The

high efﬁciencies and the ability to operate on a variety of fuels are signiﬁcant advantages for
MCFCs. However, the high operating temperatures and corrosive electrolyte exacerbate
component breakdown and reduce cell life.

Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
An electrochemical reaction occurs at the anode between the hydrogen fuel and carbonate
ions, CO2, from the electrolyte. This reaction produces water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and
3
releases electrons to the anode. At the cathode, oxygen and CO2 are combined with electrons
from the anode to produce carbonate ions, which enter the electrolyte. An added complexity for
MCFCs is the requirement to inject CO2 at the cathode since carbonate ions are consumed in
the anode reaction. MCFCs are used for large stationary power generation. Megawatt-capacity
fuel cell facilities almost always use MCFCs, as do large combined heat and power (CHP)
installations (see Chapter 11 for discussions of such systems).
SOFCs operate at temperatures of 800–1000 °C (1400–1800 °F), thus permitting combined-
cycle performance. As with other high-temperature fuel cell types, a fuel processor is not needed
and the catalysts used are non-precious metals. Like MCFCs, the high operating temperatures of
SOFCs mean that a wide variety of hydrocarbon fuels can be used. SOFCs have fuel-to­
electricity conversion efﬁciencies of over 60%. Instead of a liquid electrolyte, solid oxide systems
typically use a solid-ceramic material, such as zirconium–yttrium oxide. The solid ceramic
construction provides a stable and reliable design, permits high temperatures, and enables
ﬂexibility in fuel choice. The SOFC is especially tolerant of sulfur compounds and carbon
monoxide. Unlike other fuel cell types, SOFCs can use carbon monoxide as well as hydrogen as a
fuel and are uniquely suited for fuels from coal gasiﬁcation. SOFCs are used in large and small
stationary power systems. SOFCs with outputs in the watt range are being developed for small
portable chargers. The high operating temperatures also result in slow startup times and
material durability problems. The electrochemical reactions of SOFCs are presented in
Figure 10.9. The reactions occurring in an SOFC include
Anode reactions:
H2  O2 ! H2O  2e
CO  O2 ! CO2  2e
CH4  4O2 ! 2H2O  CO2  8e
(10.28)
Cathode reaction:
O2  4e ! 2O2
In an SOFC, hydrogen or carbon monoxide (CO) in the fuel stream react with oxide ions (O2)
from the electrolyte. These reactions produce water and CO2 and provide electrons to the

anode. The electrons pass through the load. At the cathode, oxygen molecules (O2) from the air
receive electrons and are converted into oxide ions. The oxide ions are returned to electrolyte.
PEMFCs (also called polymer exchange membrane fuel cells) contain a thin plastic polymer
membrane through which hydrogen ions can pass. The membrane is coated on both sides with
metal alloy particles (mostly platinum) that act as catalysts. The use of precious-metal catalyst
increases the system cost. Since the electrolyte in a PEMFC is a water-based solid polymer,
electrolyte loss is not an issue and does not affect stack life. The use of a solid electrolyte also
eliminates the safety concerns and corrosive effects associated with liquid electrolytes. PEMFCs
operate at relatively low temperatures (below 100 °C). PEMFCs offer high power density and low
weight and volume compared with other fuel cell types. The low operating temperatures mean
that pure hydrogen is needed, but the low operating temperatures result in fast start up and
enhanced component durability. The PEMFCs are the leading fuel cell type for use in light-duty
and materials-handling vehicles, and to a lesser extent for stationary power applications. The
electrochemistry for the PEMFC is shown in Figure 10.10. The reactions that occur in the
PEMFC are as follows:
Anode reaction:
H2 ! 2H  2e
(10.29)
Cathode reaction:
O2  4H  4e ! 2H2O
Hydrogen ions and electrons are produced from the fuel at the anode. At the cathode, oxygen
combines with electrons from the anode and hydrogen ions from the electrolyte to produce
water. The solid electrolyte does not absorb the water; thus, the water is rejected from the back
of the cathode into the oxidant gas stream.
High-temperature PEMFCs (HT PEMFCs) are a relatively recent (ca 2003) variant of PEMFCs
that operate at temperatures up to 200 °C. The electrolyte in HT PEMFCs is mineral-acid based
instead of water based for conventional PEMFCs. The increased operating temperature means
that HT PEMFCs are more tolerant of fuel impurities such as CO (up to 5% by volume).
DMFCs are a relatively new type, development having been started about 1990. Similar to the
PEMFC, a DMFC uses a polymer membrane as an electrolyte, but the platinum–ruthenium

catalyst on the DMFC anode is able to extract hydrogen from methanol (CH3OH) so that a
reformer is not needed. Methanol (see Chapter 12) is an ideal fuel – an inexpensive liquid with a
high energy density that can be easily stored, transported, and supplied to a fuel cell. DMFCs
operate from 60 to 130 °C and are used in applications with modest power requirements such as
mobile electronic devices, portable power packs, and materials handling vehicles. For the latter,
DMFCs offer rapid refueling, rather than lengthy battery charging.
The electrochemistry for the DMFC is shown in Figure 10.11. The reactions that occur in the
DMFC are as follows:
Anode reaction:
CH3OH  H2O ! 6H  6e  CO2
Cathode reaction:
3
2 O2  6H  6e ! 3H2O
(10.30)
At the anode, the hydrogen is extracted from the methanol, and hydrogen ions and electrons
are produced. At the cathode, oxygen combines with electrons from the anode and hydrogen
ions from the electrolyte to produce water. Carbon dioxide is formed at the anode, and water is
formed at the cathode.
All fuel cells have the same function: the electrochemical generation of electricity from a fuel
and an oxidant. The ﬁve types of fuel cells discussed have different electrolytes that result in
different operating temperatures, efﬁciencies, suitable fuels, fuel processor requirements, and
availability. Table 10.3 gives an overview of fuel cell characteristics for the AFC, PAFC, SOFC,
MCFC, and PEMFC (including DMFC). The information contained in Table 10.3 was obtained
from a variety of internet web sites, including manufacturers, national laboratories, academia,
and industry technical organizations and is subject to change as signiﬁcant research on most fuel
cell types is ongoing.
Virtually all fuel cells have the advantages of quiet operation, low emissions, and high
efﬁciency (compared with simple cycle thermal systems). The AFC and PAFC are relatively
mature, proven technologies. All types of fuel cells are expensive when compared on a dollar per
kilowatt basis with heat engines. The SOFC, MCFC, PEMFC, and DMFC types are just emerging
into commercialization (quite limited for some types). Since 2010, commercialization of MCFC

more varied. The Ofﬁce of Energy Efﬁciency & Renewable Energy (EERE) web-located
documents http://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/types-fuel-cells and http://energy.gov/sites/prod/
ﬁles/2014/03/f10/fct_h2_fuelcell_factsheet.pdf offer good starting points for additional infor­
mation on fuel cells, as does the E4Tech industry review (E4Tech, 2014). SOFCs have
progressed from scant market penetration in 2009 to about 20% of the installed capacity in
2013. Section 10.5 examines some of the currently available fuel cells.
10.5 Fuel Cell Availability
From 1958 until 2013, UTC Power, a United Technologies Corporation company, marketed the
PureCell
TM series of fuel cells, the Model 200 rated at 200 kW and the Model 400 rated at
400 kW. By 2012, the PureCell
TM Model 200 has amassed more than 9 million operating hours
with 275 units in 19 countries. The PureCell
TM Model 400, introduced in 2010, reached 1 million
hours of operation in 2013. In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power, which
eventually ﬁled for bankruptcy protection in May 2014, and the Doosan Group, a large South
Korean conglomerate, acquired ClearEdge Power and formed Doosan Fuel Cell America. In July
2015, Doosan Fuel Cell announced a major increase in fuel cell production at its South Windsor,
CT, facility, the original UTC Power facility.
The PureCell
TM Model 400, now built and marketed by Doosan Fuel Cell America, is a 400 kW
PAFC and is one of the best-selling fuel cell systems. The Model 400 is especially suited for CHP
applications – the subject of Chapter 11. Figure 10.12 contains a rendering of the fuel cell, and
Table 10.4 lists salient metrics. Both the ﬁgure and the table are abstracted from the Doosan web
site (http://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/main.do). In Figure 10.12, the numbered components
are as follows:
1) Fuel processor (reformer) – converts natural gas to a hydrogen-rich gas. 
2) Fuel cell stack – hydrogen and air are combined electrochemically to produce electricity 
(DC), water, and heat. Part of the water (as steam) is used in the reformer.
3) Power conditioner – the DC power is converted to grid-acceptable AC power.
4) Integral heat recovery – heat is recovered for space heating, domestic hot water, and other
process energy uses.Figure depicting the cut-away illustration of the PureCell Model 400 PAFC. The numbered components in the figure are as follows: (1) Fuel processor; (2) fuel cell stack; (3) power conditioner; and (4) integral heat recovery.

As indicated by the ﬁgure, the system baseload output is 400 kW/471 kVA at 480 V, three-
phase, 60 Hz power. Emissions are essentially negligible. The fuel cell dimensions are 100 in by
119 in by 344 in, and the PureCell
TM Model 400 weighs 60 000 lb. At 33 ft from the cell, the noise
is only 65 dB – veriﬁcation that the fuel cell is amazingly quiet and can be located inside a
structure. The life of the fuel cell stack is 10 years. The natural gas input (baseload) is
3.60 MMBtu/h, for which the electrical efﬁciency is quoted as 42%. The baseload heat recovery
from the Model 400 is 0.88 MMBtu/h at 140 °F. The PureCell
TM Model 400 is an example of a
commercially available fuel cell, and the information presented is typical of what is found on web
sites for various fuel cell manufacturers.

from this list. A number of other companies are developing and/or marketing various sizes and
types of fuel cells. As the industry is quite ﬂuid, other companies may appear, and some listed in
Table 10.5 may disappear. Fuel cell systems speciﬁcations are also likely to change. The
companies listed in Table 10.5 all have web sites, and each web site contains information
on the company’s fuel cell endeavors. As is usual for the internet, much of the information is
generally “non-technical,” and detailed technical speciﬁcations may not be available except by
contacting the company. Nonetheless, the table does provide an indication of what fuel cells are
available in the marketplace and at least some indication of the power range and electrolyte
types.
The fuel cell industry is in a state of ﬂux and is undergoing consolidations and modiﬁcations –
witness the divesture by UTC of UTC Power and the entry of the Doosan Group with Doosan
Fuel Cell America. The years since 2009 have seen signiﬁcant increases in installed megawatt
fuel cell capacity, number of units sold, and commercialization of all electrolyte types.
Figure 10.13 from the NREL’s 2013 Renewable Energy Data Book (Esterly and Gelman,
2014), illustrates the steady increases in installed fuel cell capacity from 2008 to 2013. Most
of the growth is in stationary power applications. To some extent, automotive applications are
still a research topic. Highlights, taken from the Esterly and Gelman (2014), indicate that global
stationary fuel cell capacity increased threefold, reaching 160 MW in 2013, and fuel cell
shipments increased by 25% from the previous year.
E4Tech (2014) reports the breakdown in installed megawatts by fuel-cell electrolyte type from
2009 to 2013. Figure 10.14, taken from that report, conﬁrms a healthy increase in installed
capacity (megawatts) as well as the strong emergence of SOFCs in the last few years.
Figure 10.15 provides a summary of stationary fuel cell installed capacity from 2001 through
2015. Since 2009, the installed capacity of stationary fuel cells has nearly doubled, and in 2015 it
reached 178 MW. CHP (see Chapter 11) installed capacity has been essentially constant at
40 MW since 2010.A bar graphical representation where annual capacity systems shipped (MW) is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–180 and years on the x-axis on a scale of 2008–2013.

Closure
AFCs have played an important role in the manned space program since its early days. But the
relatively high cost per kilowatt of fuel cells, in spite of their high efﬁciencies and other
advantages, has limited their use as an alternative energy system. However, as the cost per
kilowatt decreases and as stable, pollution-free electric power becomes of more importance, fuel
cells become more attractive from economic and “green” perspectives. Fuel cells are starting to
play an increased role in scenarios ranging from baseload electricity, to emergency/backup
power, to portable power solutions, and to electronic devices power, but widespread use of fuel
cells in personal vehicles has yet to occur because of cost and hydrogen availability.

Combined Heat and Power Systems
11.1
Introduction
Combined heat and power (CHP) systems are characterized by the decentralized generation of
electricity by a prime mover and the capture and use of reject thermal energy from the prime
mover. The advantages for CHP systems are simple: increased overall system thermal efﬁciency,
enhanced power quality, improved energy resiliency, and decreased greenhouse and other gases
emissions.
The electrical grid is based on large, centrally located power plants. The transmission of power
from such plants to the end users is accomplished through an electrical grid that consists of
high-voltage transmission systems and low-voltage distribution systems. The high-voltage
transmission system carries electricity from the power plants and transmits it to substations,
where the high-voltage electricity is transformed into low voltages and distributed to individual
customers.
The overall thermal efﬁciency of generation, transmission, and distribution is relatively low.
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 illustrate the losses inherent to the generation and delivery of electric
power in both traditional and combined-cycle power plants. Termuehler (2001) presents a lucid
history of power plant developments, and Kehlhofer et al. (1999) discuss in detail combined-
cycle power plants. Traditional power plants convert about >30% of the available energy of the
fuel into end-user electric power, and highly efﬁcient, combined-cycle power plants convert
about 50% of the available energy into end-user electric power. The majority of the energy
content of the fuel is lost at the power plant through the discharge or rejection of waste heat.
Additional losses are incurred in the transmission and distribution of power to the end user.
Inefﬁciencies and emission issues associated with conventional power plants provide the
impetus for new and revisited paradigms in “on-site and near-site” or “decentralized” genera­
tion. New developments in prime movers and power electronic technologies, along with
restructuring and deregulation of the electrical utility industry, have enhanced the economics
of decentralized electricity generation.
A technology consisting of power generation equipment coupled with thermally activated
and/or thermal energy consuming components has evolved under the rubric of CHP. CHP has
the potential to reduce carbon and other emissions and to increase thermal energy efﬁciency
dramatically. CHP produces both electric or shaft power and useable thermal energy on-site or
near-site, converting as much as 80% of the fuel into useable energy. A higher thermal efﬁciency
means less fuel to meet an energy demand. Also, local power generation reduces the grid
demand and provides better power quality and resilient (emergency) capability. Figure 11.3
illustrates the increase in efﬁciency of CHP systems over the conventional, centralized power
plant efﬁciencies as in Figures 11.1 and 11.2.
A successful CHP system requires a need for both generated electricity/shaft power and thermal
energy. An operation that does not have a need for both will not beneﬁt from CHP. CHP is

CHP has become an emphasis for the US Department of Energy (USDOE). The CHP program
resides in the Ofﬁce of Energy Efﬁciency and Renewable Energy (EERE) of the USDOE. The
EERE CHP Technical Assistance Partnerships (CHP TAPs) promote CHP and assist end-point
energy users in implementing CHP systems by providing market opportunity analyses, educa­
tion and outreach, and technical assistance. Contact information for the seven regional CHP
TAPs, along with details of the program, is at http://energy.gov/eere/amo/chp-technical­
assistance-partnerships-chp-taps. The DOE data base for CHP systems on a state-by-state
basis is available at https://doe.icfwebservices.com/chpdb/.
Additionally, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established the CHP
Partnership initiative that seeks to promote the adoption of CHP technologies by involving
government entities (national, state, and local), energy users, the CHP industry, and other clean-
energy stakeholders. The EPA CHP Partnership publication Catalog of CHP Technologies
(Darrow et al., 2015) provides a good overview.

11.2
Combined Heat and Power System Fundamentals
A CHP system combines distributed power generation with thermally activated components to
meet the cooling, heating and power needs of buildings or with heat recovery devices (such as
heat recovery steam generators, HRSGs) to meet process energy needs. Speciﬁc types of
distributed power generation and thermally activated technologies will be introduced and
brieﬂy discussed.
A number of technologies are commercially available for generating electric power or
mechanical shaft power on-site or near the site where the power is used. The major categories
of prime movers for distributed generation (DG) are combustion (gas) turbines, internal
combustion engines, and fuel cells, although steam turbines can also be used in CHP systems.
Combustion turbines were examined in Chapter 5, and fuel cells were discussed in Chapter 10.
Characteristics of these prime movers for DG technologies are contrasted in Table 11.1, from
the Catalog of CHP Technologies (Darrow et al., 2015). Additional cost information is also
available from the Distributed Generation Renewable Energy Estimate of Costs (NREL, 2013).
The efﬁciency of electric power generation for combustion turbine systems, operating in a
simple-cycle mode (i.e., without heat recovery in the turbine exhaust), ranges from 22 to 40%.
Combustion turbines produce high-quality thermal energy that can be used to generate steam
or hot water for thermal applications, including heating and cooling, or for process energy.
Industrial gas turbines represent a well-established technology for power generation. These
turbines also represent the “high-capacity” end of power generating equipment. Industrial gas
turbines can provide 1 MW to more than 300 MW of electric power. Microturbines, with
<1 MW electrical generating capability, represent the “low-capacity” end of power generating
equipment but possess electrical efﬁciencies of 22–28%. Fuel source versatility of turbines
allows their application in rural as well as urban areas.
A reciprocating engine, either four-cycle internal combustion or diesel, is frequently used as
the prime mover in a CHP system. Internal combustion engines are a mature technology, and
applications of reciprocating engines are well established and widespread. Engines can use

natural gas, propane, or diesel fuel and are available in capacities ranging from 5 kW to 10 MW
and possess electrical efﬁciencies of 27–41%. Reciprocating engines used for power generation
have low capital cost, easy startup, proven reliability, good load-following characteristics, and
signiﬁcant heat recovery potential. Exhaust catalysts and better combustion design and control
have signiﬁcantly reduced internal combustion engine emissions over the past few years.
Thermal energy is captured from both the engine exhaust gases and the engine cooling system.
Fuel cells produce electric power by electrochemical reactions, generally between hydrogen
and oxygen, without the combustion processes. Like a battery, a fuel cell produces direct
current. However, as discussed in Chapter 10, fuel cells come in a complete package in which the
fuel cell stack is integrated with an inverter to convert the direct current to an alternating
current and, if needed, a reformer to provide the hydrogen-rich fuel. Fuel cells have the highest
electrical generating efﬁciency and lowest emissions of any CHP prime mover, but are the most
expensive on an installed-kilowatt basis of any CHP prime mover.
In addition to on-site generation of electricity, an equally important consideration is the
capture and use of reject heat. Energy recovery from any of the prime movers in a CHP system is
accomplished by heat exchangers. Heat exchangers used to recover reject heat from a CHP
prime mover are classiﬁed according to the ﬂuid pairs handled and the temperatures of the ﬂuids
entering the heat exchangers. The input steams can be gas-to-gas, gas-to-liquid, or liquid-to­
liquid, which are usually associated with high-, medium-, and low-temperature waste heat
applications respectively.
Gas-to-gas heat exchangers are often used as recuperators for preheating combustion air for
internal combustion engines or combustion turbines. A crossﬂow heat exchanger with ﬂue gas
ﬂowing normal to a tube bundle containing air is called a convection recuperator. Such
recuperators are used in low-temperature applications such as space heating, desiccant
dehumidiﬁcation systems, or direct-ﬁred absorption chillers. Other types of heat exchangers
used for gas-to-gas waste heat recovery include plate-ﬁn, heat pipes, and rotary generators.
Gas-to-liquid heat exchangers include medium- to high-temperature heat recovery devices
such as HRSGs, ﬂuidized-bed heat exchangers, and heat pipes, as well as low- to medium-
temperature heat exchangers used as economizers or ﬂuid heaters. HRSGs, also called waste
heat boilers, are used to generate steam from a prime mover, typically a gas turbine exhaust gas.
HRSGs are very important in CHP applications and will be examined in a following paragraph.
In a ﬂuidized-bed heat exchanger, water or steam is heated by the exhaust gas (hot) stream that
ﬂows over a bed of ﬁnely divided solid particles. When the hot ﬂuid reaches a critical velocity,
the particles in the bed will ﬂoat and act like a ﬂuid, giving rise to an increase in the heat transfer
coefﬁcient. Fluidized-bed heat exchangers are often used for space or hot water heating, boiler
feedwater heating, and process ﬂuid heating. Gas-to-liquid heat pipes are similar to those used
in gas-to-gas applications.
Economizers are crossﬂow heat exchangers in which water ﬂows in individually ﬁnned tubes
with hot gases ﬂowing normal to the tubes. Economizers are often used with the boiler ﬂue gases
to preheat the boiler feedwater or to heat water or other process liquids or to superheat steam.
Fluid heaters are double-pipe heat exchangers that use hot gases to heat a process heat transfer
ﬂuid that is circulated throughout a plant.
Liquid-to-liquid heat recovery exchangers are typically used in industrial applications that
possess prime movers that use hot oil or other liquid coolants. Shell-and-tube heat exchangers
are generally speciﬁed for this type of heat recovery.
HRSGs are frequently employed in processes that require steam for thermally activated
components or for process energy use and are classiﬁed as unﬁred, partially ﬁred, or fully ﬁred.
Unﬁred HRSGs use only the hot exhaust gases for steam generation. An HRSG that uses a duct
burner upstream to increase the exhaust gas temperature is considered partially ﬁred. If the
exhaust gas is used as preheated air to the combustion process, the HRSG said to be fully ﬁred.

Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Figure 11.4 HRSG temperature–area diagram.
Figure 11.4 presents a temperature–area diagram of the temperature states in a HRSG. The
hot exhaust gas enters at a high temperature and is cooled as it traverses the HRSG. The energy
extracted from the hot gas is used to heat, vaporize (evaporate), and superheat the water. The
ﬂow arrangement shown in the ﬁgure is counterﬂow. An HRSG generally includes sections that
are identiﬁed as an economizer, an evaporator, and a superheater. The water is heated to
saturation conditions by the low-temperature exhaust as it exits the HRSG. In the evaporator,
the water is vaporized into saturated steam, and the saturated steam is superheated by the inlet
high-temperature exhaust in the superheater. The pinch point, where the water ﬁrst starts to
vaporize, is the smallest temperature difference in the HRSG and is the limiting factor in its
overall performance. The hot and cold temperature–area distributions are especially critical in
an HRSG as depicted in Figure 11.4. Poor design of such a device can result in a situation where
the hot and cold exit enthalpies satisfy conservation of energy, but in the pinch-point region of
the HRSG the local cold-ﬂuid temperature can exceed the local hot-ﬂuid temperature, resulting
in a second law violation and invalidating the expected HRSG thermal performance. The HRSG
must produce the pressure–temperature state of the steam required. To avoid condensation in
the HRSG, the exit temperature of the exhaust gas must be above the condensation temperature
of vapors in the exhaust.
In the majority of installations, a ﬂapper damper or “diverter” valve is employed to vary the
ﬂow across the heat exchanger to maintain a speciﬁc design temperature of the hot water or a
speciﬁc steam generation rate. A schematic of a typical combustion turbine, diverter valve, and
HRSG arrangement is presented in Figure 11.5. The turbine-generator is contained in a sound-
insulated enclosure to which inlet air is ducted. The diverter valve leads to a stack for venting
unneeded exhaust gas. A duct burner is illustrated upstream of the HRSG. The steam from the
HRSG is then directed to thermally activated devices or for process energy use.
Thermally activated devices use thermal energy instead of electric energy for providing
heating, cooling, or humidity control for buildings. The two primary thermally activated devices
used in CHP systems are absorption chillers and desiccant dehumidiﬁers.
Absorption chillers use heat as the primary source of energy for driving an absorption
refrigeration cycle. These chillers require very little electric power (0.02 kW/ton) compared with
electric chillers (0.47–0.88 kW/ton, depending upon the type of electric chiller). Absorption
chillers have fewer and smaller moving parts and are quieter during operation than electric
chillers. These chillers are also environmentally friendly in that they use non-chloro­
ﬂuorocarbon refrigerants.

Figure 11.5 Typical CHP HRSG components.
Commercially available absorption chillers can utilize one of the following sources of heat:
steam, hot water, exhaust gases, or direct combustion. Absorption chillers, except those that use
direct combustion, are excellent candidates for providing cooling in a CHP system.
Two types of absorption chillers are commercially available: single effect and multiple effect.
Compared with single-effect chillers, multiple-effect absorption chillers cost more (higher
capital cost) but are more energy efﬁcient and are thus less expensive to operate (lower energy
cost). The overall economic attractiveness of each chiller depends on many factors, including
the cost of capital and the cost of energy.
There are two separate aspects of space conditioning for comfort cooling:
 lowering the temperature of the air (sensible cooling), and
 reducing humidity in the air (latent cooling).
The humidity level should remain below 60% relative humidity to prevent growth of mold,
bacteria and other harmful microorganisms in buildings and to prevent adverse health effects.
Conventional air-conditioning systems reduce the air temperature below the air dew point
temperature so that moisture in the incoming air condenses on the outside of a cooling coil over
which the air passes. The cooled and dehumidiﬁed air is sent to the space being conditioned.
Reducing humidity in the air by cooling often requires lowering the air temperature below a
comfortable level and may necessitate reheating of the cooled dehumidiﬁed air if comfort is to
be attained.
Desiccant dehumidiﬁers reduce humidity in the air by using solid or liquid desiccants to
attract and hold moisture. Desiccant dehumidiﬁers operate independently of chiller operation.
In CHP systems, thermal energy from the prime mover is used for regenerating desiccant
material in these dehumidiﬁers. By reducing the moisture content of the air, desiccant
dehumidiﬁers satisfy the latent cooling load and, thus, reduce the load of the chillers to
only the sensible cooling (reducing the temperature). Desiccant components in effect permit the
sensible and latent cooling functions to be separated and independently controlled.
11.3
Combined Heat and Power System Economics and Operation
CHP systems are attractive for a number of reasons, including economics, thermal efﬁciency,
greenhouse gas emissions, power quality, and resiliency. However, in order for CHP to be viable
for a given scenario, the following three attributes must be present:

232
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
1) a use for the electricity generated; 
2) a use for the thermal energy recovered; 
3) a sufﬁcient “spark spread.”
The spark spread refers to the difference, generally expressed in $/106 Btu, between the costs
of electricity and the prime mover fuel, typically natural gas. The accepted spark spread
threshold for economically feasibility is $12/106 Btu; that is, the more the spark spread exceeds
that value, the more economically promising is CHP. Example 11.1 illustrates how the spark
spread can be calculated.
Example 11.1
What is the spark spread if electricity cost $0.12/kW h and natural gas is $0.90/ccf (ccf: 100
cubic feet).
Solution
As indicated in the problem statement, the energy charge for electricity is gener­
ally assessed as a cost per kilowatt-hour, and the cost of natural gas is expressed as the cost
per cubic foot. Another common billing unit for natural gas is per 1000 cubic feet (mcf). The
energy content of natural gas is nominally 100 000 Btu/ccf or 1 000 000 Btu/mcf. Thus:

Thus, the spark spread becomes
Spark spread  $35:16=106 Btu  $9:00=106 Btu  $26:16=106 Btu
Hence, electricity is $26.16/106 Btu more expensive than natural gas. A spark spread of this
magnitude (much in excess of $12/106 Btu) is very favorable for CHP if the ﬁrst two conditions
are met.
However, the determination of the economic feasibility of a CHP system is more involved than
just calculating the spark spread. A ﬁrst-order economic analysis of the feasibility of a CHP
system requires consideration of the operating strategy of a candidate facility. Consider the ﬁve
most common operating strategies (indicated as A through E) depicted in Figure 11.6. In the
ﬁgure, the axes are the thermal energy and the electrical energy. The three dashed lines
represent the characteristics of the prime mover. The larger the slope, the more electricity
generated for a given amount of thermal energy recovered. Because of variations in the
electricity and thermal energy needs, position A, which illustrates a perfect match between
the thermal and electrical requirements, is virtually never met. Positions B–E, however,
represents different but realistic strategies. For position B the electrical energy requirement
is met but the thermal energy recovered is greater than required. Unless a neighboring facility
can purchase the excess thermal energy, it must be rejected to the atmosphere, thus negating the
economic effect of some of the energy recovered. Position C corresponds to meeting the thermal
requirement but not meeting the electrical requirement. Electricity would have to be purchased
from the grid. Condition C is a common operating strategy for a CHP system. In many instances
connection to the grid provides power redundancy for a facility. For position D the electrical
load is satisﬁed but the thermal needs are not met, so additional thermal energy must be
provided. Condition D can be a useful operating strategy. Position E represents meeting the
thermal needs but generating excess electricity that must be sold. Unless the excess power can

be sold at a sufﬁcient price to pay the cost of generation, option E is not economically attractive
and is infrequently speciﬁed.
Tables 11.2 and 11.3 present the utility bills for a year and the utility rate structures for a
manufacturing facility. Consider the electric bill ﬁrst (Table 11.2). Commercial and industrial
electrical rate schedules usually involve energy and demand charges and can include items such
as power factor charges and time-of-day or time-of-year tariffs. The electricity bill illustrated in

(“Other charges”). The electrical energy is expressed in kilowatt-hours and is billed at some
speciﬁed rate. The demand is the maximum sustained (usually for a 15 or 30 min period) power
draw from the grid per billing period. Once set, the maximum demand is not reset until the start
of the next billing period. The rate schedule shown in the table is relatively simple; rate schedules
in many instances are more complex. Generally, natural gas is billed only as an energy charge.
The usual billing units are per 100 or per 1000 cubic feet (as deﬁned previously).
Plotting the electricity and gas usages on a monthly basis often reveals important trends in
energy use and is the initial step in analyzing energy usage patterns. Figures 11.7 and 11.8
contain graphical representations of the energy usages from Tables 11.2 and 11.3.A graphical representation for energy usage where electricity usage, kWh is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 2.5×105–2×106 and months (starting with August) on the x-axis on a scale of A–J.

Figure 11.8 Natural gas usage from Table 11.3.
The trends indicated in Figures 11.7 and 11.8 are typical of manufacturing facilities with large
electricity and large natural gas usages for process energy. The natural gas usage is essentially
constant throughout the year with no dominant use in the winter months. This behavior means
that only a small percentage of the natural gas is used for space heating; thus, most of the natural
gas is used for the manufacturing process. Likewise, the near-constant monthly electricity usage,
with about a 20% increase in the summer, implies that most of the electricity is also used for the
process and not for space conditioning.
Another revealing metric is the usage factor of electricity. The usage factor is the percentage of
time, for a given billing period, that the peak demand (kilowatts) must be used in order to
account for the total energy usage (kilowatt-hours). The energy usage (kilowatt-hours) divided
by the product of the peak demand (kilowatts) and the number of hours in the billing period
yields the usage factor:
Kilowatt-hour usage
Usage factor 
(11.1)
Peak kilowatts  Days in billing period  24 h=day
For the usage and demand represented by Tables 11.2 and 11.3, the monthly usage factor is
presented in Figure 11.9.A graphical representation for usage factor per month where use factor is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–1 and months (starting with August) on the x-axis on a scale of A–J.
Figure 11.9 Usage factor per month.

236
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
As demonstrated in Figure 11.9, the usage factor varies between 0.8 and 0.95 and
indicates that the facility runs most of the equipment most of the time. In a manufacturing
scenario, the process must be run three shifts for 5 to 7 days a week in order to achieve such
a high usage factor. Facilities with high electrical usage factors are good candidates for on-
site generation since the prime mover/generator would be operating near peak load most
of the time.
Example 11.2
Based on the three CHP attributes:
1) a use for the electricity generated, 
2) a use for the thermal energy recovered, and 
3) a sufﬁcient “spark spread,”
is the facility whose bills are provided in Tables 11.2 and 11.3 a candidate for further
investigation for a CHP system?
Solution
Tables 11.2 and 11.3 and Figures 11.7, 11.8, and 11.9 contain information useful in
analyzing the three questions. The kilowatt-hour and per 100 cubic feet usage by the facility
certainly meet the ﬁrst two conditions. The spark spread is calculated next. The average cost
of 100 cubic feet is $0.265, so the average cost per 106 Btu becomes

Thus, the spark spread becomes
Spark spread  $14:58=106 Btu  $2:65=106 Btu  $11:93=106 Btu
On a per 106 Btu basis, the cost of electricity is nearly $12 more than the cost of natural gas. This
magnitude of spark gap is usually taken as a positive indication for CHP. Hence, all three of the
attributes are satisﬁed, so that this facility is a candidate for further investigation. This short
analysis does not conﬁrm that a CHP system is appropriate, only that further investigation is
warranted.
If the “short” analysis of Example 11.2 indicates only that further investigation is appropriate,
what is needed for the next level of feasibility study? Section 11.4 explores a more involved
economic assessment of CHP suitability.
11.4 Economic Assessment of Combined Heat and Power Suitability
The economics and feasibility of a CHP system can be assessed on a ﬁrst-order basis by
considering the yearly utility bills. This technique uses the energy consumption information in

237
11 Combined Heat and Power Systems
conjunction with industry-accepted efﬁciencies for both conventional and CHP components to
estimate the savings, if any, from meeting the energy needs using CHP. Accepted values of
component efﬁciencies and electrical and thermal energy production are assigned as follows:
Conventional
Boiler
ηboiler  0:85
Central power plant
ηcpp  0:35
Central chiller
COPcc  2:5
CHP
Electricity (gas turbine)
ηe  0:30
Recovered thermal energy
ηr  0:35−0:50
Absorption chiller
COPabc  0:7−0:8
The ﬁrst-order assessment procedure is best described by considering a detailed example.
Example 11.3
Accomplish a ﬁrst-order assessment for CHP suitability for the utility bills presented in
Tables 11.2 and 11.3.
Solution
The ﬁrst step in the procedure is to establish the operating mode (conditions A–E
of Figure 11.6) congruent with the energy usages. Insight into the appropriate operating mode
can be gained by computing the ratio of the electrical energy (expressed in Btus) to the gas
energy. The electrical energy is
Btu
Electrical energy  Kilowatt-hour usage  3412 kWh
Btu
 17 049 900 kWh  3412 kWh
 58 170  106 Btu
and
Btu
Natural gas energy  100 cubic feet usage  100 000 ccf
Btu
 2 213 786 ccf  100 000 ccf
 221 400  106 Btu
The ratio of electrical energy to gas energy then becomes
Electrical energy
58 170  106 Btu
Energy ratio 

 0:263
Natural gas energy
221 400  106 Btu
Since the electrical energy required is much less than the gas energy required, a logical
choice of the operating mode is case D of Figure 11.6. Mode D provides all the electricity
required but does not meet the thermal requirements. The natural gas required for a gas
turbine to generate the required kilowatt-hours can be calculated by dividing the electrical
energy required by the gas turbine electrical generation efﬁciency ηe:
Electrical energy required
Natural gas required

ηe

58 170  106 Btu
0:30
ccf
100 000 Btu  1:939  106 ccf

238
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Thus, a gas turbine operating at an electrical efﬁciency of 30% will require 1.939 × 106 ccf to
produce the required 17 049 900 kWh. The thermal energy recovered from the turbine is the
natural gas required times the recovery efﬁciency ηr:
Thermal energy recovered  Natural gas recovered  ηe
 1:939  106 ccf  0:34  660 000 ccf
However, to obtain the input energy content of the thermal energy recovered from boiler, the
boiler efﬁciency ηboiler is needed:
Thermal energy recovered
Thermal energy equivalent 
ηboiler
660 000 ccf

 776 000 ccf
0:85
The recovered thermal energy is equivalent to 776 000 ccf of natural gas. Since this amount is
considerably less than the required thermal energy of 2 213 786 ccf, the thermal energy
recovered does not exceed the thermal energy required. Operating mode D is conﬁrmed as
appropriate for the utility usage of Table 11.2. The total natural gas usage required would be the
natural gas currently purchased to meet the thermal needs plus the additional natural gas
required for the CHP system minus the thermal energy equivalent recovered from the turbine
exhaust. For this example, the natural gas required is thus
Natural gas required  Currently purchased  CHP required  Equivalent recovered
 2 213 786 ccf  1 939 000 ccf  776 000 ccf  3:377  106 ccf
At an average cost of $0.265/ccf and a tax rate of 1.5%, the cost of natural gas to run the facility
with a CHP system in mode D becomes
$0:265
Natural gas cost  3:377  106 ccf 
 1:015  $908 400
ccf
From Table 11.1 a reasonable operation and maintenance charge for a gas turbine is 1¢/kW h.
The O&M cost is thus estimated as
$0:01
O&M cost  17 049 900 kWh 
 $170 499
kWh
The total cost for operating the CHP system is the sum of the natural gas cost and the O&M cost:
Total cost  $908 000  $170 499  $1 078 499
The cost of operating the current system, electricity and natural gas, is $1 384 000. The savings
for switching to a CHP system are thus
CHP savings  $1:384  106  $1:078  106  $306 000
The operation of a CHP system with a gas turbine would save $306 000 per year over the
existing, conventional system. For operating mode D, all of the electricity requirements are
met, and the facility could be disconnected from the grid. However, for no grid reliance the
facility would be without power during CHP system inspections or downtimes unless backup
sources were provided. In many instances, the choice would be made to maintain a grid
connection to ensure continued operation if the CHP system were down. The cost analysis
will be done under the assumption of no grid connection charges.
If the turbine is take the full load of the facility, a turbine with an electrical output of at
least 2439 kW (the maximum demand from Table 11.2) is needed. A nominal 2.5 MW turbine

239
11 Combined Heat and Power Systems
would meet the existing needs but would provide little capability for expansion. A ballpark
cost per kilowatt for an installed CHP system with a gas turbine is $1200, from Table 11.1. A
CHP system with a 2.5 MW gas turbine is estimated to cost $3 000 000. The simple payback
period, based on turbine cost only (no heat exchanger cost), becomes
$3 000 000
Simple payback 
 9:8 years
$306 000=year
This is as far as this analysis can go without additional information on the facility, including
management policies. In addition to economics examined in this example problem, other
factors would enter into a decision to convert to a CHP system. These factors include, but are
not limited to, power quality, CO2 credits, company “green” policies, and energy security
concerns.
The preceding example illustrates a ﬁrst-order approach to assessing the economic feasibility
of a CHP system. For systems operating in mode C a similar procedure would be used, except
that electricity would have to be purchased from the grid. The cost of that power would be
determined by the electrical rate schedule.
Example 11.3 contained a detailed explanation of the procedure used in the ﬁrst-order
assessment procedure, and the results were obtained “by hand.” A more ﬂexible approach is to
use a computational system such as Mathcad to do the calculations. Example 11.4 is structured
about the Mathcad approach to CHP economic assessment.
Example 11.4
Determine the cost savings and simple payback period for the facility discussed in Example
11.3 if 50% of the exhaust energy is recovered. This represents essentially the maximum that
could reasonably be expected to be recovered. Use Mathcad.
Solution
The same procedure would be followed as in Example 11.3 except that the recov­
ered energy ηr would be 0.50 instead of 0.34. The Mathcad worksheet is contained in
Figure 11.10. Variable names in the worksheet are similar to the names in Example 11.3
except that NG is used in place of “natural gas” and EE is the electrical energy. If more
thermal energy is recovered, the savings increase to $403 400 and the simple payback period
falls to 7.4 years.
At a generation efﬁciency of 30%, the natural gas required to generate the electricity is
This is mode D of the narrative for which the electricity is supplied. The natural gas
required is the old plus the new (electricity generation) minus the recovered.

11.5 Thermal and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Combined
Heat and Power Metrics
The percentage metric used in Figures 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 is the thermal efﬁciency; however, a
Btu electrical equivalent is more “useful” than a heat energy Btu, especially at a low temperature.
To account for the difference in usefulness of an electrical equivalent Btu versus a thermal Btu,
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), established several modiﬁed efﬁciency
deﬁnitions. If F is the fuel energy input, P is the useful power output (electricity equivalent in
Btus), and Q is the thermal energy captured, the usual deﬁnition of thermal efﬁciency for a CHP
system is
P  Q
ηthermal 
(11.2)
F
To acknowledge the idea that an electrical equivalent Btu is more valuable than a thermal Btu,
FERC discounts by 50% the thermal energy captured and deﬁnes a modiﬁed thermal efﬁciency
as
ηFERC  P  Q=2
F
(11.3)
The fuel utilization efﬁciency (FUE or ηFU), also called the effective electrical efﬁciency,
expresses the CHP efﬁciency as the ratio of electrical output to net fuel consumption, where
the fuel consumption excludes that portion of the fuel that produces useful thermal energy and
is deﬁned to be
P
ηFU 
(11.4)
F  Q=ηQ
where ηQ is the thermal efﬁciency of producing the thermal energy; ηQ  0:8 for a boiler.
Since CHP fuel savings compared with separate power and thermal energy operations is
appropriate when considering a CHP system, the fractional energy savings S becomes
F
S  1 
(11.5)
P=ηP  Q=ηQ

241
11 Combined Heat and Power Systems
where the denominator expresses the fuel required for separate production of power and
thermal energy, with ηP and ηQ the thermal efﬁciencies of the power and thermal energy devices
respectively.
Example 11.5 provides details of implementing the various deﬁnitions for the CHP example
considered previously in this chapter.
Example 11.5
Determine ηthermal, ηFERC, ηFU, and S for the system of Example 11.4.
Solution
From Example 11.4, the system is operating in mode D in which all the required
electricity is generated but the recovered thermal energy is insufﬁcient to meet the thermal
needs. To generate 17.049 × 106 kWh, the fuel, natural gas, required (ηe  0:3), is 1.939 × 106
ccf, and the recovered thermal energy is 9:699  1010 Btu  9:699  105 ccf. Converting the
electric energy in kilowatt-hours to 100 cubic feet equivalent (for convenience):
3412 Btu
ccf
17:049  106 kWh  3412 

 5:818  105 ccf
kWh
100 000 Btu
These values correspond to P  5:818  105 ccf, F  1:939  106 ccf, and Q  9:699  105 ccf.
The thermal efﬁciency is
P  Q
5:818  105 ccf  9:699  105 ccf

ηthermal 
 0:80
F
1:939  106 ccf
This result should not be surprising, since for ηe  0:30 and ηr  0:50 the sum is 0.80 for a ﬁrst-
order analysis. However, consider ηFERC:
P  Q=2
5:818  105 ccf  1
2  9:699  105 ccf
ηFERC 

 0:55
F
1:939  106 ccf
As expected, ηFERC is less than ηthermal; indeed, since Example 11.4 represents close to the
maximum realistic performance for a CHP system, ηFERC  0:55 represents close to the
maximum FERC efﬁciency a CHP system can attain.
The fuel utilization efﬁciency ηFU becomes (with ηQ  0:85)
P

F  Q=ηQ
And the energy savings S with ηe  0:350 (consistent with the simple-cycle central generating
plant) yields

 0:308
P=ηP  Q=ηQ
Hence, using CHP results in a fuel (natural gas) savings of 30% over a conventional system.
CHP offers thermal and economic advantages, as the following case study indicates.
11.6
Combined Heat and Power System Example
The Mississippi Baptist Medical Center (MBMC) in Jackson, MS, provides a good example of a
CHP system that has a long history of economic success and reliability. Figure 11.11 is a
photograph of the MBMC campus. The MBMC is a 624-bed, full-service hospital with a medical
staff of 500 and 3000 employees. In 1990, in an effort to reduce utility costs, the hospital

242

Figure 11.11 MBMC campus.
investigated the possibility of installing a CHP system, at the time called a co-generation system. 
The energy proﬁle in 1990 was as follows: 
1) large electricity requirement; 
2) large steam requirement; 
3) signiﬁcant price differential per Btu (spark spread) between electricity and gas; 
4) centralized physical plant; and 
5) small daily variations in energy requirements. 
Thus, the MBMC possessed all the attributes to make CHP economically feasible. The results
of a detailed engineering study resulted in the following speciﬁcations and costs estimates for a
CHP system:
1) projected savings of $800 000/year; 
2) initial system cost of $4.2 million; 
3) simple payback of period of 6.3 years; 
4) provide >70% of electricity requirement; 
5) provide 95% of steam required; and 
6) provide 75% of cooling load (via absorption chillers). 
A system schematic is presented in Figure 11.12 and is similar to the layout discussed in
conjunction with Figure 11.5. Since the system was planned to supply about 70% of the
electricity, the facility is normally grid connected. The turbine exhaust is directed to an HRSG
that provides steam for two absorption chillers and sterilization.
The diverter valve (DV), controlled by the HRSG, directs the exhaust gas to the HRSG or out
of the bypass stack to maintain the required steam pressure. The HRSG contains a duct burner
that can be operated in two modes: (1) with a heat addition up to 5.8 × 106 Btu/h to supplement
the turbine exhaust or (2) with up to 41.5 × 106 Btu/h direct ﬁre when the turbine is ofﬂine. The
economizer utilizes the remaining waste heat to preheat boiler feedwater and to add water
treatment chemicals to the feedwater.
Table 11.4 contains descriptive details of MBMC CHP system components.

243
11 Combined Heat and Power Systems
Figure 11.12 MBMC CHP system schematic.
The system went online in 1992 and has been in use since then. Table 11.5 provides a
summary of savings and usage for several years of CHP operation.
The results contained in Table 11.5 demonstrate the expected savings during the initial years
of operation. The system paid back in the projected 6 years. In subsequent years, the savings
from the system were substantial. However, one unexpected beneﬁt was the experience of
MBMC during Hurricane Katrina. After landfall, Katrina’s eye passed close to Jackson and
severely damaged the city’s electrical grid.
The MBMC’s experience during Katrina is illustrated in Figure 11.13. About 1 h after Katrina
impacted the area, the main power grid (MPG) failed. The switchgear shifted to the alternate
electrical feed, and city water pressure was lost. The Jackson Fire Department placed a pumper
truck near the MBMC CHP system and provided water for the duration of the emergency. The
MPG was restored but proved to be unstable. At 5 h into the emergency a decision was made to
shed sufﬁcient load to enable it to disconnect totally from the grid and to use the CHP system as
the only source of electricity. The hospital elevators were switched to the backup diesel
generator, and magnetic resonance imaging use was discontinued. MBMC operated for 52 h
on the CHP system and was literally an island of light and comfort during the emergency.
Approximately 57 h after Hurricane Katrina hit the MPG was restored and normal operation
was initiated. During this unforeseen event, the CHP system demonstrated its “islanding”
capability and its power resiliency.

Because of natural gas supply problems in the Gulf of Mexico due to Katrina, the price of
natural gas spiked at about $15/106 Btu in the months after Katrina. At this rate, electrical power
purchased from the grid was cheaper than using the CHP system, so MBMC used economics to
determine if the grid power or CHP-generated power would be used during periods of excessive
natural gas costs. Once natural gas prices decreased from the post-Katrina high, normal CHP
operation was resumed. However, MBMC continues to exercise its economic option when
natural gas prices exceed an economic maximum. In this fashion, the CHP system provides fuel/
energy diversity.

Two keys to the long-term successful operation of the MBMC CHP system have been
attention to maintenance and staff expertise. Table 11.6 provides details of maintenance
procedures and cost as of the summer of 2007. The monthly maintenance fee includes
replacement components and scheduled inspections. Personnel under contract with Solar
Turbines provide on-site expertise as required.
The lessons learned in the MBMC CHP operation can be summarized as follows:
1) necessity for accurate and consistent monitoring;
2) no-penalty switchover-to-grid electrical rate structure;
3) fuel/energy economic alternatives consideration;
4) comprehensive preventive maintenance program;
5) expertise of power house staff.
The MBMC CHP system is a success story and is an example of how effective CHP systems
can be.
11.7
Closure
CHP is a new version of an old paradigm (co-generation) that offers many economic as well as
other operational advantages. The internet provides considerable information beyond that
presented here. Indications are that CHP will increase in importance in the coming years. CHP
offers greatly improved thermal efﬁciencies and is an alternative use of existing fossil fuel
resources.
Characteristics of installed CHP systems in the USA as of April 2014 were reported by the EPA
in Catalog of CHP Technologies (Darrow et al., 2015). Table 11.7 was generated from those data.
The results are interesting, with a total installed capacity of 83 317 MW in 4226 installations.
However, by percentage, while 52% of the total CHP systems use reciprocating engines, their
combined capacity (2288 MW) represents only 2.7% of the installed CHP capacity. The average
capacity of reciprocating engine CHP systems is only 1 MW. Gas turbines account for 64% of the
installed capacity, with an average installation size of 80 MW. Steam turbines provide 32% of the
capacity, with an average size of 36 MW. Microturbines and fuel cells together provide only 0.2%
of the installed capacity, with average capacities of less than 1 MW. CHP represents about 7% of
the total US installed electrical generating capacity, but about 14% of the installed capacity
devoted to manufacturing.
The USDOE has established a goal of an additional 40 GW of CHP capacity by 2020 (USDOE
and US EPA, 2012). As Figure 11.14 demonstrates, the potential for signiﬁcant additional CHP

capacity in the manufacturing arena certainly exists. Indeed, for the last few years the yearly
installed CHP capacity has been less than 1 GW per year in the USA (Pales et al., 2014). The
general consensus is that restructuring of utility rate schedules and the volatility of energy costs,
especially natural gas, have been primary causes of the small increase in installed capacity.

Biomass 
12.1 Introduction 
Biomass is deﬁned as any material of recent biological origin. Examples include crops and forest 
products and residue associated with crops and forest products, as well as animal fat and food-
processing waste. 
In the pre-twentieth century era (see Figure 1.4), wood, a biomass, was the primary fuel used. 
Biomass as a solid has many disadvantages over liquids (such as petroleum) or gases (such as 
natural gas). The goal of many biomass processes is to convert solid fuel into more useful forms: 
gaseous or liquid fuels. Biomass has received much attention in the media and by political 
leaders, both in relation to alternative fuel sources and as a remedy for the USA’s dependence on 
imported fossil fuels. Biomass is attractive as at least part of a strategy for reducing dependence 
on foreign oil imports because it is domestic, secure, and abundant. Books addressing biomass 
fuel issues include those by Brown (2011), Carareda (2014), Drapcho et al. (2008) and Speight 
(2008). However, Kreith and West (2007) emphatically point out that providing alternative fuel 
sources for transportation is not a long-term solution for fossil-fuel dependence. This chapter 
explores the salient features of biomass and biomass conversion processes. 
Part of the economic impetus for biomass fuels has been the federal subsidies enacted 
supporting production and use of biomass-based fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, both 
of which are discussed in this chapter. The website (http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/ 
fed_summary) maintained by the Alternative Fuels Data Center of the Ofﬁce of Energy 
Efﬁciency & Renewable Energy (EERE) provides a comprehensive compilation of current 
federal laws and incentives. Over the years, these subsidies have included different biofuels 
and have had a chaotic history of expirations, extensions, and retroactive extensions. A good 
example is the ethanol tax credit, ﬁrst enacted more than 30 years ago and long considered to be 
immune to political pressure. However, the ethanol tax credit was allowed to expire on 
December 31, 2011, because of mounting pressures from a number of organizations, the belief 
that the expanding production of ethanol from corn had resulted in increased food prices, and 
the evidence that the ethanol industry had matured. For example, the volumetric ethanol excise 
tax credit was $0.51 per gallon of pure ethanol (minimum 190 proof) blended with gasoline and 
was available to those that produced, sold, or used ethanol in their trade or business. Qualiﬁed 
biodiesel producers or blenders are eligible for an income tax credit of $1.00 per gallon of 
biodiesel (B100) or renewable diesel produced or used in the blending process. The total amount 
of credits claimed by all biodiesel producers may not exceed the annual biodiesel tax credit cap 
of $10 million. For the purpose of this credit, biodiesel must meet ASTM speciﬁcation D6751, 
and renewable diesel is deﬁned as a renewable, biodegradable, non-ester combustible liquid 
derived from biomass resources that meets ASTM speciﬁcation D975. 
Biomass raw materials (feedstocks) exhibit considerable variations in chemical composition 
and cell structure. These features determine the products that can be obtained from biomass

feedstocks as well as the processes and difﬁculties in obtaining useful fuel and other chemicals 
from biomass. Boundy et al. (2011) provides a comprehensive survey of biomass data from 
diverse sources. The statistics and information they present characterize the biomass industry 
from feedstocks to end use. 
Biomass chemical compositions are broadly classed as cellulosic biomass or starch/sugar 
biomass. However, both biomass classes are based on photosynthesis using energy supplied by 
the sun. The basic photosynthesis process utilizes carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to 
produce simple sugars in the presence of solar energy, chlorophyll, and other plant ingredients. 
A representative photosynthesis chemical reaction for the production of glucose (C6H12O6) is  
kJ 
6C O2  6H2O ! C6H12O6  6O2  480 
(12.1) 
mol 
The detailed chemical path to glucose, as represented by Equation 12.1, is quite complicated, but 
the end products are glucose and oxygen. The energy comes from the sun, but as indicated in 
Table 1.3 and as conﬁrmed by Decher (1994), while the local conversion efﬁciency may be as 
high as a few percentage points, the global efﬁciency of photosynthesis may be as low as 0.3%. 
The plants use the sugars of reactions, such as those represented by Equation 12.1, to produce 
the myriad of chemical substances needed for growth and life processes. One of the prime selling 
points of biomass is the potential use of CO2, a greenhouse gas, to produce fuel (energy) and 
oxygen – a win–win situation. 
Indeed, one of the great attractions for biomass is the concept that biomass may be CO2 
neutral. The central concept of a CO2-neutral biomass fuel is that the CO2 generated by 
combustion is balanced by the CO2 incorporated by photosynthesis during the growth process. 
The implication is that the CO2 produced by harvesting and combustion of the biomass is 
completely offset by growth of the biomass. But, as Schobert (2014) and others points out, this 
balance is difﬁcult to achieve because of a myriad of reasons – the most important being the loss 
of CO2 to the soil and the generation of CO2 by fuels required to cultivate, harvest, and process 
biomass. Additionally, the timescale required for the biomass growth can be on the order of 
years to decades, depending on the particular biomass. Another environmental concern with 
burning biomass is that the combustion process produces emissions that may contain a diverse 
variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides, and ash/soot particu­
late matter. 
12.2 Biomass Availability 
The US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) EERE web site (www.eere.energy.gov) contains a wide 
variety of useful information relating to biomass and is a good source of additional, readily 
available, public-domain information on topics presented in this chapter. Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory (ORLN) provides an excellent source of data, updated periodically, in its Biomass
Energy Data Book; the current version is the fourth edition (Boundy et al., 2011). Following 
EERE, a delineation of biomass resources follows: 
1) Agricultural crops – commodity products such as corn, soybeans, and wheat that yield sugar 
and oils. 
2) Agricultural crop residues – residues (such as stalks and leaves) of agricultural crops that are 
not harvested for commercial use. Corn stover is the stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs of corn, 
for example. 
3) Herbaceous energy crops – perennials that are harvested annually after reaching maturity. 
These are grasses such as switchgrass, miscanthus, bamboo, and fescue. 

251 
12 Biomass
4) Woody energy crops – hardwood trees harvested within 5–7 years of planting. Examples are 
poplar, willow, maple, cottonwood, and sweetgum. 
5) Forestry residues – biomass not harvested or removed during logging, and materials 
removed during forest management operations. 
6) Aquatic crops – aquatic biomass such a kelp, seaweed, and algae. 
7) Industrial crops – crops developed to produce speciﬁc chemicals or feedstocks. Kenaf is an 
example. 
8) Animal waste – waste resulting from farm and processing operations. 
9) Municipal waste – waste from residential, commercial, and industrial sectors contains 
signiﬁcant biomass with energy content. 
Figure 12.1 provides a breakdown of the sources of biomass. The sources include biomass 
from forest lands and agricultural lands as well as secondary sources from municipal solid waste, 
animal manure, and residues from food processing. 
Much of the USA is well suited for the production of herbaceous and woody energy crops in 
addition to agricultural crops. Figure 12.2a illustrates by region the energy crops that are 
particularly suited for that region. Thus, most of the USA, except for the mountain and desert 
southwest, could produce biomass feedstock. Figure 12.2b indicates the biomass production 
potential for the USA. There are few surprises in Figure 12.2). The production potential tracks 
the agricultural production patterns in the USA. The question of availability of biomass was 
initially answered by a 2005 study jointly sponsored by the US Departments of Agriculture and 
Energy (Perlack et al., 2005). This report has become known as the “billion-ton report” because 
the authors conclude that land resources are sufﬁcient to sustain a biomass budget of 1 billion 
tons/year – enough biomass to displace 30% of the fossil fuels used for transportation. 
Moreover, Perlack et al. (2005) suggest that an increase to more than 1.3 billion tons/year Figure depicts a breakdown of the sources of biomass. The sources include biomass from forest lands and agricultural lands as well as secondary sources from municipal solid waste, animal manure, and residues from food processing.

is possible with relatively modest changes in agricultural and forestry practices. They projected a 
total of 1.366 billion tons/year with 998 million tons/year from agricultural resources and 368 
million tons/year from forestry resources. In 2011, the DOE issued an update to the “billion-ton 
report,” U.S. Billion-Ton Update: Biomass Supply for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry
(Perlack and Stokes, 2011). The update is more comprehensive and rigorous than the 2005 
version, and the focus is shifted from a strategic assessment to a comprehensive resource 
assessment. Nonetheless, the conclusions of the original and updated reports are congruent.

Figure 12.3 Biomass feedstock source distribution: (a) 2012 biomass usage; (b) 2012 biomass usage and
potential.
The update conﬁrms the baseline expectation of 1 billion tons biomass resource by 2020 is still 
valid, and a 2–4% high-yield option could result in as much as 1600 tons by 2020. 
The results of data in the Biomass Energy Data Book (Boundy et al., 2011) were used to 
construct Figure 12.3. In 2012, forest resources accounted for 60% of the actual usage with the 
remaining 40% supplied by agricultural resources. However, as Figure 12.3b demonstrates, 55% 
of biomass resources were not utilized. 
12.3 Biomass Fundamentals 
The primary products of interest from biomass processing are as follows: 
1) Liquid fuels: 
a) ethanol – ethyl alcohol for use as a fuel; 
b) methanol – methyl alcohol produced as a by-product of gaseous fuels; 
c) biodiesel – chemically modiﬁed vegetable oils suitable for diesel fuel; 
d) vegetable oil – oils contained in grains and seed; 
e) pyrolysis oil – a liquid fuel with a heating value of 17–20 MJ/kg. 
2) Gaseous fuels: 
a) biogas – a mixture of methane (CH4) and CO2, 55–70% CH4 by volume; 
b) producer gas – ﬂammable gas mixture containing carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen 
(H2), CH4, nitrogen (N2), CO2, and higher hydrates; 
c) synthesis gas – a mixture of CO and H2. 
Each of the possible biomass fuels will be examined in Section 12.5.

The US DOE has classiﬁed biomass feedstock to fuels or other products in terms of platform. 
The two primary platforms for biomass and their relationships to feedstocks, processes, and 
fuels/products are illustrated in Figure 12.4. The primary platforms of interest for this discussion 
are the sugar (or biochemical) and the syngas (thermochemical) platforms. Biomass feedstocks 
are used in both platforms, with the primary output being fuels and chemicals. However, for 
both platforms fuels can be used in combined heat and power (CHP) applications. CHP systems 
are discussed in Chapter 11. 
Biomass and biomass for fuel conversion are intimately involved with chemistry. To establish 
a uniform basis, the deﬁnitions listed in Tables 12.1 and 12.2 are introduced.

Carbohydrates 
Compounds that include sugars, starches, cellulose, and a wide variety of other cellular  
products. The name carbohydrates arose because many of these compounds have the 
formula Cn(H2O)m (where m and n are integers) – apparently making them a “hydrate of 
carbon,” although this description was later found to be inaccurate.

12.4 Biomass Characteristics 
Three types of chemical descriptions are used to describe the attributes of biomass: biochemical, 
proximate, and ultimate. Biochemical analysis describes an organic compound in terms of 
proteins, oils, sugars, and ﬁber (lignocellulose). For cellulosic materials, the breakdown of 
lignocellulose into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin is important in formulating speciﬁc 
processes for extracting useful fuel and other products. Proximate analysis breaks a compound 
into its constituents of volatiles, ash, and ﬁxed carbon. Volatile material is the faction that can be 
decomposed by heat (∼400 °C) in a nonoxidizing surrounding. Ultimate analysis, as its name 
implies, yields components including the elements (C, H, O, N, S, and Cl), moisture, and ash. All 
three are useful in understanding biomass processes. Table 12.3 illustrates biochemical analysis 
of some common biomass feedstocks. The feedstocks are divided into those that are food based 
and those that are lignocellulose based. Table 12.4 shows proximate analysis of feedstocks, and 
Table 12.5 presents results of ultimate analyses for most of the feedstocks listed in Table 12.4. 
A wide range of liquid and gaseous fuels can be obtained from biomass. Biomass-derived fuels 
may be used directly in some internal combustion engines, may be used for process energy, or 
may be further processed into more desirable fuels or chemical feedstocks. Section 12.5 
examines the characteristics of a number of biomass-based fuels and products.

heating value of ethanol as a fuel is typically quoted as 101 000 Btu/gal, about three-fourths of 
the value of gasoline (on a volumetric basis). Thus, a motor vehicle that possesses a gas mileage 
of 24 miles/gal of gasoline would likely have an ethanol mileage of 18 miles/gal. 
Ethanol is used to improve the octane rating and emission characteristics of gasoline and is 
commonly used as a 10% blend in “gasohol” called E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline). The 
highest blend, E85, contains 85% ethanol and is used in ﬂex fuel vehicles. Most (about 90%) of 
the ethanol in the USA is produced by fermentation of corn or other biomass feedstocks. The 
remaining, called synthetic ethanol, is produced from ethylene, a petroleum by-product, and is 
used mostly in industrial applications. Ethylene is one of the most highly produced organic 
chemical and is important as an industrial feedstock. However, the extensive production of 
ethanol from petroleum-based ethylene would not alleviate the dependence on imported 
fossil fuels. 
The feedstock for fermentation to produce ethanol must be high in sugars. Sugar cane, sugar 
beets, and sorghum all contain high levels of suitable sugars. Sugar beets are the basis for the fuel 
ethanol industry in Brazil. A variety of carbohydrates (starches, hemicellulose, and cellulose) can 
also serve as feedstock if the carbohydrates can be broken down into sugars capable of 
undergoing fermentation. Corn, which is high in starches, has been the basis of the US ethanol 
industry for more than two decades. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to 
fermentable sugar compounds, but the process is more difﬁcult than for starches. 
Ethanol produced from grains, such as corn, starts as a water-based slurry. After the starches 
are converted into sugars, the sugars are fermented into ethanol. In the fermentation process, 
the enzymes produced by yeast or other microorganisms decompose the sugars into ethanol and 
CO2. For the production of ethanol from glucose, C6H12O6, the chemical reaction is 
C6H12O6 ! 2C2H5OH  2CO2 
(12.2)

12 Biomass
Although grain is the leading feedstock for ethanol production in the USA, signiﬁcant 
replacement of gasoline by grain-based ethanol poses severe problems. Availability is a 
primary limitation. If all the corn in the USA were used to produce ethanol, the ethanol 
produced would only replace about 10% of the gasoline (Schobert, 2014). Hence, for close to 
100% replacement of gasoline by ethanol, the production of corn would have to increase 
10-fold. Given the amount of cultivatable land in the USA, such an increase is not possible. 
Moreover, widespread utilization of corn grain for ethanol would mean diverting a primary 
food stock to a nonfood use. Because of these limitations, ethanol from corn cannot be 
viewed as a solution to foreign oil dependence. However, the use of other biomass feedstocks 
for ethanol production, especially the use of cellulosic feedstock, offers signiﬁcant long-term 
potential. Indeed, the US DOE has announced a biofuels initiative with the goal of reducing 
the cost of cellulosic-based ethanol. Because of this potential, further examination of 
cellulosic ethanol is warranted. 
The conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol involves the three primary polymers 
(cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) that make up the cell walls of a plant. Depending on 
the plant, a cell wall typically consists of 35–50% cellulose, 20–25% hemicellulose, and 10–25% 
lignin. Cellulose is the most abundant biomass on Earth (http://genomicscience.energy.gov/ 
research/DOEUSDA/)! From a biochemical standpoint, cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose 
residues. Hemicellulose is a branched sugar polymer formed mostly of ﬁve-carbon sugars 
(pentose) with some six-carbon sugars (hexose). Lignin is complex, cross-linked polymer that is 
covalently bonded to hemicellulose. These three polymers impart strength to mature cell walls, 
and this strength is part of the reason cellulosic biomass is difﬁcult to break down into its 
component sugar compounds. The process of breaking down the cellulosic biomass in order to 
extract the sugars is called hydrolysis. The long-term, conventional process is acid hydrolysis, 
but the biochemical hydrolysis process is thought to have the potential to convert cellulosic 
biomass in quantities sufﬁcient to replace a signiﬁcant amount of gasoline with ethanol. 
The biochemical hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass is a complex process requiring a detailed 
understanding of the roles of various enzymes in degrading the cell structure into sugars. The 
web site http://www.doegenomestolife.org/biofuels/ and Himmel (2008) are excellent sources 
of additional information and details on cellulosic biomass. Fundamentally, the enzymatic 
biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass consists of three steps: (1) pretreatment to make 
the complex polymers more accessible to enzymatic breakdown, (2) the use of appropriate 
enzymes to hydrolyze the plant cell walls polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) into 
sugars, and (3) fermentation to convert the sugars into ethanol. Figure 12.6, taken from the Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory web site, provides a block diagram for the production of ethanol 
from cellulosic biomass and is indicative of the relative complexity of the process. Figure 12.7 
illustrates how a cellulosic ethanol facility, with the three steps indicated, might appear. 
An issue of concern with grain-based ethanol is the ratio of the energy per gallon of ethanol to 
the energy required to produce a gallon of ethanol – the energy balance. If the ratio is greater 
than unity, then the ethanol saves energy; if the ratio is less than unity, then ethanol production 
consumes more energy than is available in the ﬁnal product. Not surprisingly, various groups, 
agencies, and individuals are arrayed on opposite sides of the question. The US DOE, for 
example, is a strong advocate that ethanol does save energy. Kreith (2007) accepts that the ratio 
of ethanol energy content (higher heating value) to the nonrenewable energy input for 
production is 1.25, but he is a strong advocate of cellulosic-based ethanol with a ratio of about 
5. Tidwell and Weir (1986) also concur with Kreith, especially if the fuel used for distillation is 
part of a waste stream. Schobert (2014) recognizes that the energy balance for ethanol might be 
negative. Pimental, in a series of paper, articles, and interviews (e.g., Pimental, 2003), has 
maintained that the ethanol takes more energy to produce than it provides. A 2010 report from 
the US DOE (Shapouri et al., 2010), based on 2008 data from a number of ethanol facilities,

It starts with size reduction of cellulosic biomass to form ethanol via pretreatment, detoxification and neutralization, solid and liquid separation, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation of cellulosic sugars, and product recovery. In the process, enzymatic hydrolysis is also formed by solid and liquid separation via enzyme production; and product recovery can be done from solid and liquid separation via fermentation of hemicellulosic sugars. Coproducts are formed from product recovery process via residue processing.

concludes that the ethanol energy ratio (energy from a gallon of ethanol/energy required to 
produce a gallon of ethanol) is signiﬁcantly greater than unity in energy-efﬁcient facilities. They 
state that ethanol production has made the transition from an energy sink, to a moderate energy 
ratio in the 1990s, to a substantial energy ratio at the present. One of the great attractions for 
cellulosic-based ethanol is that cellulosic ethanol requires much less hydrocarbon energy in the A pictorial representation of a cellulosic biomass facility in five steps: (1) biomass is harvested and delivered to biorefinery; (2) biomass is cut into shreds and preheated with heat and chemicals to make cellulose accessible to enzymes; (3) enzymes break down cellulose chains into sugars; (4) microbes ferment sugars into ethanol; (5) ethanol is purified through distillation and prepared for distribution.

growing, harvesting, and producing. In comparison with conventional gasoline, ethanol 
produces less emissions (NOx, SOx, soot, and CO2). 
12.5.2
Methanol
Methanol (CH3OH), also called wood alcohol, can be used as a fuel in modiﬁed internal 
combustion engines. The heating value of methanol as a fuel is nominally taken as 
76 000 Btu/gal, only about 58% of the value of gasoline (on a volumetric basis). Thus, a motor 
vehicle that possesses a gas mileage of 24 miles/gal of gasoline would likely have a methanol 
mileage of about 14 miles/gal. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), that use methanol without 
reforming, were discussed in Chapter 10. 
Most methanol produced in the USA is based on natural gas as the feedstock. The production 
of methanol from natural gas involves three chemical processes. First, natural gas (primarily 
CH4) reacts with steam to produce synthesis gas (CO and H2) according to 
CH4  H2O ! CO  3H2 
(12.3) 
In the second step, the synthesis gas is combined with CO2 to alter the ratio of H2 and CO in the 
fashion 
H2  CO2 ! H2O  CO 
(12.4) 
For the third step of the process, CO and water, in the presence of a catalyst, is used to produce 
methanol: 
CO  2H2O ! CH3OH 
(12.5) 
While production of methanol from natural gas only increases the need for natural gas, an 
important observation of the three-step process is that only step 1, the production of synthesis 
gas, involves natural gas. Synthesis gas can also be produced from a variety of carbonaceous 
biomass feedstocks, as well as coal. Thus, large-scale production of methanol does not have to be 
dependent on natural gas. Because of its importance, synthesis gas is covered as a separate topic 
in Section 12.5.7. 
Methanol has many advantages over conventional gasoline: the methanol–air ﬂame temper­
ature is lower than that for gasoline, so that NOx production would be decreased; methanol 
produces no SOx, and methanol would limit soot and CO2 emissions. As for drawbacks, in 
addition to the lower energy density, methanol presents severe health hazards if ingested or 
absorbed, and it is soluble in water. Also, since methanol burns with a nearly colorless ﬂame, 
accidental ignitions could be hard to see. 
12.5.3
Biodiesel/Vegetable Oil
By deﬁnition, biodiesel is a fuel composed of fatty acid alkyl esters and is made from feedstocks 
such as vegetable oils or animal fats. This is not a particularly useful deﬁnition for non-chemical 
engineers, so additional discussion is needed. A plethora of oils can be extracted from seeds, 
nuts, and other plant parts. Additionally, recycled cooking oil and animal fats are sources of 
biodiesel feedstocks. Examples include corn oil, linseed oil, olive oil, soybean oil, and sunﬂower 
oil. Although these, and similar, plant oils can be used as a fuel in diesel engines, the direct use of 
plant oils in diesel engines shortens operating life and leads to engine maintenance issues. 
Additionally, plant oils have a higher viscosity (by a factor as much as 20) than diesel fuel and 
have a lower cetane number, which is a performance metric. Schobert (2014) states that the 
expected 10 000 h between engine overhauls can be reduced to as little as 600 h for sunﬂower oil 
operation or 100 h for operation on linseed oil. If, however, plant oil is reacted with methanol,

the resulting methyl ester product is a generic biodiesel. The generic chemical reaction is

A speciﬁc example for a slightly simpliﬁed composition for olive oil, from Schobert (2014), is

(12.7) 
where C17H33CO2 is the fatty acid component of olive oil. This chemical procedure is called 
transesteriﬁcation. The resulting methyl ester is a biodiesel fuel that possesses characteristics 
much closer to those of conventional diesel fuel than the original plant oil. As van Gerpen et al. 
(2004) point out, 100 lb of oil and 10 lb of methanol input into a transesteriﬁcation reaction will 
yield about 100 lb of biodiesel and 10 lb of glycerol. 
Example 12.2
Verify that the transesteriﬁcation reaction of olive oil agrees with the assertion of van Gerpen 
et al. (2004) about biodiesel yields. 
Solution
Equation 12.7 represents the reaction. The molecular masses for C, H, O, and OH 
are given in the solution to Example 12.1.

Thus, the assertion is substantially correct. Moreover, since most plant oils have similar 
(large) molecular masses and since the transesteriﬁcation process involves changes of a few 
atoms, the generalization of van Gerpen et al. (2004) is likely to be an appropriate rule of 
thumb for most biodiesel transesteriﬁcation reactions. 

263 
12 Biomass
Biodiesel has a viscosity comparable to that of conventional diesel fuel and cetane number of 
about 50. Moreover, operating experience with biodiesel suggests that biodiesel provides for a 
much longer time between overhauls than operating with plant oils. It also burns cleaner than 
conventional diesel fuel and signiﬁcantly reduces emissions of CO, unburned and aromatic 
hydrocarbons, and sulfates as well as particulate matter. Biodiesel is compatible with most 
emission control technologies. Blends of up to 20% biodiesel with conventional fuel can be used 
without any engine or infrastructure (storage and distribution) modiﬁcations. Similar to the 
practice for ethanol, biodiesel blends are labeled with a B followed by the percentage of biodiesel; 
B20, a commonly used blend, consists of 20% biodiesel. B5, B10, and B20 are the usual biodiesel 
blends. Tyson et al. (2004) estimate that sufﬁcient biomass feedstock exists to supply 1.9 billion 
barrels of biodiesel, about 5% of the on-road use of conventional diesel fuel. Biodiesel that is 
classiﬁed as fuel grade must be produced in compliance with ASTM D6751. Unprocessed 
vegetable oil does not meet biodiesel speciﬁcations and is not a legal motor fuel (www.eere. 
energy.gov/RE/bio_fuels.html). 
The three basic process for producing biodiesel are 
1) base-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation;  
2) direct acid-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation;  
3) conversion of the oil to its fatty acids and then to biodiesel.  
Base-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation, is the most prevalent and possesses the following 
advantages: 
1) The process occurs at low temperature and pressure.  
2) The conversion efﬁciency is high (98%).  
3) The process involves minimal side reactions.  
4) The conversion to biodiesel is direct with no intermediate compounds.  
5) No special materials are needed in the reactor.  
Since biodiesel can be made from a wide variety of plant oils and animal fats, the physical 
properties of biodiesel have some variation. Generally accepted values (http://biodiesel.org/ 
docs/using-hotline/nrel-handling-and-use.pdf?sfvrsn=4) are presented in Table 12.6. 
12.5.4
Pyrolysis liquids
Pyrolysis is deﬁned as the thermal decomposition of organic compounds in the absence of 
oxygen. Charcoal is a simple example of pyrolysis that results when wood is heated to about 
250 °C and the moisture and volatile products are driven off by the heat. The resulting product 
has a very high carbon content. Pyrolysis is an endothermic reaction that results in the 
degradation of solid fuels into a variety of gases, organic vapors, and liquids. In contrast, 
combustion is an exothermic reaction that involves the rapid oxidation of fuel with a large 
release of heat. 
The product stream from pyrolysis depends on the rate and duration of heating. In the 
production of oil using fast pyrolysis, cellulosic biomass feedstock is ground to a ﬁne power that

is heated for a short period of time (<0.5 s) to 400–600 °C and then rapidly quenched. Rapid 
quenching is necessary in order to prevent high-molecular-weight liquids from decomposing 
into lower-molecular-weight gases. Liquids from fast pyrolysis processes have a low viscosity 
and are dark brown in appearance. Pyrolysis liquids are highly oxygenated, complex mixtures of 
hydrocarbons that contain signiﬁcant amounts of water. Such liquids are highly unstable and 
highly corrosive (low pH). Because of the corrosive nature of pyrolysis liquids, storage is difﬁcult, 
and the high oxygen and water content makes them incompatible with conventional hydro­
carbon fuels. Hence, conversion of pyrolysis liquids into more conventional hydrocarbon fuels is 
desirable, although pyrolysis liquids can be used in place of heavy fuel oils such as bunker C. 
12.5.5
Biogas
Biogas is a mixture of CH4 and CO2, typically 50–80% CH4 and 50–20% CO2 by volume, with 
traces of H2, CO, and N2. The International Energy Agency offers a compact examination of 
biogas production and utilization (IEA Bioenergy, 2005). Biogas is the ﬁnal product of anaerobic 
digestion of organic waste, such as animal manure and food processing waste. Anaerobic 
digestion is the decomposition of such wastes into gaseous fuels by the action of bacteria in an 
oxygen-free environment. A detailed presentation of anaerobic digestion topics is offered by 
Chynoweth and Isaacson (2004). Biogas differs from natural gas in that natural gas is composed 
of more than 70% CH4, with the remaining constituents being other hydrocarbons. Biogas is also 
called swamp gas, landﬁll gas, or digester gas. Although the biological processes that result in 
biogas are relatively complex, anaerobic digestion systems are relatively simple. Biogas is 
produced in stages by different types of bacteria that break down the complex organic 
compounds. The following four stages, with the associated bacteria function, form the generally 
accepted path from organic waste to biogas: (1) hydrolytic bacteria break down the waste into 
sugars and amino acids; (2) fermentative bacteria convert the sugars and amino acids into 
organic acids; (3) acidogenic bacteria convert the organic acids into H2, CO2, and acetate; and (4) 
methanogenic (CH4-forming) bacteria produce biogas from the acetic acid, H2, and CO2. 
Anaerobic digestion takes place in an airtight chamber called a digester. Digesters may operate 
in batch mode or in continuous mode. Continuous digesters produce a steady stream of biogas 
and are typically associated with large-scale operation. The digestion process is temperature 
sensitive; a temperature of at least 68 °F is required, but temperatures as high as 150 °F are 
possible. The higher the temperature, the shorter the process time and smaller the digester 
volume, but high-temperature digesters are more difﬁcult to operate and maintain and require 
close monitoring. Boyle (2004) states that a typical anaerobic digester can produce 200–400 m3 
of biogas, with a 50–75% CH4 content, per tonne of feedstock. A typical anaerobic digester 
consists of a pre-mixing tank, a digester vessel, a system that uses the biogas, and a means of 
spreading or distributing the digested efﬂuent. Figure 12.8 presents a schematic of a typical 
batch anaerobic digester. In many instances the “system” is an engine–generator set. The dotted 
line from the system to the digester represents an energy stream directed from the system to the 
digester to maintain digester temperature. 
The Alberta (Canada) Agriculture and Rural Development Agency is heavily involved in 
promoting anaerobic digesters for agricultural waste. Figure 12.9, taken from the agency’s 
website, is an example of an anaerobic digester system that utilizes manure and provides the 
potential for biogas use on-site in a cogeneration arrangement as well as for upgrading to natural 
gas for pipeline connection. Additionally, concentrated nutrients and water from the efﬂuents 
are provided. The CO2 and water must be removed, leaving mostly CH4, if biogas is to be 
upgraded to natural gas and fed to the pipeline.

biogas, which is used to run two grid-connected 200 kW engine-driven generators.

CH4, N2, CO2, and higher hydrates and is made from gasiﬁcation of wood or coal. Producer gas

can be burned directly or used as a feedstock for liquid fuels. The conversion of biomass to 
producer gas is often called thermal gasiﬁcation. Thermal gasiﬁcation is the partial oxidation of 
a solid fuel, such as a solid biomass, at elevated temperatures into a ﬂammable gas mixture called 
producer gas. As Boyle (2004) points out, all gasiﬁcation processes involve interacting steam and 
oxygen with a solid feedstock. The producer gas contains varying percentages of H2, CO, CH4, 
and CO2 as well as smaller quantities of higher hydrates; the speciﬁc chemical constituents are 
determined by the temperature to which the biomass is heated, the composition of the biomass 
feedstock, and the gasiﬁer layout. Table 12.7 shows the varying composition of producer gas. 
Brown (2011) presents a compact, lucid description of thermochemical biomass technologies, 
including gasiﬁcation. He describes thermal gasiﬁcation as a multistep process involving heating 
and drying, pyrolysis, solid–gas reactions that consume char, and gas-phase reactions that 
determine the ﬁnal composition of the producer gas. At about 100 °C, moisture is driven out by 
heating and drying. Other authors (e.g., Goswami et al., 2000) view thermal gasiﬁcation as a 
combination of combustion and pyrolysis. (The distinction between combustion and pyrolysis 
were discussed previously in Section 12.5.4.) Since pyrolysis is an endothermic process, energy is 
required for pyrolysis to proceed, and combustion (by means of the addition of oxygen or air to 
the gasiﬁer) is only to the extent necessary to produce energy for pyrolysis. At about 400 °C, the 
biomass begins to break down into gases, vapors, and liquids. Only char, a porous solid 
containing carbon and ash, remains. Some idea of the percentage composition of products from 
pyrolysis can be obtained from the proximate analysis of the biomass feedstock (see Table 12.4). 
The volatile content is approximately equal to the pyrolysis yield, and the carbon and ash 
percentages are roughly equal to the char. At about 700 °C, the char begins to react with any 
oxygen as well as CO2 and water vapor to produce additional ﬂammable gases. Gasiﬁcation 
involves a number of different chemical reactions. Table 12.8 presents a summary of the 
important reactions associated with biomass gasiﬁcation.

The arrows in the reactions of Table 12.8 indicate that the gasiﬁcation reactions can proceed 
in either direction depending on the fuel, oxygen, and steam added to the gasiﬁer as well as the 
temperature and pressure. Low temperatures and high pressures favor the formation of CH4, 
while high temperatures and low pressures favor the formation of H2 and CO. 
In addition to producer gas, tars (viscous, liquid high-molecular-weight compounds) and 
particulate matter are likely to be in the gasiﬁer output streams. Thus, most gasiﬁers include 
processes for gas cleaning. The thermodynamic efﬁciency of gasiﬁers varies widely depending 
on the type and operating conditions. Gasiﬁers that can harvest more than 90% of the chemical 
energy of the biomass feedstock are possible but are expensive. Most gasiﬁers harvest between 
70 and 80% of the available energy in the feedstock. 
12.5.7
Synthesis Gas
Synthesis gas, or syngas, is a mixture of CO and H2 and can be produced by a gasiﬁcation process 
using oxygen rather than air. The oxygen requirement for syngas production is about one-third 
of the oxygen required for complete combustion. Synthesis gas is so named because, in addition 
to being a useful, high-energy fuel, it can also be used as the feedstock for synthesis of many 
useful chemicals. The chemistry of the production and use of syngas from natural gas, coal, and 
heavy oil fractions has been well known for more than a century. Reyes et al. (2003) provide a 
historical perspective on the production of syngas from non-biomass sources and review 
technological advances in the production of syngas from traditional feedstocks. In recent years, 
the production of syngas from biomass resources has received much attention as at least a 
partial solution to the energy needs of the many countries, including the USA. Spath and Dayton 
(2003) assess the potential for biomass-derived syngas in the USA, and Cobb (2007) includes a 
survey of biomass gasiﬁcation facilities in the USA. The National Energy Technology Laboratory 
provides a database of gasiﬁcation plants in the USA at http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/ 
energy-systems/gasiﬁcation/gasiﬁcation-plant-databases. Worley and Yale (2012) summarize 
the equipment, general arrangement of the equipment, operating characteristics and operating 
severity for each gasiﬁcation technology. 
Syngas is used via the Fischer–Tropsch process to produce a wide range of hydrocarbon 
products, typically in liquid form. Documents related to the history and development of the 
Fischer–Tropsch process are archived in electronic form at www.ﬁscher-tropsch.org. This web 
site is unusual, but its existence points out the importance of the process in hydrocarbon 
chemical engineering. De Klerk (2011) has been well received as a book devoted to details of the 
Fischer–Tropsch process. Fischer–Tropsch synthesis takes place at low temperature 
(200–240 °C) or high temperature (300–350 °C) with iron or cobalt serving as catalyst in 
reactors that operate at pressures ranging from 10 to 40 atm (Spath and Dayton, 2003). The 
most common hydrocarbons synthesized using the Fischer–Tropsch process are listed in 
Table 12.9. In the ﬁrst reaction in Table 12.9, �CH2� indicates methyl species that can serve as 
initiators for chain growth via sequential addition of �CH2�. Depending on the ratio of CO to 
H2, a wide range of hydrocarbons can result from the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Parafﬁns are 
alkane hydrocarbons and have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2. For 20 < n < 40 
parafﬁns are solid and waxy, as suggested by the name. Octane, C8H18, is an example of a 
parafﬁn. Oleﬁns are alkene hydrocarbons; an example is propene, C3H6. Two characteristics of 
such syntheses are (1) the unavoidable production of a wide range of hydrocarbon products and 
(2) the liberation of signiﬁcant amounts of heat from the exothermic synthesis reactions. The 
distribution of the products is determined by temperature, pressure, CO/H2 ratio, and catalyst 
(type and composition). Products generated by the Fischer–Tropsch process must generally 
undergo upgrading procedures that result in product separation, concentration, and tailoring. 
The upgrading procedures generally involve further chemical reactions.

A summary of the reactants and products for each of the reactions is presented is 
Table 12.10. The variety of Fischer–Tropsch possible products is illustrated by these results. 
The ratio of CO to H2 is the same for some reactions, but the products are different. The 
products are different for reactions with different CO to H2 ratios – hence the ﬁrst 
characteristic of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, relating to the unavoidable production of a wide 
range of hydrocarbon products. 
Although not strictly a process with biomass feedstock, a proposal by Uhrig et al. (2007) 
utilizes CO2 from fossil-fuel-ﬁred power plants in conjunction with hydrogen from non-fossil 
fuel sources and the Frischer–Tropsch process to produce synthetic fuels for motor vehicles. In 
this process the feedstocks are CO2 and water; electrolysis is used to produce hydrogen from the 
water. The “reverse” water shift reaction (Table 12.8) is used for production of CO from CO2 
and water, followed by the Fischer–Tropsch reaction to produce CH2 – the fundamental 
building block for hydrocarbon synthetic fuels.

Biopower and Biofuels Statistics
The 2013 Renewable Energy Data Book (Esterly and Gelman, 2014) provides some interesting data 
on biopower and biofuels for 2013. The biopower data will be examined ﬁrst. The Data Book
summarizes three important facts about 2013: (1) biopower electricity generation accounted for 
11% of all renewable energy generated in the USA, (2) biopower electricity comes primarily from 
wood and agricultural residues that are burned as fuel in the industrial sector, and (3) the installed 
biopower electricity capacity grew at an annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2007 to 2013. 
Figure 12.10 shows the annual generation in gigawatt-hours and installed megawatt capacity 
from 2000 to 2013. The growth in installed capacity is steady, if not spectacular. 
Ethanol and biodiesel statistics will be examined next. For ethanol, NREL Data Book (Esterly 
and Gelman, 2014) provides the following 2013 highlights: (1) ethanol production was 
13 300 × 106 gal, (2) between 2000 and 2013 corn-based ethanol production increased by a 
factor of 8, (3) the USA produced 57% of the world’s ethanol (Brazil produced 27%), and (4) the 
ﬁrst commercial cellulosic plant in the USA started operation. The 2013 highlights for biodiesel 
are (1) USA biodiesel production was 1.8 × 109 gal (up 63% from 2012) or 360 times biodiesel 
production in 2000, (2) the USA led the world in biodiesel production, and (3) worldwide 
biodiesel production increased by 17% from 2012. A useful approach is to display ethanol prices 
and production side by side with biodiesel prices and production. Table 12.11 is such an 
arrangement; for both ethanol and biodiesel, the prices are “gasoline gallon equivalent basis,”
since the heating values for ethanol and biodiesel on a per gallon basis are different from 
gasoline. Using the gasoline gallon equivalent basis accounts for the differences in the heating 
values. On an energy basis, both ethanol and biodiesel are more expensive than gasoline. In 
recent years, on a gasoline equivalent basis, biodiesel is marginally cheaper than ethanol. In 
2013, seven times as much ethanol was produced than biodiesel. 
12.6 Municipal Solid Waste 
Because of its high percentage content of organic materials, municipal solid waste (MSW) is 
often classed as a biomass feedstock source. MSW is trash or garbage that is usually thrown away

from households, and does not include industrial, hazardous, or construction waste. The 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a yearly compilation of MSW information 
that addresses MSW generation, composition, and disposal. Prior to 2015, the yearly compila­
tions were titled Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United
States: Facts and Figures; in 2015 the series was renamed Advancing Sustainable Materials
Management: Facts and Figures. Additionally, historical data on MSW are presented in the 
reports so that trends can be ascertained. Most of the ﬁrst portion of this section was abstracted 
from the Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures 2013 (EPA, 2015). 
Consider the following statistics. 
Figure 12.11 presents the US total MSW (in millions of tons) generated per year and the per 
capita generation (pounds per person per day) from 1960 through 2013. In the 53 years 
represented by Figure 12.11, the total MSW generation rate increased by 188% while the 
population increased by 73%! On a per capita basis, the increase was 64%. About the only 
positive comment that can be made about the information in the ﬁgure is that since 2000 the per 
capita generation rate has decreased slightly to 4.40 lb/(person day). Figure 12.11 illustrates in a 
rather dramatic fashion the “disposal” nature of the economy of the USAs. 
Two questions are germane: (1) What is the composition of MSW? (2)What happens to 
MSW? Figure 12.12 is a pie chart showing the composition of MSW for 2013. The EPA deﬁnes 
MSW as being composed of yard trimmings, wood, plastics, metals, glass, paper, food scraps, 
rubber/leather/textiles, and other. Paper at 27% (by weight) is by far the largest category, 
followed by food scraps, yard trimmings, and plastics, each at 12–14%. The remaining categories 
are between 5 and 9%. Plastics, glass, and metals are non-biomass components in MSW. Later in 
this section, the biomass versus non-biomass composition of MSW is examined in more detail.

Table 12.12, with the results expressed in millions of tons, addresses the second question: 
what happens to MSW? The EPA compiles information on MSW recovered for recycling, 
recovered for composting, combusted with energy recovery, and discarded to landﬁlls. The good 
news is that while the generation rate has remained nearly constant since 2000, the amount 
recovered for recycling, the total composted, and the amount of materials recovered have all

increased. The MSW combusted in facilities producing energy has increased slightly since 1990, 
reﬂecting the increasing cost of such facilities, the more stringent emissions requirements, and 
the increase in permitting difﬁculties. 
While landﬁlling has long been the usual solution for disposal of MSW, landﬁlling possesses 
difﬁculties such as availability, siting, costs, transportation, efﬂuent generation, and capacity. 
The number of available landﬁlls in the USA has decreased from 7924 in 1988 to 1967 in 2000 to 
1908 in 2013 (EPA, 2015). One way to reduce the landﬁll volume is incineration – burning MSW 
at high temperatures. Incineration decreases the volume of MSW to 10–12% of the original for 
“typical” MSW, allowing existing landﬁlls to last longer. 
The discussion focuses on facilities that combust MSW and produce useful energy – waste-to­
energy (WTE) facilities. Such facilities use the energy from the MSW to make steam that is used 
in district heating and cooling systems or to power a generator to produce electricity for the grid. 
In 2013, the EPA identiﬁed 86 WTEs in the USA with a waste handling capacity of 95 253 tons/ 
day. The 2016 ERC Directory of Waste-to-Energy Facilities (Michaels and Shiang, 2016) contains 
a list and characteristics of all WTE facilities in the USA, along with extensive statistical 
information relating to WTE technologies. Many of the developed countries make more 
extensive use of MSW than the USA. Most of the countries of western Europe, for example, 
have extensive WTE facilities and programs. The internet is an excellent source of detailed 
information about WTE facilities. The primary purpose of a WTE facility is to reduce the 
volume of solid waste with minimum adverse impact on the environment. The energy captured 
is secondary, but important especially as a selling point for local governments with both solid 
waste disposal and energy concerns. 
WTE facilities are broadly classed as mass-burn systems or refuse-derived fuel (RDF) systems. 
Mass-burn WTE facilities combust, with excess air, the MSW as received and usually have only 
a single combustion chamber. A moving, sloping grate is used to ensure that the MSW is well 
mixed with air; the grate also provides a path for ash to enter an ash collection system. For RDF 
systems, the MSW is processed to a more homogeneous mix than the as-received MSW for the 
mass-burn system. Mass-burn WTEs are the most common, with the MSW being used in the 
same fashion as other biomass fuels in direct combustion technologies. The mechanical 
processing for RDF can include grinding/shredding as well as pelletization and removal of 
metals and other bulky items. RDFs can be used as the primary fuel or co-ﬁred with fossil fuels in 
conventional utility boilers. 
The Energy Recovery Council (ERC) (http://energyrecoverycouncil.org/page/21/) is a  
national organization representing companies and local governments involved with waste-to 
energy endeavors. ERC, formed in 1991 as the Institute for Resource Recovery, operated as the 
Integrated Waste Services Association until 2008, when it became the ERC. The 2016 ERC
Directory of Waste-to-Energy Facilities (Michaels and Shiang, 2016) provides a comprehensive 
overview of waste-to-energy activities in the USA. Included in the 2016 ERC Directory are details 
of each US WTE, a list of WTE members (owners/operators, municipal members, and associate 
members), WTE performance metrics (daily MSW throughput, generating capacity, WTE 
facility characterizations and number, and waste-to energy production). The 2016 ERC
Directory lists 77 WTE facilities with a 2014 MSW throughput of nearly 30 × 106 tons from 
which 14 × 106 MW h was generated. Additionally, yearly MSW throughput and electricity 
generated from 2001 to 2014 are provided. Over the long term, a ton of MSW generated nearly 
500 kW h. Of the 77 WTE facilities, 60 are mass burn, 13 are RDF, and 4 are modular. In an 
independent assessment, Stringfellow (2014) concludes that mass burn and RDF WTE facilities 
cost ranges from $7000 to $10 000 per installed kilowatt. 
The Pinellas County (Florida) Utilities WTE facility is an example of a facility that burns MSW 
and uses the energy to generate electricity, which is supplied to the grid. Information is available 
at http://www.pinellascounty.org/solidwaste/wte.htm and in Michaels and Shiang (2016).

Figure 12.13 WTE facility schematic.
Figure 12.13 is a schematic illustrating the primary features of a WTE facility. MSW arrives at 
the facility by truck and is dumped into a receiving pit. A crane feeds the MSW into the 
combustion section of the boiler; ash falls through the combustion grate and is routed for post-
combustion treatment. Steam is produced in the boiler and directed to a turbine-generator that 
is grid connected. Young (2010) contains an overview of municipal solid WTE technologies with 
some emphasis on plasma incineration. 
The Pinellas County WTE facility processes about 1 million tons annually, although the 
capacity is 3150 tons of MSW per day. The nominal output is 75 MW, of which 60 MW is 
routed to the electrical grid and 15 MW is used internally. The Pinellas County WTE uses 
modern pollution control technology to ensure emissions are within EPA standards. The 
metals in the ash resulting from the combustion of the MSW are recovered and sold for 
recycling. The remaining ash, after being size-separated, is used for landﬁll cover, interior 
berms ﬁll, and roadways. WTE facilities are quite complex and only a brief overview has been 
presented here; however, Kreith and West (1997) present a detailed discussion of most 
aspects of WTE technology. Many local governments with WTE facilities have web sites with 
statistics and operational details. A web search with “WTE” as the key word yields many hits. 
Many of these web sites contain technical information and operational experiences; however, 
a non-negligible number of web sites report details of litigation involving solid waste disposal 
or counterclaims by individuals or citizen interests groups. WTE facilities thus generate some 
controversy. 
Many state and federal programs classify MSW-derived as renewable, thus making MSW a 
part of the renewable portfolio standard program. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 
explicitly includes MSW-derived electricity as a form of renewable energy that meets federal 
renewable energy purchase requirements. Although MSW consists mainly of renewable 
resources such as food, paper, and wood products, nonrenewable materials such as tires 
and plastics are also included. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has developed 
a procedure for classifying MSW as being composed of biogenic material or non-biogenic 
material. Formal deﬁnitions of these terms for the EPA (EPA Glossary available at www.epa.gov) 
are as follows: 
Biogenic: Produced by biological processes of living organisms. (Note: EIA uses the term 
“biogenic” to refer only to organic nonfossil material of biological origin.) 

276 
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Non-biomass (non-biogenic) waste: Material of nonbiological origin that is a by-product or a 
discarded product. “Non-biomass waste” includes municipal solid waste from non-biogenic 
sources, such as plastics, and tire-derived fuels. 
Depending on state and federal regulations, renewable-energy credit for using MSW could be 
portioned on the basis of biogenic and non-biogenic contributions. Table 12.13 presents the 
time history of MSW in terms of biogenic and non-biogenic energy content. 
The trend indicated in Table 12.13 and Figure 12.14 is a decrease in MSW biogenic content 
and an increase in non-biogenic content through the years shown. Indeed, by 2010, biogenic and 
non-biogenic waste contents became equal. Because the non-biogenic material generally has a 
higher heating value than the biogenic portion, the energy content per ton has also increased 
over time. The heating value of MSW is important in determining the output of a WTE facility. 
In 2011, the EIA reported the average heating value of MSW as 11.1 × 106 Btu/ton (http://www. 
eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=8010), which is close to the 2005 value from Table 12.13. 
Example 12.4

efﬁciency using the EIA value of 11.1 × 106 Btu/ton (http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.

base-load power that could be supplied to the electrical grid.

Solution
If 500 kW h (ERC average) could be supplied to the grid, then the electrical efﬁ­
ciency becomes 
500 kW h=ton  3412 Btu=kW h 
η 
 0:15 
11:1  106 Btu=ton 
Thus, a WTE can harvest and supply to the grid about 15% of the energy content of average 
MSW. If this seems small, remember that additionally the MSW volume has been reduced by 
88–90% in the WTE and that much of the remaining ash might have other uses. 
The electricity that might be generated from using 50% of the MSW in the USA in 2013 
can be estimated using the ERC information. Consider 
Egenerated  0:5  254:1  106 tons  500 kW h  6:35  1010 kW h 
ton 
The only viable strategy for WTE usage is as a base-load supply to the electrical grid. For a base-
load situation, the total kilowatt-hours generated would be constant with respect to time. Since a 
year contains 8760 h, the power supplied is estimated as 
6:35  1010 kW h 
Power 
 7:25  106 kW  7200 MW 
8760 h 
Used in a uniform manner as a base load to the grid, 50% of the MSW could supply nearly 
7200 MW of baseline power to the grid. 
The estimates made in Example 12.4 contain signiﬁcant uncertainties since they are based on 
“average” energy content, expected electrical harvesting, and yearly data. Nonetheless, the 
electrical efﬁciency, the kilowatt-hours generated, and the average power available are reason­
able ﬁrst-order estimates. 
Crawford (2013) provides some interesting comparisons and statistics on WTE endeavors. In 
the USA, 54% of MSW is land ﬁlled, 33% is recycled, and 13% used in WTEs. In Denmark, by 
comparison, 7% is land ﬁlled, 69% is recycled, and 24% is used in WTEs. In many instances, 
WTEs have been rejected as too unpopular to be considered, but Crawford points out that new 
technologies have alleviated many environmental problems – but getting the word out is 
difﬁcult. One of the interesting observations made by him is that since New York City rejected 
WTE, they have been sending 10 000 tons/day out of the city at a cost of $100/ton at a cost of 
more than $300 million/year!

12.7 Closure 
As is true for many alternate energy sources, the energy content and potential for biomass is 
staggering, but the technical and economic challenges are also imposing. Table 12.14 provides a 
convenient summary of biomass technologies, processes, feedstocks, and end-point uses. 
Biomass is certainly going to be an increasingly important source of energy in the USA. 
The outlook for the widespread use of biomass feedstock for fuels and chemical is summarized 
in a quote from Tester et al. (2005): 
As a raw material we can think of biomass as a nearly “universal feedstock” for producing 
energy and a plethora of energy intensive fuels and chemicals. Because of this versatility 
and the renewability of biomass, is it then the preferred solution” for a sustainable 
planet? . . . a  variety of challenges must ﬁrst be surmounted to push biomass beyond it 
current 5% contribution to energy needs in the developed world.

Geothermal Energy
13.1
Introduction
Geothermal energy is energy from the Earth. Traditionally, geothermal energy has been thought
of in terms of harvesting energy whose sources originate deep with the Earth. In recent years, the
use of the ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs), which use soil as a reservoir, has become
common; see www.geokiss.com and Section 13.5 for more information. In Figure 13.1 is a telling
statement about the pervasiveness of geothermal energy. But harvesting this energy poses
problems in both access and technology. One of the goals of this chapter is to understand the
challenges associated with geothermal energy systems.
The geological structure of the Earth is a good starting point for examining geothermal
energy. Consider the cut-away view of the Earth’s composition as schematically illustrated in
Figure 13.2. At the center is a molten inner core, surrounded by an outer core. An inner mantle
surrounds the outer core. The lithosphere is a thin, rigid crust that serves as the outmost mantle.
The lithosphere is fractured into tectonic plates – twelve large and a number of smaller ones.
These plates move relative to each other driven by gravitational and convection forces in the
mantle. This geological process, known as plate tectonics, creates fault lines where the plates
meet and produces volcanic and seismic activity. Figure 13.3 illustrates the major plates and
their boundaries. Where the plates move apart, pools of molten rock (magma) rise, leading to
volcanic activity. Where the plates collide, one plate typically moves underneath the other, a
process called subduction. In the subduction zone, temperatures become high enough to melt
rock, and earthquake and volcanic activities are common. Much of the geothermal energy is
inaccessible at great depths, but along the plate boundaries geothermal activity is close enough
to the surface to be accessible. The active geothermal zones are indicated in Figure 13.3. The
United States Geological Survey (USGS) web site http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/dynamic.
html contains a good description of the relationship between plate tectonics and volcanic
activity. The active geothermal zones are, not surprisingly, the regions with the most geothermal
energy activities.
Section 13.2 examines the estimated geothermal energy resources and provides an introduc­
tion to the harvesting procedures appropriate for geothermal energy.
13.2
Geothermal Resources
As can be inferred from Figure 13.1, geothermal resources are extensive, but the real issues are
accessibility and technology. Gupta and Roy (2007) provide a contemporary assessment of
geothermal resources and geothermal energy outlook for the Earth. Green and Nix (2006)
present a similar assessment for the USA. Kruger (1976) contains an earlier discussion of
geothermal energy, and Mock et al. (1997) examine geothermal energy as an environmentally

sustainable resource. Energy harvesting procedures for geothermal energy vary widely and
depend on the local geology. Geothermal resources are characterized by their thermal and
compositional characteristics as follows:
1) hydrothermal or geohydrothermal;
2) geopressurized;
3) magma;
4) enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) – formerly, hot, dry rock (HDR).
Different harvesting strategies are required for the different classes of geothermal resources.
But before exploring the harvesting strategies, we will examine general characteristics of each
class.Figure depicting the cut-away view of the Earth’s composition. At the center is a molten inner core, surrounded by an outer core. An inner mantle surrounds the outer core. The lithosphere is a thin, rigid crust that serves as the outmost mantle. The lithosphere is fractured into tectonic plates – twelve large and a number of smaller ones.

“Hydrothermal” refers to conditions in which water is heated and/or evaporated by direct
contact with hot porous rock. The porous or permeable rock in a hydrothermal site is contained
(bounded) by rock strata of low permeability. Water, provided by aquifers, trickles through the
porous rock and is heated and perhaps vaporized (to form steam), and is discharged at the
surface. Hydrothermal systems that produce steam are labeled as vapor dominated, while
hydrothermal systems that produce hot water or a mixture of hot water and steam are called
liquid dominated. Energy from hydrothermal sources can be harvested relatively easily. Many
existing geothermal power plants are associated with hydrothermal systems. But rock forma­
tions with hydrothermal characteristics are rare, and hydrothermal resources are the most
limited of the four categories.
Geopressurized resources are associated with sediment-ﬁlled reservoirs that contain hot
water conﬁned under pressures much greater than hydrostatic. The ﬂuids contained in
geopressurized systems are in the temperature range 150–180 °C and may be pressurized
up to 600 bar (∼9000 psi). In many geopressurized systems, the hot water may also contain
methane in solution, as well as very high levels of dissolved solids – up to 100 000 ppm. These
brine solutions are both highly corrosive and difﬁcult to handle.
Magma, molten rock, at accessible depths is contained in pools under active volcanoes.
Magma temperatures are typically in excess of 650 °C, making magma attractive from a resource
standpoint. Although the energy density of molten rock is quite large, proposed ways of
harvesting magma energy are at best speculative.
HDR suitable as a geothermal resource is characterized by temperatures in excess of 200 °C,
but, as the name implies, has little in the way of naturally contained liquids. Recently, HDR
systems have been referred to as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), and the US Department
of Energy has adopted the EGS classiﬁcation. The basic idea for harvesting energy from EGS
resources is to inject water under pressure to fracture the rock, and to use the steam formed
from the injected water to drive a turbine to generate electricity.
Table 13.1 presents estimates of the accessible geothermal resources in terms of the
aforementioned classiﬁcations. The values in the table are order-of-magnitude estimates

and are listed in order of increasing availability of geothermal resources: hydrothermal,
geopressurized, magma, and EGS (HDR). The energy economy of the USA is about 100
quad (see Chapter 1) and that of the world about 400 quad. Thus, at the current usage rates,
hydrothermal resources in the USA could last about 100 years, but the other geothermal
resource classiﬁcations offer an essentially unlimited quantity of energy. The problem is, of
course, how to harvest and use all of these resources.
The usefulness of geothermal energy is closely associated with the temperature of a
geothermal resource. A convenient graphic for displaying the applications of geothermal energy
and system conﬁgurations as a function of temperature is the Lindal diagram (Figure 13.4),
named for Baldur Lindal, a pioneer in geothermal energy development.Figure depicting lindal diagram for geothermal energy.

In 2008 the USGS completed an assessment of US geothermal energy (USGS, 2008). The
electric power generation potential from identiﬁed geothermal resources is 9057 MW. The
estimated power production potential from undiscovered geothermal resources is an additional
30 033 MW. However, an estimated 517 800 MW could be generated through implementation
of advanced technology for low-permeability, but high-temperature rock formations. This is an
enormous power generation capacity considering that 1000 GW (1 000 000 MW) exceeds the
nominal US electrical grid capacity. For geothermal utilization of this magnitude to occur, a
massive shift in infrastructure and technology development would be required.
Figure 13.5 illustrates regions in the USA with accessible geothermal resources. In this ﬁgure,
geothermal resources are expressed in terms of end-use capability. Resources above 100 °C have
the potential to be utilized for electric power generation, while resources below 100 °C can be
used for direct thermal energy – congruent with the Lindal diagram (Figure 13.4). Most of these
geothermal resources are located in the mountain and coastal areas of the west that conform
generally to the active geothermal zones of Figure 13.3. As brieﬂy mentioned in Section 13.1,
GSHPs are also considered users of geothermal energy – albeit it at low temperatures with
shallow (meters rather than kilometers) access. The entire continental USA offers the possibility
of geothermal energy for GSHP applications.
A slightly different view is provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in
Figure 13.6. This ﬁgure illustrates the deep enhanced EGS resources as well as indicates
locations of identiﬁed hydrothermal sites. The ﬁgures are generally congruent, but Figure 13.6
identiﬁes more EGS availability.
Different geothermal resource classiﬁcations require different harvesting technologies. Geo­
thermal systems details are examined next.

13.3 Geothermal Energy Systems
Different system conﬁgurations have been proposed and investigated for harvesting geothermal
energy resources according to the different classiﬁcations. DiPippo (2012) provides the seminal
presentation and case studies for geothermal energy and is recommended reading for engineer­
ing aspects of geothermal energy. Several geothermal systems will be examined in detail next.
13.3.1
Hydrothermal
Hydrothermal sources have either hot water or steam available and represent the easiest
geothermal sources to harvest. Dissolved solids, entrained solid particles, and noncondensable
gases are problems with most geothermal resources. The entrained solids are generally removed
by centrifugal separators at the well head, but ﬁlters are placed in the system to ensure solid
particles are removed. Non-condensable gases abound in some locations and pose many
problems for geothermal systems. Many of the noncondensable gases form acids under wet
conditions, necessitating the use of stainless steel or other expensive materials. Additionally,
these gases pose environmental hazards if released to the atmosphere. Hydrothermal sources
are usually considered in terms of being vapor dominated or liquid dominated.
Vapor-dominated hydrothermal sources are the most suitable for generation of electricity, but
are the rarest source of geothermal energy. As the name implies, steam is the available resource
in vapor-dominated systems. Vapor-dominated systems require steam at temperatures >175 °C
(Kutscher, 2000). Conditions at the surface seldom exceed 205 °C and 8 bar (El-Wakil, 1984).
A system schematic for vapor-dominated systems is presented in Figure 13.7. The steam from

the well passes through a centrifugal separator and enters the turbine. After exiting the turbine,
the steam is condensed, cooled in a cooling tower, and reinjected. In the ﬁgure, the thermo­
dynamics states are indicated as 1–7. The process path is shown on the T–s diagram presented
as Figure 13.8. State 1 is saturated vapor (steam) at the well bottom. The vapor goes through a
centrifugal separator (state 2) for removal of solid particles and enters the turbine (state 3) as a
superheated vapor. Processes 1–2 and 2–3 are essentially constant-enthalpy (throttling)
processes. In the turbine, some condensation takes place and the mixture exits at state 4.
State 4s represents the exit state if the turbine expansion process were isentropic. State 5 is the
exit from the condenser, and state 6 is the state after the condensate pump at the cooling tower.
The ﬂuid leaves the cooling tower at state 7 and is either reinjected or used in the direct-contactA T-s diagram depicting the process path. State 1 is saturated vapor (steam) at the well bottom.

A vapor-dominated geothermal systems is supplied with saturated steam at 3 MPa. The steam
enters the turbine at 0.5 MPa and exits at 15 kPa. The turbine isentropic efﬁciency is 82%, and
the electrical generator is 90% efﬁcient. If reinjection occurs to the cooling tower, analyze the
system performance (thermal efﬁciency and heat rate). What ﬂow rate of steam is required
for a power generation of 10 MW?

The thermal efﬁciency of only 15% does not include losses and pumping requirements.
Indeed, the accepted thermal efﬁciency of vapor-dominated geothermal systems is about 10%.
One ramiﬁcation of low thermal efﬁciencies is that system mass ﬂow rates and sizes must be
large to generate signiﬁcant power.
Liquid-dominated geothermal resources are more abundant than vapor-dominated sources.
In liquid-dominated systems, water is available at 150–315 °C. If the pressure is reduced, the
water will ﬂash into a two-phase mixture of relatively low quality – hence the name, “liquid
dominated.” Three system conﬁgurations are possible with liquid-dominated systems: ﬂash,
binary, and total. Each will be examined in turn.
In ﬂash systems, hot brine from a geothermal well is brought to the surface, where the
pressure is reduced and some of the liquid is ﬂashed into vapor. The vapor is expanded through
a turbine to produce electricity, and the liquid is reinjected through another bore. A system
schematic of a ﬂash liquid-dominated system is presented in Figure 13.9, and a T–s diagram of
the process is provided in Figure 13.10.
Water from the well bore is supplied at state 1 and enters the ﬂash separator at state 2 after a
constant-enthalpy process. In the ﬂash separator, vapor at state 3g is directed into the turbine,
and liquid at state 3f is reinjected. State 3g is expanded to state 4 in the turbine. The isentropic
expansion process to state 4s is also indicated in Figure 13.10. The mixture is condensed in the
direct-contact condenser to state 5,6. Part of the condensate is reinjected, and part is directed to
the cooling tower and subsequently used in the direct-contact condenser as the cooling ﬂuid.
One of the disadvantages of the ﬂash system is that the brine (state 3f), which contains
signiﬁcant energy, is reinjected. Energy is extracted only from the vapor phase. Example 13.2
addresses ﬂash liquid-dominated geothermal systems.
Example 13.2
A geothermal power plant is supplied with water at a well-bottom temperature of 225 °C and
a pressure of 8 MPa. The ﬂuid ﬂows into a ﬂash separator maintained at 40 kPa. The turbine

Properties for this example were computed using the IAPWS Industrial Formula­
tion 1997 for the thermodynamic properties of water and steam (Palmer et al., 2004). At

Compared with most other systems examined in the textbook, the heat rate is quite large since
the thermal efﬁciency is low. However, the thermal efﬁciency calculated using only the steam
does not consider the energy of the reinjected water. The “well-bottom” thermal efﬁciency of the
electricity production is the electrical energy produced by the steam divided by the available
energy (enthalpy) of the liquid extracted from the well bottom:

As with the thermal efﬁciency, the efﬁciency based on the well-bottom water ﬂow rate does not
consider losses and the auxiliary equipment energy required to operate the facility. Thus, in the
ﬂash separator system the electrical energy generation per kilogram of extracted water from the
well bottom is quite low.
As demonstrated in Example 13.2, the ﬂash liquid-dominated geothermal system has a low
well-bottom efﬁciency since so much energy is reinjected back into the site. A proposed solution
is the total-ﬂow concept for liquid-dominated systems, in which the turbine is replaced by a
mixed-ﬂow expander that extracts energy from the vapor-liquid mixture – thus permitting the
total well-head ﬂow to be expanded to the condenser pressure. A suggested schematic and T–s
diagram are presented in Figures 13.11 and 13.12.
Instead of undergoing the ﬂash process, the ﬂuid from the supply well enters a mixed-ﬂow
expander at state 2 and exits the expander at state 3. All of the ﬂuid from the well is directed to
the expander. In principle the process is simple; however, most geothermal ﬂuids contain

signiﬁcant concentrations of corrosive solid and dissolved gases, and the design of turbines
expanding from a near-saturated liquid to two-phase ﬂow is difﬁcult. Indeed, an examination of
the literature shows much interest in mixed-ﬂow expanders for geothermal operation in the
1970s and 1980s, with waning interest after that, to be followed by increased interest currently.
Isentropic efﬁciencies for mixed-ﬂow expanders are not anticipated to be as high as for
conventional single-phase working ﬂuid turbines. DiPippo (2012) concludes that, for appropri­
ate circumstances for single-ﬂash and total-ﬂow systems, a mixed-ﬂow expander would need to
possess an isentropic efﬁciency of about 50% to be competitive. Example 13.3 is a variation of
Example 13.2, but uses a mixed-ﬂow expander.
Example 13.3
Consider a total-ﬂow geothermal system using the same well-bottom conditions as Example
13.2. The ﬂuid enters the expander as a saturated liquid and is discharged at 10 kPa.
Determine the thermal efﬁciency, the heat rate, and the ﬂow rate for a 10 MW system if the
mixed-ﬂow expander possesses an isentropic efﬁciency of 0.50.
Solution
Thermodynamic properties for this example are taken from Cengel and Boles
(1998). For the prescribed conditions, state 2 is the saturated state; hence, in Figure 13.12,
states 1 and 2 occur on the saturation line and are the same. The saturation pressure for a
saturation temperature of 225 °C is 2.548 MPa. Thus, at state 2

The heat rate is higher than for the ﬂashed system, but the mass ﬂow rate is signiﬁcantly
reduced since all of the extracted ﬂuid traverses the mixed-ﬂow expander. This example
glosses over the many problems associated with a mixed-ﬂow expander for the total-ﬂow
geothermal system, but it does illustrate why such an arrangement is advantageous and
attractive.
The other common system for liquid-dominated geothermal applications is the binary system.
A number of existing geothermal power plants utilize such systems. A schematic illustrating the
important components of a binary liquid-dominated system is provided in Figure 13.13.
In a binary geothermal system, two ﬂuids are involved: the hot brine from the geothermal well
and a working ﬂuid (generally a hydrocarbon) that circulates in the closed portion of the system
containing the turbine, condenser, and heat exchangers. In the binary system, the hot brine for
the well supplies the hot ﬂuid to the heat exchanger in which the organic ﬂuid undergoes
evaporation. The organic vapor is expanded through the turbine and condensed in the
condenser and, hence, is in a closed system. The cooling tower is used as the cold medium
in the condenser. Strictly speaking, the only geothermal components of the binary system are
the supply/reinjection process with the well and the heat exchanger. The working ﬂuids used in
binary geothermal systems include propane (C3H8), isobutene (2-methyl propane, C4H10),

isopentane (2-methyl butane, C5H12), and water–ammonia. The working ﬂuids all have boiling
points lower than that of water. Binary systems have advantages over ﬂash liquid-dominated
systems – not the least of which is that only the heat exchanger and hot brine transport
components are exposed to the generally harsh and corrosive brine conditions.
13.3.2
Geopressurized
Geopressurized resources may be pressurized up to 1000 bar (∼15 000 psi), pressures that are
much greater (as much as a factor of 2) than hydrostatic, and are in the temperature range
150–180 °C. In the USA the primary location of such resources is in the Gulf Coast region in
Texas and Louisiana. Figure 13.14 shows, in the cross-hatched regions, the geopressurized
resource locations. Geopressurized sites are 2000–9000 m in depth. Common features of many
geopressurized resources are the high content of dissolved methane and the high levels of
dissolved solids – up to 100 000 ppm. Geopressurized brine typically contains 30–80 ft3/barrel
of methane. Indeed, Smil (2003) estimates that the global resources of geopressurized brine gas
could be more than 100 times the current proven natural gas reserves and that the Gulf of
Mexico region may contain more brine-gas methane than the current natural gas reserves.Figure depicting geopressurized resource locations by the cross-hatched regions.
Figure 13.14 Geopressurized resource locations.

296
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
These brine solutions are both highly corrosive and difﬁcult to handle. Most proposed schemes
for harvesting geopressurized resources involve the recovery of both energy and methane. The
combination of depth and the content of geopressurized brine makes harvesting energy and
methane for this resource difﬁcult and capital intensive. A number of feasibility studies of
geopressurized systems, some with economics components, have been accomplished over the
years, but the technical problems and high costs have precluded anything but pilot studies.
13.3.3
Magma
Magma is molten rock (with temperatures typically in excess of 650 °C) contained in pools
3–10 km below active volcanoes and in other geologic formations. Although the energy density
of molten rock is large and the estimated resources quite signiﬁcant (see Table 13.1), methods
for harvesting magma energy are at best speculative. The most referenced studies for magma
energy extraction were those sponsored by Sandia National Laboratory in the 1980s. Dunn
(1987) and Boehm et al. (1989) are good examples of the Sandia efforts. The good news is that, in
addition to producing energy, the high temperature and pressure associated with magma pools
also produces desirable gaseous fuels, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane. The
bad news is the high-temperature environment and the high concentration of corrosive gases
and solid exacerbate material compatibility and longevity problems.
At 600 °C iron oxide reacts with water to produce hydrogen according to
2FeO  H2O ! 2FeO1:5  H2
(13.1)
The quantity of hydrogen produced can be enhanced by introducing biomass into the injected
water. In a chemical process similar to gasiﬁcation, appreciable quantities of carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, and methane along with steam and hydrogen result.
Figure 13.15 is a sketch of how a magma power/fuel plant might appear. In addition to
utilizing the steam produced for generating electrical power, gaseous fuels would also be
recovered. As indicated in the ﬁgure, magma pools are quite large, with a single magma pool
capable of providing energy and fuel for many years. Although the potential is great, the
technological problems are immense, and the general consensus is that deep magma-based
power/fuel plants are years away. Recently, two events have enhanced interest in magma energy:
(1) the mapping of a very large magma pool under Yellowstone National Park; (2) theFigure depicting magma power plant visualization, where magma pool is present at 2 to 10 miles under the ground. Power generation, chemical, and cooling towers are presented on the surface of the earth.

serendipitous generation of electricity using shallow magma in Iceland. Both are discussed in the
next paragraph.
Haung et al. (2015) at the University of Utah identiﬁed and mapped an enormous lava (magma)
pool beneath Yellowstone National Park. The magma structure is composed of two segments: a
shallow “whale-shaped” magma chamber, oriented with the tail toward the surface, 2–10 km deep,
with the shallow end composed of hydrothermal ﬂuids and the deeper end composed of magma.
The volume of this upper chamber is estimated to be of the order of 10 000 km3 (2.5 times the
Grand Canyon volume). The magma is spongy and is composed of about 9% liquid phase. The
deeper chamber is 20 to 50–60 km below the surface and is connected to the upper chamber. The
volume of the lower chamber is about 45 000 km3 (11.2 times the Grand Canyon volume) and is
about 2% liquid phase. A super eruption event would be climatologically catastrophic, but the
UniversityofUtahresearchersposethoseoddsat1in700 000onayearlybasis.In2009,theIceland
Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) (Elders et al., 2014), in search of conventional geothermal energy,
encountered a magma pool at a depth of 2.1 km. A steel casing, perforated at the bottom, was
cemented into the bore hole. Steam at more than 450 °C from the magma was used to generate
about 36 kW of power. This effort is a milestone as it was a successful demonstration that energy
could be extracted from magma in a controlled fashion and used to generate electricity, although
from a shallow, not a deep magma pool. Ultimately, the site was shut down due to equipment
failure. Iceland is pursuing further generation of electricity from magma.
13.3.4
Enhanced Geothermal Systems
Proposed harvesting procedures for EGS (or HDR) systems involve injecting water into the
resource, circulating the water through the rock as the energy capture mechanism, and bringing
the heated water to the surface for use. Because of the low thermal conductivity of the rock, large
surface areas are needed in order to extract meaningful amounts of energy. Thus, a major
problem in EGS systems is how to attain the large surface areas in the hot rock required for
effective harvesting of thermal energy. Most proposed procedures for the use of the EGS
resource advocate hydrofracturing the rock by injecting water at very high pressures (200 atm)
into the strata. In EGS systems with sufﬁcient surface area, the use of techniques developed for
enhanced oil recovery may be employed. For an interesting tidbit of EGS history, search for the
topic, “Project Plowshare” on the internet.
EGS facilities require both injection bores and production bores. A proposed schematic for an
EGS site is provided in Figure 13.16. In the ﬁgure, the fractured hot rock is illustrated, as are the
injection and production bores. El-Wakil (1984) reported a Los Alamos National Laboratory
study as stating that that water would be pumped in at 1600 psia and 65 °C and retrieved at
2000 psia and 280 °C. In 2008, the US Department of Energy completed an 8 month assessment
of the technology developments needed for EGS to become commercially viable. The results are
available in Geothermal Technologies Program (2008). Pacing technology requirements include
site selection and characterization, reservoir creation, wellﬁeld development, system operation,
and drilling and power conversion technologies. As with some other geothermal resources,
economical and safe implementation of EGS will require signiﬁcant development and capital.

Geothermal Examples
The previous sections of this chapter have examined various aspects of geothermal energy
systems, so some examples are in order. The US geothermal electrical generating capacity was
3792 MW in 2012 (Esterly and Gelman, 2014; Matek, 2014), with California, Nevada, Utah,
Oregon, and Idaho obtaining signiﬁcant energy from geothermal resources. Matek (2014)

Although somewhat dated, a detailed compilation of geothermal energy use in the USA is
provided by Lund et al. (2005). The geothermal plants in the USA are dry steam (hydrothermal),
binary, or ﬂash (some are double ﬂash).
The Geysers Geothermal Area, north of San Francisco, contains 17 dry steam geothermal
power plants. Figure 13.17 is a photograph of the Big Geysers 75 MW hydrothermal power
plant. The facility has been in operation since 1980.
The Mammoth Paciﬁc Power Plants, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, utilize brine from the
Casa Diablo Hot Springs. Mammoth Paciﬁc I, shown in Figure 13.18, was built in 1984. It
generates10 MW and is a binary geothermal plant.
Figure 13.19 shows an 85 MW double-ﬂash geothermal power plant located at Coso Junction,
CA. In a double-ﬂash geothermal power plant, the liquid exiting the ﬂash separator is ﬂashed to
produce low-pressure steam that can be utilized by a second low-pressure turbine or injected at
an appropriate stage of the main turbine. Navy I has been online since 1987.
Geothermal energy has exhibited a slow, but steady growth in the USA. Table 13.2 depicts the
growth in installed capacity as well as the gigawatt-hours generated from 2000 until 2013. Over
that timeframe the growth was 12%, although six of those years show zero or less than 1% growth.
The USA leads the world in installed geothermal capacity (3.8 GW) followed by the Philippines
with 1.9 GW, Indonesia with 1.3 GW, and Mexico with 1 GW.

a) The increase in capacity in 2013 is partially due to a change in data sources from the Geothermal Energy
Association to the Energy Information Administration, which account for capacity differently.
The primary focus of this chapter to this point has been geothermal power systems using steam
and/or hot brine to produce electric power. As alluded to in the Section 13.1, geothermal heat
pumps or GSHPs can also be considered users of geothermal energy. GSHPs are covered next.
13.5 Ground-Source Heat Pumps
GSHPs or geothermal heat pumps utilize the ground (soil) for heat rejection in summer and as a
heat source in winter. Conventional heat pumps reject heat to the atmosphere in summer and
extract energy from the atmosphere in winter. A few feet below the surface, the ground
temperature remains nearly constant throughout the year. If the ground is used as a heat source/
sink for a heat pump, the performance of the heat pump is enhanced when compared with a heat
pump using the atmosphere as a heat source/sink. The Carnot efﬁciency is the maximum
possible thermal efﬁciency for a heat engine operating between two temperatures and producing
work and is stated as
TH  TC
ηCarnot 
(13.2)
TH
where TH and TC are the absolute temperatures of the high-temperature and low-temperature
reservoirs respectively. Refrigerators, air conditioners, and heat pumps are heat engines
operating in reverse – transferring energy from a low-temperature reservoir to a high-
temperature reservoir by the addition of work. For heat engines operating in reverse, the
coefﬁcient of performance (COP) is the usual performance metric. For a heat pump the desired

301
13 Geothermal Energy
energy result is the addition of heat to the hot reservoir, and the COP is deﬁned as the heat added
to the high-temperature reservoir divided by the work input required. The COP for a Carnot
heat pump is
Heat addition to high-temperature reservoir
TH


(13.3)

In a similar fashion, the COP for a Carnot refrigerator or air conditioner is the heat removed
from the low-temperature reservoir divided by the work input:
Heat removed from low-temperature reservoir
TL
COPrefrig 

(13.4)
Work input
TH  TC
The reason from the difference is the desired outcome – heat addition for the heat pump and
heat removal for the refrigerator. The two COPs are related as
COPheat pump  COPrefrig  1
(13.5)
Since COPrefrig is always positive, COPheat pump is always greater than one. Although an actual
heat pump is signiﬁcantly different from a reversed Carnot engine, the thermodynamic
implications of Equations 13.3 and 13.5 to a heat pump are valid – namely, the smaller the
temperature difference between the high- and low-temperature reservoirs, the higher the COP.
In the winter, heat is extracted from the ground instead of the air, so that T C is the
temperature of the ground instead of the outside-air temperature, thus signiﬁcantly increasing
the COPheat pump. Conventional (air-source) heat pumps possess COP values of near 3, while
GSHPs have COP values approaching 4. In the summer, heat is rejected to the ground, not the
outside air, such that the COPrefrig is increased. The use of the ground as a source/sink is thus
advantageous for the GSHP. The general conﬁguration of a GSHP is featured in Figure 13.20.
The heat exchanger transfers energy between the compressor refrigerant and the ground via a
circulating pump in the ground loop.
The ground can be utilized as a heat sink/source for GSHPs in several different conﬁgurations:
(a) closed loop, horizontal, (b) closed loop, vertical, (c) closed loop, lake/pond, and (d) open loop.
Figure 13.21 presents an example of conﬁguration.
The most common conﬁguration for residences is the closed loop, horizontal (Figure 13.21a).
The pipes are arranged in a helical coil shape and buried 4–6 ft deep in a trench 2 ft wide. A
disadvantage of this method is the amount of soil that must be moved/disturbed. Closed-loop,
vertical arrangements (Figure 13.21b) are quite common in government/commercial/industrial
sites and are becoming more common for residences. In vertical systems, holes 4 in in diameter
are drilled about 20 ft apart and 100–400 ft deep. In each vertical hole, two pipes are connected
at the bottom to form a “U” shape. The pipes are manifolded together and connected to the heat
pump in the conditioned space of the building. If a body of water, such as a lake or a large pond,
is available, the water can be used as the heat source/sink, as in Figure 13.21c. A helical or slinky
arrangement is again used, but the pipe must be coiled at least 8 ft under the surface for freeze
protection. Finally, an open-loop system, as in Figure 13.21d, can be utilized. Water from a well
or a pond is circulated through the GSHP and then returned to the ground via a recharge well.
The discharge must conform to local codes and regulations for groundwater discharge.
Since the ground temperature is an important consideration for GSHPs, some discussion is
warranted. Depending on the location, at 6 ft underground the near-constant temperature
ranges from 45 to 75 °F. Figure 13.22 illustrates the “yearly average” ground temperature
distribution in the USA. Not surprisingly, the ground temperatures correlates reasonably well
with the “heating degree-days” representations presented in Figure 8.6 – that is, the lower the
heating degree-days, the higher the ground temperature.

Corrosion-inhibited ﬂuids with antifreeze are used as heat transfer ﬂuids. The general
recommendation is that antifreeze sufﬁcient for protection to 10 °F below the minimum
expected temperature be used. The ﬂuids should be biodegradable and nontoxic and possess
relatively low viscosities. The two most commonly used ﬂuids are ethylene or propylene glycols
or an alcohol–water mixture. Methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl alcohols have all been used in GSHP
applications. Bio-inhibited water may be used in climates where freezing is not a problem.
Residential systems can be equipped with a “desuperheater” for heating domestic hot water. In
the summer, heat that is taken from the house and rejected into the ground loop is used to heat
the water. In the winter, the desuperheater can reduce water-heating costs by about half, with a
conventional water heater meeting the rest of the hot water needs.
Obviously, GSHP systems are more expensive than conventional systems. The question then
becomes, how much energy can be saved by using a GSHP. US Department of Energy studies
suggest that approximately 70% of the energy used in a GSHP system comes from the ground.
The US Environmental Protection Agency now designates GSHPs as an EnergyStar®-rated
product. Rafferty (2001) reports the results of Kavanaugh of energy usage by the same residence
in three different climates. The results are summarized in Table 13.3. Four systems were studied:
air-source heat pump, air-source heat pump with variable-speed drive, standard GSHP, and
high-efﬁciency GSHP. The total kilowatt-hour usages for cooling, heating, and domestic hot
water are presented. The savings for the GSHP options are signiﬁcant compared with either
conventional system. The GSHP systems demonstrate signiﬁcant electrical savings.
The general rule-of-thumb cost for GSHP systems is $2500/ton installed. This price is about
twice what a conventional residential system would cost. Thus, the energy cost savings and
possible incentives offered by utilities make GSHPs economically attractive with a reasonable
payback period. The web site www.geokiss.com contains extensive information on GSHPs and
is recommended for additional information.
GSHPs are also extensively used for commercial, industrial, and government buildings, where
they offer the same savings and advantages as for residences. Details, information, and case studies
are available from the US Department of Energy (http://energy.gov/search/site/ground%20source
%20heat%20pumps) from the Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium (www.geoexchange.org) and
the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (www.igshpa.okstate.edu).

This chapter has previewed geothermal energy, primarily as a source of heat for power
generation, but also for use in GSHP systems. Figure 13.23 is a good summary of the geothermal

country geothermal can be used for heating. Regions where the geothermal resource tempera­
ture is useful for electricity generation are limited, but still surprisingly large. As with many of
the energy sources reviewed in this textbook, geothermal has much potential, but research and
development issues need to be resolved and signiﬁcant capital will be required to fully realize
this potential.

Ocean Energy
14.1
Introduction
The oceans house an enormous amount of thermal and mechanical energy. The thermal energy
comes from the mass and temperature of the oceans, and the mechanical energy from the waves
and tidal actions of the oceans. The oceans can be viewed as a very large solar thermal collector.
The solar irradiation is incident on the surface, where the solar energy is absorbed and the
surface layer of the water heated. Over the years a number of proposals have been made for
harvesting energy resulting from the temperature difference between the solar-heated surface
and the deep ocean water – a general concept called ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC).
The actions of waves, currents, and tides have long been of interest, and various systems have
been proposed, built, and/or operated to harvest wave, current, and tidal energy. Tidal energy is
often separated into energy harvested by the tidal inﬂow–outﬂow from a captured volume via a
turbine and energy harvested by utilizing the kinetic energy of waves and currents. The latter is
referred to as marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) technology. This chapter will explore OTEC,
tidal, and MHK concepts for ocean energy capture.
14.2
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion
The solar irradiation incident on the surface of the oceans heats the layer of water near the
surface, but deep ocean convective currents transport cooler water to the lower depths of the
equatorial regions. On a typical day, the energy equivalent of 250 billion barrels of oil (http://
www1.eere.energy.gov/education/pdfs/ocean_power.pdf) is absorbed! The net result is tem­
perature stratiﬁcation with hot surface water and cooler water at depths greater than about
1 km. Surface temperatures can be in excess of 27 °C, and the temperature at depths greater than
1 km can be as low as 4 °C. Thus, between the surface and the deep water, a temperature
difference of 23 °C or more can exist. If the surface is viewed as a hot reservoir and the deep
water a cold reservoir, then a heat engine can extract useful work. OTEC systems exploit this
temperature difference to produce useful work. Depending on the OTEC system conﬁguration,
other useful products and processes may also result. Avery and Berl (1997) and Avery and Wu
(1994) provide additional discussion of OTEC energy harvesting.
As shown, the temperature difference is an important metric in determining the feasibility of
an OTEC system. Generally, OTEC systems are deemed economically feasible if the surface-to­
depth temperature difference is greater than 20 °C. Figure 14.1 illustrates the distribution of
surface-to-depth (1 km) temperature differences in the oceans. The western equatorial Paciﬁc
Ocean region contains a large area with temperature differences in excess of 24 °C. Much of the
ocean between ±20° latitude and the equator possess surface-to-depth temperature differences

of 20–24 °C. However, much of the OTEC-applicable areas are in mid ocean and/or are far
removed from both population centers and high energy-consumption locations. Thermo­
dynamic considerations, examined next, also place limits on the feasibility of OTEC systems.
Since an OTEC system is essentially a heat engine, the Carnot efﬁciency represents an upper
bound on the thermal efﬁciency. Consider the thermal efﬁciency of an OTEC system operating
with a surface temperature of 27 °C and a temperature difference of 20 °C. The Carnot efﬁciency
can be computed as

(14.1)
Hence, the maximum possible efﬁciency is only 6.7%. In reality, the efﬁciency projected or
obtained for most OTEC facilities is around 3%. The implications of such a low efﬁciency are at
least twofold: (1) high ﬂow rates and large components are required for signiﬁcant power
extraction, and (2) OTEC economics are very sensitive to irreversibilities and losses in
components. OTEC systems with high ﬂow rates and large component sizes lead to very large
capital expenditures for construction and operation. If losses are underestimated, an OTEC
system may be subject to deﬁcit economics or may require more energy to operate than is
extracted. These realities have, to a large extent, limited OTEC research and the availability of
funds for construction and operation of OTEC systems. However, as energy costs escalate and
energy availability becomes an increasing political issue, OTEC will represent a more attractive
opportunity. OTEC conﬁgurations are generally classed as open-ﬂow or closed-ﬂow systems.
Each will be examined in turn.
14.2.1
Open Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Systems
Open OTEC systems operate using the Claude cycle. An open OTEC system is illustrated in
Figure 14.2. Warm water from the surface (state 1) is admitted to a low-pressure evaporator. A
vacuum pump maintains the low pressure in the evaporator, where the warm surface water is
ﬂashed into a low-quality mixture. The warm liquid is discharged, and the vapor is directed to
the turbine. Energy is extracted in the turbine, and the resulting liquid–vapor mixture is
discharged at state 3. In the direct-contact condenser, cold water at state 5 is used to condense
the mixture from the turbine. State 4 is the state at the condenser exit. Because of the low quality

309

of the mixture in the evaporator, most of the most of the warm surface water entering the
evaporator is discharged.
The T–s diagram corresponding to the schematic of Figure 14.2 is presented in Figure 14.3.
The warm water enters the evaporator at state 1 and is ﬂashed to state 2 with 2f the liquid state
and 2g the vapor state. The warm liquid is discharged, and the vapor (quality equals 1) enters
the turbine at 2g and exits at state 3 as a mixture. State 3s represents the exit state if the turbine
process were isentropic. Cold water at state 5 is used in the direct-contact condenser. The
condenser water exits at state 4. Because the quality at state 2 is low and the quality at state 3 is
near unity, the mass ﬂow rate through the turbine differs signiﬁcantly from the warm-water
discharge and the cold-water intake. Example 14.1 examines an open OTEC system perform­
ance metrics.
Figure 14.3 T–s diagram for open-cycle OTEC system.

Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Example 14.1
An open-cycle OTEC system operates with warm surface water at 27 °C and surface
condenser water of 13 °C from the deep cold water at 11 °C. The evaporator pressure is
0.0317 bar, which corresponds to a saturation temperature of 25 °C; the condenser pressure
and temperature are 0.017 bar and 15 °C respectively. The turbine efﬁciency is 0.80. If the
turbine is to extract 100 kW, determine the system efﬁciency and the warm water, cold water,
and turbine mass ﬂow rates.

The low quality in the evaporator results in a large warm water ﬂow rate compared with the
turbine mass ﬂow rate, and the quality near unity at the turbine exit results in a high cold water
ﬂow rate.
The efﬁciency and ﬂow rates represented in Example 14.1 are realistic for OTEC systems and
explain, in part, the thermodynamic difﬁculties of open OTEC systems. The high speciﬁc
volume of the turbine working ﬂuid, 43.40 m3/kg for Example 14.1, is startlingly different from
that of modern steam power plants at 0.021 m3/kg. Thus, the mature technology of steam
turbines is not generally applicable to open-cycle OTEC turbines. El-Wakil (1984) discusses
turbine requirements and difﬁculties for application in open-cycle OTEC systems. In a 1979
Westinghouse study (http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1981-2595), a turbine 43.6 m in
diameter operating at 200 rpm was proposed for a 100 MW OTEC system.

Figure 14.4 Closed (Anderson cycle) OTEC system conﬁguration.
14.2.2
Closed Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Systems
One way to avoid turbine issues in OTEC systems is to use a binary system with a working ﬂuid
other than water. Closed-cycle OTEC (Anderson cycle) systems using working ﬂuids such as
ammonia and propane have been proposed. Figure 14.4 presents a schematic of a closed-cycle
binary OTEC system. The warm surface water provides the energy to vaporize the working ﬂuid
that is directed to the turbine. After exiting the turbine, the cold water is used to condense the
working ﬂuid.
Example 14.2
A closed-cycle OTEC system uses propane as the working ﬂuid. The warm surface water
enters and leaves the evaporator at 28 °C and 25 °C respectively. The cold water enters and
leaves the condenser at 5 °C and 8 °C respectively. The propane evaporating temperature is
22 °C, and the condensing temperature is 11 °C. The plant output is 125 MW, and the turbine
efﬁciency is 0.90. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient for both the evaporator and the
condenser is 1400 W/(m2 K). Determine the propane ﬂow rate, the evaporator and condenser
surface areas, the warm- and cold-water mass ﬂow rates, and the overall thermal efﬁciency.
Solution
Propane properties were obtained from Perry and Chilton (1973). The evaporator
operates at 22 °C, and the condenser operates at 11 °C. Table 14.1 shows the saturation proper­
ties at these temperatures.

As would be expected because of the small temperature differences involved in this closed-cycle
OTEC system, the thermal efﬁciency is low. The thermodynamic disadvantages of small
temperature differences in heat engines are real for both OTEC conﬁgurations. Although
the closed-cycle does not have the turbine availability (or suitability) problem of the open-cycle
OTEC system, the closed-cycle system requires very large heat exchangers. The surface areas
required for both evaporator and condenser are in excess of 600 000 m2!
14.2.3
Hybrid Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Systems
A hybrid OTEC system possesses features of both the open-cycle and closed-cycle OTEC
arrangements. In a hybrid OTEC system, the warm surface water is ﬂashed into steam in a
process similar to the open-cycle OTEC conﬁguration. The steam is then used to vaporize the
working ﬂuid, typically ammonia, in a closed loop containing a turbine. Desalinated water is
provided by condensing the steam.
14.2.4
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion System Outputs
In addition to the generation of electricity, OTEC systems can provide useful outputs, such as:
1) Desalinated water. The condensation of steam as in proposed hybrid OTEC systems can
provide potable water.
2) Nutrients for mariculture applications. The cold-water stream for an OTEC system contains
abundant nutrients (and is relatively free of pathogens) that can be used in commercial
mariculture applications.
3) Air conditioning for buildings and moderate-temperature refrigeration. The cold water stream
(5 °C or 41 °F) can be used in conjunction with heat exchangers to provide conditioned air for
cooling or chilled water for moderate-temperature refrigeration applications.
4) Mineral extraction. Since OTEC systems possess large ﬂow rate, the extraction of minerals
dissolved in the ocean water has been proposed as an additional OTEC application.
14.2.5
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Assessment
Examples 14.1 and 14.2 demonstrate the size/efﬁciency problems associated with OTEC systems.
Indeed, except for a few pilot plants, no commercial OTEC facility has been built and operated.
To date the biggest success has been the pilot plant in Hawaii that operated from 1993 to 1998
(Vega, 2002). The facility produced a net power of 103 kW with 255 kW of gross power extracted.
The warm surface water was 26 °C, and the cold deep water was 6 °C. Vega (2002) provides a
contemporaryassessment of OTEC andmakesseveralsuggestions for futureOTEC development.
Since the 1970s, a number of large OTEC systems have been proposed and a few have reached
the detailed engineering stage. Most of these systems are quite large and are to be moored in
deep ocean waters. Figure 14.5, a concept sketch of how a large OTEC facility might appear, was
a TRW design reported in 1976 and appears in Kayton (1981). An interesting feature of the
TRW design is that the expelled sea water is used to provide a thrust in a dynamic positioning
strategy that helps the facility to hold station (position and alignment). Additional representa­
tions of 1970s-era OTEC concepts are presented by Rudiger and Smith (1977), Baker (2006),
and Takahashi (2000).

For a number of years, the US Department of Energy (USDOE) did not support signiﬁcant
OTEC research, but in recent years that has changed and the USDOE has renewed their support
of OTEC. The USDOE web site for OTEC is http://energy.gov/eere/energybasics/articles/
ocean-energy-technology-basics. In conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the University of New Hampshire in 2009 hosted a workshop devoted
to assessing the technical readiness of OTEC technologies required for commercialization
(Coastal Response Research Center, 2010). The workshop explicitly addressed (1) platforms,
(2) mooring, (3) interface, (4) heat exchangers, (5) turbines, (6) cable, and (7) pipe. Teams
composed of technical experts were charged with determining required technological advances
needed for OTEC implementation.
Areas especially suited for initial OTEC system applications include the small island nations in
the south Paciﬁc Ocean, American territories (such as Guam) in the Paciﬁc, and the state of
Hawaii. All of these locations use diesel-powered generators for electricity and have water
potability issues.
OTEC plant ships have been proposed (e.g., Vega, 2002). These ocean-going ships would
contain OTEC systems and would move slowly in OTEC-favorable regions to harvest energy
and minerals. The electric power from the harvested energy would be used in on-board
manufacturing and fuel (such as hydrogen) production. Figure 14.6, from Vega (2002), presents
the layout of a proposed pilot facility with a 5 MW electrical output.

A comprehensive assessment of OTEC worldwide electric generation potential was funded by
the USDOE, conducted by Lockheed Martin, and published in 2012. The Ocean Thermal
Extractable Energy Visualization (OTEEV) project (Ascari et al., 2012) focused on the maximum
practicably extractable energy (MPEE) from ocean thermal resources. They deﬁned MPEE as
being sustainable and technically feasible, using state-of-the-art ocean energy technology. The
analysis used detailed ocean and climatological data and a validated nominal 100 MW OTEC
system to estimate the MPEE. The OTEC system used was a conventional single-stage closed
cycle, much likethecycleinExample 14.2,exceptthat ammoniawasused astheworking ﬂuid. The
report presents a detailed explanation of the methodology used as well as extensive presentations
of results. Within the Exclusive Economic Zones of US interest, the estimated annual average
OTEC net power was 529 GW with an estimated generation of 4636 TW h/year. The average
annual net power is the mean of the summer and winter values. The next nine countries have a
combined averageannualcapacityof1019 GWwith8923 TW h/yearofelectricity generation.The
total global estimate is 55 000 TW h/year! Hence, in terms of capacity and energy, the global
potential for OTEC is quite large. Economics were not considered in the study, only the MPEE.
To obtain the capacity referenced in the previous paragraph, Ascari et al. (2012) developed a
model to permit ocean thermal resources to be used to estimate the electrical generating
capacity. They devised, using data from existing OTEC test facilities and pilot plants, a model for
a nominal 100 MW OTEC facility. The model development and validation are explained in
detail in the report. However, we will use the model to determine and understand the
relationship between the temperature difference (surface to depth), the depth for the deep
temperature, and the power output – thus permitting parametric studies to be made. The model
baseline conditions are in Table 14.2.
The OTEEV study expressed the net power output as the difference between the gross energy
extracted and the ﬁxed and variable losses:

pumping loss, evaporator and distribution pumping loss, and ammonia pumping loss and is
42.7 MW. The variable loss Lossvariable is the sum of pipe friction and static head losses and is a
function of the pipe depth, the temperature difference, and the surface temperature. The
Lossvariable is developed in detail in the OTEEV report and has the form

An example is useful.
Example 14.3
Determine the Powergross, Powernet, and Lossvariable for the baseline values of Table 14.2.
Solution
Mathcad is used for the solution, with the results displayed in Figure 14.7. The
values of TS, TD, and the depth d are input. The gross power is computed to be 150.3 MW.
To simplify the variable loss calculations, two functions are deﬁned and are used to compute
the variable loss value of 2.718 MW. The net power is 104.9 MW. Thus, for the baseline case,
the losses (ﬁxed and variable) are 45.4 MW or 30% of the power extracted. The variable losses
are nonlinear with length; for example, if the depth in this example were changed to 500 m,
the variable losses become 1.924 MW, which corresponds to a reduction of 30% in the varia­
ble loss for a 50% change in the depth. An interactive visualization tool is available to view the
results of the OTEEV study. Details are available in Ascari et al. (2012).
Thus far in this chapter, OTEC has been examined, but ocean energy harvesting from tides
and waves is also possible. Sections 14.3 and 14.4 investigate these concepts.

Tidal energy
Tidal energy uses the rise and fall of the tides to indirectly generate electricity. In principle, the
harvesting of energy from the tides is similar to hydroelectric power. At high tide a reservoir is
charged, and at low tide the reservoir is discharged. In both the charging and discharging
process, a turbine can be used to generate electricity, as in other hydroelectric facilities.
However, the temporal aspects of the tides add other considerations. The simplest tidal power
system is called the ebb generating system and uses a dam, usually called a barrage, across an
estuary. Sluice gates open and close to regulate the ﬂow into and out of the reservoir. Two-way
tidal energy systems generate electricity with ﬂow into and out of the reservoir, but are more
complex and costly than “single-direction” generation since the turbine and supporting
structure must be more robust and complex.
The tides are periodic but not constant, since tides are governed by the moon, and to some
extent by the sun. Tides are described based on their schedule and range. The range is the
elevation difference between high and low tide, and the schedule includes the times of

occurrence of the high and low tides. A “lunar month” is 29.5 days, so that a lunar day is 24 h
50 min. During a lunar day, the tides rise and fall twice– a tidal cycle is thus 12 h 25 min. This
means that high and low tides do not occur at the same time every day, but progress 25 min per
cycle, or 50 min per lunar day. Moreover, the range is not constant but varies during the lunar
month, with the maximum range occurring at the time of the new and full moons and
the minimum range occurring at the ﬁrst and third quarter moons. At a given location, the
average ranges are complicated but predictable. The maximum range is called the spring tide,
and the minimum range the neap tide. A graphical representation, such as Figure 14.8, is a good
way to understand the details of tidal motions. The ﬁgure shows the daily tidal cycle, the
monthly tidal cycles, the tidal range variations, and the relationship of the phases of the moon
with the spring and neap tides.
The observation that the high and low tides occur at different times during different days
and that the range varies from day to day (spring to neap to spring tides) means that control
strategies to maximize tidal energy beneﬁts (typically power produced) are more involved
than strategies for hydroelectric facilities. The consideration of how to distribute the
generating time based on the tidal range for a given day impacts the size (output) of the
turbine and the system total output. A typical arrangement for a tidal pool to generate power
is illustrated in Figure 14.9. The difference in elevation due to the tidal range determines the
energy stored in the pool. The energy stored in a differential element of height dh located
above the low-level tide is
dW  g dm h
(14.5)
where dm is the mass in differential element and dm  ρA dh, where A is the horizontal area, so
that
dW  gρAh dh

Equation 14.8 demonstrates that the available energy in a tidal pool, referenced to the low-tide
datum, is proportional to the surface area and the square of the tidal range. Hence, the tidal
range is an important metric in assessing tidal energy potential.
The energy indicated by Equation 14.8 is based on the low-tide datum; hence, the energy is
attainable only when discharged to that datum. This observation raises the question of how a
tidal energy system might be operated to maximize the usefulness of the energy harvested.
Consider the conditions illustrated in Figure 14.9; namely, the tidal pool at its maximum
height and the low-tide datum at its minimum. If all the tidal pool were discharged rapidly,
then the energy attainable would be the maximum; however, if the pool were gradually
discharged, then the low-tide datum would increase and the high-tide elevation would
decrease, and the available energy would be decreased. Two protocols are thus associated
with tidal discharge strategies: (1) a simple tidal pool, in which the discharge is rapid and the
conditions of Equation 14.8 are fulﬁlled; and (2) the modulated simple tidal pool, in which the
ﬂow is varied over time and the energy recovered is reduced from the maximum. Although
protocol 2 results in less energy available than protocol 1, protocol 2 has major advantages.
Protocol 2 requires smaller turbines and results in a more uniform power level applied to the
grid or for local use. Protocol 1 results in large “spikes” of electrical power that occur at high
and low tides.
El-Wakil (1984) investigates protocol 2, as illustrated in Figure 14.10, which is adapted from
his book. A single tidal cycle with a period of 6.2083 h is indicated. Generation is initiated at
time t1, when the elevation difference between the pool and the tide is sufﬁcient for efﬁcient
generation, and is stopped at time t2, when elevation difference becomes too small for
efﬁcient generation. The determination of the times is facility dependent, but to reduce the
“spikiness” of the generation, the generation time should be an appreciable portion of the tidal

Figure 14.11 Energy availability as a function of a.
Hence, the modulated ﬂow, protocol 2, has the potential to produce only about one-tenth of the
energy that protocol 1 can. This is a dramatic decrease in the energy available for harvesting, but
energy harvested is spread over a 4 h time period instead of a very brief generating interval, and
the turbine size (power output) required is dramatically smaller. The primary control variable in
the modulated scenario is the value of a. Hence, a legitimate question is, how does the energy
harvest availability depend on a? If the calculation for W2 is repeated for a range of values of a
and the results plotted, Figure 14.11 results. As a is increased for a small value, the energy
availability increases, reaches a maximum, and then gradually decreases. The value of a for
maximum energy availability is near 0.09 h1, and the value of a  0:0625 h1 prescribed in the
problem statement results in nearly as much possible energy recovery.
In Example 14.4 and in Equations 14.8 and 14.11, the energy harvested is just the energy
extracted from the ﬂow and not the net energy output of the tidal system. Turbine efﬁciency as
well as losses in the system need to be considered to obtain the net output. El-Wakil (1984)
suggests that the overall efﬁciency may be as small as 30%.
Equations 14.8 and 14.11 have R2 in the leading term, demonstrating the importance of the
tidal range in determining energy harvesting potential for tidal systems. Tidal systems are
attractive in regions where the tidal range is high and the coastal geometry permits the
development of large-surface-area tidal pools. Gorlov (2001) provides a list of regions with
high tidal ranges, from which Table 14.3 is adapted. Locations with large tidal ranges are limited
in number, and the total available tidal resources are very limited compared with most of the
alternative energy sources considered in this textbook.
Table 14.3 presents a list of locations with large tidal ranges. As of 2015 only ﬁve tidal energy
systems were operational; however, a number are in the planning/constructions stages.

Table 14.4 contains details of the ﬁve operating tidal systems. Only two, La Rance and Sihwa
Lake, generate large quantities of electricity and involve appreciable surface areas. Tidal systems
under planning/construction include Ganghwa Island (South Kores) with 812 MW and Incheon
(South Korea) with 1320 MW.
The La Rance Tidal Power Plant, near Saint-Michel in Brittany (de LaLeu, 2009) is clearly the
most outstanding example of such facilities. La Rance became operational in 1967, and it has
operated without any major breakdowns and annually generates more than 600 × 106 kW h. The
facility has 24 turbines, each producing 10 MW. The dam, the barrage, is 750 m long and 13 m
high, and, as indicated in Table 14.4, the pool has an area of 22 km2. La Rance has operated more
than 160 000 h and produced electricity that is economically competitive. Électricité de France
has carried out a general overhaul of all the equipment, including installation of three new
turbines per year until the originals have all been replaced.
The Sihwa Tidal Power Plant (Schmid, 2005), with an output of 254 MW, is larger than La
Rance. The facility utilizes 10 bulb-type turbines, each with an output of 10 MW, and uses the
elevation difference between high tide and a reservoir to generate the 260 MW of electricity.
Sihwa generates power in one ﬂow direction, from the ocean to the Sihwa Lake, with up to
60 billion tons of seawater being circulated annually.
In addition to large capital costs, tidal energy systems raise signiﬁcant environmental and
ecological questions. Effects on the local area are site speciﬁc and difﬁcult to quantify. These
effects include aquatic and shoreline ecosystems impacts, silting, and water-quality issues.
14.4 Marine and hydrokinetic energy
The ﬁnal topic examined in this chapter, in “old” terminology, is wave energy, but is now called
marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy. The source of the energy is still currents and waves.
Ocean waves are caused by wind, which is an indirect effect of uneven solar heating, and by the
motion of the Earth. As with other alternative energy resources, the quantity of energy available
is enormous, but the techniques for harvesting the energy are still under development.
McCormick (2007) and Cruz (2008) are good introductions. Figure 14.12, from Thresher
(2014), shows an estimate of tidal current and wave energy and power for the USA. The power
available is in megawatts, and the energy harvested is in terawatt-hours per year. The power for
Alaska is separated into 47 MW and 437 MW.
Even moderate wave motion possesses an energy density in excess of the incident solar energy
density. However, before exploring the energy content of waves, we will consider the usual
description of a traveling wave:

identical to the shape at t  0.
Although the wave motion is in the x direction, with a speed of c  λ=τ, the motion of the
water is not the same as the motion of the wave. The water rotates in place with an elliptical path
in the plane of the wave propagation (El-Wakil, 1984).
The total energy of a wave is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies (El-Wakil, 1984).

For these wave conditions, the power density of 1005 W/m2 is high – greater than the solar
irradiation absorbed by the water or incident on the water surface.
Example 14.5 illustrates that a reasonable wave possesses a higher power density than might
be absorbed by the ocean. Considering the extent of the oceans and the wave conditions present
at any given time, the energy available from waves is enormous. The questions then become:
(1) How can wave energy be harvested? (2) Why are MHK devices not in widespread use?
Most of the proposed and demonstrated MHK machines harvest kinetic rather than thermal
energy. MHK devices are often grouped as (1) point absorbers, (2) attenuators, (3) oscillating
water columns, or (4) overtopping devices. Each category will be reviewed.
1) Point absorbers. Point absorbers harvest energy at a single point by using the vertical motion
of waves (from all directions) to pressurize sea water (or another working ﬂuid) that drives a
turbine. Figure 14.14 is a schematic of a point absorber system. The system is anchored to the
sea ﬂoor, and the ﬂoat moves up and down the stationary center spar. An example is the
PowerBuoy® by Ocean Power Technologies that has been deployed at several test sites.

its research and development and marketing efforts on a smaller, stand-alone PowerBuoy
primarily used for oceanographic data reporting.
2) Attenuators. Attenuators are long, articulated ﬂoating devices that are aligned parallel to the
wave direction. The articulated joints contain piston–cylinder arrangements whose relative
movements pressurize hydraulic ﬂuid that drives a motor connected to a generator.
Figure 14.16 illustrates how the wave motion and wind cause the articulated joints to ﬂex.
A good example of an attenuator device was deployed by Pelamis Wave Power, formerly
Ocean Power Delivery, several years ago. Unfortunately, the company declared bankruptcy in
2014. Nonetheless, the Pelamis device, a semi-submerged, articulated system composed of
cylindrical sections connected by hinged joints, is an example of an attenuator device. The
wave-induced motion drives hydraulic rams that pump high-pressure ﬂuid through hydraulic
motors that drive electrical generators. The power is fed via an umbilical cord to shore.
Several devices can be linked to form a wave-energy farm. The Pelamis P-750 is 140 m long,
3.5 m in diameter, and is rated at 750 kW. Speciﬁcations for the P-750 are given in Table 14.5.
A Pelamis P-750 produces a yearly average of 25–40% of the rated power. Figure 14.17 is a
photograph of the P-750. The articulated nature of the design is perhaps the salient feature.
3) Oscillating water columns. In an oscillating water column, waves cause the sea water level
inside a conﬁned container, the chamber, to move up and down. Figure 14.18 shows the
operating features of an oscillating water column device. The inclined side of the chamber is

a dominant feature. As the water level rises, the air trapped in the chamber is forced through
a turbine that extracts energy to drive an electrical generator. When the wave recedes, air
enters the chamber through a turbine, again extracting energy. The process is repeated with
the next wave. In order to harvest signiﬁcant energy, the wave machines must be large and
there must be many of them. For example, Wavegen®, a Voith and Siemens company,
installed the ﬁrst grid-connected commercial-scale wave energy plant off the coast of
western Scotland. The plant uses an inclined oscillating water column system and serves
as a full-scale test bed for component validation and development.
4) Overtopping devices. An overtopping device is a reservoir that is ﬁlled as waves break over its
walls. Since the free surface inside the reservoir is above the sea level outside the reservoir,
the liquid inside the reservoir ﬂows through a turbine into the sea – generating electricity in
the process. Figure 14.19 illustrates the important features of an overtopping device.
Other conﬁgurations for extracting energy from waves are also under consideration. These
four are the most common. A web search will yield a number of “hits,” if MHK devices is entered.
Wave energy devices are under active development by governmental agencies and private
companies; signiﬁcant technological advances are likely.Figure depicting overtopping device features, where reservoir, floating reservoir structure, water flow, hydro turbine, and overtopping ramp are labeled.

Rotating devices
Section 14.3 examined tidal energy using barrages. But tidal energy is also contained in tidal
currents in non-barrage systems. Turbines placed in tidal currents with appreciable power
density (and kinetic energy) can also harvest energy from tidal currents. In the general MHK
nomenclature, these machines are called rotating devices. The operating principle is the same as
for wind turbines (see Chapter 4). However, since the density of water is nearly two orders of
magnitude greater than that of air, the tidal current velocity does not need to be nearly as large as
the wind velocity for the same power density, ρV 3=2. Consider

Thus, a tidal current velocity of 1.05 m/s contains the same power density as a wind speed of

A wide range of turbine conﬁgurations have been proposed for use in tidal currents. A web
search will generate a large number of hits for tidal current turbines. Rotational devices used in
tidal currents are conceptually similar to wind turbines, which has helped to speed up the
development and acceptance of the rotating devices for water-based applications. Although
subject to change as new developments emerge, the most common rotating device conﬁguration
is the vertical-axis turbine, as illustrated in Figure 14.20.
In the last few years, tidal current devices and technologies have become of increasing interest.
The Jindo Uldolmok Tidal Power Plant in South Korea was commissioned in 2009 and
expanded to 90 MW in 2013. The Uldolmok Strait experiences tidal water speeds in excess
of 6.5 m/s! In Scotland, a tidal farm, when completed, will have 269 turbines of 1.5 MW each.
The ﬁrst phase, 90 MW, is scheduled for completion in 2020.

The Marine and Hydrokinetic Technology Database at OpenEI (http://en.openei.org/wiki/
Marine_and_Hydrokinetic_Technology_Database) is especially useful for MHK as it contains a
searchable, rather complete, database for MHK. The EERE site (http://energy.gov/sites/prod/
ﬁles/2015/01/f19/MHK_DBsystems1pager.pdf) provides information on MHK databases and
systems. Thresher (2014) also previews several wave energy devices and installations, and on
page 25 presents in tabular format, on a country basis, the development status of ocean energy.
The earlier Ocean Energy Technology Overview (EERE, 2009) still provides useful information.
The 2014 Water Power Program Peer Review (EERE, 2014), at 791 pages, is perhaps the most
exhaustive review of water power energy technologies, needs, and assessment ever untaken.
USDOE funding for MHK has grown from zero funding in 2007 to $42 million in 2014 with a
2007–2014 funding total of near $200 million. A summary of the DOE role in MHK from EERE
(2014) is
. . . Establish the viability of a nascent MHK industry to attract private investment.
Maximize sharing of knowledge and support device technologies that can accelerate and

The USDOE at http://energy.gov/eere/water/marine-and-hydrokinetic-resource-assessment­
and-characterization provides a summary of MHK potential for the USA. Table 14.6 lists the
theoreticalenergy available interawatt-hoursperyearaswell astheenergythat mightbeharvested
from a technical standpoint. Four categories are examined: (1) waves, (2) tidal streams, (3) ocean
currents, and (4) river currents. Since the USA uses about 4000 TW h of electricity per year, the
potential resources available from MHK devices are not trivial and could, if developed, provide at
least 10% of the annual electricity usage. However, signiﬁcant technical challenges as well as
infrastructure development issues are present if the MHK potential is to be realized.
14.5
Closure
OTEC, tidal, and MHK have been explored in this chapter. The energy potential is enormous for
OTEC, and for MKT in particular, but the technical, operational, and ﬁnancial problems are
daunting. Ocean energy devices must cope with large size, high capital costs, corrosive
environments, and uncertain and severe weather conditions. The potential is present, however,
and as greenhouse gas and climate change issues and uncertainties in energy costs continue to
be of concern, more resources are being directed to ocean energy as at least part of the energy
solution.

Nuclear Energy
15.1
Introduction
In the USA, nuclear power has been a controversial issue for more than a generation. It was
controversial before the Three Mile Island incident in 1979, with legal barriers and maneuvers
effectively halting additional penetration into the electric utility industry. After Three Mile
Island, construction of new nuclear power plant in the USA essentially ceased. Internationally,
nuclear power has achieved greater acceptance, with western Europe and Japan generating
much of their electricity from nuclear energy. Poor design choices and operational procedures
in the former USSR led to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, with further clouded nuclear power
generation safety issues. However, with increasing concern over greenhouse-gas-driven climate
change, as well as energy independence, nuclear power was under active consideration in the
USA, and for the ﬁrst time in almost 30 years plans were ongoing for new nuclear power plant
construction. Then, in 2011, disaster struck in the aftermath of an earthquake-induced tsunami
at Fukushima Daiichi, a Japanese nuclear plant with six reactors. World reaction was swift and
devastating, and the favorable outlook for nuclear power diminished signiﬁcantly. However,
several years after Fukushima, the outlook for increased use of nuclear power is becoming more
positive as a number of nuclear power plants are now under construction or being planned.
An interesting graphic on nuclear power is provided by the World Nuclear Association
(WNA) on their web site (www.world-nuclear.org) and is reproduced as Figure 15.1. In 2013, the
electricity generated by nuclear power was about 2300 TWh/year. Nuclear power produced
about 19% (Table 1.2) of the electricity in the USA in 2014. Even after the moratorium on
construction of nuclear power plants in the USA, electricity generation by nuclear power is
signiﬁcant. By any measure, nuclear power is important and vital to the production of electricity
and is hardly an “alternative energy” source in the generally accepted connotation of the phrase.
However, nuclear was included in this textbook because of the important role it currently plays
and because the growing interest in nuclear power, even after Fukushima, especially in China,
India, and Russia, portends that it is likely to become more important, not less important. In the
USA, new nuclear plants are under construction or in the planning stages. Indeed, many
individuals in the electric power industry believe nuclear power will become more important in
this century. Both the WNA (www.world-nuclear.org) and the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA, www.iaea.org) are advocates for nuclear power and provide lists for operating
and shut-down nuclear reactors as well as for those under construction. Currently, 438 nuclear
reactors are in operation, with an additional 67 under construction. The US Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC, www.nrc.gov) is the US government agency charged with overseeing all
aspects of nuclear energy. In 2015, the NRC stated that 99 reactors were in operation in the USA.
Nuclear Engineering International (NEI) is a monthly print magazine that includes feature and
technical articles on the civil nuclear power industry (http://www.neimagazine.com/). NEI also
publishes a yearly Nuclear Engineering International Handbook.

This chapter discusses the fundamentals and basics of nuclear energy, examines the various
conﬁgurations of nuclear power plants, and reviews the potential and technical problems of
fusion-power production.
15.2 Fundamentals of Nuclear Energy
An atom consists of a heavy, positively charged nucleus with much lighter electrons in orbits
about the nucleus (see Chapter 9). The nucleus is composed of electrically neutral neutrons and
positively charged protons. The charge on the proton is equal to, but opposite, to the charge on
the electron. Since an atom is electrically neutral, the number of protons is equal to the number
of electrons. The three primary subatomic particles are the electron, the neutron, and
the proton. The masses of these particles, expressed in atomic mass units, or amu
(1 amu  1:660 539  1027 kg), are as follows (Shultis and Faw, 2008):
 neutron mass, mn  1:008 665 amu
 proton mass, mp  1:007 276 amu
 electron mass, me  0:000 548 6 amu.
The proton and neutron, particles that make up the nucleus, are called nucleons. By
convention, the number of protons in the nucleus deﬁnes the atomic number Z of an element,
and the sum of the neutrons and protons in the nucleus deﬁnes the mass number A. The usual
notation for an atom of element X is A
ZX, so that the atomic number and mass number are easily
tracked. Most of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus. Isotopes of an element have the same
number of protons but a different number of neutrons and, thus, different mass numbers. For
92 U, 235
example, uranium has three common isotopes: 238
92 U, and 234
92 U. In this protocol, “ordinary”
hydrogen appears as 1
1H, and because the hydrogen nucleus contains a single proton and no
neutrons, 1
1H is also a proton. The nucleus of deuterium contains a proton and a neutron and
2
appears as 1H and is sometimes written as 2
1D. The helium nucleus contains a pair of neutrons
and protons and is cast as 4
2He. Since the electron mass is quite small compared with the mass of
a neutron or a proton, an electron is often represented as 0
1e. A neutron, which carries no
charge, then becomes 1
0n.

15 Nuclear Energy
In a chemical reaction whole atoms are involved, as in the hydrogenation reaction
C  2H2 ! CH4
(15.1)
In this reaction, atoms of carbon and hydrogen combine to form methane, but the atoms retain
their identity; indeed, the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on the left (reactant) and right
(product) sides of the equation must be equal. In a nuclear reaction the reactant nuclei do not
show up in the products, but other nuclei or different isotopes of the reactants are present.
Consider a nuclear reaction involving elements A, B, C, and D:

Conservation of mass number and conservation of atomic number (protons) demand

and
Z1  Z2  Z3  Z4

aluminum nucleus with the addition of a helium nucleus is unstable and decays:
27
2He ! 30
13Al  4
14Si  1
1H
(15.4)
The result of the nuclear reaction is silicon and a proton (hydrogen nucleus). The sums of the
mass numbers (31) and the atomic numbers (15) are the same on both sides of the equation.
Each isotope of each element has a speciﬁc mass that is dependent on the mass number and
the atomic number. The atomic mass unit is deﬁned to be one-twelfth the mass of a neutral
ground-state atom of 12
6 C. All other isotopes are referenced to this standard. The atomic mass
units of all 3200 isotopes are provided in atomic mass tables. Atomic mass tables are available in
textbooks on nuclear engineering or nuclear physics and on a number of web sites; http://
physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl is an especially useful site. In this chap­
ter, the atomic mass table presented in Shultis and Faw (2008) is used. From this table, the
following were abstracted:
 mass of 27

 mass of 30
14Si  29:973 770 amu
 mass of 1
1H  1:007 825 amu
For the nuclear reaction of Equation 15.4 the mass of the reactants is
26:981 538 amu  4:002 603 amu  30:984 141 amu
and the mass of the products is
29:973 770 amu  1:007 825 amu  30:981 595 amu
Mass is not conserved! The product mass is less than the reactant mass. The difference,

Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Hence, the nuclear reaction of Equation 15.4 produces 2.375 MeV of energy by the conversion of
mass into energy. Were the energy produced by a chemical reaction to be examined, the energy
produced would have been orders of magnitude less – hence the interest in nuclear reactions as
an energy source.
When Z protons and A  Z neutrons come together to form a nucleus, energy is emitted.
This energy, called the binding energy, comes from the conversion of some of the mass of the
neutrons and protons. The mass of the resulting nucleus is reduced from the mass of the
individual neutrons and protons by the mass equivalent (Equation 15.5) of the binding energy.
Three types of nuclear reactions are important in the production of energy: ﬁssion, fusion, and
radioactivity. Each will be examined in turn. In ﬁssion, a “heavy” element (one with a high atomic
number) is split into two or more lighter nuclei; in fusion, two or more light nuclei are fused to
form a heavier nucleus. Radioactivity occurs when an isotope spontaneously undergoes decay or
disintegration into a different nucleus, usually by emission of one or more smaller particles.
Currently, all large, commercial nuclear reactors utilize ﬁssion, so ﬁssion is of great interest in
this chapter.
El-Wakil (1984) points out that neutrons are the only particles that can be practically used in
92 U, 239
92 U, 238
ﬁssion reactors, and only a few isotopes are ﬁssionable by neutrons: 235
94 Pu, 233
92 U,
232
90 Th, and 240
94 Pu. Nuclides that ﬁssion when a neutron is absorbed by the nucleus are called
ﬁssile. Consider two ﬁssion reactions involving 235
92 U:

These reactions result in two nuclei different from uranium and the emission of two neutrons. If
a reaction is to be sustained, then more neutrons must be emitted than absorbed. Example 15.1
examines the energy release from the ﬁrst of the nuclear reactions in Equation 15.7.

Nuclides that are not themselves ﬁssile but which can be converted to ﬁssile nuclides upon
adsorption of a neutron are called fertile. For example, when 238
92 U, a non-ﬁssile isotope, absorbs
a neutron it eventually becomes 239
94 Pu, a fertile isotope.

15 Nuclear Energy
In fusion, two or more light nuclei are combined to form a heavier nucleus. Such reactions are
possible only if the nuclei possess sufﬁcient kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive forces and
are able to reach each other. This topic will be examined in detail in Section 15.4. A typical
fusion reaction and the energy released are as follows:
2
1H  2
1H ! 1
3H  1
1H  4:03 MeV
(15.8)
As with ﬁssion reactions, fusion reaction energy release results from the conversion of mass to
energy.
Radioactivity, the spontaneous decay of a nucleus by emission of one or more smaller
particles, is the last of the three nuclear reactions to be examined. A key word in this
deﬁnition is “spontaneous,” since, unlike ﬁssion and fusion reactions, the instability of the
nucleus of a radioactive isotope is the causative effect. Isotopes that occur naturally
are stable in most elements, but elements with atomic numbers greater than 84 have no
stable isotopes, and a few isotopes of elements with atomic numbers less than 84 are also
unstable. Isotopes artiﬁcially produced in particle accelerators and nuclear reactors are all
unstable and number in the thousands. The time required for a single unstable nucleus to
decay is indeterminate, but among a large cohort of the same unstable nuclei there is a
statistical probability that a certain fraction will decay within a speciﬁed time. If N is the
number of radioactive isotopes present at time t, then the rate of decay is proportional to N.
Mathematically, this is expressed as
dN  λN
(15.9)
dt
where λ is the decay constant. Equation 15.9 is variable separable; if No isotopes are present at
t  0, then

Decay is thus exponential in time. An important metric in radioactive decay is the half-life. By
deﬁnition, the half-life is the time required for one-half of the radioactive nuclei to decay. Using
Equation 15.10, the half-life can be expressed as

(15.12)
Equation 15.12 is plotted in Figure 15.2; the abscissa is t=thalf-life, the number of half-lives. The
exponential decay is rapid, such that by slightly over three half-lives the number of nuclei has
diminished to only 10%; by 10 half-lives, the number of nuclei has been reduced to less than
0.1%.
The half-lives of different isotopes differ by many orders of magnitude. For example, the half-
life of 212
92 U is 4.51 × 109 years. Most textbooks
84 Po is only 0.298 × 106 s, while the half-life of 238
on nuclear engineering contain abbreviated tables of radionuclides that include half-life and
other useful data. However, a number of web sites provide extensive listings; http://nucleardata.
nuclear.lu.se/toi/nucSearch.asp is especially user friendly and is a partial implementation of the
contents of the eighth edition of Table of Isotopes (Firestone and Shirley, 1999).

Figure 15.2 Exponential decay as a function of half-lives.
Shultis and Faw (2008) identify four mechanisms that result in the decay of a natural (not man-
made) isotope: alpha decay, beta decay, positron decay, and gamma decay. Consider each of the
four.
1) Alpha decay. An alpha ( ) particle is the nucleus of a helium atom and is written as 4
2He.
Alpha decay occurs when an alpha particle is ejected. An example is
226
88 Ra ! 222
86 Rn  4
2He 
(15.13)
In alpha decay, the Z is reduced by 2 and A by 4; in the reaction of Equation 15.13, Ra is the
parent and Rn is the daughter. Alpha particles give up their kinetic energy by ionizing the
matter through which they pass. Most of the energy is dissipated close to the emitting
nucleus. Alpha particles possess limited penetrating ability – a few centimeters in air and a
much shorter distance (about the thickness of a sheet of paper) in solids. Unless alpha
emitters are ingested, they pose little health danger.
2) Beta decay. Beta ( ) decay is the transformation of a neutron in the nucleus into a proton and
an electron, which results in the emission of the electron in order to maintain the charge
balance of the nucleus. Beta particles are thus electrons, 0
1e1. An example of beta decay is
214
82 Pb ! 214
1 
(15.14)
where ν represents the neutrino, a small neutrally charged particle that carries about 5% of
the energy of the reaction. In many cases, the neutrino in Equation 15.14 is ignored. The beta
particle has more penetrating ability than the alpha particle. In beta decay, the atomic
number is increased by 1, while the mass number is unchanged.
3) Positron decay. In positron decay, the nucleus is unstable because of an excess of protons,
and a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron, a subatomic particle
with the mass of an electron but with a positive charge; the symbol is 0
1e1. An example is
83 Bi  0
1e
22
11Na ! 22
1 
(15.15)
10Ne  0
1e
As with the beta decay, a neutrino is also emitted. Shortly after emission, the positron will
capture an electron, and the mass of the positron–electron pair will be completely converted
to energy, with the result being two photons traveling in opposite directions, each with an
energy of 0.511 MeV.

339
15 Nuclear Energy
4) Gamma decay. Gamma radiation is electromagnetic radiation of extremely short wave­
lengths and very high frequencies – implying signiﬁcant energy content. As Table 6.1
delineates, gamma rays have wavelengths λ of less than 104 m. Gamma decay does not
change either the mass number or the atomic number, but represents a reduction in the
energy level of the nucleus. In gamma decay, a high-energy photon is emitted from the
nucleus. Gamma rays have much more penetrating ability than either alpha or beta particles,
and external exposure to
-rays can be very hazardous.
Example 15.2
The radioactive isotope 135 
54 Xe. Determine the time required
53 I decays by beta emission into 135
for the number of 135
53 I atoms to be reduced by 90%.
Solution
From the Table of Isotopes (Firestone and Shirle, 1999), the half-life of 135
53 I is
6.57 h. If the number of nuclides is to be reduced by 90%, then only 10% of the original

Nuclear Power
In the context of this textbook, the discussion of nuclear power is limited to the generation of
electricity. However, the US Navy has a long and rich history of using nuclear power for
shipboard operations, including propulsion as well as onboard electricity distribution. The Navy
has designed, built, operated, and decommissioned nuclear reactors, maintaining an astonishing
safety and performance record and thus representing a signiﬁcant repository of US nuclear
engineering expertise. This section will examine nuclear reactors used for the generation of
electricity.
Worldwide as of 2015, 438 nuclear power plants with a generating capacity of 376 000 MW
(376 GW) were in commercial operation (IAEA, 2015). The US NRC provides a list of domestic
operating nuclear power units at http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/list-power-reactor­
units.html. In addition, several hundred nuclear reactors are used in the naval vessels of various
countries. A general rule of thumb is that the ﬁssion of 1 g of uranium provides the energy
equivalent of 10 tons of oil. An overview of nuclear reactors is thus appropriate.
In any discussion of nuclear reactors, the concept of the neutron economy is central. Section
15.2 reviewed several aspects of ﬁssion reactions, including the energy released by such
reactions. The fundamental idea of a nuclear reactor is to provide radioactive fuel in an
environment such that nuclear reactions can proceed in a safe and dependable manner to
provide power to generate electricity. For that to occur, enough neutrons must be produced to
sustain controlled nuclear reactions sufﬁcient to provide the power required. Uranium, for
example, is a common fuel for many reactors and will ﬁssion in many different ways, resulting in

340
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
variations in the ﬁssion products. A general nuclear reaction for a large cohort of 235
92 U atoms
would result in the “average” reaction (Murray, 1961)
235

(15.16)
where A1FF and A2FF are the ﬁssion fragments of the reaction. The mass numbers of the ﬁssion
Z1
Z2
fragments and the neutrons emitted must sum to 236. On average, 2.43 neutrons are produced.
If the reaction is to be sustained, then at least one of the 2.43 neutrons must be absorbed and
result in the ﬁssion of the nucleus of another 235
92 U atom.
The nuclear reaction presented in Equation 15.16 yields on average about 200 MeV per
ﬁssion. An important consideration for any power-producing machine, such as a nuclear
reactor, is how much fuel is used to produce a speciﬁed amount of energy. A convenient metric
is 1 MW day  24 000 kW h. So a reasonable question is how much 235
92 U is required to produce
1 MW day? Example 15.3 addresses this question.
Example 15.3
How much 235
92 U is required to produce 1 MW day if the average energy yield is 200 MeV per
ﬁssion and the electrical conversion efﬁciency is 35%?
Solution
Since the energy yield per ﬁssion is 200 MeV, the number of ﬁssions per second
for 1 MW can be calculated as
J

The mass of one atom of 235
92 U contains 6.023 × 1023 atoms/

Shultis and Faw (2008) state that about 15% of the neutrons absorbed by 235
92 U result in
something other than ﬁssion. The mass per day for 1 MW day at an electrical conversion
efﬁciency of 35% is thus
g

g
mU  1:083

 3:640

Hence, in a day 3.64 g of 235
92 U would be consumed to produce 1 MW day (24 000 kW h).
Most neutrons resulting from the reactions such as indicated by Equation 15.16 are fast
neutrons – indicating large kinetic energies (∼2 MeV) and, hence, high speeds. A fast neutron is
difﬁcult for a 235
92 U nucleus to absorb, and unless it is absorbed it will not initiate another nuclear
reaction. A slow (or thermal) neutron has a much higher probability of being absorbed than a
fast neutron. A thermal neutron is one that is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.
Thus, fast neutrons need to be slowed down to become thermal neutrons to enhance their
chances of capture so that nuclear reactions can be sustained. Fast neutrons that are slowed
down are said to be scattered. The material in a nuclear reactor that is used to slow down or
thermalize the fast neutrons is called the moderator. A moderator should have small nuclei with

341
15 Nuclear Energy
high neutron scattering and low potential for neutrons absorption (or capture). Materials
1
that ﬁt these speciﬁcations include light water (containing 1H), heavy water (containing
deuterium, 2
1H), graphite (C), and beryllium (Be or BeO). The moderator material also plays
a role in the fuel requirement of a nuclear reactor.
As mined and processed, natural uranium is composed of 99.2% 238
92 U. If the
92 U and 0.7% 235
moderator is graphite or heavy water, then natural uranium can be used as a fuel. However, if
light water is the moderator, then the amount of 235
92 U in the fuel must be increased to from 0.7%
to 3.5–5%. Enriching uranium is an expensive and energy-consuming process; Shultis and Faw
(2008) discuss enrichment procedures.
The neutron economy is also a factor in reactor control. For a steady-state reactor operation an
increase in neutron production results in an increase in the ﬁssion rate and in the power output. If
neutron production were to continue to increase, the reactor core would eventually meltdown. To
change the power level of a reactor, neutron production must be altered (increased or decreased)
until the required new power level is reached. The neutron production in a reactor can be altered
by control rods or chemical shims. Control rods are made of materials that absorb neutrons and
thus reduce the neutrons that can be absorbed by ﬁssile nuclei. Control rods can be moved in or
out to affect the neutron economy. Materials that absorb neutrons include boron, cadmium, and
indium. A chemical shim involves the use of a soluble neutron absorber, usually boron, in the
coolant of a reactor. Chemical shims allow intermediate time control and help to reduce the
movement of control rods.
Control rods or chemical shims alter the production of neutrons from one ﬁssion generation
to the next. The effective neutron multiplication factor keff is deﬁned as the ratio of the neutrons
produced from one ﬁssion generation to the next ﬁssion generation:
neutrons produced in generation n  1

keff 

(15.17)

where n is the number of neutrons. Since keff  1 represents steady-state operation, the excess

In 1 s, the number of neutrons increases by a factor of 22 024, and since the power is
proportional to the number of neutrons, the power increases by the same factor. With
such a small neutron magniﬁcation factor, the power increase in a single second is astonishingly
large – the implication being that, under these circumstances, control would be virtually
impossible. However, control is possible because of delayed neutrons.
Delayed neutrons are produced in the radioactive decay of some products from the ﬁssion of
235
92 U. Out of the ∼2.43 neutrons produced in ﬁssion reaction of Equation 15.16, about 0.65%
comes from the decay of ﬁssion products such as Br and I. The times for the emission of the
delayed neutrons are very long compared with the conventional ﬁssion cycle time. The net result
is that tavg is much longer than for the 99.35% of the neutrons released at the time of the reaction,
the prompt neutrons. Murray (1961) states that the average life of a delayed neutron is 12.7 s.
Instead of the tavg  0:0001 s for the prompt neutrons, when the delayed neutrons are
considered in conjunction with prompt neutrons tavg∼0:1 s. For Example 15.4, if tavg  0:1 s,
after 1 s the ratio of neutrons produced is 1.01 – quite a contrast to 22 024 for tavg  0:0001 s,
and a more rational number for nuclear reactor control.
As with many energy systems, different conﬁgurations of nuclear reactors have different
advantages and disadvantages, and for various reasons one conﬁguration is preferred over
another. Nuclear reactor conﬁgurations are based on the following considerations: (1) fuel, (2)
moderator, (3) coolant, (4) control rods, (5) cost, and (6) containment. Table 15.1 provides a
convenient summary of the most prevalent reactor conﬁgurations. The salient features of each
type will be reviewed next. The NRC web site (http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/power.html), Nero
(1979), Weston (1992), and Fay and Golomb (2002) contain a variety of schematics and
explanations for the various reactor types and are good sources for qualitative information about
nuclear reactors and subsystems.

generator, and “4” is the turbine/generator. Source: US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (http://www.nrc.gov/
reactors/pwrs.html).
1) Pressurized-water reactors (PWRs). These constitute the largest number of reactors, with an
estimated 278 (www.euronuclear.org) for commercial power and about 200 in service as
naval propulsion systems. A simpliﬁed schematic of a PWR is given in Figure 15.3 where the
containment vessel and the reactor vessel are shown. The concept behind PWRs is that the
reactor vessel is pressurized to a high enough pressure so that the coolant (and moderator) is
maintained in a liquid state. Typically, PWRs operate at about 300–325 °C and are
pressurized to 15 or 16 MPa. The reactor core is located in the lower portion of the reactor
vessel. In addition to the high operating pressure of the reactor vessel, a primary feature of a
PWR is the pair of ﬂuid loops. The high-pressure coolant loop circulates ﬂuid within the
reactor core and to a steam generator. In the steam generator the hot, high-pressure ﬂuid is
used to make steam at a pressure much lower (6 MPa) compared with the reactor coolant
loop that is circulated outside the containment structure to the turbine and generator. The
steam exiting the turbine is condensed in the cooling tower and returned to the steam
generator. Because the steam to the turbine is not exposed to the reactor core, the turbine
does not need to be shielded.

344
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
Westinghouse, Babcock and Wilcox, and Combustion Engineering are the designers of
many of the existing PWR systems. After these reactors were built, Westinghouse and
Combustion Engineering combined their nuclear assets with those of British Nuclear Fuels
Limited to form Westinghouse BNFL. The French–German owned ﬁrm Framatome ANP
acquired much of the nuclear technology of Babcock and Wilcox.
2) Boiling-water reactor (BWR). This is the second most popular reactor type. A simpliﬁed
schematic of a BWR is provided in Figure 15.4. In the schematic, the containment vessel and
the reactor vessel are shown. A BWR differs from a PWR in several important features: (1)
the pressure in the reactor vessel is much lower (7 MPa) since steam is the desired ﬂuid; (2) a
BWR essentially contains only a single ﬂuid loop; and (3) steam is generated in the reactor
vessel and directed outside the containment structure to the turbine. BWRs operate at
about 285 °C. Details of a General Electric BRW/6 reactor vessel are presented in
Figure 15.5. A steam–water mixture leaves the top of the core and ﬂows into the separator,
where the water droplets are removed and the steam is directed to the turbine. The steam
separator assembly is in the upper portion of the vessel. Any steam remaining after exit
from the turbine is condensed and the liquid is returned to the reactor vessel. The
recirculation pumps permit the coolant ﬂow rate to be varied in the core to change the
power output of the reactor.
A comparison of Figures 15.3 and 15.5 illustrates the signiﬁcant differences between a
PWR and a BWR vessel. The steam (vaporized coolant) in a BWR is radioactive since it is in
direct contact with the reactor core; thus, the turbine and piping must be shielded.
3) Pressurized heavy-water reactor (PHWR). A number (15 in 2015) of PHWRs are presently in
use. As the name implies, heavy water is used as the moderator. The reactor temperature of
PHWRs is about 290 °C. The most prevalent of this type is called the CANDU after its
country of origin, Canada. The PHWR offers the following advantages over the PWR and
BWR: (1) since heavy water is used as the moderator, the uranium fuel does not have to be
enriched; (2) they can be refueled without shutting down; and (3) they are not as expensive to
build and operate as some reactor types. A schematic of a PHWR is presented in Figure 15.6.
The reactor vessel is often called a calandria. The PHWR type shares many characteristics
with a PWR. However, a large amount of heavy water is required, and heavy water is
expensive. But since the uranium fuel does not have to be enriched, fuel costs are lower. An
issue of concern is that the spent fuel contains 239
94 Pu, an isotope that can be used in nuclear
weapons.
4) Gas-cooled reactor (GCR). These reactors use carbon dioxide as the coolant and graphite as a
moderator. GCRs allow the use of natural uranium as a fuel. A schematic of a GCR is
presented in Figure 15.7. Carbon dioxide is an effective coolant and does not absorb
neutrons. The CO2 reaches 650 °C in the reactor core. Gases are not good moderators,
so graphite is used. Graphite is inexpensive, relatively widely available, and possesses good
high-temperature properties.
Issues of concern for nuclear power have traditionally been safety, nuclear weapon proliferation,
and disposal of nuclear waste. Dorf (2001) examines issues concerned with nuclear power.
Arguably, the dominant issues concerning nuclear power have been radioactive waste and
safety.
The handling/storage/disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear power reactors (and military
programs) has been an issue of great concern in the USA for many decades. Nuclear fuel
removed from power reactors exhibits high levels of radioactivity since the spent fuel contains
radioactive ﬁssion products and other neutron-activated isotopes. The extracted fuel, generally
in the form of rods, is stored on the reactor site in secure water ponds or dry casts. Permanent
storage in a nuclear waste repository is the long-term goal, but in the USA the designation and

licensing of a long-term nuclear repository has been an emotional political issue. In 1985
Congress mandated a permanent storage site in 1985 in the Yucca Mountains, 130 km north of
Los Vega, NV, and reafﬁrmed that site in 2002. However, since 2008 a bizarre series of events
surrounding the site have occurred. In 2011, federal funding was terminated with the concur­
rence of the Secretary of Energy. The Government Accountability Ofﬁce stated that the
termination was for political, not technical or safety reasons. The Secretary of Energy then
established a commission to make recommendations for a repository. The commission’s ﬁnal
report was released in January 2012, expressing urgency in ﬁnding a repository site. Moreover,
the commission recommended that any future repository facility plans should be made by an
independent organization (with direct access to the Nuclear Waste Fund), not subject to
political and ﬁnancial control like the DOE! One problem associated with spent fuel is that
reprocessing is prohibited in the USA; in other countries, spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed and
the recovered uranium is sent back for enrichment and reuse, signiﬁcantly reducing the volume
and half-life of spent fuel nuclear waste. One technique for long-term storage of radioactive
waste is to mix the waste with pulverized glass and solidify the glass mixture. The resulting

mentally benign.
Although Three Mile Island generated much adverse publicity and resulted in an unbelievably
expensive clean-up effort, very little radiation was released to the atmosphere and no public
health issues have ever been raised. The disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima, however, caused
signiﬁcant release to the atmosphere and are worth examining.Figure depicting a schematic of a GCR, where concrete pressure vessel, graphite moderator, control rods, steam generator, carbon dioxide, and fuel elements are labeled.

Chernobyl
The Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster of 1986 is infamous as a catastrophe to both people and
the environment. The causes of Chernobyl serve as a litany of how not to do things. Details are
provided in Deutch and Lester (2004) and at the web sites www.world-nuclear.org/info/
chernobyl/inf07.html and https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl. The location of
Chernobyl is indicated in Figure 15.8.
The reactor was a light-water graphite reactor, a type extensively used by the counties of the
former USSR. The general consensus is that the accident was the result of a ﬂawed reactor
design coupled with serious operator mistakes in a system characterized by minimal training,
nonexistent safety culture, and Cold War isolation. The Chernobyl reactor was a 1000 MW
reactor of the RBMK (Reaktor Bolshoy Moshchnosti Kanalnyy) type, a boiling-water-cooled,
graphite-moderated design that was the workhorse of the USSR nuclear reactor program. A
schematic of the RBMK nuclear reactor is shown in Figure 15.9. The RBMK 1000 uses
uranium enriched to about 2% 235
92 U. The enriched uranium is contained in 1700 individual
pressure tubes, each about 7 m long, through which cooling water ﬂows and steam is
generated.
Since graphite is the moderator, excessive boiling reduces the cooling (and neutron absorp­
tion by the coolant) without inhibiting neutron absorption since the moderator is unaltered by
the excessive boiling. This positive-feedback behavior, termed a positive void coefﬁcient, is one
of the problems with the RBMK nuclear reactors, with the effect that at low power levels an
increase in steam results in an increase in the reactivity. Conventional BWRs have a negative
void coefﬁcient – a decline in reactivity with an increase in boiling since water is the also the
moderator in BWRs.
In addition to the inherent stability problems of a positive void coefﬁcient, the Chernobyl
accident occurred during a test of a safety system. As part of this test, the ﬂow of cooling water
through the core was interrupted, resulting in the reactivity ρ becoming greater than unity. The
power started to increase and was estimated to have reached 100 times the nominal full-power
output within 4 s! The rapid increase in power meant that not enough time was available to
insert the control rods. In any case, by 4 s the enormous power surge had destroyed the fuel
channels, effectively blocking any further insertion of the control rods. The fuel then overheated,
melted, and fragmented. When steam came into contact with the fragmented fuel, a steam
explosion occurred that literally lifted the 1000 ton reactor upper plate. Unlike most reactorsA geographical map depicting the location of Chernobyl.

(especially in the Western nations), the RBMK reactor was not surrounded by a containment
structure, so that when the explosion occurred and lifted the upper cover plate, the reactor core
was open to the atmosphere. Hydrogen, produced by reactions between the steam, the fuel, and
the graphite, then caused a second explosion that resulted in signiﬁcant amounts of radioactive
material being discharged into the atmosphere. To exacerbate matters, the hot graphite ignited
and ﬁssion continued, producing additional heat and releasing even more radioactive material
into the atmosphere. A number of emergency response workers attempting to stabilize the
situation and put out the ﬁre eventually died of radiation poisoning. Figure 15.10 depicts the
current state of the reactor at Chernobyl. About 5000 t of boron, dolomite, sand, clay, and lead
were dropped onto the burning core by helicopters to control the burning and limit the release
of radioactive materials to the atmosphere.
The adverse effects of Chernobyl were many. So far, more than 50 deaths have been
directly attributed to the disaster. At least 5% of the radioactive core ultimately found its
way into the atmosphere. The USSR nuclear program was not cancelled, but no new RBMK
reactors were constructed, and the existing RBMK reactors have been retroﬁtted to make
them safer. Safety and training for nuclear reactor personnel have become more important
in the former USSR states. Some adjacent towns were permanently evacuated, and long-
term health effects on a large number of citizens continue to be of great concern. Indeed,
some early estimates place the ultimate death toll in the tens of thousands (Deutch and
Lester, 2004). However, more recent studies have concluded that long-term radiation-
related health issues are not nearly as signiﬁcant as early projections indicated (www.world­
nuclear.org).

are provided by the WNA (http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Safety-of­

(http://www.oecd-nea.org/press/press-kits/fukushima.html), and Hayes (http://www.academia.
edu/1708583/Fukushima_and_the_Politics_of_Nuclear_Energy).TheUS NRC developed a num­
ber of studies related to the event and the lessons learned. Information in the following paragraph
was abstracted for these web sites.
On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a magnitude 9.0 earthquake (centered 130 km offshore
the city of Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture), and the resulting tsunami that impacted the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Station was at least 14 m (45 ft) high. The Fukushima sea wall was 5.7 m
high. The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a high death toll and widespread property damage
on the eastern coast of Japan. Of the six reactors in the facility, three (Units 1, 2, and 3) were
running and three (Units 4, 5, and 6) were shut down for maintenance.
The tsunami destroyed primary and secondary electrical power sources, so that instrumen­
tation, lights, and/or coolant circulating pumps were down. Fortunately, when the earthquake
was detected, control rods were inserted in Units 1, 2, and 3. The reactor cores and the stored
spent fuel rods continued to generate heat that could not be removed. The pressures in the
containment structures eventually became so high that they were vented to the atmosphere,

351

resulting in the discharge of radioactive gases. The radiation release was about 10% of that of
Chernobyl, and the primary isotope released was 131
55 Cs (half-life 30
53 I (half-life 8.04 days), with 137
134
years), and 55 Cs (half-life 2.06 years) also being released. Radioactive release peaked on
September 15, mostly from Unit 2. The evidence indicated core meltdowns in Units 1, 2,
and 3 also resulted in contamination to the surroundings. At 1–3 days into the disaster,
hydrogen explosions occurred in Units 1 and 3. Fire pumps with seawater were in use 1–3 days
after the tsunami in an attempt to cool the facility. The offsite electrical supply was restored
11–15 days after the event, and fresh water cooling was available 14–15 days after the event.
Mandatory evacuations were ordered (in excess of 100 000 people), and consumption of food
from the affected areas was prohibited. Although health issues directly attributed to radiation
were small, a number of deaths among those evacuated resulted from stress and other causes.
All-in-all, the Japanese handled the Fukushima nuclear crisis more effectively than the USSR
handled Chernobyl. What about the aftermath of Fukushima?
By the summer of 2011, all Japanese nuclear power plants were shut down, and the
governing political party publicly abandoned nuclear power as a partial solution for Japan’s
energy needs. However, at the next election, that party was soundly defeated, and the new
government moved rapidly to reintroduce nuclear power as part of Japan’s energy solution.
While the projected percentage of nuclear-supplied electricity in Japan is down from pre-
Fukushima estimates, nuclear power has been afﬁrmed as part of the base-load electricity
solution for Japan. Many of the existing nuclear power plants in Japan are either online or
scheduled to come online, while some of the older ones (and smaller ones) will be
decommissioned. Additionally, a number of advanced design nuclear power plants are
under construction or planned for construction. Initial world reaction included some
countries deciding to eliminate nuclear power. Section 15.3.3 examines recent developments
in commercial nuclear reactors.
15.3.3
Nuclear Power in the Twenty-First Century
A convenient concept that aids in understanding the evolution of power nuclear reactors is to
refer to technological innovations in terms of reactor “generations.” An excellent summary is
provided by Goldberg and Rosner (2011). Four generations are identiﬁed, spanning the time
period from 1950 through to about 2030. Salient features and characteristics of each generation
are as follows:
Generation I. The power reactors that initiated commercial nuclear power in the 1950s and
1960s. This generation of reactors typically ran at power levels considered as proof of concept. A
well-known example is the Shippingport Reactor in service from 1957 to 1982. All Generation I
reactors have been decommissioned.
Generation II. This generation of reactors was designed to be economical and reliable with
operating lifetimes of >40 years and includes PWRs, CANDUs, and BWRs. Generation II
reactors began operation in the late 1960s and comprise the bulk of the commercial operating
power reactors in use today. Most of this generation’s reactors (in the West) were manufactured
by Westinghouse, General Electric, or AREVA. Generation II reactor designs have been
upgraded and modiﬁed, especially in Korea and China. Many Generation II operating reactors
have had their operating lifetimes extended to well beyond 40 years. This generation of reactors
produces signiﬁcant quantities of spent fuel, which require long-term storage in high-level waste
repositories or reprocessing. The Fukushima experience will undoubtedly impact the future
evolutions of nuclear reactors.
Generation III. These reactors evolved from Generation II reactors with improvements in fuel
technology, thermal efﬁciency, construction techniques, and standardized designs. Generation

352
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
III reactors are expected to have operating lifetimes in excess of 60 years and include the AP-600
by Westinghouse, the advanced BWR (ABWR) by General Electric, the Enhanced CANDU 6 by
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, and the System 80+ by Combustion Engineering. No
Generation III reactors are in service in the USA. However, a General Electric–Hitachi ABWR
was constructed in only 4 years in Japan!
Generation III+. This generation of reactors represents important evolutionary develop­
ments from Generation III reactors and offers signiﬁcant safety improvements via passive
safety features that utilize natural convection and do not require operator interventions. A
number of Generation III+ reactors are under development; a partial list includes the AP1000
(based on the AP600), the economic simpliﬁed BWR (ESBWR), which is based on the ABWR,
and an advanced PWR design (based on the System 80+). Although somewhat dated, A
Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems (US DOE Nuclear Energy
Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV International Forum, 2002), is still
frequently cited as a source of information on the evolution and future directions of nuclear
power. Figure 15.11 was taken from the aforementioned document, and effectively and
succinctly delineates both the history and expectations for technology advances in nuclear
power.
The US NRC, the Energy Information Administration, and the WNA provide data on
advances in nuclear reactor technology and periodically update information on the number,
type, and status of new nuclear power installations. The NRC compilation is focused on the USA
and is available at http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/design-cert/apr1400.html. The
WNA contains similar information, except on a worldwide basis, and is available at http://www
.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-power-reactors/advanced­
nuclear-power-reactors.aspx. The IAEA also publishes extensive information on nuclear power.
Table 15.2 was abstracted from these sources and lists pertinent information about advanced
nuclear power reactors (especially in the USA).
The status of new nuclear technology and new power plant construction is addressed in detail
by the US NRC, the IAEA, and the WNA. The NRC considers mostly activities in the USA, but
the others deal on a worldwide basis. In 2015 the WNA stated that 467 nuclear power reactors
were in service worldwide with 67 under construction, 166 planned, and 322 proposed. Were all

of the proposed and planned to be constructed, the nuclear generating capacity would be
1000 GW, up from the current 379 GW. Most of the proposed and planned reactors are in
China, India, and Russia. However, how many of the planned and proposed will actually be
constructed is speculative.
In the USA, 5 are under construction, 5 are in the planning stage, and 17 are proposed;
were all to be realized, an additional 38 GW capacity would be added to the existing (2015)
99 GW of nuclear capacity. Of the ﬁve under construction, four are AP1000s, and the other is
an ESBWR. Of the 17 proposed, 10 are AP1000s, 2 are EPRs, 1 is an ESBWR, and 4 are
ABWRs.
In addition to the Generation III+ and eneration IV reactors, much activity is being devoted to
small light-water reactors (LWRs), also called small modular reactors (SMRs). SMRs are deﬁned
as reactors with 300 MW or less output and designed to be fabricated using factory modular
production techniques to capture manufacturing economy of scale and to promote shorter
construction times. Design characteristics for SMRs include high levels of passive safety features
(for malfunctions). Many are to be placed below ground level, providing a high resistance to
terrorist threats. SMRs using water as a moderator mostly use <5% enriched uranium and
possess refueling intervals of 6 years or less. Indeed, SMRs offer longer fuel cycles (time between
refueling) than larger, conventional designs. They are similar in technology to most power and
naval reactors.
SMRs can be used for generating electricity (in isolated areas) or for producing high-
temperature thermal energy, although some utilities are investigating using LWRs in their
capacity suites. SMRs are often viewed as complementing large nuclear power units by giving
utilities more power plant options by (1) reducing capital costs and project risks, (2) improving
passive safety technology, and (3) providing replacements for aging fossil-fuel generating

www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-power-reactors/small­
nuclear-power-reactors.aspx) contains a discussion of SMRs and an extensive list of current/
proposed SMRs as well as a summary of deployed units. IAEA (2014) presents a detailed
description of SMRs from many countries.
The increasing activity and interest in ﬁssion nuclear power plants is reﬂected in books on the
subject. White (2005) and Sweet (2006) advocate nuclear power as an alternative to fossil-fuel
electrical generation, and Shultis and Faw (2008) and LaMarsh and Baratta (2001) are editions of
classical nuclear engineering textbooks.
Adams (2005) provides a lucid, documented assessment of the use of ﬁssion power in a
sustainable scenario and concludes that ﬁssion power has the potential to provide a large
fraction of the world’s energy for many years. He recommends the use of high-conversion
reactors, reactors in which the production of ﬁssile isotopes exceeds the consumption of ﬁssile
isotopes (breeder nuclear reactors), and the reprocessing of spent and “reburning” nuclear fuel.
If a majority of the heavy isotopes can be made to ﬁssion, then most of the remaining radioactive
waste would decay to a radioactive level less than the original ore in 300 years. Adams points out
that signiﬁcant technical and political challenges must be met in order for this minimum-waste,
sustainable scenario to be realized.
15.4 Fusion Power
Fusion power has long been viewed as the panacea of the world’s energy problems, and much
effort and research over an extended period of time has been devoted to fusion power. A number
of books (Harms et al., 2000; Freidberg, 2007; McCracken and Stott, 2012) and research projects
demonstrate the optimism about eventual fusion power. A brief overview of fusion is thus
appropriate here.
Fusion was brieﬂy mentioned in Section 15.2 as one of three categories of nuclear reactions,
and Equation 15.8 was presented as an example of a fusion reaction. Indeed, the primary source
of energy from the sun is the fusion of ordinary hydrogen 1
1H into helium 4
2He through a series of
fusion reactions;, the results can be summarized as

which occurs at the sun’s core temperature of 15 × 106 K.

likely ones and their energy releases are summarized as follows:

As indicated in the fusion reactions in Equation 15.22, energy is released. The energy release results
from the difference in the masses of the reactants and products as with ﬁssion nuclear reactions.
Consider an example, which is based on the second of the reactions listed in Equation 15.22.

Fusion has the great advantages over ﬁssion of not requiring high mass number radioactive
isotopes as a fuel and not yielding radioactive products (thus alleviating the spent fuel storage/
reprocessing problem). Moreover, as the fusion reactions of Equation 15.22 demonstrate, the
“fuel” is deuterium (2
1H) and tritium (3
1H), isotopes of hydrogen in which the nucleus contains
two and three protons respectively. Although the individual ﬁssion of an atom of 235
92 U releases
more energy (∼200 MeV) than a single fusion reaction (3–18 MeV), on a mass basis the energy
release ratio (fusion to ﬁssion) is about seven to one (Sorensen, 1983). The great appeal of fusion
over ﬁssion and ﬁssion over chemical reactions (burning) is well summarized on the Princeton
Plasma Physics Laboratory web site (www.pppl.gov), from which Table 15.4 is adapted.
Table 15.4 delineates the fuel requirements for a 1000 MW power plant operating continuously
for a year using coal (black or brown), nuclear ﬁssion, and nuclear fusion. While the fuel
consumption of coal-ﬁred power plants is measured in millions of tonnes and the fuel
consumption of nuclear ﬁssion plants in tonnes, the fuel consumption of a fusion plant is

150 kg of deuterium and 500 kg of lithium
measured in kilograms! The deuterium part of the fusion fuel requirement poses little problem
since about 1 part in 5000 of sea water is deuterium. Since the oceans contain ∼1015 tons of
deuterium, the deuterium supply for fusion is essentially unbounded. The lithium requirement
is more problematic, but, compared with other energy sources (coal and uranium), is also
plentiful.
Why, then, with all the possibilities, has fusion power not been realized? The requirements for
fusion are very difﬁcult to attain and sustain. Any of the fusion reactions listed in Equation 15.22
requires the individual fuel nuclei to come together and then fuse. But all nuclei have positive
charges; thus, the nuclei will repel each other unless the kinetic energy of each nucleus is
sufﬁcient to overcome the Coulomb repulsive force. For fusion to occur, the speed of each
nucleus must be very high, and very high kinetic energies corresponds to very high temperature,
since on average (Shultis and Faw 2008)
Eavg  kT
(15.23)
Depending on the fusion reaction, Eavg values of from a few to several hundred kilo-electronvolts
are needed in order to ensure that the Coulomb force is overcome and the fuel nuclei can be in
position to fuse. The resulting temperatures range is (10–300) × 106 K. At these elevated
temperature, the reactants have been ionized, with all electrons stripped from their orbits
about the nucleus, and a plasma results. The plasma consists of electrons and the positively
charged nuclei. The basic problems for a fusion reactor are threefold: (1) how to generate the
high temperatures required (basically solved), (2) how to contain the hot plasma (in progress),
and (3) how to achieve the required density of the plasma so that fusion takes place (in progress).
Of the fusion reactions listed in Equation 15.22, the one of most interest is the deuterium–
tritium reaction:
2
1H  3
1H ! 2
4He  1
0n  17:59 MeV
(15.24)
The individual energy release per fusion reaction is high (17.59 MeV). The minimum tempera­
ture required for deuterium–tritium fusion is 45 × 106 K; however, the generally accepted
temperature for a deuterium–tritium fusion power plant is about 100 × 106 K. The deuterium–
deuterium fusion reaction, with only 4.03 MeV energy release, requires 500 × 106 K – a factor of
ﬁve higher than the deuterium–tritium fusion reaction. Since tritium,3
1H, has a half-life of only
12.33 years, none occurs in nature. Thus, part of the problem with a fusion reactor using the
deuterium–tritium reaction is providing the tritium. Fortunately, tritium is relatively easy to
produce by means of neutron capture by lithium. The ﬁssion reactions of the two isotopes of
lithium are as follows:

But how is a plasma at 100 × 106 K contained? Two methods have been proposed and
extensively researched: (1) magnetic containment and (2) inertial containment. Since the
electrons and ions are charged, the plasma can be conﬁned by a magnetic ﬁeld. In magnetic
containment, the magnetic ﬁeld forces the particles to follow spiral paths. Consequently, the
charged particles in the plasma are conﬁned by the magnetic ﬁeld and do not strike the fusion
reactor walls. Inertial conﬁnement is based on using high-energy lasers to vaporize, ionize, and
ignite the fusion reaction in such a short period of time (∼1010 s) that the fuel does not have an
opportunity to expand – hence it is conﬁned by its own inertia. Extensive research has been
accomplished using both techniques, but magnetic conﬁnement is the more promising of the
two. The production of electricity from fusion has been a dream for more than 70 years, but the
technical problems are daunting. Nonetheless, signiﬁcant progress has been made in attaining
fusion, but much work is still required before a fusion power plant becomes a reality.
In what form might a fusion power plant appear? Figure 15.12 is a schematic of a fusion power
plant. The overall shape of the fusion reactor is toroidal, a requirement that results from the
magnetic containment and the helical path the charged nuclei must traverse. In fusion research
projects, toroidal fusion vessels are called “tokamaks.” Tokamaks at the Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory and the Joint European Torus (JET) are perhaps the best known of these
research vessels, but tokamaks are being used for fusion research in a number of countries.
The neutrons (14 MeV) are absorbed in the lithium-containing breeding blanket that
surrounds the fusion chamber. Neutron capture by the lithium nucleus results in ﬁssion
nuclear reactions that generate (or breed) tritium, a required fuel (see Equation 15.25). The
tritium is separated and fed back into the fusion reactor for use as a fuel. As is evident from
Figure 15.12, a fusion power plant is much more involved than a ﬁssion power plant. If a
deuterium–tritium reaction is to occur, then lithium must be injected into the breeding blanket
so that tritium results. Unburned deuterium, tritium, and helium are recovered from the reactor;
the helium, which has commercial value, is removed and sold, and the deuterium and tritium are
reinjected. Energy is recovered from the reactor vessel and used to generate electricity.
But, the germane question is, “When will fusion power be a reality?” The most realistic (and
likely) answer is provided by a roadmap report from EUROfusion (EFDA, 2012). The plans
required to achieve power production at the few hundred MW level by the 2050 are detailed in
A sche matic  represen ta t ion of  a fu sion p ower pl ant, where  b lan ket, magnet coils, plasma heating current drive, divertor, and turbine generator are labeled.

the report. Widespread commercial generation of electricity by fusion would take place after
that time. The roadmap report is quite candid about the technical challenges remaining, and
the possibility of unforeseen problems that could delay commercialization, and presents a
realistic assessment of the needed technology for commercial fusion power. The International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program, a part of EUROfusion, involves using
the next-generation tokamak (discussed in the next paragraph) to resolve technical issues
needed for the production of fusion power. The ITER assessment of fusion progress (from
www.iter.org) is
Fusion research has increased key fusion plasma performance parameters by a factor of
10,000 over 50 years; research is now less than a factor of 10 away from producing the core
of a fusion power plant.
Although other organization and countries are at work on realizing fusion power, EURO-
fusion is arguably the leader. EUROfusion evolved from the European Fusion Development
Agreement (EFDA) organization. EFDA, now, EUROfusion, oversees the JET facility and is
charged with constructing the ITER, the next-generation research tokamak.
JET is currently one of the largest tokamaks in operation and has been known as the world’s
foremost tokamak machine for 20 years. In 1997 it successfully produced a peak power of
16 MW with 10 MW being sustained over a 0.5 s period (Wesson, 2000). The most signiﬁcant
fusion research project of the next few decades is the ITER program, a joint project funded by
many countries, including the USA and many European countries. The ITER project (www.iter
.org) has as its goals the development of equipment, techniques, and procedures required for
commercial fusion power generation, and is viewed as perhaps the last step before the
realization of commercial fusion power. Speciﬁcally, the ITER goals lie in the development
of plasma regimes of operation and in developing techniques to manage the plasma exhaust
heat. A second issue is concerned with the area of the tokamak wall that is exposed to the highest
heat and particle ﬂuxes: the divertor. ITER investigations will include divertor conﬁgurations
which could reduce the heat loads. Speciﬁcally, the ITER goals are fourfold (https://www.euro­
fusion.org/): (1) to produce more power than it consumes; (2) to maintain fusion plasma for up
to 8 min; (3) to test technologies needed for fusion power plants; and (4) to test and develop
concepts for breeding tritium from a blanket surrounding the plasma. Figure 15.13 is a cut-away,
same-scale rendering of the JET and ITER fusion reactor vessels. The ITER fusion reactor is
under construction at Cadarache, France. US participation and contributions for the ITER
program are detailed at www.science.energy.gov, https://burningplasma.org/, and www.usiter
.org.
The ITER program will be followed by the DEMO (Demonstration Fusion Power Reactor)
program, also by EUROfusion, that is viewed as the last step before commercialization of fusion
power. An excerpt from EUROfusion’s statement about DEMO is
The central requirements for DEMO lie in its capability to generate several 100 Megawatt
of net electricity to the grid and to operate with a closed fuel-cycle (i.e., to produce and
burn tritium in a closed cycle). A number of outstanding technology and physics
integration issues must be resolved before a DEMO plant concept selection is made.
Each of them has very strong interdependencies . . .
Were fusion power to become a reality, the energy economy of the world would be
dramatically changed. But, even barring unforeseen technical problems, fusion power is not
likely to be a reality for about 50 years. Thus, the concepts in this book retain their importance
for many years – perhaps even after fusion power is a reality.

Closure
Electricity from nuclear ﬁssion power plants represents a signiﬁcant percentage of the
electricity generated. Fission power plant technology is relatively mature, but questions
about safety issues, nuclear proliferation, and long-term radioactive waste disposal along with
a generally adverse political climate have clouded the future of ﬁssion power. Nonetheless,
energy security and greenhouse gas emission concerns have provided the impetus for
renewed consideration of new nuclear ﬁssion power plant construction, and many in the
electric power industry believe nuclear power will increase in importance and acceptance in
the next few decades.
Fusion power represents a solution to the world’s energy crisis and offers many advantages
over both nuclear ﬁssion and conventional fuel for electricity and power generation. However,
the technical problems are daunting, and even optimists in the fusion community suggest that
2050 may be as soon as fusion can be commercially exploited for power generation.

16.1 Transportation Energy Usage Alternatives to Internal 
Combustion Engines 
Figure 1.10 presents the end-point energy usages for the USA in 2014. Transportation accounted
for 28% of the energy used in the USA – more than the residential or commercial energy used.
Figure 16.1 shows the breakdown of transportation energy as a function of energy use by vehicle
type. Light trucks, cars and motorcycles, and other trucks account for 80% of the 2014
transportation energy usage in the USA. Aviation represents an additional 7% and has special
needs and standards. Boats and ships, trains and buses, military uses, pipeline fuel, and lubricants
make up for the remainder. Thus, cars, trucks, andmotorcycles representthe greatest potential for
signiﬁcant energy savings. This chapter examines how that potential might be realized.
Internal combustion engines (ICEs) were the dominant power source for motor vehicles for
most of the twentieth century. As automobiles were being developed in the late nineteenth
century, a number of power sources, including steam and electricity as well as ICEs, were
explored. Steam was too cumbersome, and electricity, with storage and control issues, was
beyond the technology of the day for mass-produced and mass-used vehicles. The ICE “won”
out because hydrocarbon fuels of high energy density could be supplied locally and because the
ICE technology matured rapidly enough to displace the other options. Kirsch (2000) contains an
interesting discussion of how electric vehicle usage might have been different had some
circumstances changed. However, the operating characteristics of ICEs and the Carnot
efﬁciency limitation of heat engines limit their overall operating efﬁciency. In the days of
cheap gas and little concern for greenhouse gas emissions, few economic or environmental
incentives existed for alternative power sources for vehicles. However, that started changing in
the 1970s, and alternatives to ICEs have been under serious consideration for a number of years.
Ehsani et al. (2010), Fuhs (2009), and Mi et al. (2011) are good textbooks devoted to hybrid
and electric vehicles. Additionally, a number of web sites contain useful information, although
care must be taken to ensure the accuracy of the information. A good place to start is to consider
what characteristics of ICEs, other than the Carnot limitation, result in inefﬁciencies. Figure 16.2
presents ideal torque and power functional forms for a power source in a motor vehicle. The
abscissa is the motor speed. The ideal performance is for constant power over a wide range of
motor speeds, ensuring that the engine operates at its best efﬁciency point. The torque then
becomes a decreasing function of speed (and is nearly hyperbolic with speed). At low speeds,
torque must be constant in order to avoid tire and road slippage and to provide the power
needed for vehicle acceleration, climbing, and towing.
Figure 16.3 illustrates the typical torque and power performance of an internal combustion
engine. The ideal and ICE performance curves are not very congruent. Because of these
mismatches, ICE vehicles have transmissions with different gear ratios and operate much of the

time with high speciﬁc fuel consumptions. Consider the power and torque characteristics of an
electric motor as illustrated in Figure 16.4. The electric motor power and torque characteristics
as a function of motor speed mimic those of the ideal in Figure 16.2. Electric motor torque and
power are well matched to the ideal torque and power. Up to a base speed, electric motors
provide constant torque; beyond the base speed, the power is constant and torque decreases
nearly hyperbolically with motor speed – in the same fashion as the ideal. Since electric motor
characteristics match those of the ideal, a transmission (gearing) is not needed.
Given the discussion in the previous paragraphs, three tactics emerge as candidates to improve
the overall energy efﬁciencies of motor vehicles: (1) change the engine to a non-heat engine with
characteristics closer to the ideal, (2) remove the engine and use only an electric motor, and (3)
combine the best features of an ICE and an electric motor in a hybrid system. Each of these will be
examined in Section 16.2, but before that some additional considerations are appropriate.
A hybrid-electric vehicle is deﬁned as a vehicle that contains an ICE and an electric motor and,
depending on the system conﬁguration (examined in Section 16.2), is capable of operating on
either or both. In a hybrid, the ICE is downsized from a conventional (ICE-only) vehicle in such a
fashion as to result in the ICE operating near it best efﬁciency point and being supplemented as
needed by the electric motor. A hybrid’s miles per gallon (mpg) is increased over that of a
conventional vehicle’s. Following Fuhs (2009), a conventional vehicle with a usage of M miles
per year and a gas mileage (in miles per gallon) of MPGC requires GC gallons per year
M

And a hybrid with a gas mileage of MPGH requires GH gallons per year:

If f is the fractional increase in miles per gallon by the hybrid, then

Consider an example using typical conditions for an SUV or pickup truck and a small, fuel-
efﬁcient vehicle.
Example 16.1
An SUV or pickup truck has a gas mileage of 20 mpg, and a small, fuel-efﬁcient vehicle
possesses a gas mileage of 32 mpg. Both are driven 15 000 miles per year. If the hybrid
versions have f  0:2, how many gallons of gasoline per year are saved? What are the miles

This simple example points out that an f  0:2, a mild hybrid modiﬁcation (see Section 16.2) to
a conventional vehicle, can lead to signiﬁcant fuel savings. Section 16.2 examines characteristics
of hybrid and electric vehicles.
16.2 Hybrid and Electric Vehicles 
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides deﬁnitions of a hybrid-electric
vehicle and an electric-motor vehicle; the following deﬁnitions were modiﬁed from the EIA
versions.
 Hybrid-electric vehicle. An electric vehicle that either (1) operates solely on electricity, but
contains an internal combustion motor that generates additional electricity or (2) contains an
electric system and an internal combustion system and is capable of operating on either
system.
 Electric-motor vehicle. A motor vehicle powered by an electric motor that draws current from
rechargeable storage batteries or other sources of electric power.
ICE technology is mature and well understood, with only incremental increases in efﬁciency
expected from technological innovations. Hybrid and electric vehicles are more complex than
ICE stand-alone vehicles. Depending on the conﬁguration, hybrid and electric vehicles can
feature ICEs, large battery capacities, electric motor-generators, regenerative braking accom­
modations, a myriad of energy-saving/–harvesting systems, and external electrical plug-in ports.
A striking feature of hybrid and electric vehicles is the extent and sophistication of the control
systems required to monitor/supervise/troubleshoot all the features. The increased number of
components, as well as the control protocols, required for hybrid and electric vehicles mean that
initial costs are higher, maintenance issues are more varied and complex, and component-
replacement costs are larger (and perhaps more frequent).

365 
16 Transportation and Hybrid and Electric VehiclesFigure depicting series hybrid system schematic, where the series system places the ICE and the electric motor in series with the drive train. The generator provides power to charge the battery as well as to power the electric motor. In the diagram, straight and curved arrows are representing current and torque, respectively.
Figure 16.5 Series hybrid system schematic.
Hybrid-electric vehicles will be considered ﬁrst. A hybrid contains an ICE (or a fuel cell) and
an electrical storage device, typically a battery, but a capacitor or a ﬂywheel can also be used.
Fuhs (2009) contains a particularly good discussion of many aspects of hybrid vehicles. A
characteristic of hybrids is the ability to harvest some of the energy used in accelerating the
vehicle by using regenerative braking – transforming kinetic energy to electrical energy by using
the “motor” as a generator. In addition to the regenerative braking feature, hybrids often possess
fuel-saving features such as engine-off during stops, electric-only propulsion, downsized
engines, and electric-motor vehicle launch since ICEs have low starting torque. An operat­
ing-design philosophy for hybrid-electric vehicles has the following tenets:
1) To operate the electric motor when possible (minimizes emissions/fuel required).
2) To use the ICE only when needed and, if possible, only at the best efﬁciency point (minimum
fuel consumption).
Hybrid systems may be conﬁgured as series, parallel, or compound; a vital component of a
hybrid system is the control interface between the engine and electric motor that permits
efﬁcient operation to be maintained.
A schematic for a typical series system is illustrated in Figure 16.5. The series system places the
ICE and the electric motor in series with the drive train. Additional elements are required to
generate electricity, to charge the battery, to provide the myriad control functions needed, and
to store recovered energy from options such as regenerative braking. These functions are
schematically indicated in Figure 16.5; in a speciﬁc vehicle the sequences/layout/interconnec­
tivities may differ. In a series hybrid, the ICE drives a generator, rather than drive shaft; the
electric motor is the only means of powering the wheels. Because the electric motor is directly
connected to the drive shaft, and is generally well matched in terms of power, torque, and speed,
a transmission is not required. The generator provides power to charge the battery as well as to
power the electric motor. If needed for acceleration or climbing, the motor can draw electricity
from both the generator and the battery. In regenerative braking, the motor acts as a generator
with energy recovered going either to the battery or to another energy storage device. A controls
suite, including electronics, is an integral part of any hybrid and is much more complex than for
a conventional vehicle. The more complex the hybrid’s operating options, the more complicated
the controls suite. The Chevrolet Volt is essentially a series hybrid, as are almost all diesel-
electric railroad engines.
Another common type of hybrid vehicle is the parallel. Figure 16.6 contains a schematic of a
typical parallel hybrid system. The key feature of a parallel hybrid is that both the electric motor
and the ICE are connected to the drive shaft. The same system elements are present as in the

366 
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications

series hybrid, including the controls function, but the interconnections are different. The motor 
and a large generator are often combined into a single unit. The battery can be recharged when 
the ICE power output is larger than that required for vehicle motion and during regenerative 
braking. Most parallel hybrids have a mechanical link between the ICE and the electric motor, so 
that the battery cannot be recharged when the vehicle is stationary. When only the electric 
motor is being used, or during regenerative braking, the ICE is either not running or idling. The 
ﬂexibility of a parallel-hybrid vehicle permits the following operating regimes: 
1) City driving – electric motor only. 
2) Road operation, low speed – ICE only. 
3) Road operation, higher speed or acceleration – ICE plus electric motor in parallel. 
4) Battery recharging – if ICE power output is higher than required for the vehicle speed, the 
excess can be used for battery recharging.
5) Regenerative braking – when decelerating or braking, the motor acts as a generator and
harvests kinetic energy.
The Honda Accord and Civic hybrids are parallel hybrids, but, due to poor sales, 2015 was the
last year the Civic hybrid was manufactured. The Honda Accord hybrid was completely
redesigned for 2016.
More common than either the series or parallel hybrid is the combined series and parallel
hybrid, also called the power-split hybrid. Figure 16.7 illustrates a schematic of a combined
Figure 16.7 Combined series and parallel (or power-split) hybrid schematic.

367 
16 Transportation and Hybrid and Electric Vehicles
hybrid. As might be expected, combined hybrids possess both series and parallel systems
architecture. The most signiﬁcant feature of a combined hybrid is that the ICE and the electric
motor both have direct connections to the drive shaft. In Figure 16.7, the connections for the
block “Control Suite” are not shown to avoid clutter in the schematic. Because of the increased
complexity of a combined hybrid, the system is more expensive and the control protocols are
more complex than for a parallel hybrid. This arrangement effectively decouples the power
supplied by the ICE from the power required to propel the vehicle. A combined hybrid utilizes a
smaller, more efﬁcient ICE since the electric motor can directly assist when high starting torque
is needed. The Toyoda Prius II, the best-selling hybrid in the USA (see Section 16.3), is a
combined series–parallel hybrid vehicle.
While series, parallel, and combined hybrid conﬁgurations are used to distinguish between
characteristics of hybrids, the concept of hybridness or hybridization is also used to distinguish
hybrid characteristics. Hybridness is deﬁned as the ratio of the total power of the electric motors
divided by the sum of the power of the electric motors and the power of the ICE:
Power of all electric motors
H 
(16.5)
Power of all electric motors  ICE power
The dominator value of Equation (16.5) is not necessarily the total power available to the hybrid
vehicle as the peak power for the electric motor and the ICE may not coincide at the same
vehicle speed. A small value of H correspond to “mild” hybridness, while a value near 0.50 is
described as “full” hybridness. A value of H  1 signiﬁes the vehicle has only an electric motor
(no ICE). An H  0:75 means large electrical power compared with the ICE power with a large
(and heavy) battery.
Example 16.2
Using information from the Toyota web site on the Pruis, estimate the hybridness of the
Toyota Prius. 
Solution
A convenient web address is http://www.toyota.com/prius/features/mechanical_ 
performance/1223/1225/1227/1229, from which the ICE engine speciﬁcations are1.8-liter 4­
cylinder DOHC 16-valve with variable valve timing; 73 kW, 5200 rpm
And the electric motor speciﬁcations arePermanent magnet AC synchronous motor; 60 kW
The hybridness is
Power of all electric motors
60 kW
H 

 0:45
Power of all electric motors  ICE power
60 kW  73 kW 
Not surprisingly, the Toyota Prius is considered a full hybrid. 
Hybridness is a continuum from H  0 for a conventional vehicle to H  1 for an electric-
motor vehicle. Figure 16.8 delineates the nature of that continuum. A “mild” hybrid is
dominated by the ICE, while in “full” hybrids the ICE and electric motor outputs are balanced.
A hybridness much greater than 0.5 is typically designated as a “plug-in hybrid vehicle” (PHEV),
meaning that the ICE power is much less than the electric motor power. As the hybridness
increases from H  0:5, a series conﬁguration is generally used; while as the hybridness
decreases from H  0:5, a parallel conﬁguration is likely. The “heights” of the shaded triangles
depict the relative values of the power contributions from the ICE and the electric motor.
Figure 16.8 is useful not only for distinguishing between hybrid conﬁgurations, but also to
introduce the PHEV and electric vehicle concepts.

Figure 16.8 The hybridness continuum.
An electric-motor vehicle must contain an onboard source of electricity, typically a battery or
a fuel cell, as well as an electric motor (or motors). A schematic of an electric vehicle with a
battery is presented in Figure 16.9. Although a battery is illustrated in the ﬁgure, the battery
could be replaced by another energy storage device such as a ﬂywheel or capacitor bank. As with
hybrids, the complexity of the controls function is determined by the features exploited for
energy recovery. External power must be available to recharge the storage device. Part of the
appeal of an electric vehicle is that the external power can be supplied by a number of sources,
including renewable resources such as wind and solar. The Nissan Leaf, with more than 150 000
units sold by fall 2015, is the world’s best-selling electric-motor vehicle. The Leaf comes with an
80 kW electric motor and a 24 kW h battery. For electric vehicles, a miles per gallon equivalent
(mpge), based on the external energy source is often stated; the Leaf mpge is 126. The
Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) listed 43 electric motor vehicles
available in the USA in the fall of 2015. In addition to mostly small cars, a few buses and small
trucks were included. The Transportation Energy Data Book (Davis et al., 2015) contains an
itemized list of speciﬁc models, along with their salient features, from each manufacturer.
The PHEV is the remaining category from Figure 16.8. A PHEV is often called a range
extender because its primary purpose is to extend the range of an electric-motor vehicle. A
PHEV, typically a series hybrid, has a hybridness value greater than 0.5, with 0.75 or larger likely.
Figure 16.5, with an external charging connection, is appropriate for a PHEV schematic. Since
the H values are large, the ICE power is small compared with the battery power.

Care should be exercised in interpreting this result. This is the per trip increase in distanced
traveled, indicating the added distance traveled by the addition of the ICE on a single battery
charge. Many PHEV advertisements show several hundreds of miles between fuel tank reﬁlls,
but the number of miles traveled between fuel tank ﬁll-ups involve many trips.
The Department of Energy AFDC listed 24 PHEVs available in the USA in the fall of 2015; all
are passenger cars. Additionally, the Transportation Energy Data Book (Davis et al., 2015) contains
an itemized list of speciﬁc models, along with their salient features, from each manufacturer.
By the usual deﬁnition, a hybrid vehicle is one that utilizes more than one form of onboard
energy for propulsion. On that basis, a fuel cell vehicle can be a hybrid since electricity can be
supplied to the motor by both the fuel cell and the battery. A fuel cell vehicle, however, is
always an electric-motor vehicle. Figure 16.10 presents a modiﬁcation of Figure 16.5 (series ICEA schematic diagram depicting fuel cell electric vehicle system that consists of control suite, battery, energy storage, fuel cell, and motor/generator.

conﬁguration) for a fuel cell electric vehicle. Since the fuel cell produces electrical power,
prospective fuel cell hybrids are all expected to use series conﬁgurations with the ICE-generator
replaced by a fuel cell. An issue with fuel-cell-powered vehicles is the availability of hydrogen
refueling stations, so fuel cell vehicles are viable only in regions where a hydrogen refueling
infrastructure exists. About 50 hydrogen refueling stations were available nationwide as of 2015;
most are located in California. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (see Chapter 10) is the
likely fuel cell type to be used for such vehicles. Because of the limitation on hydrogen
availability, cost, reliability, and other issues, commercially available, fuel-cell-powered conven­
tional and hybrid vehicles are few. The AFDC listed 12 fuel-cell-powered vehicles in the fall of
2015. Included in the list were several buses, trucks, and passenger vehicles.
16.3 Hybrid and Electric Vehicles Past, Present, and Future 
The ICE has been the prevalent form of power for most road vehicles for many decades.
However, because of energy, environmental, and sustainability concerns, the last few decades,
individuals, corporations, and government agencies (local, state, and federal) have increasingly
become proponents of alternatives to ICEs. Personal beliefs, corporate policies, governmental
policies, and governmental incentives have resulted in a signiﬁcant, and increasing, market
penetration of alternative fuel vehicles. This trend is examined next.
The Transportation Energy Data Book (Davis et al., 2015) contains tabular data showing the
history of hybrid and electric vehicles sales and compares them with conventional vehicle sales.

Starting in 1999, the general trend for hybrid and plug-in vehicles sales has been increasing,
although a few years exhibit decreases (2008–2011 and 2014). The 2008–2011 decreases in
hybrid sales are attributed to economics; the 2014 decrease is likely due to falling gasoline prices
(see Chapter 17). Plug-in vehicle sales have monotonically increased.
The AFDC (http://www.afdc.energy.gov/data/) provides comprehensive data on all aspects of
alternative fuels, including hybrid and electric vehicle information. One interesting aspect that
AFDC compiles is hybrid and electric vehicles sales parsed by manufacturer. Figure 16.11
illustrates the history of hybrid vehicles sales by manufacturer. Several items are of interest in the
ﬁgure: (1) the number totals agree substantially with Table 16.1, (2) the consistent best seller, by
a signiﬁcant margin every year, has been the Toyota Prius, and (3) the number of manufacturers
offering hybrid vehicles is substantial and increasing.
Figure 16.12 provides essentially the same information for plug-in vehicles as does Figure 16.9
for hybrid vehicles. The number of plug-in electric vehicles sold is about an order of magnitude
less than hybrid vehicles, but on a year-to-year basis, the trends for plug-in vehicle sales track the
sales of hybrid vehicles. The number of manufacturers offering plug-in electric vehicles has
increased since 2010, but unlike the sales of hybrids, no single manufacturer has been as
dominant as the Toyota Prius has for the hybrid vehicles.A bar graphical representation for plug-in electric vehicle sales history and manufacturers, where number vehicles sold (in thousand) is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–15 and years on the x-axis on a scale of 12/2010–12/2014.

Between the AFDC web site and the Transportation Energy Data Book (Davis et al., 2015), a
rather complete listing of individual hybrid and electric vehicle models can be obtained.
However, the AFDC web site offers interactive features that enhance the information available.
Some features of the web site are examined in the next paragraph.
One useful interactive feature of the AFDC web site is the capability to identify speciﬁc
manufacturers and models by category. The AFDC web site for ﬁnding speciﬁc vehicles is http://
www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_availability.html. Selecting either “Hybrid electric vehi­
cles,” Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,” All-electric vehicles,” or “Electric drive vehicles” will open
a page containing a list of Fuel/Technology options and Class/Type options as well as pull-down
menus for “Manufacturer-Light Duty” and “Manufacturer-Med & Heavy Duty.” The Fuel/

indicated as a total and then a photograph and a short description of salient features of each of
the selected vehicles is presented. For example, if “Plug-in Hybrid Electric” is selected as the

A photograph from company literature accompanies each vehicle. As Figures 16.9 and 16.10
indicate, hybrid and electric vehicle commercial availability is continually changing, so that a
web site that is updated frequently is a valuable source for information on alternative fuel
vehicles.
What is the future for hybrid and electric vehicles? In 2012 the Department of Energy initiated
EV Everywhere, an umbrella effort to increase the adoption and use of plug-in vehicles with the

technical goal of having the USA by 2020 becoming the ﬁrst nation to produce electric vehicles
that are as affordable as conventional vehicles were in 2012. Details are available on the EV
Everywhere website at http://energy.gov/eere/eveverywhere/about-ev-everywhere and in “EV
Everywhere Grand Challenge Road to Success” (DOE, 2014). EV Everywhere research focuses on
advanced batteries, electric drive systems, and lightweight materials with the following goals:
1) Vehicle weight reduction – reduce vehicle weight by nearly 30% (includes body, chassis,
interior, and electric drive components).
2) Electric drive system – reduce cost from $30/kW in 2012 to $8/kW in 2020 (1.4 kW/kg,
4 kW/L, and 95% efﬁciency).
3) Battery – reduce cost from $500/kW h in 2012 to $125/kW h in 2020 (250 W h/kg, 400 W h/
L, and 2 kW/kg).
Storage and retrieval of electrical energy is difﬁcult to accomplish economically; indeed, the
storage and retrieval of a kilowatt-hour of electricity is one of the most expensive endeavors in
energy engineering. Refer to the battery discussion in Section 9.4 for additional information
relating to storage-retrieval issues. The EV Everywhere battery goals are daunting; nonetheless,
signiﬁcant progress has been made. Figure 16.13, taken from the EERE overview of the advanced
battery program in 2014 (Howell, 2014), demonstrates that progress in terms of cost and energy
density. The symbols represent different size and capacity (14 kW h, PHEV, to 40 kW h, EV)
batteries under development, and the costs were estimated based on 100 000 battery packs per
year production.
The economics of plug-in and electric vehicles is determined almost entirely by the battery
cost, initial and replacement. Battery storage energy density is low, meaning that a large (and
heavy) battery network is needed to store a meaningful quantity of electrical energy. Batteries
also have a ﬁnite life in terms of discharge–recharge cycles, so that replacements are needed.
Muller (2012) concludes that while full hybrids make economic sense, pure electric vehicles do
not. Indeed, he estimates that the battery purchase-replacement cost, on a per mile basis,
exceeds the cost, on a per mile basis, of electricity required to recharge the battery. Muller’s

numbers can be juggled, but the results will be the same: battery storage expense is a pacing
economic consideration for electric vehicles.
The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2015 (EIA, 2015) examines scenarios and makes projections
for future energy use and likely technological improvements. One of the topics considered is
hybrid and electric vehicles. Vehicle price and fuel economy are delineated in Figure 16.14 from
2015 to 2040 for ﬁve different alternative fuel vehicles. The gasoline hybrid is a mild hybrid with
the ICE power larger than the electric motor, while the electric–gasoline hybrid is a full hybrid.
The PHEV10 and PHEV40 are for vehicles with a 10 mile range and a 40 mile range respectively,
and the electric vehicle (EV100) range is 100 miles. All ﬁve different vehicle types are projected
to have improvements in fuel economy (expressed as miles per gallon) from 2015 until about
2025 when miles-per-gallon values essentially plateau. The EV100 is expected to have the least
improvement in fuel economy. For the plug-in types, the fuel economy improves as the electric-
only mileage values increase, with more than 125 mpg (equivalent) for the EV100. The costs of
the gasoline–electric and electric–gasoline types are projected to exhibit only modest increases
(constant dollar) from 2015 to 2040. The plug-in vehicles (PHEV10, PHEV40, and electric) are
expected to cost more than the non-plug-in types, but to decline in costs from 2015 to 2040. The
PHEV40 is anticipated to cost more than the PHEV10, primarily because of the larger battery
required for the PHEV40. The EV10 estimated cost is somewhat less than the PHEV40 over the
timeframe examined; even though a larger battery is required, the EV100 does not have an ICE,
and the controls requirements are simpliﬁed.
However, the EIA notes that fuel-efﬁcient technologies will enable vehicle manufacturers to
meet miles-per-gallon and emissions standards with vehicles that are predominantly gasoline
powered. Even though the prices of some vehicles using electric motors are projected to decline,
their relative cost-effectiveness does not improve. The EIA acknowledges that while the reasons
for vehicle purchases vary, not always on an economic basis, wider market acceptance would
require more favorable fuel economics. Based on the EIA 2040 projections (using the reference
or most likely fuel price scenario), a full hybrid would have a payback period of 13 years, a
PHEV10 a payback period of 27 years, a PHEV40 a payback period of 46 years, and a EV100 a
payback period of 19 years. However, were gasoline prices to increase signiﬁcantly from 2015 to
2040, then the payback periods decrease and the economics of hybrids and plug-in vehicles
greatly improve. Details are given in EIA (2015: 11).
Considering the preceding discussions based on the EV Everywhere initiative and the EIA
projections, where does that leave hybrid and electric vehicles? Muller (2012) makes a very

375 
16 Transportation and Hybrid and Electric Vehicles
cogent argument that full hybrids make sense, but that plug-in and electric vehicles do not make
economic, and perhaps environmental, sense. He points out that, thus far, the US use of gasoline
in automobiles has contributed only about 1/40 °C of the temperature rise, and that if the EIA
anticipated 60% increase in automobiles were to occur, the contribution for the next 50 years
would be only 1/25 °C, perhaps less if more stringent mileage mandates are adopted. Hence, the
environmental reason to displace gasoline is small. Moreover, if plug-in and electric vehicles use
electricity generated by fossil fuels, any overall reductions in emissions and greenhouse gases are
negated.
Prentiss (2015), who reaches some different conclusions than Muller (2012), argues that by
infrastructure changes and much more reliance on renewable resources (wind, solar, and
biomass especially), the USA could have achieve a sustainable energy economy with little
reliance on petroleum. Prentiss acknowledges the importance and difﬁculty of energy storage,
but expects technology to solve energy storage issues. With that assertion, electric vehicles then
become her recommended choice for personal transportation, with hybrids becoming her
choice for driving in urban trafﬁc.
All major automobiles manufacturers are preparing for futures that are heavily involved with
hybrid and electric vehicles. Ford, for example, announced in December 2015 that it was
investing $4.5 billion in electriﬁed (hybrid and electric) vehicles. The Ford web site (https://
media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/12/10/ford-investing-4-5-billion-in­
electriﬁed-vehicle-solutions.html) presents the details. Key elements include: (1) $4.5 billion
invested by 2020, (2) a new Ford Focus electric with a 100 mile range and 30 min recharging
(80%), (3) adding 13 new electriﬁed vehicles to their product portfolio by 2020, and (4)
expanding their electriﬁed vehicle offering internationally. Ford also announced that 120
new engineers would be added to their electriﬁed powertrain engineering program. Other
major automotive manufacturers, in the USA and worldwide, have announced similar plans and
are heavily invested in hybrid and electric vehicles.
16.4 Closure 
Hybrid and electric vehicles have been examined and discussed. The degree of displacement
of gasoline-only powered vehicles by plug-in and electric vehicles is uncertain as of the fall
2016. The EV Everywhere initiative has as its primary goal the development of technology that
would result in plug-in and electric vehicles being economically competitive with gasoline
vehicles. This is a daunting task. The full hybrid is likely to continue to increase its market
share. Overall, the future price and availability of gasoline as well as federal mandates will
determine the depth of market penetration of hybrids, and especially plug-in and stand-alone
electric vehicles.

Hydraulic Fracturing, Oil, Natural Gas, and the New Reality
17.1
Introduction
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) deﬁnes hydraulic fracturing (http://www.eia.
gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=H) as “the fracturing of rock at depth with ﬂuid pressure.
Hydraulic fracturing at depth may be accomplished by pumping water into a well at very high
pressures.”
In the oil and gas industry, the usual abbreviation for hydraulic fracturing is “fracing.” In the
media, hydraulic fracturing is usually called “fracking” and generally connotes all steps involved
with enhanced or stimulated oil/gas recovery which involve hydraulic fracturing. The practice of
hydraulic fracturing has generated a signiﬁcant amount of controversy, and the “pro” and “con”
sides vehemently and emotionally defend their positions. Many in the oil and gas industry
believe fracking to be a pejorative term and prefer fracing for the hydraulic fracturing step of
stimulating reservoirs. Books and papers often avoid the controversy by simply using fracturing.
In Ahmed and Meehan (2012), one of the most respected textbooks on reservoir engineering,
neither fracing nor fracking is listed in the index, and they typically use fracturing – although in a
few instances (not in the index) frac is used.
When the preface to the ﬁrst edition of this textbook was written in the summer of 2009, retail
gas prices (87 octane) were approaching $4.00/gal. As this is being written, spring of 2016, retail
gas prices are less than $2.00/gal. What happened to cause this unforeseen price reduction?
The short answer is enhanced-stimulated oil/gas recovery using hydraulic fracturing and the
identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant natural gas resources, including those made available by fracturing,
in the USA. Figures 17.1 and 17.2 demonstrate how fracturing has resulted in the identiﬁcation
of crude oil and natural gas proved reserves well beyond what was expected near the end of the
twentieth century. The proved oil reserves in 2013 were close to the proved reserves in 1973. For
natural gas, the proved reserves in 2013 were 40% higher than in 1973. Webber (2013) discusses
the recent dramatic increase in proved reserves and enhanced oil and natural gas recovery and
concludes that market forces, government policy, and technological innovations came together
to provide the unexpected results. Indeed, in a perhaps optimistic view of fossil fuel reserves, BP
(British Petroleum) recently stated that the world is not likely to run out of oil anytime soon
(Reuters, 2015). The goals of this chapter are to examine the circumstances which led to the
additional proved reserves, to understand what hydraulic fracturing is in stimulated oil and
natural gas recovery, and to delineate the energy futures that are possible.

shale play.
 Tight oil. Oil produced from petroleum-bearing formations with low permeability that
must be hydraulically fractured to produce oil at commercial rates. Shale oil is a subset of
tight oil.
Figure 17.3 is a help in understanding the conventional and unconventional oil and gas
distinctions. Conventional is extracted by drilling into geologic formations which have
sufﬁciently large permeabilities that the gas can be obtained using conventional techniques.
Unconventional gas is extracted from reservoirs of very low permeability by hydraulic
fracturing and recovery using unconventional techniques. Section 17.3 will examine
unconventional hydraulic fracturing. Gas extracted by conventional means and not associ­
ated with a low-permeability reservoir, as in the upper left-hand corner of Figure 17.3, is
called conventional, non-associated gas. Depending on the geologic structure, as in the
middle, left-hand side of Figure 17.3, gas may be extracted using conventional techniques
from high-permeability regions of an otherwise low-permeability formation (e.g., shale);
such gas is called conventional, associated gas to distinguish it from conventional, non-
associated gas.
Although shale plays are not necessary for unconventional oil/gas extraction, the majority of
such extractions are expected to occur in shale formations. The availablity of shale plays is likely
to determine the potential for unconventional oil/gas recovery using hydraulic fracturing.
Figure 17.4 illustrates the prevalence of shale plays in the continential USA and shows current as
well as prospective locations amenable for hydraulic fracturing. The natural gas production
from different shale plays, identiﬁed in Figure 17.4, in the USA since 2000 is summarized in
Figure 17.5. The increase in shale gas production since 2000 is startling and is responsible for the
increase in natural gas production in the USA.

Shale plays in the world, including the USA, are highlighted in Figure 17.6. The estimates of
proved tight gas and oil reserves are quite large, and such reserves are mostly responsible for the
unexpected fossil-fuel reserves outlook. We next consider reservoir engineering concepts and
examine hydraulic fracturing.

Reservoir Engineering Concepts
Prior to discussing hydraulic fracturing, some important features of reservoir engineering are
needed. Reservoir engineering has become very sophisticated, very technical, and very effective,
especially when coupled with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. A
number of excellent reservoir engineering textbooks are available, as are a number of web
sites. Ahmed and Meehan (2012) and Economides et al. (2013) are frequently referenced; an
examination of either will conﬁrm the complexity of reservoir engineering. Since most oil and
gas production involves porous geologic formations, a good place to start is with the expression
of Darcy (in 1856), often called Darcy’s law, for ﬂow through porous media:
k dp
Q  A
(17.1)
μ dx
where Q is the volumetric ﬂow rate, A the cross-sectional ﬂow area, k the permeability, μ the
viscosity, and dp/dx the pressure gradient. Equation (17.1) is valid for laminar, steady-state,
incompressible, and homogeneous ﬂow in a porous medium. Figure 17.7 illustrates the
relationship between the variables and the sign convention in a Cartesian coordinate system.
Dimensional homogeneity requires the units of permeability be length squared; the SI SI unit
for permeability is square meter, but a more practical unit is the darcy. By deﬁnition, a darcy isA pressure-distance plot depicting Darcy’s law interpretation. The direction of flow is from pressures p1 to p2. Width between p1 and p2 is dx.

the permeability that results in a volumetric ﬂow rate of 1 cm3 across an area of 1 cm2 with a
pressure gradient of 1 atm/cm and a viscosity of 1 cP. The millidarcy (md) (1 d  1000 md) is the
commonly used unit for permeability, especially in the oil and gas industry, and the conversion
factor from the SI units to the darcy is 1 d  9:869  1013 m2. Interestingly, the plural of darcy
is darcys. A Guide to Shale Gas (Energy Institute, 2015) provides a cogent overview of
permeability values as related to hydraulic fracturing. Figure 17.8 is adapted from their
approach. The permeability can be as high as 100 000 d for gravel to as low as 0.0001 md
for granite. The ﬂow rate as predicted by Darcy s law (Equation (17.1)) is directly proportional to
the permeability k. Going from a 1.0 md play to a 0.01 md play means that the ﬂow rate is
reduced by 99%. Thus, the need for hydraulic fracturing for low-permeability plays.
Reservoir engineering is a complex topic. Ahmed and Meehan (2012) categorize the
complexity of reservoir ﬂows by considering four attributes: (1) types of ﬂow, (2) ﬂow regimes,
(3) reservoir geometry, and (4) ﬂuid phases. Each attribute is further subdivided as follows:
1) Types of ﬂuids in a reservoir
a) incompressible
b) slightly compressible
c) compressible
2) Flow regimes
a) steady state
b) unsteady state 
c) pseudosteady 
3) Reservoir geometry 
a) radial ﬂows
b) linear ﬂows
c) spherical and hemispherical ﬂows
4) Number of ﬂuids in a reservoir
a) single phase
b) two phase
c) three phase.
In Ahmed and Meehan (2012) and Economides et al. (2013), several hundred pages are
devoted to details of the preceding as applied to reservoir engineering. These details are well
beyond the scope of this book; however, an examination of two examples is useful both to
capture an understanding of some ﬂows and to discuss the units commonly used in the oil and
gas industry.
Consider the radial ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid; the geometry is illustrated in Figure 17.9.
Ahmed and Meehan (2012) develop, starting with Darcy’s law, the following expression for the

where the 0.007 080 is needed to reconcile the “ﬁeld units” with conventional units. The
variables in Equation (17.2) with the associated ﬁeld units are as follows:
Qo 
oil ﬂow rate (STB/day – Stock Tank Barrel is 42 US gallons, liquid)

The values used in this example are typical of reservoir conditions and represent reasonable
results. Of special note is the use of “ﬁeld units” in the expressions.
Example 17.1 represented conditions typical of oil recovery. But also of interest is the
recovery of gas. The volumetric gas ﬂow rate for radial ﬂow of a compressible ﬂuid, using the
“pressure-squared method,” is developed from Darcy’s law in Ahmed and Meehan (2012) and

The pressure-squared approach as presented in Equation (17.2) is generally considered to be
accurate for pressures less than 2000 psia, but the results of this example are within about 2% of
the much more involved exact solution. Equations (17.2) and (17.4) serve well for illustrative
purposes. A number of observations are pertinent for Examples 17.1 and 17.2: (1) units of
individual quantities are not carried in the calculation since the “0.007 080” and “1422” implicitly
account for the ﬁeld units; (2) the units for all quantities must be the ﬁeld units consistent with
the original development; (3) magnitudes can be large; (4) signiﬁcant information (e.g., μ, Z, k,
Bo) speciﬁc to a given site must be available; and (5) assumptions are important.
From Figure 17.8, permeabilities of 100 md and 65 md would be considered “large” and be
congruent with reservoirs for which conventional recovery procedures would be appropriate.
However, in Example 17.2, if the permeability were 0.065 md, a thousand time less, then the
production from such a tight reservoir would be only 38 Mfsc/day (all other parameters being
the same), a number that is so small as to be economically unfeasible. Hydraulic fracturing
would be needed to economically recover gas from such a tight reservoir. Hydraulic

386
Alternative Energy Systems and Applications
fracturing essentially increases (dramatically) the effective permeability of a reservoir,
rendering it feasible for oil/gas recovery.
17.4 Oil and Gas Recovery from Tight Plays
Hydraulic fracturing is only part of the reason why recovery of oil/gas from tight plays has become
economically feasible. Webber (2013) identiﬁed technological innovation, market forces, and
government policy as components of the recent increase in oil and gas production and proved
reserves. Perhaps the most important technological innovation was made by oilmen George P.
Mitchell (Crawford, 2013), in the 1980s, when he combined two existing technologies, horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing, to makeoil and gas recovery economically feasible from tight plays.
Horizontal drilling is important because instead of drilling multiple wells into a relatively
shallow play that will “pay,” horizontal drilling permits one well to be drilled and multiple,
horizontal bores to extend for thousands of feet, opening up much more of the play for oil/gas
recovery from a single well. Hydraulic fracturing was developed shortly after World War II as a
technique to “stimulate” the production of oil from conventional oil reservoirs. Typically in
hydraulic fracturing, water (with some additives) is pumped at pressures sufﬁciently high to
fracture oil-bearing formations, resulting in additional production. How does the combination
of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing produce oil/gas from tight plays?
A number of governmental agencies, companies, and associations discuss the stages or
sequences needed to produce oil/gas from tight plays. The Energy Institute (2015), NETL
(2011), Turcotte et al. (2014), Crawford (2013), Graves (2012), and Bell (2013), as well as a
number of web sites, have been consulted in the development of the follow discussion. Various
stages are cited by different sources, but all encompass the same procedures, just with some
procedures in different stages. Six stages are common; a six-stage procedure for extracting oil/
gas from tight plays includes:
1) well construction
2) horizontal drilling
3) well completion and stimulation
4) ﬂow testing
5) long-term production
6) project completion and reclamation.
Each of these topics will be discussed. Figure 17.10 provides an illustration with important
features associated with a typical hydraulically fractured well with a horizontal trace in a tight
geologic formation.
Starting at the top of the ﬁgure, representing the surface, are indications of a private water well
and a municipal water well, both designated as “USDW” (underground source of drinking
water). A USDW must contain less than 10 000 mg/L of dissolved solids. The initial vertical
wellbore is illustrated and transitions to a horizontal bore in the play of interest. Separating the
surface and the horizontal bore are several geologic layers (extending over many thousands
of feet depth), many of very low permeability, which effectively blocks any migration of ﬂuids
from the play to the surface. In the wellbore near the surface, steel casings, cemented in place,
line the bore and prevent any migration of fracturing ﬂuids from contaminating the USDW. The
wellbore is also lined with steel casings. The horizontal segment of the wellbore illustrates the
results of hydraulic fracturing by showing the fractures in the shale play in this illustration.
1) Well construction. A well site requires about 5 acres and an access road that is likely to have
heavy trafﬁc. The well is drilled in stages, with each diameter smaller and deeper than the
preceding one, forming a drill string. During the drilling process, drilling “mud” is circulated

through the drill string back to surface; the mud carries drill cuttings back to surface and
cools the drill bit. At each stage a casing, run to the drill location, composed of steel pipe is
hung from the wellhead. Cement is pumped down the casing to form a protective barrier, and
the integrity of the barrier tested. Portions of the wellbore near the surface may have two or
more layers of cement and steel casings. Figure 17.11 illustrates the general layout for a three-
casing arrangement. The intermediate casings may extend several thousands of feet from the
surface. The casing and cement provide a barrier to prevent drilling ﬂuids from contami­
nating the USDW and other water sources.
2) Horizontal drilling. As illustrated in Figure 17.10, as the play is approached, the drilling
direction is directed from the vertical to the horizontal as the wellbore enters the play.
Although sharp turns are possible, they exacerbate drilling issues, so gradual turns are the
usual. Once horizontal and into the “pay” part of the play, the wellbore may extend several
thousands of feet – generally much longer than the play is deep. The horizontal length in the
play determines the oil or gas recovery potential. Depending on the geology, a single surface
well may have two or more horizontal wellbores extending in different directions. Use of
multiple horizontal bores from a single wellhead minimizes the surface footprint.
The co ncent ric circ les are depi cting wellbore with multiple casings, where production casing, intermediate casing, surface casing, and annuli (cement filled) are indicated by arrows.

388

3) Well completion and stimulation. This step begins with the wellbore and involves hydraulic
fracturing to achieve oil/gas ﬂow from a tight play. Starting at the end of a horizontal
wellbore, the “toe,” segments of the bore are isolated into fracture stages with each stage
containing a number of perforation clusters. Within a stage, at each cluster location, the
casing is perforated, typically by explosives charges in a “gun,” until all clusters are
perforated. This phase is called “plug and perf,” and is the dual process of perforating
the casing and plugging the wellbore until the entire segment is ready for ﬂuid ﬂow. The plug
and perf process moves to the next fracture stage, where it is repeated at the next clusters.
When the plug and perf process is completed for a stage, hydraulic fracturing is initiated. The
gun is removed from the stage, the debris washed out, and hydraulic fracturing initiated. This
sequence is repeated for each stage until the sector of interest has been completed. Hydraulic
fracturing involves pumping under high pressure (thousands of pounds per square inch) a
series of fracturing ﬂuids, each formulated to accomplish a speciﬁc task in the fracturing
process. The fracturing ﬂuid, typically water with additives, is pumped through the casing
perforations, initiating cracks that create one or more fractures that extend into the
surrounding rock. A fracture may propagate for hundreds of feet until the high-pressure
pumping ceases.
Several ﬂuids are sequentially used to prepare and fracture the rock. Each is essentially a
dilute mixture of water with speciﬁc additives. The exact blends and additives vary as
functions of the site characteristics. The ﬁrst ﬂuid used is often acetic, a dilute mixture of
hydrochloric or muriatic acid, used to clear cement debris from the wellbore and dissolve
minerals from the open fractures near the wellbore. That is often followed by a low viscosity
water mixture called “slickwater.” Traditional hydraulic fracturing uses relatively low ﬂow
rates of high-viscosity ﬂuids; however, large ﬂow rates of slickwater have become the norm
for many fracturing applications. Both traditional and slickwater fracturing require high
pressures to accomplish fracturing of the rock. However, when fracturing takes place and the
pressure is reduced in preparation for oil/gas recovery, the fractures often collapse, rendering
the fracturing less effective. To avoid this, fracturing ﬂuids after the initial fracturing has been
accomplished are formulated with solid “proppants” that “prop” open the fractures. Prop-
pants are usually spherical, ﬁne-grained sand or ceramic materials of uniform size. The
proppant material is mixed with water and other additives and injected into the fractured
rock. The proppant load in the water varies depending on the characteristics of the fractured
rock. In addition to proppants, hydraulic fracturing ﬂuids can also contain biocides (to
control bacteria growth), scale inhibitors (to control precipitation of minerals), iron-
stabilizing agents (to maintain ferrous compounds in soluble form), and corrosion inhibitors
(to protect casing walls).When the hydraulic fracture is complete, fresh water is used to ﬂush
the excess proppant from the wellbore and prepare the fracture stage for production. Shale
wells may have as many as 25 fracture stages. Since each stage may require up to 500 000 gal
of water; a single sector can require more than 10 000 000 gal. When the fracturing process is
completed, a portion of the water ﬂows out of the well and can be recycled after processing to
remove harmful compounds.
Decisions about the details of any well stimulation, stages and fractures or ﬂuids, are not
arbitrarily made. Most companies have well-established procedures to ascertain what
decisions to make in order to maximize the beneﬁt-to-cost ratio. Ajayi et al. (2013) and
Crawford (2013) provide interesting insight into the effort and level of sophistication of
details of well stimulation. Crawford (2013) points out that Halliburton, one of the largest
companies involved in fracturing activities, has a number of PhD-level technical experts
engaged in making decisions and improving techniques to ensure that each hydraulically
fractured well returns its maximum economic potential. In an insightful paper, Ajayi et al.
(2013) describe Schlumberger’s (another large company in the fracturing business) efforts to

389
17 Hydraulic Fracturing, Oil, Natural Gas, and the New Reality
optimize the stage and perforation cluster distributions for maximum return. They reference
a computer program, Mangrove Completion Advisor, which has been validated as signiﬁ­
cantly improving stage and cluster distributions. The complexity of a play undergoing
hydraulic fracture is best described by a quote from Ajayi et al. (2013):
Hydraulic fracture growth is governed by the rock fabric and geomechanical properties of
the reservoir, the preexisting fracture network and prevailing in situ stress magnitudes,
and anisotropy.
The approach is not just to punch a hole and plug and perf, but to understand the
completion process and to take advantage of that understanding. Site preparation is
complicated, with many different functions required. Figure 17.12 provides a drawing of
a typical site during the fracture procedure. The wellhead occupies the center position;
around the wellhead are positioned the pumps required for the fracturing process, a blender
for the fracturing ﬂuids, and a control van. Storage is provided for ﬂuid storage, the proppant,
and any additives used. Figure 17.12 was drawn by DOE artist Joe Lindley. He drew a number
of line drawings illustrating different enhanced oil recovery (EOR) procedures and was active
in last part of the twentieth century: they are available on the NETL website at http://netl.doe.
gov/research/oil-and-gas/enhanced-oil-recovery/eor-process-drawings. Although Figure 17.12
shows the hydraulic fracturing to be in the vertical as opposed to the now more common
horizontal, the details and the relationships of the components at the surface are still valid.
Figure17.13isaphotographofasitewithmultiplewellheads.Thecongestionisapparent,butthe
photograph is essentially congruent with the schematic of Figure 17.12.
An interesting question is how long does the process of drilling, plugging and perforating,
and readying a well for production take? The general answer is that a typical well might take 3
or 4 weeks for site preparation, 4–6 weeks for drilling, 5–10 days for hydraulic fracturing, and
2 or 3 weeks for completion after fracturing.

4) Flow testing. As might be expected, once the well is ready for production, ﬂow testing to verify
the ﬂow rate and product characteristics are needed. A temporary separator vessel is used to
determine characteristics and ﬂow rates of the gas/oil recovered as well as the fracturing ﬂuid
that ﬂows back up the well. Oil recovered is delivered to a reﬁnery for further processing, and
natural gas is either harvested or ﬂared, depending on the purpose of the well.
5) Long-term production. When testing is complete, production starts and continues as long as
the economics are favorable. In many instance (Graves, 2012) the initial recovery rate
declines signiﬁcantly after a few years to 10–20% of the initial recovery rate. But a well may
produce at 10–20% of the initial rate for a number of years. Industry expectation is for
production runs of up to 20 years. Some wells may be restimulated after about 5 years to
increase production.
6) Shutdown and recovery. When production decreases to a noneconomic level and if restim­
ulation is not warranted, the site is shut down and the land returned to near predrilling
conditions.
The preceding has provided an introduction to the processes involved in extracting oil/gas for
tight shale plays. As discussed in Section 17.1, while the use of hydraulic fracturing in tight plays
is an undeniable economic success, environmental issues and other concerns have resulted in
the process becoming quite controversial. The internet contains a plethora of pro and con web
sites and articles. The issues and concerns include: (1) fracturing ﬂuids and other contaminants
ﬁnding their way into the water supply; (2) fracturing within geological plays resulting in
increased seismic activity; (3) the water required for hydraulic fracturing, perhaps as much as 10
million gallons per well, causing water shortages,; and (4) overburdening of local infrastructures.
There are other concerns, but these are frequently mentioned and have creditable responses.
Each will be examining separately.
1) Fracturing ﬂuids and other contaminants ﬁnding their way into the water supply. The US
Environmental Protection Agency has been assigned responsibility to assess this issue. A
draft report was issued in June 2015 (EPA, 2015). The following quote was taken from the
Executive Summary of this report:
Through this national-level assessment, we have identiﬁed potential mechanisms by
which hydraulic fracturing could affect drinking water resources. Above ground

391
17 Hydraulic Fracturing, Oil, Natural Gas, and the New Reality
mechanisms can affect surface and ground water resources and include water withdrawals
at times or in locations of low water availability, spills of hydraulic fracturing ﬂuid and
chemicals or produced water, and inadequate treatment and discharge of hydraulic
fracturing wastewater. Below ground mechanisms include movement of liquids and
gases via the production well into underground drinking water resources and movement
of liquids and gases from the fracture zone to these resources via pathways in subsurface
rock formations. We did not ﬁnd evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread,
systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States . . . The number of
identiﬁed cases where drinking water resources were impacted are small relative to the
number of hydraulically fractured wells.
2) Fracturing within geological plays resulting in increased seismic activity. Hydraulic fractur­
ing undoubtedly leads to an increase in seismic activity; however, virtually all are classiﬁed as
micro-seismic events, Richter scale values of less than 1, and are not detectable on the
surface. Turcotte et al. (2015) examined this concern and concluded that most micro­
seismic events caused by hydraulic fracturing are in the range 3 to 2 on the Richter scale.
Moreover, they assessed the probability of a Richter scale 4 seismic event as being 1015 to
109.
3) The water required for hydraulic fracturing, perhaps as much as 10 million gallons per well,
causing water shortages. Although the water used in hydraulic fracturing is signiﬁcant, the
overall quantity of water used for fracturing is small compared with the water use for other
purposes. The EPA (2015) draft report provides a cogent assessment:
Water is a major component of nearly all hydraulic fracturing operations. It typically
makes up almost 90% or more of the ﬂuid volume injected into a well, and each
hydraulically fractured well requires thousands to millions of gallons of water. Cumula­
tively, hydraulic fracturing activities in the United States used on average 44 billion gal of
water a year in 2011 and 2012, according to the EPA’s analysis . . . Although this
represents less than 1% of total annual water use and consumption at this scale, water
withdrawals could potentially impact the quantity and quality of drinking water resources
at more local scales . . .
The potential for impacts to drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing water
withdrawals is highest in areas with relatively high fracturing water use and low water
availability. Southern and western Texas are two locations where hydraulic fracturing
water use, low water availability, drought, and reliance on declining ground water has the
potential to affect the quantity of drinking water resources. Any impacts are likely to be
realized locally within these areas . . .
The potential for impacts to drinking water quantity due to hydraulic fracturing water use
appears to be lower – but not eliminated – in other areas of the United States. Future
problems could arise if hydraulic fracturing increases substantially in areas with low water
availability, or in times of water shortages.
Testa (2013) provides examples of hydraulically fractured water-availability issues in Texas
and presents interesting examples of how local residents assess EOR.
4) Overburdening of local infrastructures. Extensive EOR activities in an area can overwhelm
local and state governmental services. Williston, ND, is often cited as a modern boom town
because of the EOR activities in the Bakken shale play. Anyone passing through the town sees
the widespread evidence of effects of the increased EOR activities. The Williston experience
has even been a Smithsonian Channel subject. A typical well site requires many 18-wheeler

loads over likely two-lane, farm-to-market roads. Not only are the roads impacted, but safety
issues are compounded.
Other issues and concerns are also mentioned in conjunction with EOR in a region.
Fundamentally, issues and concerns with EOR activities are ongoing. The ﬁnal conclusions,
and attendant regulations, could signiﬁcantly impact EOR activities in the USA. This is not a
closed issue by any means.
17.5 The New Reality
On a yearly basis, the EIA provides an Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) that makes energy
consumption and production predictions for 25 years by examining six scenarios: (1) a reference
case, (2) low economic growth, (3) high economic growth, (4) low oil price, (5) high oil price, and
(6) high oil and gas resource. Table 17.2 summarizes the six scenarios. The 2015 AEO (EIA,
2015) reference case provides an overview of the expected energy future from 2015 until 2040 for
the USA. Figure 17.14 presents the reference case projections as well as the energy history from
Table 17.2

1980 through 2013. The energy usage is in quads. The actual energy usage data are congruent
with the details in Chapter 1. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspects of the energy projections are
the lack of signiﬁcant changes in either total consumption or the constituent contributors. The
total estimated energy use increases from slightly under 100 quad to slightly more than 100 quad
through 2040, and the percentage contributions shift by a maximum of 3%.
A prime concern in the USA has been the dependence on petroleum imports and its impact
on economic and political issues. Figure 17.15 illustrates the actual (history, 1980–2013) and
projected production and consumption (to 2040) for the reference case. From the mid-1980s
through about 2005, the difference between consumption and production widened; however,
from 2005 onwards the gap between the two narrowed. For the reference case, consumption and
production become equal by about 2030 with little difference between the two by 2020.
Considering that the gap between consumption and production by 2013 had narrowed to
about 10 quad/year, the effects of enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the USA have been
pronounced.
Figures 17.14 and 17.15 are for the reference case, perhaps the most likely scenario, but the
chaotic history of “energy” teaches us that unforeseen events can have dramatic effects on
energy cost and availability. The other ﬁve cases in the EIA AEO review alternate energy
scenarios. Since net energy imports are the difference between consumption and production,
the history and projections of net energy imports for the six cases are an effective gauge of the
importance of the six different energy scenarios. Figure 17.16 delineates the dramatic differences
between energy consumption and production for the various cases considered. The “history”
portion of the ﬁgure unequivocally demonstrates the effects of enhanced oil and gas production
since 2005. Except for the low oil price case, imports are projected to continue to decrease
through 2040. If the high oil price or the high oil and gas resource cases are followed, the USA
would become an energy exporting nation – quite a change from the 1980s dependence on
foreign energy imports.
Figure 17.17 contains similar information on natural gas imports (1012 cubic feet) for four
cases (reference case, low oil price, high oil price, high oil and gas resource). For all four cases,
natural gas imports decline through 2040. Indeed, for all cases considered, by 2015–2020, the
USA would become a natural gas exporting nation! Figure 17.18, which illustrates USs natural
gas production, is a companion ﬁgure to Figure 17.17. From 2005 to 2013, natural gas

production in the USA increased by 35%. The growth in production was driven by the
development of shale gas resources. In the reference case, shale natural gas production is
projected to increase by close to 59% by 2040. Natural gas is an attractive energy source because,
compared with many other fuels, it has relatively lower CO2 generation and a lower cost on a per
million British thermal unit basis. Figure 17.19 presents history and projections for shale gas
production. Comparing Figures 17.18 and 17.19 reveals that much of the future production is
attributable to shale gas. As evidenced by Figure 17.20, since 2005 natural gas cost per million
British thermal units has declined by nearly two-thirds. Projections of cost per million British
thermal units for the four cases from 2013 to 2040 show moderate price increases, except for the
high oil price case, and even in that case, in 2013 dollars, the price of natural gas does not reach
the 2005 level until about 2035. As in Chapter 1, the use of dollars cast in terms of a single year
(2013 for EIA AEO 2015) implicitly accounts for inﬂation by considering constant or chained
dollars. For the high oil and gas resource case, the price, in 2013 dollars, remains nearly through
2040.Figure depicting US natural gas costs (2013 dollars/million Btu) for four cases: high oil price, reference, low oil price, high oil and gas resource.

History and projections are denoted in the left- and the right hand sides of 2013, respectively. Three different curves are representing high oil price, reference, and low oil price.
Recent (since 2012) decreases in motor gasoline prices have been dramatic, as is evidenced by
Figure 17.21. For the reference case, gasoline prices (2013 dollars) do not reach the 2010 value
until 2037, and in the low oil price case, prices per gallon (2013 dollars) stay below the 2013 level.
The high oil price case monotonically increases. For the reference and low oil price cases the
USA is being given another chance, as in the 1980s, to utilize technology and conservation to
mitigate future energy “crises.” Perhaps the results will be better than earlier. The continued
importance of oil from fracturing endeavors (“tight” oil) is illustrated by Figure 17.22. The
production of tight oil has increased since 2005 and is currently about 5 million barrels per day.
The EIA predicts substantial continued contributions of tight oil from hydraulic fracturing, with
the reference case production reaching a plateau by about 2020. The high oil and gas case
monotonically increases through 2040.
Although coal is an abundant resource in the USA, politics, public perceptions, and emission-
control economics have signiﬁcantly impacted coal production since 2005. Figure 17.23
presents the history and projections for coal production for the six cases. Except for the
high oil and gas resource case, coal production for the other cases is predicted to rebound.
Indeed, for the high oil price case, coal production may well exceed the 2005 level by 2035.Figure depicting US tight oil production (106 barrels/day) for four cases. Years are plotted on the x-axis on a scale of 2005–2040. A vertical line is drawn from the year 2013. History and projections are denoted in the left- and the right hand sides of 2013, respectively.

Figure 1.16, the US coal ﬂow diagram (2014), shows that 92% of coal is used for electricity
generation. Considering the emissions issues for coal, increased natural gas reserves, and enhanced
oil and gas production, what mix of fuel sources will be likely in the future? Figures 17.24 and 17.25
help to answer that question. The history portion of Figure 17.24, the reference case, is congruent
with the details presented in Chapter 1. From 2013 to 2040, electricity production is predicted to
increase about 40% for the reference case; coal’s portion is decreased from 39% to 34%, nuclear is
reduced by 3%, renewable energy is increased by 5%, and natural gas increased by 4%. None of the
reference case’s predictions are startling. Figure 17.25 examines the breakdown of fuel types for
electricity generation in 2013 and projected in 2040. Except for hydroelectric power, the electricity
generation from other renewable sources is expected to increase – the amounts depending on the
speciﬁc case scenarios.
The projected price of electricity (2013 cents per kilowatt-hour) from 2013 through 2040 is
provided in Figure 17.26 for the six cases. The high oil and gas resource case electricity costs are

Alternative Energy Systems and ApplicationsA bar graphical representation for the breakdown of fuel types for electricity generation in 2013 and projected in 2040. Electric generation (109 kWh) is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0–1250. Five different types of energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biomass and waste are represented with different colors on the bars.
Figure 17.25 Renewable electricity generation (109 kWh) for the six cases for 2013 and 2040. Source: EIA (2015).
expected to be nearly constant through 2040, while the other ﬁve cases are projected to have
varying levels of price increases. But even for the high oil price case, the increase per kilowatt-
hour is only from 10¢ to 13¢. Hence, in terms of 2013 dollars, electricity is not expected to
dramatically increase in price.
As Figure 17.24 indicates, in 2013 fossil fuels provided 67% of the energy used in electricity
production. By 2040, for the reference case, the percentage of electricity generated by fossil fuels
is projected to be 66%, a decrease of only 1%. However, since electricity usage is expected to
increase by about 20% from 2013 to 2040, the quantity of fossil fuels used for electricity
generation increases signiﬁcantly. Thus, fossil fuel combustion product emissions attributable
to electricity generation will also increase accordingly, unless measures are taken to reduce/
capture/sequester/control the emissions. In late 2016, the National Academies released the
report The Power of Change that delineated ﬁndings and made recommendations in three
Figure 17.26 Average retail electricity price (2013 dollars/kWh) for the six cases. Source: EIA (2015).

399
17 Hydraulic Fracturing, Oil, Natural Gas, and the New Reality
prioritized categories: overarching, key, and other (National Academies of Sciences, Engineer­
ing, and Medicine, 2016). In the ﬁrst category (overarching) are two recommendations that are
more important than all the others. Also included are 10 key recommendations and eight key
ﬁndings. Twelve additional recommendations are made in the “other” category. The ﬁndings
and recommendations are presented in the Summary section of the report and are discussed in
detail in the remainder of the report. Essentially, The Power of Change ﬁndings and recom­
mendations address economic, legal, legislative, and technology issues whose resolution would
markedly enhance the production of “clean” electricity.
This section has examined the future of energy as projected by the EIA from 2013 through
2040. The impact of hydraulic fracturing and increased natural gas resources-reserves are
signiﬁcant and are examined in terms of the six cases (scenarios) delineated at the start of the
section. Because of enhanced oil and natural gas recovery, the energy future of the USA is
markedly different from what might have been expected in the late twentieth century.
17.6
Closure
However, even though hydraulic fracturing has alleviated some energy concerns, many issues,
problems, and concerns still exist. Fossil fuels are still ﬁnite, nonrenewable resources whose
combustion still produces CO2, a greenhouse gas. Hence, the topics of this textbook are very
germane for the future. The identiﬁcation of additional fossil fuel resources has essentially
provided more time to discover, implement, and develop other, more sustainable and more
greenhouse gas friendly energy resources.
