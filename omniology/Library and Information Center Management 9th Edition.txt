Preface
The first edition of this book was published in 1977. That edition, co-­authored 
by Robert D. Stueart and John T. Eastlick, was designed to fill a need for a 
basic management textbook for library and information science (LIS) stu­
dents. At the time it was published, ­there was ­little material available about 
library management, and LIS faculty who taught library management courses 
had ­either to assign textbooks intended for students in public administration 
or business management or to compile a reading list of selected material 
on management from vari­ous sources. During the more than 40 years since 
the publication of the first edition of Library Management, libraries and infor­
mation ser­vices have changed dramatically and each new edition of this 
textbook has reflected ­these changes in both libraries and in their external 
environment. The ninth edition of this text is very dif­fer­ent from the one that 
was published in 1977, but its purpose is the same—to provide in one vol­
ume a comprehensive introduction to all the most impor­tant functions in 
library management for not only LIS students but also for beginning library 
man­ag­ers.
Each edition of the book has introduced new material and features. In 
the early editions before the internet, a large portion of each volume was 
devoted to examples of forms, charts and documents used by man­ag­ers. More 
recently, ­those examples have been included in the companion Web site to the 
textbook. This new edition reflects the helpful feedback we have gotten from 
LIS faculty both in the United States and internationally who use the text­
book in their courses. In preparing this revision, the authors have continued 
to draw freely from writing and research in cognate fields, including busi­
ness management, public administration, and many areas of the social sci­
ences. Although all of our chapters have been revised and updated, we have 
expanded the chapter on bud­geting, with more real life examples and added 
a grant writing section to the fundraising chapter
This edition continues to provide numerous opportunities through case 
studies, role-­plays, and simulations for experiential learning to enable stu­
dents or beginning man­ag­ers to apply their knowledge to real world prob­lems 
or situations. In this latest edition, we have added more activities to allow 
students to interact with one another and to participate in managerial-­related 
exercises. In this new addition, each chapter begins with “Chapter Take­
aways” which lists the most impor­tant concepts covered in that chapter. 
Another new feature, “Management on the Job” is located near the beginning 

xiv  Preface
of each chapter and pres­ents up-­to-­date examples of the application of the 
management function covered in that chapter in vari­ous library settings. This 
edition, also has added two new features to the end of each chapter: first a 
“Practice What You Have Learned” section, that allows students to apply the 
concepts from the chapter to their own experiences, and second, a “Discussion 
Questions” section, that poses challenging questions for students to discuss 
with one another. More of ­these experiential activities such as in-­basket exer­
cises, case studies and simulations, which can complement and supplement 
the material presented in the book can be found on the volume’s companion 
Web site.
We hope that LIS faculty, students, and man­ag­ers ­will find the material 
in the volume helpful. We have enjoyed writing this ninth edition and hope 
that our book ­will provide insight and perspective on this impor­tant function 
of management in library and information organ­izations.

Acknowl­edgments
We would like to thank the many ­people have contributed to ninth edition of 
Library and Information Center Management. Readers of previous editions, 
including students, faculty, and prac­ti­tion­ers, have made useful suggestions 
and many have been incorporated into this latest edition. Colleagues through­
out the United States and the world have indicated the value of this text­
book to them and to their students. We are grateful for their encouragement 
and hope they ­will be pleased with the changes made in this edition.
Our appreciation goes Rebecca Vargha, the SLIS Librarian at the Univer­
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Monica Colon-­Aguirre from Simmons 
College SILS; and Elizabeth Fowler from the University of New Hampshire 
Library for their help in this latest edition. Brian Nussbaum and his team 
of talented student assistants at the IT desk at UNC–­SILS provided much 
needed assistance whenever needed. We are also grateful to Rachel Anne 
Spencer, who helped with the preparation of the manuscript. Our editor at 
Libraries Unlimited, Blanche Woolls, provided us with assistance throughout. 
We would also like to acknowledge other colleagues from Libraries Unlim­
ited, especially Emma Bailey, for their efficiency, assistance, and continuing 
encouragement to write yet another edition of this textbook.
In addition, we need to once again recognize the contributions of A. J. 
Anderson, who wrote several of the case studies used in the book and the Web 
site. Fi­nally, we again recognize Bob Stueart, friend and mentor, who first 
saw the need for a textbook in library management over 40 years ago and 
who coauthored the first seven editions of Library and Information Center 
Management. His work in library management continues to be an inspira­
tion to us.
Many library and information center man­ag­ers permitted us to repro­
duce documents that are used as examples in the book and the Web site, and 
we thank them. Their management practices and procedures make our dis­
cussions and illustrations of the issues and challenges more relevant and 
effective.
Fi­nally, we thank our husbands, Joe and Lennie, and our families for 
their help and encouragement during the writing of this manuscript. With­
out their support, the task would never have been completed.

Section 1
Introduction
It has become a cliché to say that constant change is the new normal, but we 
are certainly living in a period of time when the pace of change has increased 
dramatically. Organ­izations of all types are struggling to stay ahead of trans­
formations that often threaten their traditional ways of ­doing ­things, real­
izing that ­those organ­izations that do not adapt ­will likely not survive. In 
2015, Udo Gollub, a German entrepreneur and CEO, provided an in­ter­est­ing 
perspective on the consequences of not being able to adapt quickly. He used 
Kodak, which just a few years ago was a ­house­hold name in cameras and film, 
as an example of an organ­ization that was not able to adapt rapidly enough. In 
1998, Kodak employed over 170,000 employees and was the source of 85 ­percent 
of all photo paper sold worldwide. However, in just a few years its business 
model was completely destroyed, and the com­pany entered bankruptcy. Kodak 
was too slow to change in response to the advent of digital photography, which 
constituted a transformative change in the environment for photography. This 
change almost resulted in the demise of an organ­ization that had existed as 
a leader in its field for over 100 years. Gollub speculates that what “happened 
to Kodak ­will happen in a lot of industries in the next 10 years—­and most 
­people ­don’t see it coming.”1
Gollub described other transformative changes that he thinks ­will become 
mainstream in just a few years, advances that ­will pose the same threats to 
the traditional practices of many existing organ­izations that digital photog­
raphy did to Kodak. ­These are trends to which ­today’s man­ag­ers need to be 
responding to now if they want their organ­izations to remain ­viable. Some of 
­these changes are:
Software	
Organ­izations are now defined by soft­
ware and not by what they actually own. 
Uber is now the biggest taxi com­pany in 
the world, and Airbnb the biggest ­hotel 
com­pany. Uber owns no taxis and Airbnb 
no ­hotels.
Artificial Intelligence	
Computers are becoming exponentially 
better at defining the world. ­Legal and 

2  Introduction
medical advice is available from IBM 
Watson with higher accuracy than advice 
given by ­humans. Facebook now has soft­
ware that is able to recognize ­faces bet­
ter than ­humans can.
Driverless Cars	
In just a few years, driverless cars ­will 
be available to the public. This innova­
tion may bankrupt the traditional auto 
industry as new entrants such as Tesla 
and Google begin to envision cars as 
computers on wheels.
3D Printing	
The price of the least expensive 3D 
printer has dropped dramatically, and 
soon smartphones ­will be able to scan 
in 3D. For example, soon you ­will be 
able to scan your feet and print a perfect 
pair of shoes at home. Within a de­cade, 
10  ­percent of all goods manufactured 
­will be 3D printed.
Work	
In the next two de­cades, 70 to 80 ­percent 
of the jobs that now exist ­will dis­appear. 
­There ­will be new jobs, but it is less clear 
what they ­will be and how many ­there 
­will be.
Agriculture	
Farmers ­will be freed from working all 
day in their fields with the development 
of a $100 agricultural robot.
Currency	
Bitcoin ­will become mainstream and 
might become the default reserve 
currency.
Education	
The cheapest smartphone already costs 
only $10 in Africa and Asia. Soon almost 
every­one ­will own a smartphone that can 
provide access to first-­class educational 
information.
Solar	
Solar power ­will continue to grow expo­
nentially. The price of energy ­will drop so 
much that all coal companies ­will be 
defunct in a few years.
The changes listed above are all speculations, but they are grounded in 
real­ity. Although they may not occur within the time frame predicted by Gol­
lub, it is highly likely they all ­will occur. Most of them are already begin­
ning to happen. All organ­izations that exist ­today ­will feel the impact of one 
or more of ­these transformative changes and likely ­will be impacted by ­others 
that we are not yet able to foresee. Man­ag­ers are facing the need to stay 
ahead of ­these changes while at the same time encountering more competi­
tion in terms of funding and support than ever before. Some of the transfor­
mations faced by organ­izations are the result of demographic and other 
changes, but most have been the result of the dizzying pace of change in tech­
nology that has occurred in the past few de­cades.
Just as organ­izations ­were transformed ­after the advent of the indus­
trial revolution of the 18th ­century, we now are entering a new industrial 

Introduction  3
revolution. This new era has been given vari­ous names including the Digi­
tal Revolution, the Second Machine Age2 and the Fourth Industrial Revolu­
tion3, but what­ever you call it, the indications are that this new era is poised 
to bring fundament alterations the way we live and work. The first industrial 
revolution was triggered in the mid-1700s by the advent of the steam engine 
that allowed many pro­cesses that had previously been done by hand to be 
mechanized. The second arrived about 100 years ­later when electric power 
began to be used to drive mass production. The third industrial revolution 
began in the late 1960s and was based on electronic technology that provided 
new ways of generating, pro­cessing, and sharing information. The fourth 
industrial revolution, unlike its pre­de­ces­sors, is not based on a single technol­
ogy but instead is a coming together of a number of technologies; this fusion 
of technologies is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biologi­
cal spheres.4 As a report from the World Economic Forum states, “Develop­
ments in ge­ne­tics, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing 
and biotechnology, to name just a few, are all building on and amplifying one 
another. This ­will lay the foundation for a revolution more comprehensive 
and all-­encompassing than anything we have ever seen.”5
­Today’s organ­izations have already been affected by the changes brought 
about by the information technology associated with the third industrial rev­
olution. Few organ­izations have been transformed as much as libraries, which 
have experienced change in almost ­every area of responsibility and activity. 
­These already transformed organ­izations ­will face further changes during 
the Fourth Industrial Revolution. At least for the immediate ­future, librar­
ies ­will need to continue many of the legacy functions they have always per­
formed while at the same time implementing the new ser­vices needed to meet 
the information needs of the 21st ­century user. ­Today’s library man­ag­ers 
must be able to respond rapidly and flexibly to this new environment. Good 
management has always been impor­tant for libraries, but it ­will be even more 
critical as they face the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
This book examines the current management practices in libraries and 
other types of information agencies. It ­will discuss both current thinking 
about management and some of the princi­ples developed over the past cen­
turies that still provide a framework for thinking about modern organ­
izations. The first chapter of the textbook ­will begin with a general overview 
of the skills and competencies needed by modern man­ag­ers. This chapter is 
followed by a historical overview that provides a retrospective look at the 
roots of modern management. The third chapter focuses on change and its 
impact on organ­izations.
Library and Information Center Management provides an introduction 
to the princi­ples of management, but serves only as a foundation. Although 
the princi­ples of management can be imparted, the practice of management 
­really cannot be taught—it must be learned through experience. This book 
­will acquaint you with the basic princi­ples, concepts, and techniques of man­
agement. It ­will also teach you the professional vocabulary of management, 
but if you are interested in becoming a man­ag­er, you must continue to learn. 
It is hoped that this book ­will cause you to become interested in becoming a 
man­ag­er yourself, ­because good management is critical to the success of all 
organ­izations.

Managing in 
­Today’s Libraries
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand why man­ag­ers are impor­tant in all organ­izations
•	 Be familiar with the most common functions that man­ag­ers perform
•	 Be able to discuss the roles that man­ag­ers play in organ­izations
•	 Be familiar with the three levels of management and the skills needed in each
•	 Know the major differences between managing in the for-­profit and the not-­for 
profit sectors
•	 Be able to identify some of the challenges faced by ­today’s man­ag­ers
Libraries existed in the ancient world and still retain their importance in 
the modern information age. Throughout history, as libraries have developed 
in vari­ous nations and cultures, they have all shared a defining character­
istic: they provide access to information that has been recorded on some type 
of medium. Over the years, the medium has changed, from stone slabs to clay 
tablets, from papyrus and palm leaves to vellum, from scrolls to hand-­copied 
books, and, most recently, from printed paper to interactive electronic and 
multimedia resources.
It is easy to imagine the concern felt by librarians in ancient times as 
scrolls ­were superseded by the new technology of books. Such concerns still 
exist to this day as modern hybrid libraries supplement or replace their print 
resources with electronic ones. For librarians, however, the format in which 
the information is recorded is far less impor­tant than ­whether patrons can 

6  Introduction
Management on the Job: Management Challenges 
in Rural and Small Town Libraries
Much of the library management lit­er­a­ture focuses on large, well-­funded libraries. How­
ever, almost 90 ­percent of public libraries in the United States are small ones, located in 
towns with populations of 50,000 or fewer. In 2015, Rachel K. Fischer surveyed man­ag­
ers in some of ­these small libraries to identify the management challenges they ­were 
facing. Bud­gets ­were a big prob­lem for most of ­these man­ag­ers. The majority of the librar­
ies had bud­gets of ­under $250,000 per year. ­Because of low bud­gets, some man­ag­ers 
reported prob­lems such as restricted hours of opening, low salaries, and difficulties in 
keeping up with technology. The good news, however, was that over two thirds of the 
libraries had received bud­get increases within the last five years.
All the libraries had small staffs and most had only one managerial level position. 
­These library man­ag­ers reported being unable to do a lot of marketing but nonetheless 
most reported their libraries ­were valued by the communities. The respondents stated 
that keeping up with technological change was especially challenging. Two technological 
areas in which ­these libraries ­were lagging ­behind ­were lending e-­readers and having 
a suitable Web site. The respondents to the survey described a number of management 
challenges. Leading the list was staffing—­there are not enough ­people to do all that needs 
to be done. Some are not able to hire librarians with master’s degrees. Other challenges 
reported frequently ­were bud­get/funding, marketing/PR/advocacy, time management, 
­human resources issues, technology, Board of Trustees, building maintenance, and 
volunteers.1
Small libraries face their own set of management challenges but not all their prob­
lems are found exclusively in small institutions. How do the management challenges of 
small libraries differ from ­those of larger organ­izations? What do you think the major 
differences in managerial responsibilities are between the two types of libraries? Would 
you prefer to work in a large organ­ization or in a smaller one?
retrieve and access this information efficiently and effectively. To make that 
retrieval and access as smooth as pos­si­ble, librarians need to create suitable 
environments by employing appropriate methods of management.
The Importance of Management
Libraries and other information-­intense enterprises have, over the 
years, ­adopted many management princi­ples that originated in business, 
industry, and government. In some cases, libraries have been required to do so 
as when, for example, they are part of a government structure or other large 
organ­ization. Usually, however, library man­ag­ers borrow established man­
agement princi­ples from the nonlibrary world in order to make their organ­
izations more successful.
Of course, most libraries are not businesses; almost all libraries are non­
profit organ­izations. Nevertheless, all enterprises, ­whether for-­profit or non­
profit, must provide a product to customers or clients, deliver consistent and 
efficient ser­vice, give employees and employers a sense of well-­being, and fos­
ter an attractive and healthy environment. A well-­managed library accom­
plishes all of ­these objectives far better than one that is poorly managed.
Effective organ­izations cannot rest on past success. Instead, they must 
focus on quality and customer satisfaction, must respond quickly to changes 

Managing in ­Today’s Libraries  7
Talk About It
Look at the predicted changes listed in Section 1: Introduction and discuss which of ­those 
changes have already had an impact on libraries. Which are likely to have an impact in 
the ­future? Do you think ­today’s libraries are adequately prepared to meet the chal­
lenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution? If not, what ­else should they be ­doing?
in the external environment, must be creative and innovative, and must be 
committed to continuous learning. Libraries ­will need to continue to change 
in order to succeed in the ­future as they face the challenges of the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution.
The most effective organ­izations use their available resources to main­
tain a competitive advantage. In the past, libraries had almost a total mono­
poly on information provision and ­were funded ­because they ­were considered 
a public “good”; however, in ­today’s environment, libraries must compete with 
numerous other nonprofits for public support. In addition, their position is 
being eroded by the growing influence of the private information sector. As 
a result, libraries are being forced to behave more and more like for-­profit 
institutions, sometimes even charging for ser­vices that ­were formerly ­free. 
In the private sector, individual companies are accustomed to attempting to 
outperform their competitors in order to survive; competitive advantage is the 
edge a com­pany has over its rivals in generating greater value for the organ­
ization and its shareholders. Libraries are beginning to focus on their own 
competitive advantage. Although libraries do not typically have to compete 
against other libraries, they do need to use ­every pos­si­ble means available 
to demonstrate that they are able to generate value for the investment made 
in them by their stakeholders. They now need to demonstrate their competi­
tive advantage, and good library man­ag­ers target available resources to com­
pete successfully. The mea­sures used to demonstrate competitive advantage 
typically are quality of product offered, efficiency, responsiveness to patron 
needs, and innovation in terms of continuing to respond to new demands in 
the market.2
Almost all libraries have attempted to incorporate the ele­ments of com­
petitive design into their operations. The quality of the product offered by 
­today’s libraries continues to improve. Digitization has made it pos­si­ble for 
libraries to offer products never pos­si­ble before, and ­these products are highly 
attractive to library patrons. Many libraries are innovating and offering 
ser­vices and products that have not been available before. Libraries increase 
their efficiency when they use fewer resources (such as ­people) to produce 
their goods or ser­vices. The IT revolution has increased productivity of all 
workers, and recent cutbacks in library funding have led to an increase in 
responsibility and workload at all levels. Most of ­today’s libraries are much 
more efficient than in the past. They are ­doing more with fewer employees. 
Libraries have become increasingly customer-­oriented and are very respon­
sive to patron needs. It is common for librarians to do market research and 
find out what ser­vices and collections their patrons would like to have offered. 
This new emphasis on customer ser­vice, quality, and efficiency has resulted 
in better libraries for all.
However, any good man­ag­er knows that libraries cannot excel at all of 
­these ele­ments at once. Pressure to increase orga­nizational per­for­mance can 

8  Introduction
be beneficial ­because it does force an organ­ization to rethink its priorities 
and practices. However, too much pressure to increase efficiency can be harm­
ful. It produces ­great stress on employees and can result in man­ag­ers try­
ing to cut corners in any way pos­si­ble to contain costs. As Maurice Line, a 
British library con­sul­tant, pointed out:
Improved productivity and ser­vice can hardly continue forever. 
It is rather like athletic rec­ords: they continue to be broken, but 
less and less frequently and by smaller and smaller margins. At 
the same time, the body is put ­under increasing stress, with 
sometimes permanent damage to muscles, tendons, bones and 
internal organs. Similarly, as ‘pro­gress’ continues to be made 
with products and ser­vices, margins of advantage are certain to 
diminish, and industries drive themselves and their staff harder 
and harder into the ground.”3
If the library workforce continues to shrink as a result of bud­getary cut­
backs, the quality of ser­vices offered and responsiveness to patrons’ needs 
­will inevitably decline. ­There is a need to have balance between the vari­ous 
ele­ments of competitive advantage.
FIGURE 1.1. Ele­ments of Competitive Advantage
Practice Your Skills
Identify a library or information center that you know well. How does it demonstrate the 
ele­ments of competitive advantage? Do you think that this organ­ization is able to balance 
the vari­ous ele­ments of competitive advantage or is the drive to become more efficient 
having an impact on the other ele­ments?

Managing in ­Today’s Libraries  9
Modern libraries continue to adjust to the changing climate in which 
they operate. Libraries are just emerging from the worst economic recession 
since the ­Great Depression and they have been forced to reevaluate their 
business model to be competitive in the changing marketplace. This reeval­
uation serves a useful purpose.4 ­Because of their long history, libraries have 
tended to follow practices that have worked effectively in the past, and often 
organ­izations that have been successful in the past become disinclined to 
innovate and hence less able to meet the dynamic needs of customers. The 
challenges that libraries are facing ­today provide them with an opportunity 
to reenvision their roles and responsibilities so they can remain ­viable. To 
compete with the burgeoning—­and often aggressive—­information industry, 
library man­ag­ers ­will need to be adaptable, always remaining open to new 
methods and techniques.
Over the years, as libraries have become larger, the importance of good 
management has grown accordingly. Major national, public, and academic 
libraries are in many ways the equivalent of large for-­profit corporations. 
Library directors who, in the past, ­were often scholars are necessarily becom­
ing more like chief executive officers (CEOs). Directors of large libraries are 
responsible for enormous bud­gets. In 2015, the Library of Congress had a bud­
get of over $631 million.5 The Library of Congress is one of the world’s largest, 
so its substantial bud­get is not typical. Nonetheless, it is very common for 
man­ag­ers in all types of libraries to deal with multimillion-­dollar bud­gets, 
and regardless of the size of the bud­get, knowing how to secure and manage 
funding is critical to any institution’s success.
Despite its large bud­get, the Library of Congress is like other libraries 
in that it recently has been forced to make hard choices between competing 
priorities. From 2010 to 2015, the Library’s total appropriation decreased by 
more than $53 million or 8 ­percent.6 Therefore, man­ag­ers in both large and 
small libraries must not be only able to work with bud­gets that remain the 
same but with ­those that are shrinking. In addition to their financial duties, 
library directors also oversee many employees and large facilities, tasks that 
often require additional skills.
Of course, library directors are not the only ones who need managerial 
skills. Almost all librarians have some sort of managerial responsibilities, 
so they, too, need to develop managerial expertise. ­Today’s librarians face 
greater challenges than ever before, resulting from increased competition, 
globalization, ever-­changing technology, and the rapid pace of change. As dis­
cussed previously, the changes that are occurring as a result of the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution ­will continue to buffet libraries with the need to adjust 
to changes of all sorts. In addition, libraries like almost all other not-­for-­profit 
institutions are just beginning to recover from the most challenging economic 
period they have faced in recent history. Funding of all types—­governmental, 
institutional, and philanthropic—­was drastically decreased while demand 
for library ser­vices grew to a rec­ord high. Library resources ­were strained 
by all the cutbacks and are just now beginning to recover. Libraries ­will need 
capable management at all levels to address ­these new developments in the 
world of information provision.
What Is Management?
The basic task of management is using orga­nizational resources to achieve 
defined goals. Within an organ­ization, man­ag­ers are the ­people who make 
decisions that enable the organ­ization to achieve its objectives. Man­ag­ers then 
work to help ­others reach ­these objectives effectively and efficiently.

10  Introduction
Early in the 20th ­century, Mary Follett characterized management 
as “the art of getting ­things done through ­people.” Follett’s observation 
remains relevant ­because, by definition, it is impossible to manage alone. 
Man­ag­ers rely on the skills and ­labor of ­others to succeed, so, for them, 
interpersonal skills are extremely impor­tant. Furthermore, all man­ag­ers 
must fulfill the functions of planning, organ­izing, staffing, leading, and 
controlling. Each of ­these functions ­will be discussed in more depth ­later 
in this chapter.
Who Are Man­ag­ers?
As stated above, man­ag­ers are ­people within an organ­ization who are 
responsible for and support the work of other ­people. Man­ag­ers can be cat­
egorized in vari­ous ways. Commonly they work within a vertical hierarchy. 
Man­ag­ers oversee all levels of the organ­ization; naturally ­those nearer the 
top of the hierarchy have broader responsibilities and authority than do ­those 
at lower levels. In typical organ­izations, including libraries, management can 
be divided into three levels:
•	 Top management, which in libraries usually means the director 
and the assistant and associate directors, is responsible for the over­
all functioning of the entire organ­ization. In most cases, man­ag­ers at 
the highest levels establish organization-­wide policy and are influen­
tial in setting the leadership style throughout the enterprise.
•	 ­Middle man­ag­ers are in charge of specific subunits or functions of 
the organ­ization. In libraries and information centers, department 
heads act as ­middle man­ag­ers. They are responsible for making sure 
vari­ous parts of the library function successfully. ­Middle man­ag­ers, 
in addition to leading specific subunits or functional teams, also serve 
as liaisons between top management and supervisors.
•	 Supervisors, sometimes called first-­line man­ag­ers, are ­those on the 
lowest rung of the management hierarchy. Supervisors lead the day-­
to-­day activities of employees working to accomplish orga­nizational 
objectives, and they are responsible for the production of goods or ser­
vices. In a library, the night circulation man­ag­er who works with a 
group of part-­time student workers would be considered a supervisor. 
First-­line man­ag­ers implement procedures and pro­cesses that allow 
their units to work effectively and efficiently.
The traditional management hierarchy can be seen in figure 1.2. Note 
that anyone who is supervising another person is involved in the manage­
ment pro­cess. Many recent gradu­ates from library and information science 
(LIS) programs become man­ag­ers in their first professional positions, 
although many do not envision themselves in this role when they are LIS 
students.
As ­will be discussed ­later in this book, this traditional managerial hier­
archy is being affected by many of the changes in ­today’s workplace. One 
widespread change has been the adoption of team-­based orga­nizational struc­
tures, which has led to a flattening of the management pyramid and the 
elimination of some middle-­management positions. In most of ­today’s organ­
izations, including libraries, management responsibility is being distributed 
more widely than ever before.

Managing in ­Today’s Libraries  11
What Do Man­ag­ers Do?
Man­ag­ers are usually very busy ­people who must carry out many of their 
duties concurrently. As a result, man­ag­ers must often multitask, and their 
work is frequently interrupted. Tasks may be fragmented, with some mana­
gerial functions occurring almost daily, and ­others performed on a more 
irregular basis. For ­these reasons, it can be difficult to tease out all the 
strands that make up the fabric of managerial life. To examine what man­
ag­ers do, the two most common approaches are to consider the functions that 
man­ag­ers perform and to describe the roles man­ag­ers play.
One very common way to view management is as a set of common pro­
cesses or functions that, when properly carried out, lead to orga­nizational 
efficiency and effectiveness. The managerial functions are ­those tasks that 
man­ag­ers perform as part of their positions. ­These functions can be classi­
fied in vari­ous ways,7 but, regardless of the terminology used by vari­ous man­
agement theorists, it is generally agreed that man­ag­ers perform five main 
functions within an enterprise: planning, organ­izing, staffing, leading, and 
controlling. ­These five functions are depicted in figure 1.3. Anyone who has 
managerial experience ­will be familiar with all of them.
Planning requires man­ag­ers to anticipate tasks that need to be done 
in order to achieve the organ­ization’s goals and to figure out the best meth­
ods for accomplishing them. Planning allows man­ag­ers to determine where 
their organ­ization wants to be in the ­future and enables that organ­ization 
to make the transition from ­today to tomorrow.
Organ­izing is the second function of management. Man­ag­ers establish 
the formal structure of authority through which work is divided among the 
employees. They must first match individuals and their talents with the 
functions and structures needed to get the job done. ­After that, they create 
channels that facilitate communication among the units.
Staffing, often called ­human resources or personnel, involves hiring, train­
ing, compensating, and retaining the ­people necessary for the organ­ization 
FIGURE 1.2. Levels of Management in Libraries

12  Introduction
to achieve its objectives. No organ­ization can be successful without effective 
employees.
Leading involves creating a shared culture and values within an organ­
ization, communicating goals to its employees, and motivating ­people at all 
levels. All of the sub-­functions encompassed ­under this category focus on the 
­human ele­ment in the organ­ization. This ­human ele­ment is very impor­tant, 
­because employees’ attitudes, perceptions, and personality attributes affect 
their work.
Controlling means monitoring an organ­ization’s activities to be sure it 
is on the right path to meet its goals. Controlling requires analyzing the organ­
ization’s operations and then using that information to inform the planning 
pro­cess. In this way, the organ­ization can continually examine and correct its 
goals in light of current information. Controlling is the mirror image of plan­
ning. In planning, man­ag­ers establish where the organ­ization is headed, 
whereas in controlling, they assess ­whether they are on target to reach ­these 
goals. Planning allows man­ag­ers to decide where their organ­ization is ­going; 
controlling allows them to find out if it has gotten ­there.
All man­ag­ers perform ­these five functions. Of course, man­ag­ers at dif­
fer­ent levels and in dif­fer­ent departments ­will differ in the time they devote

You are the library director at a state university in a medium size city. A decision has 
been made to combine your library and the city’s public library in a new building that 
­will provide ser­vices for both sets of users. You and your public library counterpart must 
plan how to merge the collections of the two libraries and manage the ser­vices and staff 
in a shared fa­cil­i­ty.8
You are the director of the information center in a multinational corporation where 
employees are rarely in their offices. You have just been asked to make plans to transform 
the library into a virtual library with information available by telephone and Internet9
You are a school librarian just hired by a city planning a new high school. Suddenly 
you find that you are the administrator of a million-­dollar operation and need to be 
skilled as a facilities planner, designer, technology con­sul­tant, and bud­get authority.10
You work in a public library that is in the midst of changing from one or­ga­nized by 
using departments to one or­ga­nized using teams. You have been put on the steering com­
mittee that ­will decide what needs to be done to make a transition between ­these two 
types of managing.11

to them and the depth at which they perform them. Like most other man­
agement textbooks, Library and Information Center Management is or­ga­
nized around ­these five major functions, with a section devoted to each.
Managerial Roles
Man­ag­ers must play a number of roles in order to do their jobs well. A 
role can be defined as an expected set of be­hav­iors and activities. Henry 
Mintzberg, a Canadian management theorist, observed the activities of a 
number of man­ag­ers over a period of time and, from his observations, came 
up with a set of roles that man­ag­ers play. Mintzberg grouped ­these roles into 
three broad categories: interpersonal roles, information roles, and decisional 
roles.12 ­These roles can be seen in figure 1.4.
Interpersonal roles, as a category, involve working with ­people. For 
example, top man­ag­ers often serve as figureheads. Although the term has 
taken on a slightly pejorative overtone, figureheads are ­people—­like higher-­
level man­ag­ers—­who spend a ­great deal of time representing their organ­
izations to the outside world. They perform ceremonial functions and entertain 
on behalf of the organ­ization. In such cases, top man­ag­ers serve as symbols 
of the organ­ization itself.
Man­ag­ers also play a role as leaders. They perform functions such as 
motivating, communicating with, and inspiring the ­people who work for them.
Man­ag­ers often act as liaisons between groups of employees or between 
employees and customers, linking information sources inside and outside the 
organ­ization. It is often said that man­ag­ers need to be good networkers; 
indeed, when they are serving as liaisons they are building essential net­
works within the organ­ization or between the organ­ization and the outside 
world.
Informational roles are more impor­tant than ever in ­today’s 
information-­based organ­izations. One role Mintzberg identifies is that of 
monitor. Monitors are always seeking information, both from outside the 

14  Introduction
organ­ization and from inside. They develop systems to keep track of their 
units’ per­for­mance. They oversee the use of resources.
Complementing their information-­seeking role, man­ag­ers also act as dis­
seminators of information. Man­ag­ers not only gather information, but they 
also share it with ­others. This dissemination can take place in person, by 
e-­mail, or via other communication media. As organ­izations in general have 
become more participatory, man­ag­ers share information much more broadly 
than in the past.
The final informational role played by a man­ag­er is that of spokesperson. 
As such, a man­ag­er may transmit official information about an organ­ization 
to the public by means of e-­mails, speeches, newsletters, and the like.
Decisional roles are fundamental to management. The decisions that 
need to be made may be tactical, financial, or interpersonal. For example, 
man­ag­ers often have to act as disturbance handlers. Conflict resolution and 
crisis response can be among the more challenging aspects of a man­ag­er’s 
job. Similarly, man­ag­ers often play the role of negotiator. ­Here they repre­
sent their organ­ization or department in pursuing resources such as money, 
equipment, or other forms of support. On occasion, man­ag­ers may take part 
in collective bargaining.
In their role as resource allocators, man­ag­ers spend a ­great deal of time 
determining how they ­will distribute assets such as time, money, and ­people 
within the organ­ization. ­There are always decisions that need to be made 
about allocating resources, especially now when resources are scarce in most 
organ­izations.
Fi­nally, when they work to introduce innovation within the organ­ization, 
man­ag­ers play the role of entrepreneur. Man­ag­ers must decide which new 
ideas are worth bringing into an organ­ization and then ensure that the 
organ­ization makes the changes that are necessary to keep it competitive.
Mintzberg’s concept of managerial roles offers an in­ter­est­ing and useful 
alternative to the traditional view of managerial functions and has been built 
upon by other researchers in the field of management. Some of the roles 
Mintzberg describes, such as acting as a figurehead or serving as an official

Arrange to speak briefly to a ­middle or lower-­level man­ag­er in any organ­ization with 
which you are familiar. Ask that man­ag­er about his or her daily routine and the amount 
of time spent on each of the five managerial functions. Then ask the man­ag­er about the 
roles that Mintzberg says man­ag­ers play. Does that man­ag­er play any of the Mintzberg’s 
roles and what part of the job was being performed when the roles ­were played?
spokesperson, are performed primarily by top-­level man­ag­ers. Yet all man­ag­
ers must play many of ­these roles in the course of their managerial activities.
What Resources Do Man­ag­ers Use?
According to one definition, a man­ag­er is someone with the authority to 
commit orga­nizational resources. Mintzberg noted that one of the manage­
rial roles is that of resource allocator. The resources controlled by man­ag­ers 
are of four main types:
­Human resources are all the employees who work in an organ­ization. 
Though ­these employees have varying levels of skill, experience, and 
education, each serves an essential purpose in the organ­ization. The typ­
ical library employs professional librarians, paraprofessionals, clerical 
workers, technical specialists, and, in many cases, part-­time workers 
such as student assistants and pages. Man­ag­ers oversee the distribu­
tion of all ­these ­human resources.
Financial resources are the sources of an organ­ization’s funding. In the for-­
profit world, the funding sources are primarily customers, who give the 
organ­ization money in exchange for goods or ser­vices. In not-­for-­profit 
organ­izations, funding usually comes from federal, state, or city govern­
ments, charitable donations, grants, and similar sources. In both realms, 
man­ag­ers are increasingly held accountable for the financial resources 
of their organ­izations. In nonprofits, man­ag­ers are often expected to 
secure grants or participate in fund-­raising.
Physical resources are the tangible or material assets of an organ­ization, 
ranging from office supplies to office buildings. Libraries rarely own 
their own premises; instead, the buildings are provided by other enti­
ties, such as cities or universities. Nevertheless, a library man­ag­er is 
still responsible for proper management of the building along with 
every­thing inside it. Management of physical resources can be time-­
consuming, since in addition to maintenance, it includes acquisition 
and eventual replacement of the library’s facilities and equipment. In 
many large libraries, facilities man­ag­ers are designated, but in cases 
involving expensive resources, top-­level man­ag­ers ­will typically make 
the final decisions. Control of inexpensive items (such as supplies) is 
usually delegated to lower-­level man­ag­ers.
Information resources are increasingly impor­tant in all management set­
tings. Of course, the library’s prime function has always been steward­
ship of information resources. ­Behind the scenes, man­ag­ers control 

16  Introduction
In contrast to Katz’s broad-­brush depiction of managerial skills, other 
management experts have identified crucial skills in greater detail. Some 
studies have looked specifically at the skills necessary for library man­ag­ers. 
A number of years ago, for instance, G. Edward Evans proposed a core of uni­
versal managerial knowledge for librarians, archivists, and information 
man­ag­ers; and the core he proposed is still relevant ­today. The 12 items on 
his list are planning, staffing, fiscal management, innovation, motivation, 
communication, leadership, quantitative methods, ethics, decision making, 
del­e­ga­tion, and marketing.14
Although ­there is some variation, many skills that ­were needed in the 
past are still being mentioned in current list of needed skills. In 2016, the 
editors of Library Journal polled a group of prominent library directors and 
asked them what skills they thought ­were most essential for new librarians. 
The skills mentioned ­were: advocacy/politics, collaboration, communication/

other information resources, ­those pertinent to the organ­ization’s day-­
to-­day functions. At one time, this information was stored on paper in 
centrally located file cabinets in the organ­ization. Since the advent of 
computers, most libraries have maintained electronic databases of 
information relevant to employees, resources, and other management 
responsibilities. Networks make operational information available 
to employees throughout the organ­ization. All of ­these information 
resources are valuable assets and must be leveraged for strategic advan­
tage. Meanwhile, man­ag­ers must also be sure to safeguard certain infor­
mation in order to ensure privacy and confidentiality of business-­related 
materials, in par­tic­u­lar ­those that are available electronically.
What Skills Are Needed by ­Today’s Man­ag­ers?
Obviously, librarians ­will need dif­fer­ent skill sets depending on their 
place in the management structure. In a classic article, Robert Katz identi­
fied three essential sets of managerial skills: technical, ­human, and concep­
tual.13 Technical skills, ­those skills that relate to specific functions and tasks, 
take pre­ce­dence for first-­line man­ag­ers. To be an effective supervisor, one 
must understand the pro­cesses that are encompassed by the job. The head 
of a cata­loging department would find it difficult to supervise copy cata­logers 
without knowing about cata­loging and classification. On the other hand, the 
director of the library, who may have had this technical knowledge at one 
time, may no longer possess such skills, especially in newer competencies 
such as creating metadata. Instead, upper-­level man­ag­ers rely more on con­
ceptual skills and their ability to look at the “big picture” of the organ­ization. 
The ­human skill, the ability to interact effectively with ­people, is impor­tant 
at all levels.

Managing in ­Today’s Libraries  17
people skills, creativity/innovation, critical thinking, data analy­sis, flexibil­
ity, leadership, marketing, proj­ect management, and technological exper­
tise.15 Not surprisingly, the skills needed by librarians do not differ greatly 
from ­those needed by all knowledge workers. ­Table 1.1 lists the top 10 skills 
that the World Economic Forum identified as being necessary for success in 
the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2015 and 2020.
­These lists provide a core of managerial skills useful to all man­ag­ers, but 
it is difficult to define the exact competencies needed by a specific man­ag­er 
­because ­these ­will differ according to position and the type of organ­ization. 
Despite ­these caveats, the following skills have proved essential to most con­
temporary man­ag­ers:
Po­liti­cal skills. Like most workplaces, libraries and information agencies 
are intensely po­liti­cal organ­izations. To survive in ­today’s climate, man­
ag­ers need not only to create a vision but also to inspire ­others to believe 
in it. They must create a workplace atmosphere that is conducive to 
strategic thinking and action. Politics arise both within internal opera­
tions and from the organ­ization’s relationship to forces outside itself. To 
maintain equilibrium for the organ­ization, flexibility and the willing­
ness to take risks are often vital.
Analytical skills. Man­ag­ers frequently serve as change agents and thus 
must be ­adept at critical thinking and analy­sis. Decisions based on 
insight or intuition are almost impossible to defend, but lucid, rational, 
well-­argued analy­sis is a solid foundation for a man­ag­er’s actions.
Problem-­solving skills. Prob­lem solving is arguably a man­ag­er’s most 
impor­tant day-­to-­day activity. Solving prob­lems often involves making 
changes within an organ­ization. Man­ag­ers need a positive attitude 
­toward change management, since, as mentioned above, flexibility is 
often crucial to success.
Social skills. ­People are the heart of ­every organ­ization. ­Because they 
possess many dif­fer­ent dimensions, a man­ag­er inevitably has to deal 
with all of ­these dimensions. To do so, the most essential skills are

18  Introduction
­those pertaining to communication, conflict resolution, and interper­
sonal skills. Increasingly, man­ag­ers are responsible for coordinating 
team-­based initiatives. They therefore need to know the best team-­
management techniques as well as understand how to coach and men­
tor their subordinates. Learning to see situations through the eyes of 
­others in the organ­ization can facilitate cooperation and reduce conflict. 
Man­ag­ers should aim to convey concern and interest in the ­people they 
manage, and of course a sense of humor is always useful.
Financial skills. All man­ag­ers need a sound grounding in the financial 
structure of their organ­ization. They should know where funding comes 
from, where it goes, and how to get it. ­These skills should also include 
knowledge of marketing, since marketing can be a key ­factor in secur­
ing funding. Additionally, in an era when governmental funding for 
libraries has decreased, the responsibility for private fund-­raising has 
come to the fore, especially for top man­ag­ers. Fund-­raising is time-­
consuming, but the money it brings in can often pay for the extras in a 
library’s bud­get.
System skills. Naturally all library man­ag­ers need to be familiar with 
computer-­based information systems, but this type of skill extends far 
beyond computers. ­After all, systems include not only technological ones 
but also physical arrangements of resources and routines designed to 
produce specified results. ­Today’s libraries are usually part of even 
larger systems, and man­ag­ers need to be aware of their organ­ization’s 
place within ­those larger systems.
In summary, ­because a man­ag­er’s job is complex and multidimensional, 
man­ag­ers need to possess both “hard” skills (such as technical and specific 
business knowledge) and “soft” skills (such as the interpersonal adeptness 
described above). No man­ag­er can completely master all of the skills that 
might prove useful. However, good man­ag­ers know that their success depends 
upon their skills and knowledge, so they aim to keep learning and develop­
ing skills throughout their ­careers.

What Are the Differences in Managing in 
For-­Profit and Not-­for-­Profit Organ­izations?
Although some libraries and information centers are located in for-­profit 
organ­izations, the vast majority of them are not. Most libraries are funded 
­either by state or local taxes or by not-­for-­profit organ­izations such as private 
colleges and universities. Not-­for-­profit organ­izations play a unique role; they 
are created to provide a public ser­vice rather than to generate profit.
For-­profit organ­izations have a primary mission of making money for the 
business ­owners or stockholders. By contrast, the emphasis in most libraries 
is not on creating profit; instead, libraries exist to contribute to the public 
good. Not-­for-­profits do not usually generate their own funding, and typically 
they use par­tic­u­lar forms of financial controls and accounting. Often, they are 
not permitted to have ­either deficits or large reserves as part of their bud­
get. This dissimilarity in the bottom line is the most significant difference 
between managing for-­profit organ­izations and not-­for-­profit ones. However, 
even though libraries do not have to make a profit to remain in business, they, 
like their for-­profit counter­parts, must strive to maintain a competitive advan­
tage in a rapidly changing environment and always need to operate as effec­
tively and efficiently as pos­si­ble.
Even so, management in the not-­for-­profit world can seem comparatively 
complicated ­because the goals of ­these organ­izations may be difficult to artic­
ulate. For-­profit organ­izations have a fairly straightforward goal: to make 
money for their ­owners. By contrast, not-­for-­profits aim to “serve society” or 
“do well,” a goal that could be interpreted in many dif­fer­ent ways.
Consequently, man­ag­ers in not-­for-­profits may sometimes have trou­ble 
setting specific goals; it can then be equally hard to assess ­whether the organ­
ization has achieved ­these goals. In addition, some aspects of ­human resources 
management can differ from the for-­profit sphere if the not-­for-­profit’s employ­
ees are government workers, or if they have the special benefits, such as 
tenure, sometimes found in college and university libraries.
­These small differences aside, most of what man­ag­ers do is the same no 
­matter where they work. Well-­known management expert Peter Drucker 
emphasized the similarities between for-­profit and nonprofit organ­izations.16 
Drucker suggested that man­ag­ers in ­every organ­ization should ask them­
selves five essential questions: “What is our mission? Who is our customer? 
What does the customer value? What are our results? and What is our plan?” 
This pro­cess may be even more impor­tant for nonprofits, since they have to 
produce results in order to retain the confidence and trust of the entities that 
fund them.
In summary, ­there are some differences in management between ­these 
two types of organ­izations, but man­ag­ers in both types still engage in the 
five essential functions of planning, organ­izing, managing ­human resources, 
pre­sen­ta­tion skills, strategic agility, and a quick grasp of pro­cess management 
and systems thinking.

leading, and controlling. Both types of man­ag­ers also play the roles described 
by Mintzberg. Given ­these similarities, a good man­ag­er in one type of organ­
ization could fairly easily transfer to one in the other sphere. Regardless of 
structure, all organ­izations need skilled man­ag­ers to help them accomplish 
their mission and goals.
Conclusion
It is clear that librarians of the 21st ­century ­will continue to work in 
fast-­changing environments. Peter Vaill once used a compelling meta­phor 
to describe this turbulent ­future. He stated that ­today’s man­ag­ers need to 
be prepared to confront what he called permanent “white ­water.” In his view, 
the management of organ­izations used to be like a pleasant boat ­ride down 
a calm, quiet river, but the ­future ­will be dif­fer­ent. It ­will be full of rapids, 
whirl­pools, and eddies.17 It has been over 25 years since Vaill predicted the 
onset of permanent white ­water. The environment has been turbulent since 
that time, and, if the Fourth Industrial Revolution arrives as expected, it 
­will churn up the ­waters even more. Libraries need experienced man­ag­ers 
who can take the helm for this exhilarating journey.
­Today’s man­ag­ers undoubtedly face many challenges, and management 
can therefore be difficult. Nevertheless, it also pres­ents ­great ­career oppor­
tunities and enables one to make impor­tant changes within an organ­ization. 
To ensure the success of libraries in the de­cades to come, both ­these organ­
izations and the users they serve ­will need to rely on talented man­ag­ers.
This first chapter of Library and Information Center Management has 
provided an overview of what man­ag­ers do and the skills they must have. The 
next chapter ­will examine the evolution of management theory over the years. 
This introductory section ­will then conclude with chapter 3, which focuses on 
change management in ­today’s fast-­moving library environments.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 The city of Charlotte, North Carolina has long prided itself on its public library 
system. “The Charlotte Mecklenburg Public Library has been renowned for its 
reinvention and growth. It was named the Library Journal Library of the Year 
in 1995, and up ­until two years ago was seeking new ways for the system to 
expand not only in number of branches but also in its ser­vices. The 2009 long-­
range plan proposed adding 8 new branches, expanding its programs, and open­
ing a new Job Help Center for job seekers. The recent recession hit Charlotte 
hard. Tax revenues fell precipitously and Charlotte, like many other cities, was 
forced to reduce funding to its libraries. Beginning in the spring of 2010, the 
Charlotte Mecklenburg Library lost roughly $12 million in county funding reduc­
ing its bud­get from $41.2 million in early 2008–09 to $25.4 million. The cuts 
resulted in the closing of four branch libraries, the reduction of hours in the 
remaining branches, and the layoff of nearly 180 staff members, almost a third 
of the workforce.”18
Luckily Charlotte has made a good comeback from the effects of recent reces­
sion described above, but a severe bud­get cutback can happen to any organ­ization. 
What do you think are the major challenges facing a man­ag­er working in a 

Managing in ­Today’s Libraries  21
situation such as the one described above? What skills and characteristics 
would a man­ag­er need to be successful in such a position?
2.	Think about a job you held in the past or have now. First, consider your super­
visor and his or her general be­hav­ior, managerial style, and attitude. Then think 
about your fellow employees, and your perception of their competence and of their 
attitudes ­towards their work, the organ­ization, and you. Fi­nally, reflect upon 
the organ­ization itself and its policies, procedures, and practices. What ­were the 
good ­things about this job? What ­were its negative features? How much did 
the man­ag­ers, both your immediate supervisor and ­those at a higher level, con­
tribute to what you liked or disliked about the job? What did you learn about 
management from this job?
3.	­There was ­great rejoicing at the Carville Public Library. Sam Gates, the director, 
was leaving. The staff had been hoping for this announcement since he arrived 
six months ago. Why this rejoicing? If asked, the staff would have answered, 
“­Because the man has serious psychological prob­lems that interfere with his 
and our ability to do our jobs.” Asked to elucidate, they would have said that he 
was supersensitive and very self-­conscious. This shyness robbed him of all spon­
taneity and naturalness. He appeared cold, reserved, and stiff.
The Carville librarians have been asked by the trustees what characteris­
tics, abilities, and talents a public library director should possess. They have 
also been told that they ­will take part in the interview for the new director. The 
staff is excited to have input in this hiring decision and are wrestling with 
deciding what qualities the director should have and with how to find out dur­
ing an interview ­whether a candidate for the position has them. If you ­were on 
the Carville library staff, what do you think you would be advocating in terms 
of a new director? What questions might you ask to determine if an applicant 
had ­these skills?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Brynjolfsson and McAfee in their book, The Second Machine Age: Work, Pro­
gress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies, point out that although 
the Fourth Industrial Revolution ­will bring about many beneficial results, it 
­will also bring about some thorny challenges. “Rapid and accelerating digitiza­
tion is likely to bring economic rather than environmental disruption, stem­
ming from the fact that as computers get more power­ful, companies have less 
need for some kinds of workers. Technological pro­gress is ­going to leave ­behind 
some ­people, perhaps even a lot of ­people, as it races ahead. . . . ​­There’s never been 
a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, ­because 
­these ­people can use technology to create and capture value. However, ­there’s 
never been a worse time to be a worker with only ‘ordinary’ skills and abilities 
to offer, ­because computers, robots and other digital technologies are acquiring 
­these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate.”
Think about the job skills needed by ­people who work in libraries. Are the 
skills they possess “ordinary” or “specialized”? Which library jobs do you think 
are most at risk if Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s predictions are correct?

This statement still holds true for ­today’s organ­izations. How can libraries 
rethink their traditional assumptions? What keeps all organ­izations from 
­doing this on a regular basis?

The Evolution of 
Management Thought
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand why knowledge of the evolution of management theories is impor­
tant to ­today’s man­ag­ers
•	 Be able to discuss the major schools of management thought and how each 
reflects the time period in which it was developed
•	 Know some of the major differences between the organ­izations of ­today and 
­those that existed when the vari­ous perspectives ­were developed
•	 Be able to explain why ­there is not just one “best” way to manage
•	 Be ready to discuss what you think ­will be the prevalent management “schools” 
of the ­future
Over the past 250 years, almost all nations have evolved from socie­ties in 
which most workers ­were self-­employed, primarily as farmers or in­de­pen­dent 
craftsmen, into socie­ties in which almost all workers are employed by organ­
izations. Only a ­century ago, 38 ­percent of the U.S. workforce worked on small 
farms. ­Today fewer than 3 ­percent of Americans farm for a living.1 Almost 
all con­temporary workers are employed within some sort of organ­ization 
and have man­ag­ers to guide and direct their work.
When manufacturing began in the United States at the end of the 18th 
­century, the factories ­were small. In 1849, the largest factory in the United 
States was located in Chicago and employed 123 workers. Between 1860 and 
1890, the number of ­people working in manufacturing in the United States 

26  Introduction
quintupled. By 1913, more than 12,000 ­people worked in a single Ford Motor 
Com­pany factory in Michigan. As the number of ­people working in organ­
izations grew, so too did interest in management. Management techniques 
had been relatively unimportant when most organ­izations ­were small, but 
with the explosion of industrialization, supervisors suddenly needed knowl­
edge about the best ways to manage their large workforces and complex 
organ­izations.
Man­ag­ers in early organ­izations had few resources except their own per­
sonal experiences to guide them in how they managed. Then, in the latter 
part of the 19th ­century, some man­ag­ers and management theorists began 
to systematically reflect upon their experiences and observations in an attempt 
to identify the most effective management practices. ­These most effectives 
practices are usually called princi­ples, but they are more accurately consid­
ered guides to good management rather than scientific fact.2 The study of 
management has expanded greatly in recent de­cades, fueled by new ideas 
that have helped countless man­ag­ers to succeed. Indeed, management theo­
ries continue to proliferate, as do vari­ous schools of management thought, 
each purporting to provide the best approach.
­Today’s management techniques have evolved from earlier practices, 
princi­ples, and research. Examining the history of management provides 
context and background for learning about current management concepts, 
for establishing what has worked in the past, and for avoiding known mis­
takes in the ­future. No student of management can afford to be unfamiliar 
with the field’s pioneering thinkers. Although organ­izations have moved away 
from some of the practices of ­these pioneers, their ideas are still the founda­
tion for many management techniques currently in practice.
Although the formal study of management began less than 175 years 
ago, management techniques have been employed from the time of the earli­
est civilizations, long before management princi­ples ­were ever studied or cod­
ified. Consider Stonehenge or the Mayan pyramids. None of ­these proj­ects 
could have been completed without management. Whenever ­humans have 
had to work cooperatively, ­there have been ­people who have taken charge and 
performed the standard managerial functions of planning, organ­izing, lead­
ing, and controlling the work. This chapter ­will describe the evolution of man­
agement thought and practice from prehistory to the pres­ent. It ­will focus 
briefly on some current trends that are bringing new approaches to manage­
ment. Then the chapter ­will conclude with a short summary of how librarians 
have adapted general management princi­ples to their workplaces.
Management on the Job: Nicholson and the 
Bodleian Library
In March 1912, The Times of London reported the death of E. W. B. Nicholson who for the 
past 30 years had served as the Librarian at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Nicholson 
was appointed to the post in 1882 ­after the death of H. O. Coxe, and the obituary goes 
on to say that the position Nicholson assumed was a difficult one, ­because Coxe “was a 
courtly kindly scholar, so much beloved in the University that his successor was bound 
to suffer by comparison.”3
Nicholson was hired ­because Oxford’s library needed to be brought up to date, and 
“the new librarian was therefore selected as being a man of modern methods, a man of

Management in Ancient History
Long before the time of Nicholson or any of the other early man­ag­er pio­
neers, ­there was a need to employ management techniques whenever ­people 
had to work cooperatively together to accomplish a task. Although ­these man­
agement attempts ­were never systematic or codified, ­there are many exam­
ples from ancient history of individuals performing the standard managerial 
functions of planning, organ­izing, leading, and controlling. As early as 3000 
BCE, the Sumerians kept rec­ords on clay tablets; many of ­those rec­ords per­
tained to management practices followed by the priests of Ur. Babylonian 
King Hammurabi (ca. 1792–1750 BCE) issued a code of 282 laws, many of 
which ­were related to business practices including accounting and regulation 
of wages and fees.6 The ancient Hebrews’ understanding of hierarchy and 
the importance of del­e­ga­tion is reflected in the Old Testament. For example, 
Moses (ca. 1300 BCE) “chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads 
over the ­people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and 
rulers of tens. And they judged the ­people at all seasons; the hard cases they 
brought unto Moses, but ­every small ­matter they judged themselves.”7
Around 2560 BCE, the construction of the ­Great Pyramid at Giza was 
completed in less than 23 years using an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 labor­
ers.8 Clearly such a feat could not have been accomplished without extensive 
planning, organ­izing, and controlling. Similarly, rec­ords exist of manage­
ment activities in China 3,000 years ago. By that time, the Chinese had estab­
lished a governmental organ­ization with a hierarchy of officials.9
energy, who would reor­ga­nize an old institution to meet what ­were believed to be new 
requirements.”4 However, as the obituary noted, Nicholson was only able to carry out his 
objectives in the face of strong opposition, ­because the changes he advocated faced vig­
orous opposition within both the library and the university. Nevertheless, ultimately, 
Nicholson was able to achieve his primary objective, which was to make the library more 
useful, and “before the end of his life he had the satisfaction of seeing some of his most 
cherished schemes carried out or inaugurated.” Among ­these ­were a system of shelf-­
classification, a subject cata­log, the enlargement of the library, an underground storage 
fa­cil­i­ty, and an increase in the number of staff. As the obituary rightly noted, this was 
“a remarkable rec­ord for one man’s tenure of office”.5
Although Nicholson is ­little known at the pres­ent time, he was one of a number of 
librarians at the turn of the 20th ­century who pioneered by bringing new management 
techniques to libraries. Working without benefit of established library management 
norms or practices, the members of this first wave of library man­ag­ers experimented 
with varying approaches to the administration of libraries. Although many of ­these early 
attempts ­were unsuccessful and abandoned with time, ­others proved to be of lasting value 
and are still used in library management ­today.
Many of the prob­lems that confronted Nicholson in attempting to innovate the 
Bodleian Library are also faced by modern man­ag­ers. Man­ag­ers are still struggling with 
ways to keep their organ­izations up-­to-­date and “useful” in order to better serve their 
patrons. It is still difficult to be appointed to follow a much beloved pre­de­ces­sor and to 
implement major innovations that shake up old ways of ­doing ­things. Times change, but 
many prob­lems in management remain the same. Why is it difficult to bring changes to 
a well-­established organ­ization? What can man­ag­ers do to make change easier?

28  Introduction
Although the historical rec­ords of early Greece offer ­little specific man­
agerial insight, the very existence of the Athenian commonwealth—­with its 
councils, popu­lar courts, administrative officials, and board of generals—­
indicates an appreciation of vari­ous managerial functions. The famous Greek 
phi­los­o­pher Socrates (469–399 BCE) wrote on the differences between man­
agement of public and private concerns, and his pupil Plato (428–348 BCE) 
wrote about specialization.11 In ancient Rome, the complexity of administering 
a huge empire demanded the use of sophisticated management techniques. 
The Romans constructed an extensive system of roads, which allowed goods 
to be distributed and armies to be moved to all parts of the Empire. In fact, 
much of the Roman Empire’s success arose from the Romans’ ability to or­ga­
nize work and ­people for the imperial cause.
Many other examples of managerial concepts could be drawn from 
ancient and medieval times. However, with the dawn of the industrial age 
and the large-­scale employment of individuals in factories, man­ag­ers 
began to face prob­lems on a dif­fer­ent scale from ­those they had encoun­
tered before.
The Impact of the Industrial Age on Management
At the end of the 18th  ­century, the development of new technology 
resulted in the Industrial Revolution. The growth of large factories brought 
workers into one central location and thereby into contact with other work­
ers. Division of ­labor, which allowed large jobs to be broken down into many 
small components, led to a workforce where each worker was not required to 
have an overall knowledge of the pro­cesses but just expertise in one small 
task that was performed all day long.
As ­these new organ­izations developed, their leaders endeavored to run 
them effectively and efficiently, and many now-­familiar management con­
cepts began to emerge. For example, Adam Smith (particularly in The Wealth 
of Nations) described division of ­labor and time-­and-­motion studies and 
urged man­ag­ers to use them. Other writers of the period, including Robert 
Owen and Charles Dupin, examined the prob­lems of management in facto­
ries.12 Charles Babbage (1791–1871) attempted to build the forerunner of 
Practice Your Skills
It is the year 73 CE and the Emperor Vespasian has deci­ded to build a new Colosseum 
in Rome to regain the confidence of the Roman citizens ­after the death of Nero. This new 
structure ­will provide ­free gladiator games and other entertainment for 50,000 specta­
tors and has been designed to demonstrate the latest in Roman engineering, archi­
tecture, and fine arts. Imagine that you are the overseer of a group of ­people who are 
working on the Colosseum. Although some forced ­labor is being used on the construc­
tion, you are supervising a team of Roman builders who have had experience in large 
construction proj­ects before.10
How do you think you would approach the task of overseeing this group? How would 
you manage such a group? How would you motivate them? What differences would 
­there be in managing such a group 2,000 years ago and in managing a present-­day 
construction group?

the modern computer hoping to be able to calculate tabular material for the 
military and other organ­izations.13 He studied a number of manufacturing 
companies, and in 1832 he published a book, On the Economy of Machinery 
and Manufacture, in which he advocated that highly skilled workers should 
not work at tasks below their skill level.14
Indeed, interest in management spread widely during the Industrial 
Revolution as the factory system increased in size and complexity. As prob­
lems encountered in the workplace multiplied, so too did the demand for solu­
tions, and the number of ­people employed as man­ag­ers surged. At this point 
in time, the study of management became more systematized and formal, and 
vari­ous approaches or so-­called schools of management began to take shape. 
­These schools are theoretical frameworks that are based on dif­fer­ent assump­
tions about ­people and the organ­izations in which they work. Each of the 
schools reflects the prob­lems of its era, along with the most effective solutions 
of that time.
­Because experts divide and subdivide the schools in dif­fer­ent ways, ­there 
is no agreement about the number of schools of management. In addition, 
writers often disagree about the school to which a par­tic­u­lar idea, or theory 
belongs. The next section of this chapter ­will briefly discuss the most impor­
tant of ­these schools of thought. To simplify the discussion, not ­every school, 
nor all of the subdivisions, ­will be covered. We ­will cover only five of the major 
schools of management:
•	 The classical perspective
•	 The humanistic approach
•	 The quantitative perspective
•	 The systems approach, and
•	 Contingency management
Ele­ments from each of ­these schools of management thought are still 
being used in ­today’s organ­izations. In fact, most organ­izations use a com­
bination of practices derived from more than one of ­these approaches. 
However, management practice continues to evolve, and ­today’s man­ag­ers 
often supplement or tweak some of the more established schools of man­
agement thought to meet the needs of their employees and organ­izations. 
The new approaches have been outgrowths of changes in the environments 
in which con­temporary organ­izations function. Many of the ­factors found 
in ­these new approaches to management grew out of the tenets of the five 
schools listed above and none of them provides a complete theory of man­
agement. However, ­these three con­temporary approaches can be roughly 
classified as:
1.	 an increased emphasis on quality;
2.	 a growing reliance on evidence-­based management and big data; 
and
3.	 the development of a more employee-­centered workplace.
All of ­these new methods have all proven helpful to man­ag­ers confronting 
issues that arise in con­temporary organ­izations, and each ­will be discussed 
briefly. All ­these ideas about management and their approximate dates of 
influence are displayed in figure 2.1.

30  Introduction
Classical Perspectives
The earliest management schools are often categorized as “classical” 
perspectives. Before the advent of ­these classical perspectives, man­ag­ers 
drew on ­either their own past experience or that of the organ­ization in 
managing workers, but few attempted to find out if one way of ­doing a job 
was better than another. Employers hired workers with ­little thought 
about matching their skills to the tasks, and new workers rarely received 
any systematic training at all. ­There was no standardization of tools or 
pro­cesses.
As organ­izations grew and multiplied, writers and thinkers responded 
by attempting to bring a more systematic approach to management, pro­
posing more efficient and effective ways to run operations. As can be seen 
in figure 2.2, the most impor­tant of the Classical Schools are the Scientific 
Management, Bureaucratic, and Administrative Princi­ples schools. Each of 
­these schools ­will be described separately below. Interestingly, although ­these 
classical perspectives arose in dif­fer­ent countries, they share many common 
characteristics.
Scientific Management Movement
Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), an American mechanical engi­
neer, is considered the ­father of scientific management. The basic assump­
tion ­behind scientific management is that workers are motivated primarily 
by money, and that they ­will put forth their best efforts if they are rewarded 
financially. This approach emphasizes maximum output and focuses on elim­
inating waste and inefficiency, in part by planning and standardizing tasks 
and techniques. Taylor thought man­ag­ers should:
FIGURE 2.1. Major Schools of Management Thought

The Evolution of Management Thought  31
•	 Develop a series of rules and routines to help employees in their daily 
work
•	 Replace rule-­of-­thumb conventions by finding and adopting the most 
efficient methods
•	 Select each new hire scientifically, then train and develop the worker
•	 Provide workers with wage incentives to encourage increased output.15
Efficiency was Taylor’s central theme. While managing a steel factory 
in Pennsylvania, Taylor began to consider how he could get more work out of 
FIGURE 2.2. Classical Schools of Management
FIGURE 2.3. Frederick W. Taylor

32  Introduction
workers whom he considered naturally lazy. This laziness, he speculated, was 
fostered by poor management. He observed that “when a naturally energetic 
man works for a few days beside a lazy one, the logic of the situation is unan­
swerable. ‘Why should I work hard when the lazy fellow gets the same pay that 
I do and does only half as much work?’ ”16 Taylor proposed using scientific 
research methods to discover the one best way to perform each given job. He 
felt that greater productivity could be assured only through enforced stan­
dardization, including regulation of methods, adoption of the best available 
instruments and tools, hygienic working conditions, and task cooperation.
While Taylor was the most impor­tant advocate of the scientific manage­
ment movement, ­others also contributed to the popularization of the scientific 
approach, including Frank (1868–1924) and Lillian (1878–1972) Gilbreth. 
Frank, an engineer, and Lillian, who held a doctorate in psy­chol­ogy, ­were con­
cerned with increasing productivity. Their work sought to identify the best—­
that is, the most comfortable and time-­efficient—­manner for performing a 
task since they realized that ­human ­factors such as fatigue or wasted motion 
impeded the efficient execution of a task. (The Gilbreths also became famous 
as the efficiency-­expert parents in Cheaper by the Dozen, a book written by 
2 of their 12 ­children.)17
At about the same time, Henry L. Gantt (1861–1919) developed the task-­
and-­bonus system, similar to Taylor’s awards incentive. Gantt’s system estab­
lished set rates of output; if the organ­ization surpassed ­those production 
rates, workers received bonuses. In some cases, where his system was ­adopted, 
the production rate more than doubled. He is also known for devising the 
Gantt chart, still widely used to chart and calculate employees’ work sched­
ules. Along the horizontal axis of the chart, Gantt placed the time, work 
schedule, and work-­completed aspects; along the vertical axis, he listed the 
individuals and machines assigned to ­those schedules. Horizontal bars depicted 
each participant’s tasks and how ­these tasks fit into the schedule as a ­whole. 
In this way, man­ag­ers could easily track a proj­ect through its many stages 
to completion. See figure 2.5 for an example.

The Evolution of Management Thought  33
Bureaucratic School
At about the same time that scientific management was developing 
in the United States, in Eu­rope, Max Weber (1864–1920), a German soci­
ologist, was introducing many of the theories that underlie the bureaucratic 
school. Weber was the first to articulate a theory of the structure of author­
ity in organ­izations, to distinguish between power and authority, and to 
Talk About It
­These princi­ples of Scientific Management are still used in many manufacturing organ­
izations. Think of a task that you do regularly. This could be something like making 
lunch, ­doing laundry, or shopping. Imagine that you have F. W. Taylor or the Gilbreths 
standing by you encouraging you to become more efficient and to use your time better. 
They have suggested that you identify the major steps that go into this task and then 
eliminate unnecessary ones or combine several related tasks. They also mention that 
you might need better tools or training. Is ­there a way to standardize the way you do this 
task so you would be more efficient? Would you be willing to invest time in learning the 
“best” way to do this task if it saved you time?
FIGURE 2.5. Simplified Gantt Chart
Early in its development, scientific management devoted ­little attention 
to the organ­ization’s external environment, concerning itself almost exclu­
sively with internal operations. It also placed ­little emphasis on workers’ 
needs, focusing instead on producing better results.

34  Introduction
differentiate between compelled action and voluntary response. His concerns 
centered on the structure of the organ­ization rather than on the individual’s 
work style. Most of his writings and research dealt with the importance of 
specialization in ­labor, the value of regulations and procedures, and the advan­
tages of a hierarchical structure for informed decision-­making. To Weber, 
the ideal organ­ization was a bureaucratic one, in which:
1.	 ­Labor is divided with a clear indication of authority and 
responsibility;
2.	 The princi­ple of hierarchy exists;
3.	 Personnel are selected and promoted based on established 
qualifications;
4.	 Rules are written down and uniformly applied;
5.	 Promotion into management requires demonstrated technical 
competence;
6.	 Rules and procedures ensure reliable and predictable be­hav­ior.18
­Today the term bureaucracy is sometimes considered pejorative, as it is 
often associated with mindless rules and red tape, but Weber’s concept of the 
ideal structure has been extremely power­ful and pervasive. Bureaucracies 
work well ­under many conditions, especially for stable organ­izations in stable 
environments. Many large organ­izations, including many libraries, have 
structures that reflect Weber’s bureaucratic princi­ples.

Administrative Princi­ples
At about the same time that the Scientific Management and Bureau­
cratic schools came into existence, the Administrative Princi­ples school was 
being developed in France. A French industrialist, Henri Fayol (1841–1925), 
attempted to establish a conceptual framework, to identify the princi­ples 
of management, and to build a theory on that basis. Fayol took a scientific 
approach, but unlike Taylor, who began by considering the workers on the job, 
Fayol examined administration from the top down, concentrating on the 
man­ag­ers’ roles as planners, organizers, and controllers. He believed that 
man­ag­ers needed a set of basic princi­ples upon which to operate, and empha­
sized the need to teach business administration at all levels. He was the first 
to write about the functions of management, including planning, organ­ization, 
command, coordination, and control.19 He devised a set of princi­ples, shown 
in ­table 2.1. Fayol agreed with Taylor on many points: that workers ­were nat­
urally lazy and resisted work more effectively when toiling in groups; that 
they must be subject to discipline; that the incentive of higher wages was the 
best motivation; that employees differed markedly in native ability and capac­
ity, yet could all work better when properly instructed.
All three of ­these classical perspective schools emphasized consis­
tency, efficiency, and clear rules, and they all subordinated the needs of the 
worker to that of the organ­ization. They paid ­little or no attention to outside 
environmental ­factors. The greatest criticism of ­these early schools is that 
they place undue emphasis on the formal aspects of organ­ization and neglect 
entirely the ways in which individual personalities, informal groups, intra-­
organizational conflicts, and the decision-­making pro­cess affect the formal 
structure. They also have been criticized as leading to rigidity and re­sis­tance 
to change. Yet the theories of ­these three schools provided a way to efficiently 
or­ga­nize and manage the large organ­izations that ­were developing at the same 
time that the theories ­were being formulated. Many organ­izations, includ­
ing libraries, still depend heavi­ly on some aspects of ­these classic theories.
The Humanistic Approach
During the 1930s, management theorists began to examine the con­
cerns of the individuals who work in organ­izations. No longer ­were workers 
considered mere cogs in the machine of industry. Observation and study 
focused on the individual and on the informal groups found within the formal 
organ­ization, as theorists pondered how to integrate ­people into the work 
environment.
Practice Your Skills
Imagine that you are a director in a large, urban public library in the early 20th ­century 
and have read about some newfangled management theories being propounded by your 
contemporaries, Frederick W. Taylor and Max Weber. What impact do you think their 
ideas might have had on your way of managing? Which princi­ples might you want to 
try in your own library? How might ­these princi­ples be harder to implement in a library 
than in a factory?

36  Introduction
Mary Parker Follett
One of the first ­people to write about the ­human ele­ment in organ­ization 
was Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933), a social worker and a pioneer in the 
field of orga­nizational be­hav­ior. ­After her death in 1933, she was almost for­
gotten, but her contributions to management have been rediscovered in the 
past few de­cades.
Although she lived about the same time as Taylor and Fayol, her ideas 
­were very dif­fer­ent from theirs. Mary Parker Follett stressed the interactions 
of management and workers. Follett is now considered a management vision­
ary ­because she wrote about issues such as teamwork and empowerment in 
the early 20th ­century.20 To Follett, ­people ­were central to any business activ­
ity, and she advocated giving greater responsibility to workers.
­TABLE 2.1. Fayol’s Fourteen Princi­ples of Management
Division of work
­There should be a clear division of duties. Breaking jobs 
into smaller pieces ­will result in specialization. Manage­
ment should be separate and distinct.
Authority
The authority that individuals possess should be equal to 
their responsibility. Anyone responsible for the results of a 
task should be given the authority to take actions neces­
sary to ensure its success.
Discipline
­There should be clear rules and complete obedience to 
be­hav­ior in the best interest of the organ­ization.
Unity of command
An employee should receive ­orders from only one superior 
to avoid confusion and conflict.
Unity of direction
­There should be one head and one plan to ensure a 
coordinated effort.
Subordination of 
individual interest to 
the general interest
Employees should place the organ­ization’s concerns before 
their own.
Remuneration of 
personnel
Pay should be fair.
Centralization
Centralization is the desirable arrangement within an 
organ­ization.
Scalar chain
Each position is part of a vertical chain of authority 
(scalar chain). Communication should move up and down 
the chain of command.
Order
To avoid conflicts, ­there should be a right place for 
every­thing and every­one in the organ­ization.
Equity
Equality of treatment must be taken into account in dealing 
with employees. Justice should be tempered with kindness.
Stability of tenure of 
personnel
Long term stability of workers is good for an organ­ization.
Initiative
Incentive rewards must be provided to stimulate production.
Esprit de corps
Try to develop a strong sense of morale and unity. Com­
munication is the key to a satisfied working group.

The Evolution of Management Thought  37
Follett was also one of the first theorists to discuss orga­nizational con­
flict. She viewed conflict as a fact of life and argued that man­ag­ers needed 
to use conflict and make it work for an organ­ization. She was the first to 
advocate the concept of “win-­win” as the best method of resolving conflict. 
Her ideas on power ­were also ahead of her time. She rejected the idea of 
imposing one’s ­will over another, what she called “power over.” Instead, she 
believed in “power with.” She wrote, “[I]t is pos­si­ble to develop a conception 
of power with, a jointly developed power, a coactive power, not a coercive 
power. . . . ​Genuine power can only be grown, other­wise it ­will slip from ­every 
arbitrary hand that tries to grasp it.”21 Her thoughts on leadership ­were also 
visionary ­because she believed that leadership “does not mean coercion in 
any form. . . . ​It means, I think, freeing. The greatest ser­vice [one person] 
can render another is to increase his freedom—­his ­free range of activity and 
thought and his power of control.”22
Mary Parker Follett was an impor­tant figure in the history of manage­
ment ­because she was one of the earliest ­people to propose an alternative to 
the classical management school. Her ideas had to wait for a long time to be 
rediscovered, but she is now recognized as the originator of many ideas com­
monly accepted in 21st-­century management.
Mayo and the ­Human Relations Movement
The ­human relations school focused on the individual’s be­hav­ior and 
quality of life in the organ­ization, as well as on the needs, aspirations, and 
motivations of individuals, of the group, and of the organ­ization. The funda­
mental assumption was that if management could make employees happy, 
optimum per­for­mance would result.

38  Introduction
Proponents of this school drew many of their ideas from research con­
ducted by Elton Mayo (1880–1949) and a group of industrial psychologists 
at the Western Electric Hawthorne Plant in Chicago. The Hawthorne stud­
ies in the late 1920s ­were among the first to demonstrate the importance of 
the ­human side of organ­izations.23 Interestingly, the studies had begun in the 
spirit of scientific management; they ­were designed to find a way of increas­
ing efficiency and effectiveness by varying indoor illumination for workers 
at the plant.
As efficiency engineers experimented with vari­ous types of illumination, 
they noticed an unexpected reaction from Hawthorne employees. When illu­
mination increased, so did productivity. Surprisingly, however, when illumi­
nation decreased, production continued to increase. The same increase in 
productivity even occurred when the illumination was not changed at all. 
Examining this paradox, Mayo found that the explanation lay not in the 
changed working conditions, but in the changed way workers perceived them­
selves. By lavishing attention on the workers, the experimenters had made 
them feel as though they ­were impor­tant to the com­pany. As a result, ­these 
formerly indifferent employees had coalesced into congenial, cohesive groups 
with a ­great deal of collective pride. This helped fulfill the workers’ desire 
for affiliation, competency, and achievement, and thus their productivity 
increased. The Hawthorne studies revealed that:
1.	 Workers are more motivated by social rewards and sanctions than 
economic incentives;
2.	 Workers’ actions are influenced by the group;
3.	 In any formal organ­ization, both formal and informal norms exist.
The Hawthorne studies constitute a landmark in management research 
­because they ­were the first to describe organ­izations as social systems, con­
cluding that workers’ productivity depends not only on physical ­factors but 
on interpersonal ones as well. Mayo’s conclusions contrasted sharply with 
­those of Taylor, who believed workers ­were motivated only by money. Mayo 
maintained that workers are primarily motivated by togetherness and that 
they crave individual recognition within their group. In general, the ­human 
be­hav­ior movement maintained that if the organ­ization makes employees 
happy, it ­will gain their full cooperation and effort and therefore reach opti­
mum efficiency.
Self-­Actualizing Movement
Closely related to the ­human relations movement, the self-­actualization 
movement is often perceived as intertwined with it. It differed from the 
­human relations school, however, in that its primary point was not that man­
ag­ers should recognize the importance of workers and try to make them 
happy; instead it emphasized designing jobs that would allow workers to 
satisfy higher-­level needs and utilize more of their potential. Psychologist 
Abraham Maslow was one of the early proponents of this school. Maslow’s 
needs theory posits that ­humans have a hierarchy of needs; starting with 
the basic physical necessities of food, shelter, and clothing, his five ascending 
levels extend to the intangible needs of self-­actualization and fulfillment.24 
(Maslow’s theory ­will be described in greater depth in chapter 13.)
Douglas McGregor (1906–1964) was another influential thinker from 
this school. In the 1950s, McGregor put forth two sets of assumptions about 

The Evolution of Management Thought  39
Talk About It
John Doe, the supervisor of the mailroom in a very large library, is a micromanager. He 
stands over the shoulders of workers while they are performing tasks and makes “help­
ful” comments. He insists on checking and double-­checking ­every piece of work that is 
produced by his employees. He arranges all of the schedules and makes all of the deci­
sions. Workers are required to sign in and sign out of the workplace and are allowed no 
flexibility in scheduling. McGregor has given us a theory to explain this man­ag­er. Using 
McGregor’s theories, how would you classify John Doe, and what characteristics cause 
you to place him in that category?
workers; he called ­these Theory X and Theory Y (shown in ­table 2.2). The 
first set of assumptions, Theory X, reflects what McGregor considered the 
perceptions that traditional, autocratic man­ag­ers had of workers. McGregor 
asked ­whether a Theory X perception of workers was adequate in a demo­
cratic society in which the workforce enjoys a rising standard of living and 
has an increasing level of education. In most workplaces, he argued, the aver­
age employee does not get to develop his or her full intellectual potential. He 
then set out an alternative set of generalizations about ­human nature and 
the management of ­human resources, which he called Theory Y.25
Theory Y pres­ents a much more positive picture of workers, but the 
assumptions that constitute this theory create challenges for man­ag­ers. 
­These assumptions imply that ­human nature is dynamic, not static—­that 
­human beings have the capacity to grow and develop. Consequently, Theory 
Y makes man­ag­ers responsible for creating an environment that promotes 
employees’ positive development. Theory Y man­ag­ers do not try to impose 
external control and direction over employees; instead man­ag­ers allow them 
to exercise self-­direction. McGregor’s writings made many man­ag­ers aware 
that they had overlooked the potential of individual workers.
­TABLE 2.2. Assumptions of McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y
Assumptions of Theory X
Assumptions of Theory Y
Average ­human beings have an inherent 
dislike of work and ­will avoid it if they 
can.
The expenditure of physical and 
­mental effort in work is as natu­ral as 
play or rest.
­People must be coerced, controlled, 
directed, and threatened with punish­
ment to get them to work.
Individuals ­will exercise self-­direction 
and self-­control in the ser­vice of 
objectives to which they are committed.
­People prefer to be directed, wish to 
avoid responsibility, have relatively ­little 
ambition, and, above all, want security.
­People learn, ­under proper conditions, 
not only to accept but to seek 
responsibility.
­People are self-­centered and do not like 
change.
Imagination, ingenuity, and creativity 
are widely distributed among workers.
Another proponent of this school was Peter Drucker (1919–2005), who 
in the 1950s introduced the concept of management by objectives, which advo­
cates substituting a more participative approach for the traditional authori­
tarian style. Other disciples of this approach include Rensis Likert, Warren G. 

40  Introduction
Bennis, Robert Blake, and Jane Mouton, all of whom ­will be discussed ­later 
in this book.
The writers of the humanistic school challenged the view of employees as 
mere tools of the organ­ization, a view that underlay much of the classical per­
spective. Their ideas forced man­ag­ers to think about interpersonal pro­cesses in 
the workplace and to consider workers as valuable resources. Although critics 
have accused some of ­these writers of being overly simplistic about the nature 
of workers and individual complexity, their ideas remain very influential.
The Quantitative Approach
During World War II, scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians in 
the United States and ­Great Britain contributed to the war effort by work­
ing to solve logistical prob­lems related to military objectives. ­After the fight­
ing ended, business executives in the United States and a number of other 
countries ­adopted many of ­these mathematical techniques in the hope of cre­
ating better and more sophisticated management tools. This management 
movement came to be known as the quantitative approach. Thinkers within 
this school sought to apply complex mathematical, statistical, and economic 
models to civilian organ­izations, so that man­ag­ers could make more accu­
rate predictions and hence smarter decisions. Once computers became more 
widespread, the techniques used to inform decision-­making became more 
sophisticated. Subfields within the quantitative perspective include such 
areas as management science, decision theory, and operations research. In 
many ways, the quantitative perspective is related to the earlier scientific 
management approach.
Management scientists, in applying scientific analy­sis to managerial 
prob­lems, share the goal of improving the man­ag­er’s decision-­making abil­
ity, a high regard for economic effectiveness criteria, reliance on mathemati­
cal models, and the use of computers.26 The decision theory movement 
primarily concerns itself with studying rational decision-­making procedures 
as well as how ­human man­ag­ers actually reach such decisions. To do so, ­these 
theorists use techniques such as game theory, simulation, and linear program­
ming. Many of the researchers in this movement have drawn on psy­chol­ogy 
and economics to describe the decision-­making pro­cess27 or to prescribe 
how decisions should be made.28 The closely related field of operations research 
(OR) applies advanced analytical and mathematical methods to help man­
ag­ers make better decisions related to materials, capital, and employees. It 
is an applied field that is concerned with topics such as the best way to con­
figure a production fa­cil­i­ty or the most effective way to distribute goods that 
have been produced.
Overall, researchers in the quantitative school advanced man­ag­ers’ 
awareness of how models and measurement-­based approaches can be used 
in planning, controlling, and decision-­making. As ­will be discussed ­later, the 
advent of high speed computing in organ­izations, which has facilitated 
the gathering and manipulation of all types of data, has made all of ­these 
approaches more prevalent.
The Systems Approach
One of the most widely accepted theoretical bases for modern manage­
ment is called the systems approach. Envisioning organ­izations as systems 

The Evolution of Management Thought  41
that function as a ­whole, this movement integrates knowledge gleaned from 
the biological, physical, and behavioral sciences. Ludwig von Bertalanffy 
(1901–1972) was one of the first ­people to write about the “system theory of 
the organism.”29 He defined a system as “a set of ele­ments standing in inter­
relation among themselves and with the environment. The ­really impor­tant 
aspect is the interaction among the ele­ments to create a ­whole, dynamic sys­
tem. This system, if it is an open one, interacts with its environment.”30 Thus 
the system is influenced by the environment and in turn influences the envi­
ronment. In dissecting a system, one sees that it comprises multiple subsys­
tems; likewise, the organ­ization is but one subsystem of a larger environment. 
The older schools of management saw organ­izations as closed systems, never 
interacting with the outside environment. By contrast, system theory envi­
sions organ­izations as porous entities that are greatly affected by the out­
side world.
It is impossible to ignore that organ­izations themselves are component 
parts of an even larger system. Each individual organ­ization receives inputs 
that are pro­cessed in some way and eventually emerge from it as outputs. 
The surrounding environment influences all of the ele­ments of the system 
and provides feedback that allows the organ­ization to assess ­whether its out­
puts are successful or not. The ele­ments of the system theory can be seen in 
figure 2.8.
The inputs and the outputs vary according to the type of organ­ization. 
In a public library, the inputs could be (1) funding from the city to support 
ser­vices, (2) unpro­cessed books and journals being received, (3) users look­
ing for information and reading material, or (4) ­children coming for a story 
hour. All of ­these inputs are received from the outside environment and taken 
into the library, where they are pro­cessed or transformed in some way. Then 
the library produces outputs, which can be as diverse as (1) books ­going home 
FIGURE 2.8. The Ele­ments of the System Theory

42  Introduction
Talk About It
Think about an organ­ization you know well, ­either a library or another type of organ­
ization, and view it from the systems perspective. What are the inputs and the outputs 
of the system? What is done in the system to transform the inputs into outputs? How 
does the environment influence the system and how is feedback received? Do you think 
that the organ­ization is synergistic?
with patrons, (2) adults inquiring at the reference desk and having their 
information needs satisfied, or (3) ­children returning home talking about the 
story they heard at the library that morning. The library receives feedback 
from data such as the number of books circulated, the attendance at story 
hour or the comments of users, and then man­ag­ers use that feedback to make 
changes in the library’s operation.
Systems theory also has given man­ag­ers the concept of synergy; that is, 
the concept that the ­whole is greater than the sum of its parts. When an 
organ­ization is working well, each subunit can accomplish more than it could 
if it ­were working alone. Systems theory has resulted in man­ag­ers not view­
ing organ­izations in isolation, but remembering the importance of the envi­
ronment to their organ­izations, and the interdependence of the subsystems 
with the collective system.
The Contingency Approach
Beginning in the 1970s, the contingency approach became an influen­
tial way to think about management. Frederick W. Taylor attempted to find 
the “best” way to manage; contingency theory says that ­there is no one best 
way. Instead, it posits that situational ­factors are impor­tant. It considers the 
circumstances of each situation and then decides which response has the 
greatest chance of success.31 The contingency approach asserts that:
•	 ­There is no best management technique;
•	 ­There is no best way to manage;
•	 No technique or managerial princi­ple is effective all of the time.
Contingency theorists think that, if asked the question as to what works 
best, the ­simple response is, “It all depends on the situation.”32 They argue 
that universal princi­ples cannot be applied in all organ­izations ­because each 
one is dif­fer­ent. Type of organ­ization, outside influences, size, skill level of 
workers, and other ­factors all play a role in determining how to manage an 
organ­ization.
The challenges of the contingency approach lie in perceiving orga­
nizational situations as they actually exist, selecting the management tac­
tics best suited to ­those situations, and then competently implementing ­those 
tactics.33 Contingency theory tells man­ag­ers that ­there is no so-­called silver 
bullet—no one-­size-­fits-­all approach. Instead, a man­ag­er has to look at the 
organ­ization, its goals and objectives, the technology it uses, the ­people who 
work ­there, the outside environment, and a number of other ­factors before 
choosing a management approach.

The Evolution of Management Thought  43
New Approaches
The preceding sections of the chapter have provided an overview of the 
evolution and the history of management theory and practices. Although 
­there has not been a major overarching management theory developed 
since the contingency theory ­there are a number of current trends in organ­
izations that are causing man­ag­ers to rethink their approaches, and new 
techniques are being developed. As mentioned previously, all ­these new 
approaches have roots within the older schools of management, but the old 
techniques have been reworked to meet the needs of the current environment. 
­These new approaches can be categorized into three general areas: first, a 
focus on quality assurance; second, the use of data, including big data, in 
managerial decision-­making; and third, the restructuring of workplaces to 
meet the changing needs of ­today’s employees who desire greater engagement 
in their work life.
Quality Assurance
Quality has been of increasing interest in U.S. organ­izations since the 
1970s when the concept of Total Quality Management (TQM) was developed to 
help make U.S. manufacturing more competitive against international com­
petition. An emphasis on quality had been pioneered by W. Edwards Deming 
and Joseph M. Juran ­after World War II as they worked to improve manufac­
turing in Japa­nese companies. However, their efforts ­were largely ignored in 
the United States ­until competition from Japa­nese carmakers threatened the 
automobile industry. Consumers recognized that Japa­nese cars ­were of much 
higher quality than ­those manufactured in the United States, and U.S. car­
makers ­were forced to improve to remain in business. The notion of TQM 
swept the country. TQM was a comprehensive system of creating an organ­
ization committed to continuous improvement, and was in opposition to some 
of the early management theorists who believed that low costs ­were the best 
way to increase productivity and profits. The mantra of TQM was to get it 
right the first time and ­every time. Unfortunately, although TQM was ­adopted 
by many organ­izations, it was not always successful, especially where organ­
izations brought in “quality experts” who demanded changes that ­were never 
accepted by most man­ag­ers or employees. At that point, many organ­izations 
abandoned their TQM attempts, and the approach began to be considered by 
many as just a fad whose time had come and gone.
However, since the turn of the 21st ­century, ­there has been a renewed 
emphasis on quality and this emphasis has moved from the for-­profit sector 
to non-­profit sectors such as health care, education, and libraries. ­These 
organ­izations are realizing that if they wish to satisfy their customers and 
justify their funding, they need to improve their quality. They are making 
quality a top priority and making it known that employees are responsible 
for ensuring quality. Organ­izations focusing on quality are continuously 
seeking ways to improve every­thing they do; they seek feedback from their 
users on how to improve and then make any needed changes. Obviously, this 
approach to management often demands a change in the orga­nizational cul­
ture, and it takes time to implement and to be accepted. However, it is an effort 
worth making.
Peter Drucker knew this in the early 1970s when he wrote “a business 
is not defined by the com­pany’s name, statutes, or articles of incorporation. It 
is defined by the want the customer satisfies when he buys a product or ser­vice. 
To satisfy the customer is the mission and purpose of ­every business.” Drucker 

44  Introduction
goes on to say, “What the customer sees, thinks, believes, and wants, at 
any given time must be accepted by management as an objective fact. To the 
customer, no product or ser­vice, and certainly no com­pany is of much impor­
tance. The customer only wants to know what the product or ser­vice ­will do 
for him tomorrow.”34 Organ­izations that want to succeed must be dedicated 
to the satisfaction of their customers and thus have to be focused on main­
taining quality in their goods, in their ser­vices, and in every­thing ­else. In this 
time of greater competitiveness, it is not surprising that ­there has been a 
reemerging interest in quality. “Good enough” is no longer good enough for 
any organ­ization that wishes to be successful.
Data and Evidence-­Driven Management
Closely related to the drive for quality is the increased emphasis on using 
data or evidence as the basis for making decisions. One of the ways that 
organ­izations know that their customers are being satisfied is by gathering 
information about their satisfaction levels and then using that data to shape 
decisions about how to improve quality. This new approach to management 
is often called “evidence-­based” management (EBM). EBM attempts to bridge 
research and practice by collecting relevant data and then using that data 
to inform managerial decision-­making.35
Information technology offers a tool that allows organ­izations to more 
effectively gather data about the operations. The management lit­er­a­ture has 
recently been full of articles discussing “big data” and the analytics it can 
provide an organ­ization in revealing patterns, correlations, market trends, 
and customer preferences that had previously been unknown. Large organ­
izations such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook are using ­these analytics to 
improve their business per­for­mance. Of course, having more or better data 
is only the beginning; the organ­izations that succeed are the ones that are 
able to use the data in a useful manner. Organ­izations still need to have lead­
ership that is able set the right goals, define what success looks like and ask 
the right questions.36
­These data-­driven approaches are still relatively new and often pres­ent 
prob­lems. Some data analytics may provide misleading patterns. In addition, 
­there are many privacy concerns, which are likely to become increasingly 
impor­tant as more organ­izations begin to use such data to drive their 
decision-­making. However, as McAfee and Brynjolfsson wrote: “The evidence 
is clear: Data-­driven decisions tend to be better decisions. Leaders ­will ­either 
embrace this fact or be replaced by ­others who do. In sector ­after sector, com­
panies that figure out how to combine domain expertise with data science 
­will pull away from their rivals.”37
­There is an old adage in management, “You ­can’t manage what you ­can’t 
mea­sure.” All of the attempts to use evidence and data as the basis for man­
agerial decision-­making are efforts to help man­ag­ers make the best-­informed 
decisions pos­si­ble. However, ­there are many aspects of management that do 
not produce data or readily lend themselves to EBM. Especially when it comes 
to ­people, it is almost impossible to use a metric that captures all the aspects 
of ­human be­hav­ior. Often metrics are only a proxy, and the best man­ag­ers 
use both data and the knowledge they have accumulated from past experi­
ence and patterns and relations they have observed to help them in choosing 
the data to be collected and how to use that data to drive decision making.

The Evolution of Management Thought  45
Employee Engagement
Since the time of the ­human relations theorists, man­ag­ers have realized 
that employees who are engaged with their work are more productive and 
motivated. Engaged employees go beyond being merely content; they are fully 
involved in and enthusiastic about their work. ­These workers are attracted 
to and inspired by their work (“I want to do this”), committed (“I am dedi­
cated to the success of what I am ­doing”), and fascinated (“I love what I am 
­doing”). They care about the ­future of the organ­ization and are willing to 
work harder than expected to ensure that the organ­ization succeeds.38 Mil­
lennial employees, who are becoming an ever-­increasing proportion of the 
workforce, are especially attracted to organ­izations that provide work that 
engages them.
One of the proven ways that lead to higher employee engagement is to 
provide learning and development for workers. In an attempt to provide an 
environment that encourages engagement, some organ­izations have embraced 
the notion of becoming a learning organ­ization. As its name implies, a learn­
ing organ­ization is one in which all employees are constantly gaining skills 
and experience. ­People at all levels of the organ­ization focus on identifying 
and solving the prob­lems confronting that organ­ization. The learning organ­
ization maintains open communications, decentralized decision-­making, and 
a flatter orga­nizational hierarchy.
The concept of a learning organ­ization was first put forth by Peter Senge 
in 1990 as a way to help organ­izations meet the challenges of a rapidly chang­
ing environment.39 This type of organ­ization can overcome limitations, under­
stand the pressures against it, and seize opportunities when they pres­ent 
themselves. The basic princi­ples of the learning organ­ization approach clus­
ter into five core themes:
1.	 Personal mastery, with ­people identifying what is impor­tant in the 
pro­cess
2.	 ­Mental models, with the organ­ization continuously challenging 
members in order to improve their ­mental models
3.	 Shared vision, requiring an imagining of what the organ­ization 
should be
4.	 Team learning, through cooperation, communication, and 
compatibility
5.	 Systems thinking, recognizing the organ­ization as a ­whole.
Leaders assume vari­ous roles—­innovator, broker, director, producer, 
coordinator, monitor, facilitator, teacher, steward, or designer of learning 
processes—­for serving the staff rather than controlling it.40 The learning 
organ­ization approach is just one way that man­ag­ers are using to make “the 
shift from the command-­and-­control organ­ization, the organ­ization of depart­
ments and divisions, to the information-­based organ­ization, the organ­ization 
of knowledge specialists.”41 The success of any organ­ization is dependent 
on its ability to manage its knowledge so it ­will be able to respond and adapt 
to changes in the environment. ­Today’s workers respond favorably to being 
part of a learning organ­ization.

46  Introduction
Summary
This general overview does not permit detailed discussions of ­these 
management concepts and theories. Instead, ­these brief introductions are 
intended to provide the basic background necessary for a student or other 
interested professional to become familiar with the most well-­known theo­
ries. Applications of many of the theories mentioned are discussed in ­later 
chapters of this book.
Perhaps the best way of viewing the maze that is management theory is 
to consider each movement as a subsystem or a specific means of examining 
the overall system of ­people working together in organ­izations. The current 
po­liti­cal, economic, social, and technological climate is forcing a continuous 
reevaluation of systems and structures and a reexamination of some of the 
early management theories. Modern man­ag­ers are still using some parts of 
all of the theoretical frameworks discussed, ­because they often need to use a 
pastiche of approaches to fashion the best way to manage in any one par­tic­u­lar 
organ­ization.
Looking back on the history of management demonstrates the impact 
that managerial practices have had in the past. As Gary Hamel has written, 
“Management is undoubtedly one of humankind’s most impor­tant inven­
tions.” However, he also points out that management, like the combustion 
engine, is a “mature technology,” and he suggests that the field has to be 
reinvented for ­today’s environment.42 ­Today, man­ag­ers in all organ­izations 
are struggling to find the best type of management to meet the needs of the 
changing world, and it is no small task. However, although it is a daunting 
challenge, Hamel suggests that man­ag­ers should take heart. As he writes, 
“The first management pioneers had to turn freethinking, bloody-­minded 
­human beings into obedient, forelock-­tugging employees. They ­were working 
against the grain of ­human nature. We, on the other hand, are working with 
the grain. Our goal is to make organ­izations more ­human—­not less.”43 The 
managerial styles of ­today ­will continue to evolve, and tomorrow’s man­ag­
ers may be advocating new techniques of management that are unheard of 
­today. However, like all good man­ag­ers of the past, tomorrow’s man­ag­ers ­will 
attempt to find the style that best suits the needs of their organ­ization and 
its employees.
An Historical Perspective of 
Management in Libraries
The rest of this chapter ­will discuss how libraries have deployed ­these 
general management approaches. From its beginning, library management, 
as might be expected, showed no identifiable characteristics that set it apart 
from other types of orga­nizational management. Therefore, trends, theories, 
and techniques discussed in management lit­er­a­ture easily found their way 
into library practice and, over the years, have been implemented with vary­
ing degrees of success. Librarians often ­adopted par­tic­u­lar managerial 
approaches ­later than the for-­profit world did, but eventually tried almost 
­every managerial approach introduced into the corporate sector. The inte­
gration of ­those theories and techniques into library operations has been 
extensively reported in library lit­er­a­ture for more than a ­century.
Library management before the beginning of the 20th ­century was still 
in an early stage of development, and ­there was no accepted set of best 

The Evolution of Management Thought  47
Talk About It
In 1876, in the first issue of what would become Library Journal, Melvil Dewey wrote of 
the change that was occurring in the library profession. “From the first, libraries have 
commanded ­great re­spect, and much has been written of their priceless worth; but the 
opinion has been largely prevalent that a librarian was a keeper only, and had done his 
full duty if he preserved the books from loss. . . . ​The time is come when we are not 
astonished to find the ablest business talents engaged in the management of a public 
library. Not that we have less scholarship, but we have more life. The passive has 
become active, and we look for a throng of ­people ­going in and out of library doors as in 
the markets and the stores.”45
What changes ­were occurring in libraries and in their environment that caused 
Dewey to make this statement? What was the impact on libraries when the “scholar” 
librarians ­were replaced by man­ag­ers?
practices for managing libraries. Management techniques had not been 
impor­tant when libraries ­were smaller, but as ­these organ­izations grew, ­there 
was a need for knowledge about the best way to manage larger numbers of 
employees and more complex organ­izations.
A number of librarians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries made 
changes in traditional library practices in an attempt to increase the effec­
tiveness and efficiency of the libraries they managed. For instance, Melvil 
Dewey, Charles McCarthy, and Charles Cutter in the United States experi­
mented with ways to achieve greater efficiency and standardization in librar­
ies.44 ­These pioneering library man­ag­ers viewed the operation of libraries 
differently than their pre­de­ces­sors, who had considered themselves primarily 
as scholars, not man­ag­ers. Since ­there was not a large body of extant man­
agement expertise available to draw from, in effect each was in­de­pen­dently 
attempting to find methods that met the needs of their own institutions.
In 1887, F. M. Cruden, librarian of the St. Louis Public Library, stated, 
“the duties of a chief executive of a library differ in no essential way from 
­those of a man­ag­er of a stock com­pany. The librarian may profit by the meth­
ods of the businessman.”46 Arthur E. Bostwick, addressing the New Zealand 
Library Association in 1891, advocated the adoption of the methods of busi­
ness efficiency in the operation of libraries.47 In ­England, beginning in 1902, 
E. W. B. Nicholson, the librarian at Oxford University, produced the Bodle­
ian Staff Kalendar [sic], which evolved over the years from a schedule of the 
work that had to be performed into one of the first manuals of library prac­
tice.48 Other library leaders of the era, including Charles C. Williamson, 
emphasized the value to libraries of industrial methods, pointing out that 
“no one has attempted yet to treat comprehensively the princi­ples and phi­
losophy of library ser­vice or library management.”49 When Williamson wrote 
this, the scientific management school was being developed; its theories had 
already been applied to a number of industrial situations but not yet to librar­
ies. Not ­until the 1930s was attention focused on applying scientific man­
agement to libraries. Donald Coney emphasized this “new” approach by 
stating, “Scientific management furnishes library administrators with a use­
ful instrument for orientating their activities.”50 In the late 1940s and early 
1950s, Ralph R. Shaw began his landmark studies of the scientific manage­
ment of library operations.51

48  Introduction
The influence of the ­human relations school on library and information 
ser­vices also began to be seen in the early 1930s; issues relating to library 
workers began to receive attention, and training for library administrators 
emphasized the personnel relations approach. In the mid-1930s, J. Periam 
Danton emphasized the trend ­toward the ­human aspect of management, in 
which personnel administration was paramount to the democ­ratization of the 
library organ­ization.52 This was further expounded in Clara W. Herbert’s 
1939 volume on personnel administration in libraries.53 Among Herbert’s rec­
ommendations ­were greater attention to personnel administration; more 
attention to basic organ­ization, particularly directed ­toward simplifying 
and coordinating activities; greater staff development; and better working 
conditions.54
The quantitative, or mathematical, school also had a ­great influence on 
library operations. Beginning in the late 1960s, library man­ag­ers used applied 
operations research in decision-­making. In the 1960s, a group of researchers 
led by Philip Morse at the Mas­sa­chu­setts Institute of Technology (MIT), along 
with a ­later group headed by Ferdinand Leimkuhler at Purdue University, 
deployed operations research to study library prob­lems.55 In 1972, the Whar­
ton School at the University of Pennsylvania finished a study that had been 
supported by a federal grant to design and develop a model for management 
of information systems in universities and large public libraries.56
As management theory evolved, librarians continued to apply the devel­
oping precepts and princi­ples to their own organ­izations. Just as they had 
with the scientific and the humanistic schools of management, librarians 
­adopted systems concepts and contingency management. Libraries are now 
seen as open systems that are influenced by and must respond to the larger 
environment. With the wide ac­cep­tance of contingency management, library 
man­ag­ers seek the specific management approach that ­will best suit the 
needs of each unique setting.
Libraries are also adopting the new perspectives that center on quality 
assurance, evidence-­based management, and permitting employees to have 
a greater engagement in their work life. More and more libraries are using 
assessment techniques and working to improve the quality of their ser­vices. 
They are heeding the advice of Hernon and Altman who state that, “Librar­
ians need new ways of thinking and alternatives for applying a customer-­
centered model of ser­vice quality.” They urge librarians to “develop new ways 
to look at ser­vice . . . ​and address the perspectives of stakeholders interested 
in libraries and their institutional context.”57 A number of libraries have 
already instituted quality assurance programs and more ­will likely follow 
their lead.58
Evidence-­based management is gaining a foothold in ­today’s libraries 
where assessment and evaluation are becoming part of the normal operat­
ing procedures of organ­izations. For instance, the library at the largest uni­
versity in Ireland, University College Dublin, recently faced severe financial 
cutbacks and used EBM to carry out a university-­wide print resources can­
cellation proj­ect. A ­great deal of data was gathered about the use of vari­ous 
print resources, and the final decisions made about the cancellations ­were 
well received.59 One library man­ag­er stated, “Having objective data pre­
sented by expert librarians allowed me as library officer to ensure that the 
input of my colleagues in the pro­cess was governed by data and information 
inasmuch as pos­si­ble so that we could make wise decisions that would have 
the least impact pos­si­ble on both the research and pedagogical agendas of 
the School.”60 ­There is a need for all librarians to advocate for the research 

The Evolution of Management Thought  49
Talk About It
In Hard Choices in Hard Times: Lessons from the ­Great Depression, the impact of the 
­Great Depression on libraries is described vividly. “The experiences of the Chicago Pub­
lic Library provide a fascinating case study of efforts to maintain a public ser­vice ­under 
trying circumstances. Chicago in the early 1930s was on the brink of collapse. As unem­
ployment soared to an estimated 30 ­percent, desperate workers took to the streets where 
they ­were met by tear gas and baton-­wielding police. The Chicago Public Library’s finan­
cial fortunes declined rapidly. As early as January 1930, the library predicted a bud­get 
short fall of 20 ­percent. The initial response included reducing library branch hours 
and laying off about one-­fifth of the staff. . . . ​Facing protests over reduced hours, the 
library reexamined its priorities. Branch hours ­were restored and many staff ­were 
rehired at reduced salaries. In May 1931 all book ordering was stopped. In a 1932 letter, 
the library director, Carl Roden, summarized the situation: ‘We are afflicted by the worst 
financial hardship we have ever suffered. We have bought no books for eight months, 
the magazine subscriptions for 1932 ­were cancelled. . . . ​No bud­get for the current year 
has been attempted and the prospects of funds for even our curtailed activities, are, at 
this writing, far from encouraging.”64
It is always said that we can learn from history. What do you think that ­today’s 
libraries can learn from the impact of the ­Great Depression on libraries in the 1930s?
that would produce more evidence to allow them to make more informed deci­
sions to provide better management and more effective ser­vices.61
It is hardly surprising that so many libraries are also finding ways to 
permit employees to have greater engagement with their workplace. Librar­
ians have enthusiastically ­adopted the learning organ­ization theory. Many 
articles have been published in recent years describing libraries of vari­ous 
types that have ­adopted Senge’s concept of the learning organ­ization.62
­Later chapters of this book ­will examine in greater depth how ­these 
management theories are being applied in libraries ­because ­these new 
approaches are the foundation of many developments in con­temporary library 
management. In all organ­izations, management pro­cesses are continuing to 
evolve to meet the demands of ­today’s volatile environment. It ­will be the 
challenge of library man­ag­ers to “reinvent” management to face the prob­
lems that confront their organ­izations ­today and in the ­future.63
Conclusion
We have seen that the vari­ous management theories developed in the 
past 150 years—­scientific management, ­human relations, quantitative, open 
system, contingency, and learning environment—­are being applied to library 
and information center operations ­today. The continued use, development, 
and refinement of ­those theories and techniques should result in more effi­
cient and effective library ser­vice. The work is not finished ­because man­ag­
ers continue to be challenged by how to make their organ­izations more 
effective. ­There ­will never be just one “best” way to manage, but it is the task 
of managers always to be looking for a better way.65

50  Introduction
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Many of the ideas that we think of as modern and cutting edge have been used 
in the past. Some years ago, an article in Harvard Magazine dealt a serious blow 
to the Hollywood version of pyramid building, in which Charlton Heston as 
Moses commands the pha­raoh to “Let my ­people go!” The article reported that 
archaeologist Mark Lehner has found evidence that pyramid workers ­were not 
slaves at all—at least not in the modern sense of the word. Instead, Lehner 
believes, the pyramids ­were built by “a rotating ­labor force in a modular, team-­
based kind of organ­ization.”66
Lehner’s discovery provides a good example of how many techniques that 
we think are very modern are ­really not. Can you think of any other seemingly 
new developments that ­were actually taken from the past?
2.	You are a library director in an academic library in 1938—­long before the advent 
of any computer technology in libraries. It is the era of typewriters and adding 
machines (both non-­electric), of duplicate hand-­written or typed book cards, of 
typing short-­form original cata­loging if LC cards are not available. Of course, 
OCLC does not exist. The only national cata­logs are in book form and only that 
of the Bibliotheque Nationale, completed to the letter “R,” offers much assistance 
in searching.
Your library is a typical one with a small collection and a small staff. The 
educational preparation for librarians is a fifth year bachelor’s degree (BLS) 
from a library science program, and librarians perform many tasks, which are 
essentially clerical in nature. Their pay is low. Some reference ser­vice is provided, 
but ­little effort is put into teaching students, especially on a formal basis, about 
the use of the collections. Book se­lection in the library is done by interested fac­
ulty, not librarians. The acquisition bud­get is small and the collection is com­
posed almost entirely of books and journals since only the largest libraries hold 
any type of audio-­visuals or microfilm. The librarians on your staff have had 
­little input into decisions made by you. Only a few cooperative library ventures 
are in existence, and your library is not a part of any of them. It operates in 
relative isolation with no formal relationships with other libraries or librarians 
outside of your own institution.67
As a library director in that library, what management theories might you 
rely on to operate your library? Would you be relying on the same theories if you 
­were managing a 21st ­century academic library? What are some of the ­factors 
that account for the differences in the style of management?
3.	 Proponents of EBM encourage man­ag­ers to be more “scientific” by using research 
to gather data that is then used in making managerial decisions, but manage­
ment is both a science and an art. In a recent article in Evidence Based Library 
and Information Practice, Denise Koufogiannakis argues that librarians need 
to recognize both ele­ments. She writes,
We need to embrace both the science and the art of evidence based 
practice—­other­wise, we ­will overlook impor­tant ele­ments of the ­whole 
situation. . . . ​­Doing so is not neat and tidy, but does that ­really ­matter? 
LIS is a social science, and the ‘social’ implies ‘messy’ ­because ­people and 
real-­life situations are not easily controlled. The art of our craft allows us 
to embrace the messy situation, find ways to be creative, put our profes­
sional judgements [sic] to use and find the best solutions to meet the needs 
of individual users by applying the best of what we find in the research 

The Evolution of Management Thought  51
Discussion Questions
1.	The psychologist, Abraham Maslow, thought that ­humans ­were perpetual 
wanting animals. He wrote, “Most members of our society who are normal, are 
partially satisfied in all their basic needs and partially unsatisfied in all their 
basic needs at the same time.”69
Do you think that Maslow is correct in his assumptions? Are any of us 
­every completely satisfied? How could this lack of satisfaction be used in moti­
vating workers?
2.	How does a knowledge of the managerial practices of the past improve the per­
for­mance of ­today’s man­ag­ers?
3.	 Douglas McGregor, the originator of Theory X and Theory Y, wrote, “The aver­
age person learns, ­under proper conditioning, not only to accept but to seek 
responsibility. The capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of imagination, 
ingenuity, and creativity in the solution of orga­nizational prob­lems is widely, not 
narrowly, distributed in the population.70
Do you agree with McGregor? Are ­there workplaces that allow the employees 
to display ­these traits and ­others that squelch them? Discuss some the practices 
of places where you have worked that affect the initiative of their workers.
4.	What kind of workplace would you expect if Frederick W. Taylor ­were your boss? 
What about Mary Parker Follett? Elton Mayo? What would you expect to be the 
strengths and weaknesses of each of ­these workplaces? If you ­were able to pick 
your boss, whom would you choose?
5.	 Consider all the schools of management discussed in this chapter and then think 
about workplaces with which you are familiar. Can you see ele­ments of ­these vari­
ous school being used in con­temporary organ­izations? Would any of ­these organ­
ization been improved by changing their management perspectives?
lit­er­a­ture together with the best of what we know is likely to help this 
person. My purely unscientific judgement as a practitioner is that LIS 
practice is prob­ably 30% science and 70% art (more or less depending 
upon the specific topic). As such, I think that we cannot ignore the art of 
evidence based practice, and in fact should begin thinking about ways to 
be better artists as well as better scientists.68
How do you think man­ag­ers should ­handle the conflict between art and sci­
ence in their work? What happens if ­either ele­ment is ignored? Why do you think 
some man­ag­ers ­favor one ele­ment over the other? Do you agree that 70 ­percent of 
LIS practice is an art?
4.	 Have you ever worked in a job where the supervisor was a micromanager who 
constantly checked up on your work and acted as though you ­were incapable of 
making any decisions on your own? How did that make you feel? Did you work up 
to your full capacity on that job? Do you think man­ag­ers who practice McGregor’s 
Theory X prevent employees from reaching their potential? Are ­there some work­
ers who need to be treated in that manner? As an employee would you prefer to 
work for a Theory X or a Theory Y man­ag­er?

Change: The 
Innovative Pro­cess
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Identify the ­factors or pressures that necessitate change
•	 Understand barriers to making changes
•	 Learn how to participate in and foster a climate of change
•	 Know the importance of communication in the change pro­cess
Libraries and information center staff encounter change ­every day. Man­ag­
ers realize that for the success of good information ser­vices in this dynamic, 
demanding environment, it is necessary to make changes so that the 
organ­ization ­will continue to prosper and fulfill its mission. Among other 
­things, this means empowering all levels of responsible workers in the library 
system to participate fully in a continuous change pro­cess. A librarian’s 
focus ­will be on users, and old ways of working may be discarded and a 
culture of empowerment fostered throughout the organ­ization to enhance 
quality of ser­vice.
The popu­lar concept of a paradigm shift in order for major changes to 
occur most often means changing the culture into a new orga­nizational struc­
ture with realignment between what customers need and how ­those needs 
would be met. It requires reviewing and adjusting individual worker efforts 
with revised orga­nizational goals. Rafael Ball offers an in­ter­est­ing article1 
describing the history of scholarly communication and ­these shifts to the sta­
tus quo.

58  Introduction
Management on the Job: Transitioning from 
a Traditional School Library to a Learning Commons
In a series of five brief articles written during her first year on a new job, Christina A. 
Bentheim demonstrates how she collaborated with the school principal to align the 
library to the new mission of the Brinley ­Middle School. Each article shows the steps 
(and missteps) she took and the pro­cess she used to change this school library. Interest­
ingly she was offered the job in April for the following fall, but she began working in the 
spring to plan and to prepare the library, since she felt that if she waited ­until arriving 
in the fall, “it would be too late.”2 During this time she investigated the library and 
gained a lot of information before she started officially in the job. Ensuring early access 
to the online cata­log, she ran reports and gained understanding of the collection and 
how it was used. She made many visits to the school in May and June and began devel­
oping relationships with the principal, teachers, and other staff (including janitors). She 
kept a notebook of photos and ideas for the library. She also used social media to commu­
nicate. By the end of June (remember this is before she starts the job in September) she 
had re-­arranged the physical space, cleared out-­of-­date materials, and redecorated it. 
Using strategic planning, vision and mission statements, and personal goals as a guide, 
she revitalized the library and changed the focus to students. The outcome was an 
87 ­percent increase in circulation, a significant use of the learning common’s Web site, 
and a valuable place where teachers find resources. She found that providing flexible 
space and bringing the library’s equipment to classrooms greatly increased use and 
usability. Her one-­year turnaround demonstrates how one professional with energy and 
vision can accomplish successful change.
Change plays an impor­tant role in developing information ser­vices in 
all types of libraries and other information centers. This chapter pres­ents 
an introduction to the topic of change in information ser­vices organ­izations 
in an ever-­evolving global environment.
­Factors Promoting Change
Why should a management book devote a chapter to the concept of 
“change”? Change is everywhere in our lives, and libraries and information 
centers have been changing dramatically and evolving. Lively, sometimes 
heated, discussions center not on ­whether ­there should be change, but how 
to identify what should be done differently and how best to do it. In informa­
tion ser­vices circles, just as in most areas of society, one can hear vari­ous, 
sometimes conflicting, proposals that are alternatives to the status quo. Many 
change strategies are expressed, at least initially, in the form of how, what, 
and why questions. ­These are all questions and issues focusing on the means 
of ­doing ­things.
A “how” question: “How do we get ­people to be more open or to assume 
more responsibility or to be more creative or be more productive?” Intertwined 
is the question “what?” “What changes are necessary, what mea­sures should 
be in place to ensure per­for­mance, what standards need to be applied, what 
do we want to accomplish with change?” The primary and most basic question 
of all is “why?” “Why do we do what we do? Why should we identify a better 
way of ­doing what we do?” All of this questioning leads to yet another under­
lying question, “What does ­doing something differently ­really require? What 

Change  59
Talk About It
J. K. Rowling said in a speech to the Harvard Alumni Association, “We do not need magic 
to change the world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have 
the power to imagine better.”3 Team up with another student and discuss what power 
each of you has to imagine a better library. Make a list of personal qualities, skills, and 
abilities you could utilize to participate in a change management pro­cess.
indicators can be used to predict success? What new or dif­fer­ent standards 
should be applied? What mea­sures of per­for­mance ­will we use to know if we 
are effective?”
A successful outcome of that questioning requires the following:
•	 A review of the culture of the organ­ization
•	 Acquisition of the mind-­set necessary to accept the need for change
•	 A basic understanding of change and how to manage it.
This understanding reduces uncertainty and promotes openness, good 
communication, and a clear vision. Effective leadership and employee empow­
erment lead to positive results. Strategic change, even reengineering, is the 
outcome of this questioning and learning pro­cess.
Some Definitions
Change: ­Those situations in which per­for­mance of job functions requires 
­people throughout the organ­ization to learn new be­hav­iors and skills
Empowerment: Encouraging and authorizing workers to take the initiative 
to improve operations, reduce costs, and improve product quality and 
customer ser­vice
Reengineering: Examining and altering a system to remake it in a new 
form
Paradigm shift: Significant change from one fundamental view to another, 
which often includes a discontinuity
The biggest challenge is implementing new methods and systems into a 
long-­established organ­ization. That effort is not easy ­because it requires that 
employees give up familiar practices and procedures. To accomplish change 
requires a delicate balance and a deliberate progression ­toward renewing the 
organ­ization through a series of time-­consuming initiatives that demands 
continuous questioning of the status quo.
Many outside ­factors serve as primary agents for change in information 
ser­vices. ­Those so called environmental pressures, outside the organ­ization, 
are most often ones over which the organ­ization can exercise ­little or no con­
trol. Examples of environmental pressures include fiscal changes to the par­
ent institution, changes to products purchased by the library, vendor mergers 
or ­going out of business, demographic changes in a community, and change 
in user expectations brought on by networked technologies and ubiquitous 
and power­ful search engines. Faced with such external forces, man­ag­ers of 

60  Introduction
Talk About It
“Change is the law of life. And ­those who look only to the past or pres­ent are certain to 
miss the ­future.”4 John F. Kennedy offered this advice more than 50 years ago. Where do 
you see examples of ­people in the information community looking to the past, pres­ent, 
or ­future? Make a list and discuss your examples.
information ser­vices organ­izations are challenged to develop successful out­
comes. Continuous changes in the information technology environment drive 
libraries to change. ­These changes in technology encourage and enable part­
nerships, consortia, and collaborative alliances locally and across the globe.
In addition, several global changes have affected knowledge-­based librar­
ies and information centers. Primary among them are the following:
•	 The emergence of a global complex enables information ser­vices cen­
ters, as a part of the information economy, to offer a greater variety of 
ser­vices: in-­house, online, through consortia, and via virtual access.
•	 The development of a changing po­liti­cal and social matrix empow­
ers seekers of information to express disenchantment with the sta­
tus quo and to demand alternatives.
•	 The availability of alternative information sources provides options 
where users may turn when libraries do not provide sufficient ease 
of access.
•	 The growth of massive digitization proj­ects from ­every corner of the 
world offers ubiquitous availability.
•	 The creation of a knowledge economy is characterized by procuring 
ideas and information in a global society; knowledge has become an 
impor­tant central ­factor in development.
­These initiatives pres­ent new challenges ­because, although man­ag­ers in infor­
mation ser­vices organ­izations cannot control much of the changing world 
around them, they can control how they respond in the area of information ser­
vices and can choose ­whether to anticipate and embrace change or to resist 
it. Man­ag­ers in ­these organ­izations can choose to view change as a cause or 
a condition and thereby become reactive or proactive.
For knowledge-­based organ­izations, this ongoing revolution already has 
launched a gigantic wave of change. How customers seek, access, use, and 
value information has forced new physical and intellectual structures to meet 
­those needs. Immediate decisions are made to effectively or­ga­nize and com­
mit resources in support of technology, employee development, and other 
ongoing or new priorities or initiatives. The information ser­vices organ­ization 
should be managed, or more appropriately, guided in a way that effective 
decisions can be made. However, the time frame for identifying and imple­
menting change continues to be shortened. This requires man­ag­ers and staff 
at ­every level to be immediately accountable for their job per­for­mance as well 
as decisions about the ­future of their primary information ser­vices initia­
tives. Usually ­these decisions are based upon best-­guess assumptions about 
the ­future.

Change  61
In some ­future scenarios, management theorists and con­sul­tants have 
advocated redesigning organ­izations through reengineering,5 a term that 
has become synonymous with redundancy and downsizing. However, such a 
pro­cess of radical change requires reinventing the structure, systems, and 
ser­vices of libraries and information centers to achieve improvement and to 
offer a value-­added profile. Other theorists and con­sul­tants encourage more 
fundamental restructuring, whereas a few take the idea further, forecasting 
the need to cope with what has been called an “age of unreason.”6 With few 
dissenting opinions, it is accepted that the pres­ent time of discontinuity 
and ferment, what some have called chaos,7 demands reevaluation, renewal, 
revamping, even redesign of previously rather stable library and informa­
tion ser­vice organ­izations. In that pro­cess, futurists, trying to predict out­
comes, are making forecasts concerning the importance of vari­ous forces that 
have been growing for some time.
Change activity produces a paradox ­because an organ­ization’s suc­
cess depends upon the ability of staff to maintain stability while managing 
change. Man­ag­ers balance their responsibility to control with the need to 
inspire. Vision, planning, development, persuasion, and assessment skills are 
required of con­temporary man­ag­ers. Knowing what to change and how to 
change are imperative for the pro­cess to succeed. This requires an under­
standing of how a knowledge-­based organ­ization’s direction of change and 
innovation can shape the level of knowledge transfer ­because implementing 
that transfer requires self-­direction and teamwork.
Library and information ser­vices organ­ization man­ag­ers ­today hire 
knowledge workers whose chief resource is their ability to think conceptu­
ally, act logically on what they know, and keep an open, flexible mind. Man­
ag­ers understand that their employees are experts and let them participate 
in decisions.8 Successful organ­izations combine energies and talents of groups 
of ­people with an open, two-­way communication strategy—­with all mem­
bers taking responsibility for their actions—­versus the so-­called grapevine 
approach, which is an informal communication network that may distort 
communication and bar organ­izations from achieving desired results. Indi­
viduals, working in such a proactive orga­nizational setting, view change not 
as happening to them but as an opportunity to create what they have agreed 
upon as a ­viable and necessary ­future.
Both deliberate planning and directional change, then, are required, 
­because without the order that planned change provides, an organ­ization is 
crippled, and without change, a knowledge-­based organ­ization is no longer 
­viable, becomes obsolete, and is ­either marginalized or quickly superseded 
by other entities willing and ready to step in, often with a profit motive.
Empowerment—­An Agent of Change
Individuals have a tendency to discount change as a force in an organ­
ization’s life, while at the same time embracing it in their own personal lives. 
As an example, research has shown that almost a third of all U. S. workers 
are so-­called discounters, who routinely reject the significance of potential 
­future change; another 40 ­percent are so-­called extrapolators, who believe 
that the trends of the recent past ­will continue into the foreseeable ­future. 
However, 40 ­percent of the discounters and extrapolators indicate that they 
are currently ­going through a major, self-­initiated change in their own lives 
or ­careers, and another 40 ­percent are actively planning to undertake such 
a change.9 How can this variance of attitude ­toward ac­cep­tance of change in 

62  Introduction
personal lives but re­sis­tance to change in the orga­nizational life be explained? 
Perhaps the answer lies in an orga­nizational culture and value system that 
traditionally would pres­ent barriers to change. ­Those barriers can be iden­
tified as:
•	 Failure to create a sense of urgency for change
•	 Lack of a shared vision
•	 Failure to remove the obstacles to the new vision
•	 Failure to anchor changes into the organ­ization’s culture
•	 Failure to systematically plan for and create short-­term wins
•	 Failure to follow through with plans.10
When employees of libraries and information centers are confident of 
their success and believe that they are indispensable, complacency easily 
becomes a trap. Although historic success has been built on innovative ideas, 
­there is a common tendency to rely on past achievements. But a continua­
tion of that success requires a reawakening and renewal in ­today’s competi­
tive environment, and this is an active and deliberate pro­cess. From the 
­human side, barriers to that success are both psychological and institutional, 
with most being in the minds of knowledge workers rather than on organ­
ization charts.11 Predictably, this requires a re­orientation and recommitment 
of all ­people working in knowledge-­based organ­izations: man­ag­ers and 
non-­managers, professional and support staff. It also requires a marketing 
program that informs both customers and potential customers that their 
information and knowledge needs can be met. It is obvious that without due 
preparation, change can place any organ­ization on a confrontation course, 
­because it is a threatening pro­cess and can easily get out of control. To under­
stand that re­sis­tance, one must look at what is happening in knowledge-­based 
libraries and information centers.
Man­ag­ers in information ser­vices organ­izations find it imperative to 
embrace change. Initially, some have reevaluated the types of knowledge and 
skills needed by the workforce in anticipation of ­future needs. They have 
formed alliances with faculty of library and information science programs 
to identify core subjects and values necessary for current and ­future ser­vices. 
With this knowledge and ethical approach has come empowerment of pro­
fessionals with increased authority and more freedom to be creative. This 
also creates a culture that encourages change and improvement across infor­
mation ser­vices bound­aries. A common aspiration, the vision (which ­will be 
discussed in more detail in chapter 4, Strategic Planning, Decision Making, 
and Policy) forms the basis for the ­future direction and priorities for infor­
mation ser­vice organ­izations. ­Human resources, complemented by materials 
and methods, techniques and tools, are components to which long-­established 
management princi­ples traditionally have been applied. ­These remain the 
core of a changing knowledge-­based organ­ization’s life, and its success depends 
upon all employees’ knowledge and commitment.
Vari­ous other ­factors also drive strategic initiatives for change in library 
and information ser­vices, including costs of ser­vices, speed and methods of 
delivery, new teaching techniques, changing values and expectations of cus­
tomers, entrepreneurial activities, and quality of value-­added ser­vice. Also, 
the technological climate and global communication systems foster the recon­
figuration of knowledge-­based organ­izations and their ser­vices. In such a 

Change  63
Talk About It
Change management is required ­because “the need for change arises from the develop­
ment of new products, the entry of new competitors, shifts in consumer tastes, and from 
alterations in the cultural, po­liti­cal, economic and ­legal frameworks within which a firm 
operates.”12 In a small group setting, make a list of new products, new competitors, shifts 
in consumer tastes, and changes in cultural, po­liti­cal, economic and ­legal structures in 
the environment of libraries and information centers. Compare your lists to ­others and 
discuss.
dynamic environment, the significance of what is done and how it is done is 
continually challenged by questioning why it is done or, in some cases, why 
it is not done. Effecting change in libraries and information centers is com­
plex and difficult, but necessary and worth the effort.
Paradigm Shift—­Myth or Real­ity
A paradigm shift occurs in resources, in ser­vices, and in the user expec­
tations within knowledge-­based organ­izations and in knowledge workers’ 
responsibilities for ser­vices and systems. This continuing paradigm shift now 
pres­ents the best opportunity for comprehensive orga­nizational change.
Change is just as threatening to top man­ag­ers as it is to other members 
of the organ­ization. In par­tic­u­lar, it threatens autocratic administrators 
­because it can push down mundane decision making to employees in the 
organ­ization. In addition, the development of teams of knowledge workers also 
precludes the idea of a finger-­snapping man­ag­er making all the decisions. In 
such a scenario, a man­ag­er may feel a loss of authority, being unable to control 
certain outcomes. Even more inclusive man­ag­ers may feel that they have a 
better perspective for decision making. From the top and through ­every level 
of the organ­ization, a re­orientation requires ac­cep­tance of new ideas, new 
techniques, and skills; breaking old habits; and adapting to new behavioral 
patterns. Since participants inevitably perceive the pro­cess as threatening, 
it requires a more delicate, deliberate, calculated approach with much prepa­
ration and gentle persuasion. In such a setting, each member of the organ­
ization is expected to become a bit of a risk-­taker, willing to abandon approaches 
that no longer work. Tough questions must be asked: What sort of work is 
affected as smart technologies are developed and employed? What do knowl­
edge professionals do better than the technologies? How can knowledge work­
ers be or­ga­nized for optimum impact? What needs are not being met or could 
be met better with a dif­fer­ent approach?
Knowledge-­based organ­izations are rapidly moving from individual­
ism or task orientation ­toward teamwork and pro­cess development. Staff 
participation in the decision-­making pro­cess; ­unionization and collective-­
bargaining efforts; centralization of information ser­vices; flattening of 
orga­nizational hierarchies; and collaborative employer/employee workplace 
arrangements, including programs like parental leave, flextime and flex-­
place, and job-­sharing—­all of which are designed to meet changing needs and 
interests—­are examples of change ­factors that are having an impact on orga­
nizational culture and character and have helped produce a feeling of shared 
responsibility ­toward achieving a vision of knowledge-­based ser­vices.

64  Introduction
Empowerment is the key ­factor and accountability the motto. ­Because 
change remains difficult to quantify and elusive to manage, ­there is no 
one successful model to follow. The impor­tant ­thing to understand is that 
change can be accomplished when it is done to improve, innovate, and exploit 
the knowledge base, and a new orga­nizational profile can emerge. All change 
involves risk, but ­there is no other alternative. A common vision and mission 
hold the organ­ization together, and team effort provides the vital link to 
achieve goals, with accountability mea­sures tracking success. Educating, 
informing, and involving knowledge workers is an impor­tant step in plan­
ning change, ­because participation aids individuals and helps motivate 
them so that change can be viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat. 
In the pro­cess, an organ­ization man­ag­er cannot abandon recognition of prior 
achievements of individuals and the orga­nizational ­whole ­because that 
could demoralize ­people who contributed to ­those past successes. The corpo­
rate memory, that body of data, information, and knowledge residing in files 
but also primarily in staff memories, is valuable as a source of knowledge in 
fulfilling the strategic aims and objectives of an organ­ization. Individual 
employees are not all the same and do not adapt to change at the same speed. 
Some ­will be frustrated at the lack of speed to change and ­others, who are 
slower to accept changes, ­will try to drag out the pro­cess. Change also requires 
constant awareness of each identified orga­nizational role in which teamwork 
and pro­cess improvement are replacing individualism and a task orientation. 
This involves designing, implementing, and evaluating programs to meet 
the market’s needs and desires and using effective balancing of resources, 
communication of ser­vices, and distribution of systems to inform, motivate, 
and ser­vice a market that is also fluid.
Library organ­izations need to be future-­focused and knowledge-­
empowering. They anticipate and redefine customer needs on a regular basis 
and expand and shift ser­vices in this fluctuating environment. In the pro­
cess they have become more flexible and ­people centered. This is obvious as 
many information ser­vices organ­izations have become committed to:
•	 Reordering priorities based on user feedback
•	 Retraining and cross-­training staff
FIGURE 3.1. Information Paradigm Shift

Practice Your Skills
You have been invited to participate in a panel discussion of users at a library that you 
use. The staff ­there would like to hear how this library could change to better support 
your research or recreational needs.
Prepare a list of ideas that would make your experience at that library more suc­
cessful or enjoyable. Please keep your focus on positive changes; ­after all you want to 
convince the employees of your seriousness.
When you have a list developed, compare the items with ­others and look for both com­
monality and outliers. Discuss both. How difficult would ­these changes be for the library?
•	 Reor­ga­niz­ing space focusing on users, not collections
•	 Renewing equipment
•	 Restructuring hierarchy and decision making
•	 Redirecting financial resources
•	 Fostering diversity and multiple points of view
Organ­izing for Change
The past quarter ­century has seen enormous change in society and in 
library and information ser­vices. Man­ag­ers of libraries and other informa­
tion centers previously spent ­little time on external ­matters. ­Today, a major 
portion of ­every man­ag­er’s time is spent on external ­matters:
•	 With civic organ­izations, trustees, faculty members, or corporation 
members at board meetings and individually
•	 In fund-­raising by cultivating relationships with philanthropic-­
minded individuals and foundations as well as other potential fund­
ing authorities
•	 By lobbying government officials and other decision makers at many 
levels
•	 In collective bargaining sessions
•	 In meetings with friends-­of-­libraries groups
•	 With higher administration and funding agencies or authorities in 
defense of the bud­get or in support of strategic planning efforts; and
•	 On other public relations ­matters such as gathering and disseminat­
ing information to the public, to decision makers, to customers, and 
to colleagues.
The primary focus upon customers, gauging their information/knowledge 
seeking patterns and learning their information/knowledge needs in order 
to develop plans, policies, practices, and procedures that satisfy ­those needs, 
pres­ents new challenges and requires changing patterns of ser­vice and atti­
tudes. This approach has precipitated a move away from what might be called 
an authoritarian hierarchy to smaller work groups in which ­people manage 
themselves with the response time to action shortened in the pro­cess. Workers’ 

66  Introduction
roles in adopting a change environment are enhanced as they are allowed to 
grow beyond a traditional hierarchical job to the point of being involved in 
team problem-­solving activities.13 Work design is becoming more flexible and 
self-­organized. Information intermediaries become educators, coordinators, 
and facilitators.
The trend ­toward the flattening of the organ­ization means that commu­
nication and decisions are more immediate and apparent within groups of 
workers at appropriate levels. ­Those changes are not easily portrayed on 
organ­ization charts. This flattening of organ­izations requires greater collab­
oration as new approaches are developed in management planning, person­
nel development, systems analy­sis, and control activities. Seeking a balance 
between initiative, del­e­ga­tion, and control is a challenge for ­those who are 
ultimately responsible. Employees are empowered and become more sophis­
ticated, articulate, and unwilling to ­settle for what management theorists 
call the lower-­level needs.
“Managing participation is a balancing act: between management con­
trol and team opportunity; between getting the work done quickly and giv­
ing ­people a chance to learn; between seeking volunteers and pushing ­people 
into it; between too ­little team spirit and too much.”14 This requires man­ag­
ers to become better teachers and coaches, mentors, and developers of ­human 
potential, rather than “whip wielding autocrats trying to force change.”15 
The way change is managed has become as impor­tant as the outcome of the 
change pro­cess itself. Man­ag­ers are learning to acknowledge the transition 
and to cope with the continuous barrage of new ideas, advanced technologies, 
sophisticated information access, and the need for interpersonal and intra-­
organizational relationships.
To implement new ideas and ser­vices requires participation by all who are 
affected by such change. The thought of restructuring requires consensus 
and a common vision of and core values for the organ­ization’s ­future. There­
fore, understanding what the change pro­cess means and then becoming 
committed to it is a continuing pro­cess from the time that an organ­ization 
first officially recognizes, and therefore encounters, the need to change ­until 
the point when change is initiated, internalized, institutionalized, and val­
ued, as illustrated in figure 3.2.
At ­every point along this continuum of change, the pro­cess can be, and 
sometimes is, aborted for a variety of reasons. For instance, with the “under­
standing” point in that continuum, a person or group can have a positive 
perception, in which the pro­cess continues, or a negative perception. If it is 
negative, steps must be taken to bring that person or group along to the point 
of understanding and having a positive response. This does not mean coer­
cion, but education, give-­and-­take, and gentle persuasion.
Diagnosing Change
Two approaches to change can be identified in orga­nizational structures.
•	 Unplanned change is likely to be disastrous, ­because it usually pres­
ents a situation that forces an organ­ization to react quickly without 
preparation. Such change usually occurs when pressures for change 
are intense and almost out of control, or if the pro­cess is being 
mismanaged. Large unexpected bud­get cuts, natu­ral disasters, or 
the bankruptcy of an impor­tant software vendor are examples of 
unplanned change.

Change  67
•	 Planned change, on the other hand, encourages all in the organ­ization 
to buy into the pro­cess, thereby bringing about renewal or recommit­
ment on the part of the organ­ization and the ­people working in it. If 
it works well, employees know their roles and through team effort 
contribute to a better library.
Although change is sometimes forced upon an organ­ization from outside, 
causing it to react, successful change efforts most often come from within as 
a calculated effort on the part of ­people working in organ­izations who have 
recognized the need. An informed approach to managing change enables 
library and information center personnel to join together in strategic thinking 
FIGURE 3.2. The Continuum of Change

68  Introduction
and envisioning a strategic vision for the organ­ization while at the same 
time deciding upon necessary choices about technological and fa­cil­i­ty invest­
ments, staffing, and ser­vice needs. This pro­cess involves a deliberate progres­
sion ­toward renewing the organ­ization by creating conditions, encouraging 
participants, and soliciting resources to accomplish that transition. Change 
is sometimes costly and time consuming to implement yet inevitable in the 
current life cycle of libraries and other knowledge-­intensive organ­izations. 
It should be obvious that the difference between planned and unplanned 
change is that of being proactive rather than reactive when the time is right. 
Proactive change recognizes the need for change, and it is easily revealed in 
a SWOT analy­sis that considers the Strengths and Weaknesses in the organ­
ization as well as the Opportunities and Threats that exist in the external 
environment (for more on SWOT analy­sis see chapter 4). This deliberate 
approach can guide the identification and establishment of goals for change, 
can help diagnose relevant variables, and can aid in the se­lection of a change 
technique to be employed. It also should set the stage for planning the ini­
tiation of change, implementing the pro­cess, evaluating its impact, and then 
beginning the pro­cess all over again.
Theorists describe the change pro­cess as ­either incremental or funda­
mental, with incremental change being based upon preserving successful 
aspects of what has been created before and building upon that. Fundamental 
change, on the other hand, is based upon abandoning what has gone before, 
challenging ­those old concepts, and ­doing ­things in a new, completely dif­fer­
ent way. ­There are proponents of both approaches, each stating the strengths 
and logic of a par­tic­u­lar approach. In any case, it is apparent that organ­
izations must be flexible and agile. An excellent example of continuous orga­
nizational change in an academic library is at the University of Arizona.16
Effective change agents try to ensure that ­people are not afraid of what 
is to come and are able to put the traditions of the organ­ization into some 
perspective while recognizing that “We’ve always done it that way” is a strong 
argument on the side of ­those satisfied with the status quo. ­Those doubters 
must be persuaded that yesterday’s success may be tomorrow’s failure. Lis­
tening to clients at an information center or students and teachers in a school 
library produces clear expectations and a solid case for change. Change 
agents use focus groups, surveys, and small meetings to elicit this feedback. 
For example, academic library man­ag­ers use survey tools such as LibQual 
to survey library users and compare feedback from one year to another and 
between similarly sized schools.17
Gentle but firm persuasion and inclusiveness all along the way is needed 
in changing not only the way that ­people act, but also the way they think. This 
positive pro­cess, then, requires trust and participation by all. An internal 
environment that fosters change includes the orga­nizational structure itself, 
the strategic planning pro­cess, the decision-­making pro­cess, strategies for 
improving communication and staff morale, team building and conflict man­
agement, and the accountability ­factor that controls what is done and the 
way it is done. All of ­these must be encouraged by management and ­gently 
directed by leaders in the organ­ization. Modification of attitudes and be­hav­
ior of individuals, a delicate pro­cess and one that cannot be management 
controlled, is just as impor­tant as other ­factors in the internal environment. 
The culture of the organ­ization and the set of beliefs and expectations that 
are shared by members (ethical values and social responsibilities) must be 
identified and preserved.
As with any major pro­cess, a plan for change, a road map, guides the 
organ­ization to where it wants to be. This pro­cess is facilitated by a few 

Change  69
­simple questions, prevalent in all good planning exercises (who, what, when, 
where, how, and, most importantly, why). A lack of preparation and imagi­
native follow-­through are ingredients for failure in any change initiative. The 
change pro­cess is evolutionary ­because tasks, technologies, and even orga­
nizational structure are dictated by constantly changing environmental pres­
sures and relationships. ­These influence the attitudes, habits, and values of 
persons working in the organ­ization, in a changing po­liti­cal, economic, social, 
and technological climate. As an example, newly elected officials may have 
dif­fer­ent attitudes concerning the government’s role and responsibilities. 
This may have a direct impact on financial support for libraries and infor­
mation ser­vices. Such a shifting focus, as it occurs, should be capitalized upon 
as elected officials and decision makers begin to recognize the importance 
of information converted into knowledge in the social ser­vices and economies 
of the locale. During times of bud­get cuts, librarians should take the oppor­
tunity to question and assess ser­vices and priorities. “Make bud­get cuts, lay­
offs, and furloughs a motivator to go further, faster.”18
Libraries as Open Systems
The library of ­today can be considered an open system that receives input 
from the outside, absorbs it, transforms that information, and then trans­
mits it back into the environment. This proactive type of organ­ization includes 
a number of subsystems that, in turn, respond to this change cycle.
This requires that a change in any one component of the organ­ization 
leads invariably to a change in all components.19 It also means that goals 
and objectives are determined, to a ­great extent, by that larger environment, 
and, if the organ­ization is to be successful, personnel must depend upon that 
outside input to be able to produce usable output against which the success 
of goals and objectives can be mea­sured. Further, a psychosocial subsystem 
is formed by individuals and groups interacting both within the system and 
with groups of individuals outside the system. Additionally, the structure of 
the organ­ization subsystem determines the way assignments are divided and 
work is carried out, ­those being reflected in documents such as organ­ization 
charts, per­for­mance evaluation pro­cesses, policies relating to ser­vice and 
structure, and procedures manuals. Fi­nally, the technical subsystem is 
­shaped by the specialized knowledge, skills, and techniques required and 
the types of technological equipment involved. ­These subsystems continu­
ally interact in informal and formal ways within the overall system. Each 
points to the challenge of developing a multidimensional knowledge-­rich, 
technologically savvy environment and the need to plan for that eventuality. 
This interaction is reflected in the larger managerial subsystem that encom­
passes components of the entire organ­ization and is subject to the greatest 
change.
Change in both placid and turbulent organ­izations, ­whether planned or 
unpredicted, almost always is accompanied by tension, anxiety, re­sis­tance, 
and conflict. ­Those negative forces can and must be analyzed and minimized 
to facilitate the success of the change pro­cess. Change, affected unilaterally 
by the hierarchy in which the “definition and solution to the prob­lem at hand 
tends to be specified by the upper echelons and directed downward through 
formal and impersonal control mechanisms”20 is a ­recipe for disaster, ­because 
that attitude and approach is one of the major ­causes of tensions, anxiety, 
conflict, and re­sis­tance to change. Sometimes change initiatives fail ­because 
the ­human ­factor is not adequately considered.

70  Introduction
Re­sis­tance to Change
Re­sis­tance to change comes about ­because of emotional, philosophical, 
and procedural conflicts among individuals and groups within organ­izations. 
­People may be tentative about change, particularly if they do not understand 
why it is being initiated. Employees who resist change can provide impor­tant 
feedback. Shared vision, good communication, and empowerment remain the 
key ­factors in successful change efforts. Most change initiatives that fail do 
so ­because ­human ­factors are not taken into account adequately.
Re­sis­tance occurs for a variety of reasons:
•	 The orga­nizational structure may be an impediment to change.21 A 
library that is or­ga­nized in the classic bureaucratic approach with 
FIGURE 3.3. Internal and External Pressure

Change  71
top-­down decision making, by its very orga­nizational structure, may 
prevent employees from contributing ideas and taking chances that 
would lead to change.
•	 ­People do not understand or do not want to understand the need for 
change. ­People have their ­careers invested in the status quo. Some 
truly do not understand, and too often this reaction is interpreted 
by change advocates as defiance. Other persons may disagree with 
the need for change, basically denying that it is necessary. Certain 
categories of ­people resist change more than ­others. In general terms, 
­people who have been in an organ­ization longer are more resistant to 
change ­because they have more time and effort invested in the status 
quo; they may be proud of their accomplishments and see the changes 
as negating their contributions. ­People who have less time invested 
have no strong commitment to the old way and may be more adaptable 
to new situations. They ­will also bring dif­fer­ent approaches to tasks 
learned at prior workplaces.
•	 ­People are skeptical about the success of the effort. ­People sometimes 
have not been fully informed or involved in the decision making, an 
FIGURE 3.4. Interrelationships of the Vari­ous Subsystems

72  Introduction
indication that effective communication is a key ­factor that is some­
times lacking. Communication is a two-­way street. How a message 
is transmitted and if it is successfully received are both necessary 
components. If re­sis­tance is viewed as noncompliance with change, 
it can build the change climate to a higher intensity of re­sis­tance. 
Communication is an impor­tant management responsibility to see 
that every­one is kept fully informed. Sometimes information about 
change is restricted, thereby causing suspicion and re­sis­tance. Sev­
eral experts have pointed out that not only ­will providing opportuni­
ties for individuals to have influence over and participate in the 
change pro­cess lessen re­sis­tance to change, but also providing con­
tinuing involvement ­after the initial change effort “­will produce sig­
nificant increases in motivation, satisfaction, and per­for­mance.”22 
A lack of understanding of how and what to change ­causes confusion.
•	 ­People’s habits and securities are threatened. They may feel their 
basic assumptions, their personal values, and their sense of secu­
rity or friendship are threatened. Change introduces new conditions 
and requires dif­fer­ent skills and knowledge. ­People may become 
anxious about their own personal situations and about their ­future 
responsibilities or even if they have a ­future in the organ­ization. 
Self-­preservation becomes paramount in their mind ­because self-­
confidence is threatened. For example, man­ag­ers who communicate 
that responsibilities ­will change but that no job ­will be lost should 
provide some comfort to ­those employees who feel vulnerable.
•	 ­People may be satisfied with the status quo, with the way ­things are 
and with current priorities and working relationships, particularly 
­because groups of individuals may be comfortable working together. 
When groups are comfortable together, the pressure of a group norm 
influences attitudes ­toward change, forcing the burden of proof on 
­those seeking change. In some cases groups may lack motivation and 
therefore do ­little to support its implementation.
•	 ­People have a vested interest in what they believe. They view their 
own perspective as a clear perception of what is needed or wanted. 
Even though they may be somewhat open to change, it can only be on 
their own terms. With increasing complexity in organ­izations comes 
a greater disparity of backgrounds, attitudes, and values, thereby 
allowing a greater likelihood of individual or group re­sis­tance.
•	 The speed with which change occurs ­causes greater strain on the 
organ­ization. The organ­ization itself may not be able to cope. When 
overwhelmed by change, ­people resist. Rapid change makes ­people 
ner­vous, and fear becomes an inhibitor.
•	 On the other hand, once the pro­cess has begun, some may become 
impatient with the slowness of pro­gress. Leaders play a key role in 
managing expectations.
•	 Overcoming inertia in an organ­ization requires considerable effort. 
Such strain forces pseudo consensus on groups and places greater 
reliance on man­ag­ers as coordinators, negotiators, and arbitrators, 
as well as motivators.
•	 The organ­ization may not be ready for change. Certain preconditions, 
as previously discussed, are required but may not yet be in place. 
Speed in instituting ­those preconditions cannot be forced. Trust must 

Change  73
be established at all levels. When implementing the proposed change, 
leaders must be ready and exude confidence.
•	 Rapidly changing technology and societal conditions render some 
individuals’ work obsolete. It is impossible to remain in the same 
job for life, and even if a person did remain in one position, the job 
itself would change. Obsolescence is one of the most serious prob­
lems facing individuals in ­today’s society. Obsolescence means the 
degree to which a person lacks the up-­to-­date knowledge or skills 
necessary to maintain effective per­for­mance on the job. Many ­things 
influence obsolescence, including the information explosion; fast-­
moving technology developments; personal characteristics, particu­
larly psychological; and work environment. The acceleration of change 
has resulted in a progressive decline in the useful lifetime of previous 
formal education and training, thereby requiring continual educa­
tion on the part of individuals and staff development on the part of 
organ­izations.
•	 Change is challenging to implement. ­People find it difficult to let go. 
Without a shared vision, many strug­gle to imagine a dif­fer­ent ­future. 
Successful change cannot be forced by the dictate of man­ag­ers. Also 
during the change pro­cess man­ag­ers work to preserve the agreed 
upon traditions, values, and character that are vital to the organ­
ization’s life.
Some ­will always resist change; therefore, re­sis­tance must be recognized, 
valued, and managed. The organ­ization as a ­whole must explore the core of 
that re­sis­tance, validate its existence, and try to minimize its impact through 
understanding and prob­lem solving. Experienced change agents excel at this 
kind of negotiation. A status quo attitude ­will render an organ­ization in­effec­
tive and condemn it to obsolescence and lack of support.
Conclusion
Man­ag­ers of libraries and information centers recognize that ­today’s 
knowledge-­intense climate requires a dif­fer­ent structure, attitude, and out­
come for organ­izations. It requires collaboration and cooperation among all 
levels of workers. Managerial systems and practices in some libraries and 
information centers ­were introduced in a more leisurely past without the 
current rate of change, and some of ­those systems, created in that more 
stable, predictable world, no longer work effectively. For example, bureaucratic 
control, a holdover from the past, is being replaced by peer control, customer 
control, and automated control. In many successful library initiatives, team­
work, team building, team sharing of core knowledge and new directions, and 
team incentives now provide flexibility and better ser­vice.
Organ­ization charts now depict new organ­izations of groups with col­
lective responsibility for ser­vice to customers, with a focus on customer 
requirements. During the change pro­cess, the challenge is to convert re­sis­
tance into commitment and status quo attitudes into new ideas. The remain­
ing chapters of this textbook discuss components necessary to be considered 
as that change is instituted in knowledge-­based library and information ser­
vice organ­izations.

74  Introduction
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	You are part of a team that is redefining reference ser­vices in your county 
library. This library is the central library in a system made up of the central 
library and five branch libraries. Other team members work in the central library. 
How would you go about involving the 10 other reference librarians who work 
in the branch libraries? Make a list of ideas for involving ­these librarians to 
guarantee the success of the new ser­vice. Who ­else would you consult with your 
plans?
2.	You share a workspace with another employee who is out­spoken and hostile to 
just about every­thing your man­ag­er suggests. You think the man­ag­er’s ideas 
are ­great and you ­really want to get moving to implement them. Why would 
someone be negative and resentful? What could you do to help change your col­
league’s attitude? Make a list of ideas.
3.	Why is it sometimes easier to make changes when they are seen as temporary 
experiments rather than hard and fast? What are some ways a library or infor­
mation center could experiment with change? Make a list of ideas to propose to 
your classmates.
4.	You are a man­ag­er of a library department that ­will be merged with another 
department, for example Interlibrary Loan merges with Circulation or choose 
another combination. The reasons are that ­there ­will be better coverage at cir­
culation during down ILL times and also that cross training ­will benefit the 
organ­ization. The library does not anticipate any layoffs, just reor­ga­niz­ing 
where ­people work. ­There ­will be opportunities for training. Draft a letter to 
your employees explaining why the merger is happening and suggest ways ­people 
should see this as a positive move for the library.
Discussion Questions
1.	 Mahatma Gandhi once said, “We must become the change we want to see.”23 
How do you think this quote applies to employees in a library or information 
center? Can you give examples where you have changed and that change has 
affected ­those around you?
2.	Robert E. Quinn24 sees empowerment as a critical ingredient to creating change 
in an organ­ization. He proposes two approaches to empowerment that are 
listed below. Look at the descriptions and consider in which management envi­
ronment you would be the most comfortable: mechanistic or organic. Would 
this differ if you had a staff position or a management position? Compare your 
thoughts with ­others.
Mechanistic View of Empowerment
•	 Start at the top.
•	 Develop a clear vision, plans, and assignments.
•	 Move decisions to the appropriate levels.

•	 Start with the needs of the ­people.
•	 Expose the difficult issues.
•	 Model integrity through risk taking.
•	 Build credibility through small wins.
•	 Encourage initiative.
•	 Build teamwork.
In short empowerment is about risk, growth, trust, and teamwork.

ion about ser­vices and especially any ways that the library could improve 
what they offer. Make a list of points you would make for that library. Compare

Section 2
Planning
Successful planning is impor­tant for any organ­ization. A planning effort 
shapes the ­future and provides a roadmap for every­one involved. Thinking 
strategically and taking action to redesign and revitalize is key to a library’s 
or information center’s success. As part of a planning effort, man­ag­ers lead 
a pro­cess of recommitment to core values and a shared vision of user needs as 
well as understanding the internal and external environment. An impor­tant 
aspect of planning is decision making and the role of policy in library and 
information centers. ­Because most man­ag­ers somewhere in their ­careers par­
ticipate in remodeling or building new space, a chapter specifically on plan­
ning library facilities is also included in this section. And marketing allows 
plans to flourish. All of ­these ­factors must be developed with a keen aware­
ness of outside forces that may facilitate or frustrate the planning pro­cess.
An effort to anticipate the ­future requires choosing from among pos­si­
ble alternatives, and with full knowledge and use of techniques and tools 
available for such action. Thinking and acting strategically enables the organ­
ization to continue to move from where it is now to where it wants to be. Plan­
ning the ser­vices, configuring the space, and then marketing the outputs can 
ensure success in the efforts. Involving stakeholders—­users and financial 
supporters—in the planning pro­cess empowers the organ­ization to move 
forward in a meaningful and appropriate fashion.
Since planning sustains the viability of an information ser­vices organ­
ization, this section ­will focus on a discussion of how to facilitate such a pro­
cess, including the trends and techniques of strategic planning, facilities 
planning, and marketing the library or information center.

Strategic Planning, 
Decision Making, and Policy
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the reason for planning
•	 Know the basic parts of a strategic planning pro­cess
•	 Be familiar with the pro­cess of decision making
•	 Recognize the role of policies in a library or information center
The previous chapter described the necessity for change in any organ­ization. 
This chapter ­will focus on some of the tools to effect changes: strategic plan­
ning, decision making, and policy development. “The purpose of planning is 
to develop policies and decisions to guide the actions of individuals in the 
organ­ization.”1 A man­ag­er or management group must determine the most 
appropriate way of demonstrating accountability while developing needed 
ser­vices. “Strategic plans provide guidelines for moving into an uncertain 
­future with the ability to set a direction but the flexibility to adjust to emerg­
ing issues.”2

80  Planning
Thinking strategically means focusing upon a vision for the organ­ization 
as it attempts to create distinctive value. Strategic planning can be useful 
only if it supports such strategic thinking as a step in the organ­ization’s stra­
tegic management. Strategic thinking means asking not only if the organ­
ization is ­doing ­things right but also, more impor­tant, “Are we ­doing the right 
­thing?” More precisely, it means making a strategic thinking assessment by 
keeping in mind an awareness of the greater environment in which the organ­
ization operates; which outside ­factors are likely to affect the fulfillment of 
the organ­ization’s purpose. This awareness allows the information ser­vices 
organ­ization to be more creative in developing effective responses to ­those 
forces. Strategic thinking facilitates the conversion of a vision and mission 
into goals, action plans, and assessment.
Therefore, a strategic planning pro­cess is only as good as the strategic 
thinking that leads to its development and actions. In order to be most suc­
cessful in the planning effort, this thinking precedes planning, and plan­
ning precedes actions. Strategic thinking often involves brainstorming, 
including such actions as what-if scenario planning. Successful strategic 
thinking requires looking backward and identifying successful accomplish­
ments as well as looking forward and letting go of some ­things that have been 
maintained “­because we have always done them that way.” In other words, 
it means challenging assumptions so that new directions and initiatives can 
be created. Without strategic thinking, a strategic planning pro­cess is likely 
to be no more than an exercise in futility. The plan needs to be seen as alive 
and real by every­one in the organ­ization. “Strategic planning and strategic 
thinking are tools (never ends in themselves) for critically analyzing current 
environments and the unit’s place within them for thoughtfully assessing the 
short-­term ­future and how the stasis or evolution of internal resources ­will 
intersect with certain-­to-­change conditions.”4
Strategic thinking, then, is a pro­cess of creating a better tomorrow for 
the users of the information ser­vices organ­ization; and it requires insight 
Management on the Job: Strategic Planning 
for a Single-­Person Library3
The article selected as an example of “management on the job” in this chapter shows 
that even when the staffing of a library is only one person, the development of a strate­
gic plan is not only pos­si­ble, but crucial to the success of the library. In the article, the 
authors, David E. Coleman and Kenneth Robbins, establish the need for planning and 
show that the impor­tant role of the library is vital in the hospital environment, where 
reducing or eliminating medical libraries has been a national trend. In this example, 
the librarian, who worked within an organ­ization of hospitals in Hawaii, began a plan­
ning pro­cess by looking to the desired ­future (vision and mission statements of the hos­
pital organ­ization) and then determined how the library could help the larger institution 
to reach that vision.
The librarian understood that the library’s plan needed to focus on the vision and 
mission of the hospital organ­ization as a ­whole; this helped keep the planning relevant 
to the larger institution. A library vision and mission was developed that paralleled the 
institutional one, and then strategic goals ­were established that linked back to the 
organ­ization’s values. Establishing methods for evaluating the success of the plan gave 
the librarian a way to demonstrate to the hospital administration how the library was 
supporting the greater institution.

through synthesis as well as analy­sis, nonlinear as well as linear thinking, 
visual as well as verbal conceptualizing, implicit as well as explicit think­
ing, and the need to engage the heart as well as the head.5
Definitions
Below are some strategic planning definitions that ­will help readers bet­
ter understand the concepts in this chapter. The following terms appear in 
this chapter’s discussion of strategic planning.
Strategic visioning: a proactive view, leading to a plan to anticipate the 
­future of the library organ­ization
Strategic acting: a pro­cess of strategically analyzing the organ­ization’s 
efforts
Strategic planning: a systematic pro­cess of envisioning a desired ­future, 
and translating this vision into broadly defined goals or objectives, and 
a sequence of steps to achieve them6
Core values: a set of common beliefs held by the organ­ization
Planning Strategically
To be truly strategic in actions, some ambiguity must be tolerated; mean­
ing that some uncertainty becomes acceptable. Faced with that unknown 
­future, library and information ser­vices organ­izations are challenged to 
maintain the pro­cess of converting information to knowledge, through staff 
initiatives, for the benefit of customers. Such strategic planning involves a 
continuous pro­cess of making entrepreneurial, even risk-­taking decisions 
systematically, with the greatest pos­si­ble knowledge of ­future consequences, 
and keeping a focus on the plan.
One example7 of a man­ag­er keeping the focus on the plan demonstrates 
how employees in a library have evolved. At the beginning of the planning 
effort, employees would come to the director with a new idea. She asked them 
if it related to the plan. If not, she said to hold off ­until the next yearly plan­
ning cycle. More recently employees with new ideas come prepared to dem­
onstrate the relevance of their ideas to the library’s plan. This approach helps 
employees keep the strategic plan in mind throughout the year, not just dur­
ing planning sessions; and it furthers the goals of the plan.
Planning—­An Overview
Strategic planning, then, is the systematic outcome of a thinking pro­
cess that enables man­ag­ers in libraries and information centers to or­ga­nize 
efforts necessary to carry out major decisions and to mea­sure the results of 
­these decisions against the expectations written into the plan. This is done 
through or­ga­nized, systematic feedback and adjustments. Staff members in 
libraries and information centers recognize their role in a customer-­focused 
organ­ization and develop ser­vices to meet their users’ needs and also mar­
ket to nonusers who are potential customers. Therefore, strategic planning 
must start with attention to the customer. That emphasis is primary in all 
types of libraries and information centers ­today.

82  Planning
Just as with strategic thinking, several questions must be addressed in 
the planning pro­cess:
•	 “Who are we?” requires reaffirming the organ­izations core values 
and confirming or creating the organ­ization’s vision and mission.
•	 “Where are we now?” requires an environmental analy­sis, which 
includes both an internal examination and an external view of trends 
and threats.
•	 “Where do we want to be?” requires the visioning aspect and then 
preliminary goal and objective setting.
•	 “How do we get ­there?” requires the development of specific action, 
financial, and communications plans.
•	 “How are we ­doing?” requires periodic review of the plan, mea­sur­
ing successes and shortcomings, and following up with appropriate 
revisions to the plan over time.
Figure 4.1 illustrates this strategic planning pro­cess common to library 
and information centers that have initiated strategic plans.
Systematic, planned change is the most effective way to implement new 
ser­vices and preserve impor­tant existing ones while eliminating ­those pro­
grams and ser­vices whose usefulness has passed or cannot be justified. A 
ser­vice may still be valued by a small number of clients, but cost benefit needs 
to be considered. Successful strategic planning requires an orga­nizational 
arrangement that makes systematic, orderly change pos­si­ble and attainable 
within a realistic time frame. Flexibility in development, implementation, 
and time constraints pres­ent the greatest challenges to a strategic plan­
ning effort.
FIGURE 4.1. Strategic Planning Is a Continuous Pro­cess

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  83
In order to implement a successful strategic planning pro­cess, two cri­
teria are necessary:
•	 The entire organ­ization should be informed of the pro­cess and buy 
into its success, with all participants being kept informed both in the 
planning stage and the implementation of the plan.
•	 The administration of the larger organ­ization—­academic institution, 
town, county, city, school district, or com­pany—­should be aware of and 
supportive of decisions, commitments, and efforts as a result of the 
planning activities.
With the involvement of library employees and informed administrators, 
man­ag­ers can proceed with a systematic planning pro­cess knowing they have 
a much better chance of maximum success with a minimum amount of 
re­sis­tance.
Most experts agree that a strategic plan should attempt to proj­ect between 
three to five years into the ­future but need revisiting and updating on an 
annual basis. The question of time frame addresses one of the most difficult 
aspects of strategic planning, which is that of projecting and making assump­
tions about external forces and the likelihood of change, demographics, tech­
nology, and user needs and expectations. The further ahead one plans and 
proj­ects, the greater the uncertainty and, therefore, the greater the challenge. 
Such uncertainty makes it vital that strategic plans receive continuous review 
and assessment so that certain aspects can be updated, deleted, or rethought 
as the library’s goals are achieved and as priorities or circumstances shift. 
Such a review also can indicate how realistic and achievable the goal-­setting 
pro­cess has been. This annual review can also be a good device for evaluating 
the success of the strategic plan and for communicating pro­gress on the plan 
to all employees, clients, and other stakeholders.
Why Plan?
Employees often scoff at the time needed to develop a strategic plan. ­Here 
are some good reasons why planning is necessary.
Specifically, strategic planning:
•	 explains the library program to ­others
•	 identifies priorities, strengths, and weaknesses
•	 provides an anchor for the development of a bud­get
•	 articulates connections with the larger organ­ization
•	 provides a blueprint for ­future development
•	 creates a clear sense of purpose
•	 provides the basis for ongoing evaluation.8
In a sense, the planning pro­cess can be described as a way of taking con­
trol of the ­future by developing the vision of the results that the organ­ization 
wants to achieve. This requires revisiting and reenvisioning the organ­
ization and the ser­vice mission that is most desirable. Before beginning 

84  Planning
a strategic planning pro­cess, an organ­ization must seriously address and 
adequately answer several basic questions:
•	 Why is it necessary to plan strategically and why at this par­tic­u­lar 
point in the organ­ization’s life?
•	 Who should be involved, and how involved should they be?
•	 How does strategic thinking lead to strategic planning for this organ­
ization, and what needs to be known beforehand?
•	 Is ­there understanding among all the primary players of the ­factors 
to be considered and how they interrelate?
•	 What additional resources are needed and how ­will they be made 
available? Is a strategic planning con­sul­tant necessary?
•	 How long ­will the pro­cess take?
•	 Is the larger organ­ization of which the library or information center 
is a part committed to supporting the strategic planning effort, and 
what type of support is committed to the outcome and to facilitate 
success?
•	 How ­will the pro­cess be implemented, and how ­will it be evaluated?
Components of a Strategic Plan
­After ­those initial questions have been answered to the satisfaction of 
members of the organ­ization, the impor­tant first step in a strategic planning 
pro­cess is the identification of a coordinating team or task force with the 
responsibility for the major planning phases. In addition, other work teams 
and task forces are likely to be involved, as appropriate, at vari­ous times and 
levels in the pro­cess.
To facilitate the activities, some orga­nizational planning teams work 
with strategic planning con­sul­tants, or a staff member is trained and desig­
nated for this role. The primary role of the con­sul­tant is to help the team or 
task force decide what data are to be collected, how they ­will be collected and 
by whom, and how they ­will be analyzed and used. A con­sul­tant acts as both 
a catalyst and facilitator in identifying orga­nizational goals and objectives. 
He or she does not force opinions on the group, ­because no two organ­izations 
are alike. A realistic time frame must be set for the strategic planning pro­
cess. See also figure 4.2 Development of a Strategic Plan.
The list below is a summary of the steps for strategic planning. Each 
step ­will be described in more detail in the chapter.
1.	 Identify the orga­nizational culture and the values or assumptions 
that are the organ­ization’s guiding princi­ples.
2.	 Review environmental ­factors that might help or hinder the library’s 
­future.
3.	 Create a vision statement that focuses on a better ­future by com­
municating enthusiasm and excitement.
4.	 Formulate the mission statement that identifies distinctiveness.
5.	 Develop the goals and objectives.

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  85
FIGURE 4.2. Development of a Strategic Plan

86  Planning
6.	 Develop strategies and action plans. This requires identifying 
resource funds and developing policies and procedures to accom­
plish the objectives.
7.	 Implement the strategic plan.
8.	 Monitor, evaluate, and adjust the plan as objectives are accom­
plished and as priorities shift.
9.	 Communicate strategic planning pro­gress to organ­ization’s employ­
ees and stakeholders.
The pro­cess of strategic thinking and then planning is a proactive one 
and as such provides the underlay for initiative, by developing and employ­
ing a mind-­set that guides orga­nizational thinking and acting. It calls upon 
members of an information ser­vices organ­ization to discern what is truly 
impor­tant and to position it within a relatively long-­term context by imag­
ining and exploring the identified innovative possibilities.
Values and Culture
Values are the organ­ization’s essential and enduring beliefs, a small set 
of general guiding princi­ples that provide enduring guidelines for ­human con­
duct. Values are usually stated in terms of re­spect for other ­people; honesty 
and integrity; a commitment to the social responsibilities and diversity in 
the organ­ization’s workforce; engagement in activities with commitment to 
innovation, collaboration, and excellence in ser­vices; and social responsibil­
ity, openness, and reliability. A discussion of an organ­ization’s values and the 
shared values of all employees and other stakeholders is impor­tant. ­These 
values and the pro­cess of defining them lead to team spirit, pride, loyalty, and 
owner­ship of the pro­cess. Developing a list of shared values helps every­one 
to understand ­these under­lying values and keeps every­one pointed in the 
same direction. Below is an example of a library values statement from the 
New York Public Library.
ACCOUNTABILITY. We take responsibility for delivering on our com­
mitments and for the stewardship of our materials and spaces.
EXCELLENCE. Only the finest of every­thing is good enough.
EXPERTISE. We are relentless in our efforts to better understand our 
communities, our collections, and our users.
FREEDOM. We are ­free and open to all. We treat every­one with re­spect 
and compassion.
INNOVATION. We are always learning. We are constantly exploring 
new ways of ­doing ­things better and ­doing better ­things.
PASSION. We love the Library, we love New York, and we love what 
we do.
TEAMWORK. We celebrate the diversity of our experiences and build 
connections. We trust each other.9
One primary benefit of strategic planning is that it serves as a neces­
sary self-­analysis or self-­study that allows ­those in the organ­ization to iden­
tify its strengths and weaknesses and then develop priorities within the 
framework of ­those physical and financial capabilities. The need for such an 
assessment has been heightened by the increasing pace of change in library 
and information ser­vices, what is done, and the way it is done. Strategic plan­
ning assumes that an organ­ization is responsive to a dynamic, changing 

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  87
environment. Being strategic, then, means having a clear understanding of 
the organ­ization’s objectives and resources and incorporating both while 
responding to a dynamic external environment.
Self-­examination allows the library or information center staff to for­
mulate actions that address threats and weaknesses while taking advantage 
of opportunities that promote the vision of what it would like to be, envisioned 
in a mission statement, with what it can afford to be, regulated by the organ­
ization’s physical and financial capabilities. If ­great disparity exists, a reso­
lution must be sought by reducing expectations and/or increasing resources. 
Most organ­izations focus their planning strategies on concerns relating to new 
directions, ser­vices and systems, marketing and public relations, growth and 
finances, and per­for­mance and personnel development. This pro­cess of mining 
information that is vital to the organ­ization’s survival, the self-­analysis and 
environmental scanning pro­cess, produces several obvious benefits. Perhaps 
the most impor­tant one is that of viewing the library or information center 
in relation to the greater environment.
Environmental Scan
­After the organ­ization has defined the values, the next step involves 
reexamining the organ­ization’s environment: determining its strengths and 
weaknesses, and identifying threats or opportunities that can hinder or 
encourage the ­future state of information ser­vices. Strategic planners con­
sider ­factors that are in place or have the potential of being developed in the 
larger context in which information ser­vices plays an impor­tant role, includ­
ing the global environment, since ­these ­factors have the potential to affect the 
end result of a plan.
Usually time is set aside in a planning pro­cess to look critically at the 
environment in which the organ­ization operates. Often groups brainstorm 
to explore ­future options and directions in a systematic pro­cess. Three pri­
mary questions guide this ­future strategic thinking exercise:
•	 What seems to be happening? Answering that question requires 
addressing, meaning perceiving, how one builds the relevant knowl­
edge base.
•	 What possibilities are presented? This requires addressing, mean­
ing understanding, how one determines the significance or use of the 
knowledge base.
•	 What is the organ­ization ­going to do about it? This requires reason­
ing, how to determine the significance or use of the knowledge base.10
Answering ­these questions involves identifying the political, economic, 
sociological, and technological (PEST) forces external to the organ­ization. 
The outcome of this PEST analy­sis has an influence on what eventually can 
be accomplished. A knowledge base developed from identifying and describ­
ing ­those forces, plus input from customers, allows the information ser­vices 
organ­ization to develop scenarios of what information ser­vices appear rea­
sonable and desirable. If ­those are then compared to the identification of an 
organ­ization’s own strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and 
threats (SWOT), possibilities for the ­future begin to emerge.11 Strategic plan­
ning helps staff members in libraries and information centers to think about 
the ­future of the organ­ization, not just the current situation.

88  Planning
Both the SWOT analy­sis and the PEST analy­sis help focus planning 
on the mission and vision of the organ­ization and help develop strategies to 
monitor external and internal forces. The external environmental scan 
and the internal self-­analysis merge in the pro­cess to provide the focus for 
developing strategies and converting them into plans, policies, pro­cesses, 
and procedures.
From an environmental analy­sis emerges a concise understanding of 
what the organ­ization is and whom it serves, ­those primary stakeholders 
whose satisfaction guides ultimate ser­vices, and how it intends to achieve a 
plan by identifying priorities of ser­vice and directing decision making. The 
next step is to formulate the vision and mission statements. ­These may

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  89
already be developed, but at this time, they should be revisited and evalu­
ated in light of the current circumstances.
Vision
The first step in reviewing or developing a vision for the library or infor­
mation center is to locate the vision for the university, city, school, or busi­
ness. Since nearly all library and information centers are part of a larger 
organ­ization, it is very impor­tant for planning participants to review the 
vision of the larger organ­ization and to tailor the library’s vision to support 
the vision of the larger organ­ization.12 The vision statement is aspirational 
and not likely to be achieved. It holds out what the organ­ization could be in 
the best pos­si­ble world. This vision begins and drives the planning pro­cess. 
A vision statement, as an act of foresight, outlines what the organ­ization 
FIGURE 4.4. Po­liti­cal, Economic, Social, and Technological (PEST) 
­Factors Impact Planning

90  Planning
aspires to be. It is inspirational; set within a context of the ­future, it is time­
less, and it provides clear decision-­making criteria. It envisions changes that 
­will affect systems and ser­vices. It is as ­simple or as complex as necessary 
to stretch the organ­ization’s capabilities and image of itself. It gives shape 
and direction to the organ­ization’s ­future. A vision is never attainable, but 
something to work ­toward.
Developing a vision statement requires drawing upon the imagination 
of good information ser­vices. Sometimes the sophisticated technique of vision­
ing is used by organ­izations to help develop vision statements as part of 
their strategic planning by examining and understanding all of the possi­
bilities available for them to envision a scenario for the ­future. Vision focuses 
on the ultimate end result of an effort, not how to get ­there. As a guiding state­
ment, it should answer the question “What is the preferred ­future for this 
organ­ization?” The procedure of visioning seeks to create a compelling pic­
ture of a desirable ­future that represents quantum changes from the past. 
When visioning focuses on generating a thoughtful vision statement, with a 
pro­cess that engages ­people in the exploration of possibilities, it can be ener­
gizing and enlightening for an organ­ization. It can help distance a library 
from a constrained view of the ­future and is a particularly power­ful way of 
tying values to action. Simply stated, it should be an inspiring statement of 
the ­future, which can become the guide for actions and be­hav­iors ­toward the 
accomplishment of a mission. An example of a ­simple, yet comprehensive, 
statement is one from the Aurora (Colorado) Public Library, “Our vision is 
to nurture an educated, enlightened and enriched diverse community.”13
FIGURE 4.5. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) 
Analy­sis

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  91
Mission
The mission statement is a short, succinct statement focusing on the pur­
pose of the organ­ization, its reason for existence, and what it hopes to accom­
plish. This overarching, comprehensive concept or princi­ple is intended to 
guide the organ­ization in establishing goals and developing strategies to 
achieve ­those goals. Defining the mission is the most impor­tant strategic step 
an organ­ization can take. A mission statement is based on the values and 
beliefs previously identified in the organ­ization’s vision. The mission state­
ment should answer three primary questions: “Who (customers)?”, “What 
(ser­vices)?”, and “How (activities)?”, all focused by the previously answered 
question of “Why (the vision)?” It demonstrates the value the organ­ization 
can make in the lives, both personal and professional, of ­those it serves.
A clearly formulated, broadly discussed, and mutually accepted mission 
statement enables all parts of an organ­ization to work ­toward common goals. 
The concise mission statement should be shared with all members of the 
organ­ization, funding authorities, and supporters so that every­one under­
stands and is committed to its basic princi­ples. This sharing action reduces 
the possibilities of fragmentation and dissension. It also enables the state­
ment to be used as an impor­tant marketing tool. Some librarians distribute 
their vision and mission statements to all stakeholders: some print out copies 
of the vision and mission on small cards or post it on their Web sites.
Of course, all types of libraries and information centers are typically cre­
ated with a mission of ser­vice. For public libraries, this mission has tradition­
ally included education, information, and recreation or entertainment, and the 
library’s ser­vices have emerged as a vehicle to accomplish a broader mission. 
Practice Your Skills
Think about a library, archive, or any organ­ization that you use. Without looking at the 
Web page, draft a vision statement that you think would encompass the core values of 
the organ­ization. Remember this is an aspirational statement, so dream about what 
could be. ­After you have written your version, try to find the ­actual vision statement 
and compare yours. How ­were they similar? What was dif­fer­ent?
FIGURE 4.6. Components of a 
Mission Statement

92  Planning
Talk About It
Locate five examples of mission statements from information organ­izations. How do they 
compare? Do they seem appropriate to the organ­ization? Share your examples with 
­others in class. Which ones seem the best? Why?
A concise mission statement, for example, from the Boston Public Library 
states, “The Boston Public Library’s mission is to preserve and provide access 
to historical rec­ords of our society, and to serve the cultural, educational, and 
informational needs of the ­people of the City and the Commonwealth.”14
An organ­ization’s mission statement is often available on its Web site. 
Although one might assume that the mission ­will not change, it does, some­
times subtly, sometimes dramatically. Therefore the mission statement may 
be changed based on changing external or internal circumstances. A good 
example is the Baltimore County, Mary­land, system. Thirty years ago, its 
mission was “to make readily available to the greatest pos­si­ble number of 
county residents the most wanted library materials of all kinds, and to serve 
as a point of access for any needed information.” A ­later system’s mission 
statement was “to make readily available to Baltimore County residents 
library materials and information ser­vices in a cost-­effective manner, pro­
portionate to levels of demand and use, and to provide access to resources 
outside the library system,” and in the current statement
Baltimore County Public Library ­will connect our diverse 
community with innovative, quality ser­vices as we:
Create welcoming physical and virtual spaces
Champion an early and lifelong love of reading
Excel as an essential information resource.15
Based on the above example, it is clear that mission statements need to 
be reviewed and if necessary revised periodically.
Goals, Themes, and Directions
Goals are the organ­ization’s broad aspirations defined in operational 
terms, leading to mea­sur­able objectives with strategies and activities ema­
nating from them. Goals provide direction and are intended to produce 
effectiveness. They also provide a framework for ­future planning and help 
motivate individuals and groups in the work environment. Goals must be 
flexible and are subject to regular modification to reflect changing expecta­
tions and focus. ­Because goals are not detailed enough to be termed opera­
tional, lower-­level, more specific objectives and activities are required. Goals 
are the basis for development and mea­sures against which the success or fail­
ure of the plan can be determined. Goals are action oriented, with action 
following through in the form of objectives that specify the means of achiev­
ing the goals. One beneficial way of developing a goal statement is to place it 
within the larger environmental context. For example, the Purdue Univer­
sity Libraries identifies one goal as,

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  93
We contribute to student success and lifelong learning through 
innovative educational practices. Our research-­based information 
literacy programming empowers Purdue’s diverse community of 
learners to use information critically to learn and to create new 
knowledge. Our learning spaces, both virtual and physical, align 
with evolving curricula and student learning needs.16
This leads to the identification of how best to serve the needs of library users. 
The goal is wide in scope, long term, and directly relates to the mission state­
ment. Objectives are necessary so that employees can understand the steps 
to achieve the goal and they are mea­sur­able and are usually developed for a 
specific time-­period, such as one year.
Objectives
Several action terms are used to describe the next level of specific activ­
ities, ­because goals in themselves are not specific enough. An objective is the 
most generic term used to set a pattern for the structure of the activities. 
­Here is an example of an objective for the above goal from Purdue’s strategic 
plan: “Lead and partner in developing information literacy programming and 
transformational experiences that address the needs of Purdue’s diverse com­
munity of learners.”17
­Those activity-­oriented objectives provide direction as well as incentive 
­toward achievement. Objectives can be conservative or expansive but always 
should be stated in terms and conditions that stretch the enterprise. They 
are specific objectives to achieve goals that specify activities to be accom­
plished in order to achieve the vision. ­There is a real danger of setting objec­
tives that are ­really hopes and not attainable ends or, on the other hand, so 
easily attainable that they are not challenging. In setting objectives, many 
­things must be taken into account: the strengths of the library, the limita­
tions of the organ­ization and how much can be accomplished with the finan­
cial and material resources available, and the mission of the larger institution 
of which the library or information center is a part.
Questions that must be addressed in the objective-­setting exercise are:
•	 Is the objective suitable for this library/information center at this time?
•	 Does the objective help achieve the goal to which it is related?
•	 Does it take the organ­ization in the direction it wants to go?
•	 Does it support the overall mission of the library/information center?
•	 Is it compatible and complementary with other objectives?
•	 Is it acceptable and understandable to the majority who ­will be 
charged with implementing it?
•	 Is it affordable for the organ­ization?
•	 Is it mea­sur­able and achievable?
•	 Is it ambitious enough to be challenging?
Man­ag­ers in library or information centers must be able to prove to 
themselves and to their funding authorities that the objectives are suitable, 
sustainable, and mea­sur­able.

94  Planning
Primary ele­ments involved in objectives formulation include:
Clients: Who they are and who they are not (with the potential of convert­
ing ­those who are not)?
Ser­vices: What new ser­vices are needed, which existing ones should be 
retained or modified, and which should be deleted?
Personnel resources: What professional and support skills are needed to 
provide identified ser­vices?
Technological resources: What resources can be assessed and what tech­
nology is required?
Financial resources: What does each objective cost?
Community responsibilities: What are the library’s obligations as a social 
institution?
A maximum degree of compatibility should exist between the identified 
goals and specific objectives to achieve them if the organ­ization is to be suc­
cessful in its mission. It is also impor­tant to remember that many forces 
influence the pro­cess of planning and achieving goals; therefore, the pro­cess 
must be viewed from a number of perspectives. The three primary perspec­
tives are environmental, orga­nizational, and individual.
A balance must be achieved between what is realistic and what is obtain­
able, what is challenging and what is idealistic but not necessarily com­
pletely attainable. Unlike for-­profit organ­izations, in which the first objective 
is often to create the greatest profit base, most libraries and other informa­
tion centers have among their primary objectives to provide a useful and 
needed ser­vice and to attract a competent staff. Libraries and information 
centers, however, are responsible to higher authorities that may restrict some 
other more social objectives. Still other objectives may be forced upon librar­
ies and information centers by the community, through social obligations, or 
by the employees, through collective bargaining or other means. Therefore, 
just as profit objectives in business organ­izations and their sometimes conflict­
ing social objectives can dictate opposing courses that force compromise, so, in 
information ser­vices organ­izations, an individual’s personal objectives and 
­those of the organ­ization as a ­whole can create conflict and sometimes force 
compromise.
Additionally, specific orga­nizational subobjectives can be departmental, 
unit, or team-­based objectives or even short-­range objectives of the ­whole 
organ­ization. Objectives are tangible and mea­sur­able; they should be stated 
in terms of activities that are quantifiable.
Activities, Tasks, and Initiatives
­These elemental tasks are directly related to the objectives and are a way 
of achieving the objectives. They are usually short-­term, repetitive, mea­sur­
able, and numerous at the operational level. They require effective policies and 
procedures to facilitate their achievement. Activities guide the everyday func­
tioning of the organ­ization and in that sense are pragmatic and narrow.

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  95
Evaluation—­Accountability in Action
Just developing a strategic plan on paper is not enough, and therefore 
evaluation is vital to any strategic effort. At the end of the established time 
periods, reports are made to appropriate individuals and groups as to the pro­
gress and success of the planning effort. Operational plans that support the 
goals and benchmarks of the overall strategic plan should be established on 
a regular yearly basis. Per­for­mance mea­sures are required to indicate the 
pro­gress and anticipated success of the planning effort. ­Those benchmarks 
indicate adjustments that may need to be made along the way and should be 
a part of the pro­cess.
Once the body of a strategic plan has been developed, guidelines should 
be established for monitoring pro­gress in terms of operational adjustments 
as well as guidelines for overarching decisions for policy making and mea­
sure­ment of success. The mea­sure­ment and evaluation plan helps ensure that 
the expected outcomes are reasonable and mea­sur­able. In addition, such 
evaluation tends to sharpen the organ­ization’s thinking about the pro­cess. 
They relate to four basic actions:
1.	 Applying the strategies in operational form by identifying specific 
per­for­mance mea­sures and developing implementation strategies 
with a view ­toward ensuring that all employees understand the 
goals and objectives that guide per­for­mance mea­sures
2.	 Ensuring that all the vari­ous work units within the organ­ization 
are linked, both tactically and philosophically, to achieving the 
goals and objectives, thus instilling a synergy for the work to be 
accomplished
3.	 Communicating is impor­tant to ensure total understanding of the 
strategies and how they impact the organ­ization’s mission
4.	 Linking the plan to the bud­geting pro­cess, thereby ensuring a con­
tinuing initiative.
The end of the cycle and the beginning of a new stage is the final formal evalu­
ation pro­cess, which is based upon data collected since the initiation of the 
plan. This evaluation component requires a focused design that provides for 
mea­sur­ing program success and recommending program improvement, when 
necessary. ­Factors such as success, efficiency, effectiveness, benefits, and costs 
all play a role in this effort.
The kinds of information and how it is collected are deci­ded as the final 
component of the initial planning pro­cess. Mea­sure­ment of ­these ­factors is 
key to the success of the library’s or information center’s plan. They must be 
built in as a systematic part of the plan. The results are useful for both internal 
purposes, guiding the ­future of the organ­ization, and external purposes, as 
communication with the greater community. Involvement of staff, users, and 
other stakeholders in this pro­cess is valuable in improving programs and 
activities. Stakeholder participation in the evaluation sometimes proves 
extremely useful in helping the organ­ization verify its effectiveness, or lack 
thereof. A systematic collection of data and other information about the pro­
gram of information ser­vices also enables stakeholders to better understand 
the organ­ization, recommend improvements to its effectiveness, and thereby 
buy into ­future programming.

96  Planning
Someone should be designated as responsible for monitoring pro­gress 
­toward each objective that has been established. A person or team can be 
identified in relation to the success of each goal, and that person or team 
becomes responsible for developing a timeline for accomplishing the objec­
tive, identifying mea­sures to evaluate pro­gress, and establishing pro­cesses 
and procedures at the functional level. Individual strategies can be assigned 
to one or more units or teams within the organ­ization for execution, and ­these 
units in turn assign activities to individuals or specific sections of the unit. 
If this pro­cess is followed, the strategic plan can automatically be used at 
the functional level for decision making. This, of course, entails designating 
responsibilities for implementing the vari­ous steps in the planning pro­cess. 
A mechanism is required for coordination, evaluation, and monitoring the 
vari­ous activities and tasks that are necessary for the implementation of a 
plan. Such implementation plans provide an opportunity to specify recom­
mendations for resource allocation strategies, assignments of responsibility, 
coordinating mechanisms, and priority-­setting criteria.
Per­for­mance indicators ­will have been built into the plan, and ideally 
each unit can execute several goals si­mul­ta­neously, making consistent pro­
gress ­toward vari­ous objectives in keeping with the established priorities. 
In practice, this may not always work effectively ­because, by nature, some 
­people tend to invest more time in fulfilling objectives related to their own 
par­tic­u­lar interests, thus slighting the priorities established for the unit. In 
addition, unforeseen circumstances, such as the loss of a key person, can jeop­
ardize the achievement of objectives or can, at least, force major revisions or 
delays.
It is obvious that organ­izations with clear goals and objectives tend to 
have higher staff morale. Understanding ­those goals and objectives and their 
environment and actively participating in developing them and carry­ing 
them out is the best assurance of loyalty to the plan of ser­vice. Unfortunately, 
some ­people carry out tasks; they do not achieve objectives. Perhaps a sim­
plistic, yet primary, benefit of setting goals and objectives is to provide a new 
way to look at ­those jobs; it concentrates thought and gives a sense of pur­
pose and commitment. By developing a plan and establishing with staff writ­
ten goals and objectives and communicating them throughout the library or 
information center and to the organ­ization’s customers, a man­ag­er encour­
ages individuals to think through logical courses of action and provides a 
yardstick for decision making and ongoing activities.
Therefore, reviewing strategies, revising priorities, reassessing the plan, 
and reassuring the primary constituency are vital ele­ments, a prelude, to 
the next round of strategic planning, a continuing pro­cess, a circle from ini­
tiating, developing, instituting, and reviewing. In that pro­cess, attention is 
paid to what has worked (successful strategies) and what has not worked 
(failed attempts, with a review of why), what efforts have been successful 
and should be retained, as well as a review of which have not been totally

successful and should be adjusted, phased out, or immediately discarded. 
Man­ag­ers and staff in a library or information center cannot afford to put 
forth the same goals and programs on a continuous basis. Customer needs, 
financial outlays, larger orga­nizational priorities, operating methods, and 
market needs are in continuous flux. This requires revisiting objectives 
and strategies on a periodic basis, certainly no longer than a five-­year period 
and often yearly or ­after three years. Change is required as circumstances 
dictate. Most man­ag­ers ­will give a pro­gress report on the strategic plan once 
or twice a year to show what has been achieved and to also demonstrate the 
need to revise the plan. An example of a pro­gress report is from the Univer­
sity of North Carolina.18
The planning pro­cess analyzes capabilities, assesses environmental 
pressures and opportunities, defines a vision and mission for the organ­ization, 
sets objectives, examines alternate courses of action, and implements a pre­
ferred course. However, the mark that distinguishes strategic planning from 
other forms of planning is the deliberate attempt to concentrate resources 
in areas that can make a substantial difference in ­future per­for­mance and 
capability. Thus, strategic planning is as much a frame of reference and a way 
of thinking as it is a set of procedures identified in the planning tool. The 
pro­cess does not concentrate upon projecting past experiences into ­future 
practices. Rather, it concentrates upon understanding the ever-­changing envi­
ronment in which the library or information center plays a vital role. It encour­
ages creativity, has the potential of improving communications within the 
organ­ization, markets the initiative to its users, and allows libraries and other 
information organ­izations and their staffs to identify and adopt options that 
may be unique to their individual settings and at a par­tic­u­lar time in the 
organ­ization’s life.
The plan itself encourages man­ag­ers to experiment with vari­ous alter­
natives before committing resources by promoting a systems approach in:
•	 Providing a mechanism to avoid overemphasizing orga­nizational 
parts at the expense of the ­whole
•	 Guiding man­ag­ers to make decisions that are in line with the aims 
and strategies of the ­whole organ­ization
•	 Providing a basis for mea­sur­ing the per­for­mance of the organ­ization 
as a ­whole, of an operating unit, and of an individual
•	 Forwarding to higher levels of management ­those issues of strategic 
importance with which they should be concerned
•	 Serving as a training device by requiring participants to ask and 
answer the very questions that man­ag­ers must address
•	 Improving managerial motivation and morale through a sense of cre­
ative participation in the development of known expectations.19
Strategic planning in summary is a way for the organ­ization to develop 
a roadmap leading to the ­future. It helps every­one understand where the 
organ­ization is ­going, and gives ­people in the organ­ization an opportunity 
to think strategically about directions and ser­vices, to have every­one focus 
on the vision, mission, and values of the organ­ization as they plan. Goals are 
developed with library users in mind and objectives and activities to meet 
­those goals are planned out with persons responsible, and ways to mea­sure 
the success or understand why they ­were not met. Strategic planning helps 

98  Planning
focus the priorities for bud­geting and staffing and when done well, gives 
every­one in the organ­ization an understanding of the decision making and 
reasons for moving in a specific direction. The next section of this chapter 
­will concentrate on the decision-­making pro­cess.
Decision Making
Orga­nizational decision making is an impor­tant part of management, 
one of the very basic planning princi­ples. Se­lection from among alternatives 
(i.e., the decision-­making pro­cess) is at the core of planning. In ­simple lan­
guage, a decision is a judgment and therefore a choice between alternatives. 
“It is at best a choice between ‘almost right’ and ‘prob­ably wrong’—­but much 
more often a choice between two courses of action neither of which is prob­
ably more nearly right than the other.”20 Decision making complements plan­
ning ­because it involves choosing the best alternative for the ­future, and 
­those decisions with organization-­wide implications are related specifically 
to the planning pro­cess. A decision is made with a course of action in mind. 
Of course, such a choice implies an awareness of alternatives and the impor­
tant ­factors that need to be considered. A good decision is by choice, not acci­
dent, and is the result of intelligent direction; it is the best choice among 
alternatives.
The orga­nizational decision-­making pro­cess is a much slower pro­cess 
than some can imagine. Decisions affect impor­tant ­future outcomes and 
require systematic research and analy­sis. The decision-­making pro­cess 
involves a blend of thinking, deciding, and acting; information is critical to 
the pro­cess. Deliberation, evaluation, and thought are all brought into play. 
Although many decisions are mundane, impor­tant orga­nizational ones are 
of unmea­sured consequence and could change the course of action for the 
information center. An example of the latter is the decision to close a branch 
library or to migrate to an open source system. Such decisions can be made 
only ­after long, thoughtful review, analy­sis, discussion, and deliberation. The 
man­ag­er who has the ultimate responsibility must make a decision that ­will 
have a ­great impact on the operation of the library and on many ­people: staff, 
customers, and other stakeholders.
Attention paid to the final act, the decision itself, often obscures the fact 
that a number of steps and minor decisions are made along the way, and the 
announcement of the decision is only the final step in the pro­cess. Decision 
making at a formal level involves a series of scientific steps: defining the 
prob­lem, analyzing it, establishing criteria by which it can be evaluated, 
identifying alternate solutions, selecting the “best” one, implementing it, and 
evaluating the results. If the organ­ization’s goals are clear, the impor­tant 
step in decision making is developing alternatives for solutions to identified 
prob­lems or issues. This step is pos­si­ble in almost all situations. Effective 
planning involves a search for ­these alternatives. If ­there is only one solution, 
management is powerless to devise alternatives, and no decision is required, 
although some adjustments may be necessary. In most cases, however, several 
alternatives exist. Final se­lection of a course of action is a ­matter of weighing 
expected results against enterprise objectives.
Steps in Making Decisions
The first step in the decision-­making pro­cess, then, is the recognition that 
a prob­lem exists. Having done that, one can then begin to explore pos­si­ble 

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  99
­causes with the intent of seeking a solution. The environment inside and out­
side the organ­ization provides information upon which a decision can be made. 
This requires considering all of the information: Where does the issue or 
prob­lem come from, does it represent several points of view? How accurately 
has information been gathered, and is it based on fact or opinion? Based upon 
the evidence gathered, one must consider the alternatives. Weigh the advan­
tages and disadvantages of each alternative. What are the costs, benefits, 
and consequences? Are ­there obstacles, and if so, how can they be overcome? 
What are the choices available? This pro­cess focuses on the articulation of a 
desired outcome. It builds in a review or assessment phase to mea­sure suc­
cess of the effort. The pro­cess culminates in a se­lection of the solution that 
best serves orga­nizational goals and the initiation of action to implement it. 
Of course, it always requires following through on the decision by monitor­
ing the results of implementing the plan. ­These phases, of course, do not have 
clear cut bound­aries or strict sequence.
When ­adopted, the decision is then expressed as policy for the function­
ing of the organ­ization. The outcome of the se­lection pro­cess involves a ­great 
deal of risk taking as well as uncertainty ­because it is only ­after the deci­
sion has been implemented that one can determine ­whether or not it was 
appropriate. The final step of implementation involves evaluating the deci­
sion. If a man­ag­er deci­ded to change the staffing at a ser­vice desk, the final 
step of that decision would be to evaluate ­whether the change was success­
ful. This evaluation could be accomplished by surveying the library users, 
and consulting statistics taken before and ­after the change.
Although this discussion is primarily about the steps in the major 
decision-­making pro­cess, it is impor­tant to remember that every­one makes 
decisions ­every day and that most of ­these decisions are, to some degree, 
reached by the same pro­cess discussed ­here. Some orga­nizational decision 
making, which was once reserved for the executive, is now being delegated to 
and assumed by ­others in the organ­ization. The way in which decision mak­
ing is handled can be as impor­tant as the decision reached. Decision making 
is no longer confined to the very small group at the top. In one way or another, 
almost ­every knowledge worker in an organ­ization ­will ­either have to become 
a decision maker or ­will at least have to be able to play an active, intelligent, 
and autonomous part in the decision-­making pro­cess. The ability to make 
effective decisions increasingly determines the effectiveness of knowledge 
workers. It is also impor­tant to remember that decisions involve factual, 
FIGURE 4.7. Steps in the Decision-­Making Pro­cess

100  Planning
verifiable ele­ments along with judgment and qualitative evaluation, and that 
the evaluation of the decision should lead to a positive feeling about the results 
on the part of ­those affected.
Group Decision Making
The approach to decision making by groups is somewhat dif­fer­ent from 
individual decision making, primarily ­because of group dynamics. However, 
group decision making should follow the same pro­cess if it is to be construc­
tive. In some cases, ­there are several advantages to group decision making, 
including:
•	 Group judgment: The old adage “two heads are better than one” 
applies ­here. Group deliberation provides varied viewpoints and 
alternative solutions to a prob­lem.
•	 Group authority: ­There is a fear of allowing one person to have too 
much authority. Group decisions prevent this prob­lem to an extent. 
However, it must be remembered that one person must ultimately 
answer for decisions that have been made. Thus, the role of leader­
ship in the organ­ization is not diminished but altered.
•	 Communication: It is much easier to inform and receive input from 
all parts of the organ­ization through a group. Also, if vari­ous inter­
est groups have been represented during the pro­cess of making major 
decisions, ­there ­will be less re­sis­tance to decisions. Communication 
permits a wider participation in decision making and therefore may 
have some influence on employee motivation. All employees may not 
agree with a decision, but at least they understand the rationale 
­behind the decision.
The group approach also has distinct disadvantages. As a cynic once 
wrote, a committee is a group of “unfits appointed by the incompetent to do 
the unnecessary.” More realistically, disadvantages potentially include:
•	 Cost: Group decision making requires more time, energy, and there­
fore money.
•	 Compromise: Group decisions can be diluted to the least common 
denominator. Pressures of uniformity force compliance. This may be 
viewed in two ways. The major drawback may be that majority rules. 
The desirability of a consensus should not take pre­ce­dence over crit­
ical evaluation in such a situation. On the other hand, a group can 
prevent an individual from ­going off track by forcing him or her into 
line with the thinking of the rest of the group.
•	 Indecision: ­There are delays in reaching a final decision ­because of 
the lengthy deliberations required. Groups are often accused of 
engaging in too much irrelevant talk and not enough concrete action.
•	 Power: One individual usually emerges as a leader. This person 
should be in a position of influence in the organ­ization. The cohe­
siveness of the group and the attitudes of one person ­toward another 
are impor­tant ­factors in the group pro­cess.
•	 Authority: Groups are sometimes used to make decisions that are 
beyond their authority. This can cause ­great delay and only enhances 

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  101
Talk About It
Peter F. Drucker said, “The importance of decision making in management is generally 
recognized. But a good deal of the discussion tends to center on answers. That is the 
wrong focus. Indeed, the most common source of ­mistakes in management decisions is 
the emphasis on finding the right answer rather the right question.”20
Do you agree with this quotation? Can you remember an experience ­either in your 
personal life or in the workplace when the wrong question was asked and answered? 
Discuss.
a feeling of frustration on the part of members, particularly if the 
group decision is rejected by management. The responsibility and 
authority of the group should be clearly set out at the beginning.
Although ­there can be drawbacks, the demo­cratic approach of group deci­
sion making improves morale, stresses the team approach, keeps individu­
als aware, and provides a forum for ­free discussion of ideas and thoughts.
­Factors in Making Decisions
Several ­factors influence decision making for libraries and other infor­
mation centers. The PEST analy­sis, discussed earlier in the chapter, suggests 
a community analy­sis should be conducted before certain major decisions can 
be made on ser­vices to be offered by the library. Se­lection from among alter­
natives is made on the basis of:
•	 Experience: In relying on one’s experience, ­mistakes as well as accom­
plishments should act as guides. If experience is carefully analyzed 
and not blindly followed, it can be useful and appropriate.
•	 Experimentation: This approach ­toward making major decisions 
from among alternatives, although legitimate in many situations, is 
expensive where capital expenditures and personnel are concerned.
•	 Research and analy­sis: Although this is the most general and effec­
tive technique used, it also may be somewhat expensive. However, 
the approach is prob­ably more beneficial and cheaper in the long run, 
particularly for large academic, public, school system, and special 
libraries.
Another impor­tant ­factor, mentioned above, in the decision-­making pro­
cess is the perceived level of importance of a par­tic­u­lar decision. ­There are 
two basic types of decisions: major ones affecting the total organ­ization and 
lesser or routine ones, which have less effect on the overall organ­ization but 
are nonetheless impor­tant. ­Those routine decisions comprise as much as 
90 ­percent of decisions made in an organ­ization. Most decisions of lesser 
importance do not require the thorough analy­sis described.
The potential effectiveness of a decision frequently has two dimensions. 
The first is the objective or impersonal quality of the decision and the other 
is the ­actual ac­cep­tance of the decision: the way ­people react to it. Politics is 
paramount in decision making, as is consideration of the ­human ­factor. 

102  Planning
Ac­cep­tance of change is essential to the success of a decision. Therefore, it is 
desirable that ­those who ­will be affected ­will also be involved in the decision 
from the beginning. Traditionally, emphasis has been placed on the quality 
of a decision: on getting the facts, weighing them, considering them, and then 
deciding. Although this position is technically sound, it may not involve other 
­people. The optimal decision should include high ac­cep­tance as well as high 
quality.
The following suggestions may facilitate involvement in the decision-­
making pro­cess:
•	 Distinguish big from ­little prob­lems to avoid getting caught in a 
situation that is rapid fire and not effective.
•	 Rely on policy to ­settle routine prob­lems, and subject the big prob­lems 
to thorough analy­sis.
•	 Delegate as many decisions as pos­si­ble to the level of authority most 
qualified and most interested in ­handling the prob­lem.
•	 Avoid crisis decisions by planning ahead.
•	 ­Don’t expect to be right all the time; no one ever is.
In the real world, decision making is not always that straight forward, 
and sometimes a man­ag­er relies also on intuition. Intuition can be defined 
as “the ­mental pro­cess of assessing situations and forming conclusions with­
out the intervention of factual information or analy­sis.”21
Decision making is at the heart of any organ­ization. The approach that 
the librarian and the information specialist take to decision making and to 
the involvement of ­others ­will determine the direction the library or infor­
mation center ­will take in the ­future. As noted above, policies have an impor­
tant role so that employees do not need to make decisions on the “fly.” Policy 
making and the role of policy in libraries and information centers are dis­
cussed below.
Policy Making
It is impor­tant to distinguish between objectives and policy. Objectives 
emphasize aims and are stated as expectations, while policies emphasize 
rules and are stated as instructions intended to facilitate decision making.
To clarify the difference between policy making and decision making, 
think of policy making as only one part of decision making. Policies emanate 
from the original decisions and become general statements or understand­
ings that channel and guide thinking ­toward ­future decision making, and 
they serve as guidelines for actions, particularly ­those of a repetitive nature, 
in order to create some sense of uniformity in the conduct of an organ­ization. 
In other words, policies are contingency plans ­because they are based on deci­
sions that set the action course for the plan. Policies, even though they are 
sometimes expressed in positive terms, are essentially limiting ­because they 
dictate a specific course of action and are aimed at preventing deviations from 
a set norm. They attempt to guard against and eliminate differences that 
sometimes result from variations in personality and interpretation. Policies 
become the effective tools for transferring decision making through vari­ous 
levels in the organ­ization. This is true ­because, within the broad policy out­
line, individuals at all levels may be charged with making operational 

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  103
decisions. A good working definition of policy making might be “a verbal, 
written, or implied overall guide setting up bound­aries that supply the gen­
eral limits and direction in which managerial action ­will take place.”22
Both policies and objectives are guides to thinking and action, but ­there 
are differences between them. Objectives, as already discussed, are devel­
oped at one point in the planning pro­cess, whereas policies, taken as a higher 
level, channel decisions along the way ­toward meeting ­those established 
objectives. Another difference is that a policy is usually effective or opera­
tional the day it is formulated and continues to be in effect ­until it is revised 
or deleted. As mentioned before, policies can give guidance to all levels of the 
organ­ization. For example, by adopting an equal employment opportunity 
policy, an institution ensures that all qualified individuals are seriously and 
equally considered by all hiring units within the organ­ization for any posi­
tion vacancy. The policy does not dictate the choice of a par­tic­u­lar individ­
ual but does eliminate the ­factor of discrimination as an ele­ment in a final 
decision.
All libraries have policies, ­whether they are written or unwritten, sound 
or unsound, followed or not followed, understood or not understood, complete 
or incomplete. It is almost impossible to delegate authority and clarify rela­
tionships without policies ­because one has difficulty carry­ing out decisions 
without some kind of guideline. It is impor­tant to remember that policies can 
provide freedom as well as restrict it, and that ­there are as many cases of 
frustration within organ­izations about the lack of rules, regulations, proce­
dures, and policies as ­there are about arbitrarily established ones. In the 
absence of policy, each case is resolved on its own merit, so consistency is 
lacking.
Lack of policy means that the same question may be considered time 
­after time, by a number of dif­fer­ent individuals, in several units of the organ­
ization, with the result that energy is wasted, redundancy is established, 
conflicting decisions are made, and confusion develops. Policies ensure some 
degree of consistency in the operation. They may be stated in the form of 
guiding princi­ples, ­these being broad, comprehensive, and basic, or may be 
specific or operational and deal with day-­to-­day activities.
Policy making is not just reserved for top management, ­because it 
includes both major policies involving all segments of the organ­ization as well 
as minor policies applicable only to a small segment of the organ­ization. Many 
policies in libraries and information centers provide basic direction ­toward 
the achievement of stated goals, including policies relating to materials pur­
chasing, personnel employment, equipment use, and monetary allocation. In 
most libraries, ­these policies are put together in a policy manual and made 
available to all employees for guidance and consultation.
Examples of library and information center policies might be:
•	 All new staff ­will be rotated through all departments during their 
first year of employment (a staff-­development policy).
•	 When selecting library materials, all sides of controversial issues 
should be represented in the collection.
•	 Access to electronic resources is limited to students, faculty, and 
staff.
Policy manuals should enumerate an organ­ization’s policies in rela­
tion to its goals and objectives. Therefore, a policy manual is an impor­
tant rec­ord and is invaluable as a decision-­making guide and as a way of 

104  Planning
communicating within the organ­ization. It is also a basic tool for instruct­
ing new staff members and assuring some degree of uniformity in approaches 
or responses to issues. Of course, a policy manual also serves as a historical 
rec­ord of decisions made.
Sources of Policy
Policies can be categorized according to their source as follows:
•	 Originated policy: This type of policy is developed to guide the gen­
eral operations of the library or information center. Originated poli­
cies flow mainly from the objectives and are the main source of policy 
making within the organ­ization. An example of an originated policy 
is the previously mentioned policy to adhere to the concept of equal 
employment opportunity.
•	 Appealed policy: Certain decisions may be needed by man­ag­ers in 
their assigned areas of responsibility, and the staff members are 
required to take it through the chain of command, where a common 
law is established. This type of policy can cause tension ­because it 
forces a decision or policy that, consequently, often does not have the 
thorough consideration that is required. To draw an extreme example, 
it may be the appealed policy of the pro­cessing department to make no 
more than two subject headings for each monograph entered into the 
online system. That policy, derived from practice years and years ago 
in the card-­based cata­loging pro­cess, has a ­great effect on users’ abil­
ity to find needed items in the collection. Oftentimes, appealed policies 
are made by snap decisions.
•	 Implied policy: This type of policy is developed from actions that 
­people see about them and believe to constitute policy. Usually, this 
type of policy is unwritten. For instance, repeated actions, such as 
promotion from within the organ­ization, may be interpreted as pol­
icy. This may or may not be the case. Particularly in areas relating 
to personnel, staff must be informed so that misunderstandings do 
not arise. When implied policies are recognized, policies should be 
developed or other statements used to clarify the issue.
•	 Externally imposed policy: ­These policies, which come through sev­
eral channels, dictate the working of an institution even though they 
may be beyond its control. For example, local, state, and federal laws 
have a direct bearing on the policies that libraries may formulate. 
­These laws may be general, such as ­those relating to destruction of 
public property (Malicious Damage Act of 1861), or specific, such as 
­those relating to copyright (Copyright Act of 1976 and ­later amend­
ments). When policies are being formulated, they must be checked 
for compliance with law before they can be finalized.
No ­matter what policies are set for libraries and information centers, the 
policies are subject to government regulation, national and sometimes inter­
national. In the case of public libraries, objectives must adhere to government 
policy on the local, state, provincial, and/or national levels. If, for instance, 
a local authority decides, for local economic reasons, to reduce drastically the 
library ser­vice hours to the point that the library no longer meets that state’s 

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  105
standards for allocating funds to that library, such an action could be in 
conflict with its obligation and thus be illegal. Or, if library management 
decides to cut ser­vice points and closes a branch library, ­people living nearby 
may petition their representatives or other local officials, who may decide that 
such a policy does not secure an improvement and may prevent the library 
from carry­ing out its decision on policy.
Laws governing information ser­vices often relate to finances: standards 
for capital investment, percentage of bud­get spent on physical and electronic 
materials, qualifications of staff, and so on, that are developed by library offi­
cials. ­Because this is an external control upon all public library spending, it 
necessarily affects the planning and administration of public libraries. 
Although the example given is in relation to U.S. regulations, ­those same 
types of laws of princi­ple affect other countries as well.
Effective Policy Development
Policies fall into two basic groups: (1) ­those that deal with the manage­
rial functions of planning, organ­izing, staffing, directing, and controlling, 
and (2) ­those that deal with the functions of the enterprise, such as se­lection 
and development of technology, resources, finance, personnel, and public rela­
tions. Both types of policies relate to the characteristic be­hav­ior of the infor­
mation ser­vices organ­ization to achieve its objectives.
Several basic rules (described below) should be considered when policies 
are being formulated. Some of ­these may seem simplistic, mundane, and even 
redundant, but it is surprising how many in organ­izations ignore ­these basics 
steps when they are formulating policy. To be most effective, policies should 
reflect the objectives and plans of the organ­ization. ­These should complement 
each other and build on that common strength. For this reason, any specific 
policy being formulated should receive detailed consideration before being 
proposed and certainly before implementation. Some larger libraries have a 
rule that proposed new policies be circulated to all man­ag­ers for comment 
and discussion before implementation. That approach recognizes that library 
departments are all interconnected and a change in one place may have con­
sequences in another.
Good policies include the following characteristics:
•	 Consistent: This maintains efficiency; the existence of contradicting 
policies dissipates the desired effects.
•	 Flexible: Policies should be reviewed and changed as new needs 
arise. Unfortunately, many organ­izations ignore this fact and there­
fore adhere to out-­of-­date policies. At the same time, a laissez-­faire 
approach to policy formulation and revision can lead to disillusionment 
on the part of ­those who are charged with carry­ing out the policies. 
Some degree of balance and stability must be maintained. Policies 
should be regularly revisited and controlled through a careful review 
pro­cess, and someone should be in charge of that pro­cess.
•	 Distinguished from rules and procedures: Rules and procedures are 
firm, while policies, as already indicated, are guides that allow some 
discretion and latitude.
•	 Written: A clear, well-­written policy helps facilitate the spread of 
information. ­Because many policies affect individuals who have not

Talk About It
The truth is that many ­people set rules to keep from making decisions.”24 Discuss the 
realities ­behind this statement. Do you have any experience with ­people who rely too 
heavi­ly on rules? When are policies and rules appropriate?
been involved in their formulation, the policies should be discussed 
and widely distributed through letters, memoranda, announcements, 
and policy manuals.
Stated policies have several advantages:
•	 They are available to all in the same form.
•	 They can be referred to, so that anyone who wishes can check the 
policy.
•	 They prevent misunderstanding through use of a par­tic­u­lar set of 
words.
•	 They indicate a basic honesty and integrity of the organ­ization’s 
intentions.
•	 They can be readily disseminated to all who are affected by them.
•	 They can be taught to new employees easily.
•	 They force man­ag­ers to think more sharply about the policy as it is 
being written, thus helping achieve further clarity.
•	 They generate confidence of all persons in management and in the 
fact that every­one ­will be treated substantially the same ­under given 
conditions.23
Implementing Policy
Policies are carried out or enforced by procedures, rules, and regulations. 
Procedures are guides to action and therefore are subordinate to policies. 
They establish a method of ­handling repetitive tasks or prob­lems and may 
be thought of as means by which work is performed. Basically, procedures 
prescribe standardized methods of performing tasks to ensure uniformity, 
consistency, and adherence to policies. Greater efficiency in routine jobs can 
be achieved through procedures that identify the best way of getting the job 
done. Procedures tend to be chronological lists of what is to be done. Exam­
ples of procedures are:
•	 a timetable for bud­get preparation
•	 a sequence of steps to be followed in searching and ordering library 
materials
•	 circulation checkout procedures.
Procedures are helpful in routine decisions ­because they break down the 
pro­cess into steps.

Strategic Planning, Decision Making, and Policy  107
The relationship between procedures and policies can be best indicated 
by an example. Library policy may grant employees four weeks of annual 
vacation. The procedures specify how vacations are to be scheduled to avoid 
disruption of ser­vice, maintain rec­ords to ensure each employee is allocated 
the right number of vacation days, and elucidate procedure for applying for 
time off.
Rules and regulations, constituting the simplest type of a plan, spell out 
a required course of action or conduct that must be followed. A rule prescribes 
a specific action for a given situation and creates uniformity of action. Rules 
may place positive limits (should), negative limits (should not), or value con­
straints (good or bad) on the be­hav­ior of individuals working in the institu­
tion or on individuals using the institution as a ser­vice. Rules ensure stable, 
consistent, and uniform be­hav­ior by individuals in accomplishing tasks, 
addressing personnel issues, and relating to both the internal and external 
environment. Like procedures, rules and regulations guide action, but they 
specify no time sequence. Similar to decisions, rules are guides, but they 
allow no discretion or initiative in their application. Examples of rules might 
be the fact that materials in the reference collection do not circulate or that 
only a pencil and paper may be brought into a special collections reading 
room. Regulations also establish a course of action that is authoritative, with 
failure to adhere to regulations eliciting discipline.
Conclusion
Strategic planning is the most-­used approach to planning in manage­
ment of ­today’s knowledge-­based organ­izations. It helps define the organ­
ization’s reason for being and mission. ­Because the planning pro­cess can be 
a costly proposition, improper se­lection or faulty specification of objectives 
wastes planning time and money, resulting in frustrations and disenchant­
ment, rendering the entire planning activity futile. A successful strategic 
planning pro­cess commits the organ­ization to specific goals and objectives 
and, as a result of decision making, determines the policies, procedures, and 
orga­nizational structure of the library or information center. Two other impor­
tant planning activities, (1) planning for a new or renovated fa­cil­i­ty and 
(2) developing a marketing plan, ­will be considered in the next chapters.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Mahatma Gandhi once said, “A policy is a temporary creed liable to be changed, 
but while it holds good it has to be pursued with apostolic zeal.”25 Make a list 
of library or information center policies. Then note which policies have had a 
long history and which have been implemented as a result of recent develop­
ments in the field.
2.	Select a library or information center and develop a SWOT analy­sis: make a 
list of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
3.	Select a library or information center and develop a PEST analy­sis: make a 
list of po­liti­cal, economic, social, and technological issues.

Discussion Questions
1.	 Anatole France, French poet and novelist, wrote, “To accomplish ­great ­things, 
we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.”26 Do you 
think man­ag­ers need to dream to accomplish change in a library or informa­
tion center setting? If so what techniques might they use to set aside the reali­
ties of a job to think outside the box?
2.	The head of the archive where you work has just announced that the organ­
ization ­will be undergoing a strategic plan. You are excited to actually partici­
pate in planning, but some of your colleagues just think it is big waste of time. 
What can you say to your coworkers to convince them to participate and help 
shape the archive’s ­future? Share your points with group members.
3.	“If you are not making ­mistakes then you are not making decisions.” Cathe­
rine Cook (MyYearBook.com). What is your comfort level for making ­mistakes? 
Are you a perfectionist, the opposite, or somewhere in between? Can you 
describe a ­mistake you made? What could you have done differently? What did 
you learn from it? Share your thoughts.
4.	Consider the differences between individual and group decision making. Make a 
list of the kinds of decisions that are best made by a group and ­those that are 
best made by an individual.
4.	One of the joys of becoming a professional librarian or archivist is that you can 
decide how to spend your time and to have some latitude about what work you 
tackle when. How do you find time to plan when the day-­to-­day work presses in?

Planning and Maintaining 
Library Facilities
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Have a clear understanding of the roles involved in a library building or reno­
vation proj­ect
•	 Be able to justify the need for a library renovation
•	 Understand the basics of capital funding for building proj­ects
•	 Know the steps for a library building proj­ect from site se­lection to post occu­
pancy evaluation
•	 Understand the need for and components of an emergency plan
“The very meaning of the word library has changed in the digital environ­
ment. As more libraries focus on what it is they must do to help their parent 
organ­izations achieve their missions, the ser­vices ­will begin to look very dif­
fer­ent.”1 Another very impor­tant form of planning includes changing space 
or making new library spaces to meet evolving needs. As organ­izations pro­
gress and the needs of users change, library and information center man­ag­
ers find that the requirements for space evolve with changes to mission, and 
strategic goals. Despite the increase of digital resources and 24/7 access to 
collections online, the renovation and building of new library and informa­
tion centers continues; in fact, physical changes are necessary ­because of 
digital resources and new ways that library clients are using libraries. As 
­these needs are evolving, organ­izations remodel their libraries and infor­
mation centers to reflect ­those changes. Although some might think that 

112  Planning
libraries are an artifact of the past and new building proj­ects are not neces­
sary, many libraries are seeing growth in all kinds of library use. In a recent 
Association of Research Libraries survey,2 of the 71 libraries responding, 
75 ­percent reported increases to the library’s gate count and 35 ­percent saw 
an increase in the use of digital materials as a result of the construction of 
new learning spaces. The focus recently has been less on housing paper col­
lections and more on work space for users. For example, in the Netherlands 
a nationwide 30 ­percent cut in library bud­gets caused the man­ag­ers in the 
public library in the city of Gouda to completely rethink the role of a public 
library and developed a new space in an old choco­late factory.3 ­Because the 
ser­vices of libraries are changing, most information professionals ­will expe­
rience a renovation or a new fa­cil­i­ty during their ­careers. This chapter pres­
ents basic information about the planning of library space including library 
design and the renovation pro­cess as well as preparing emergency plans 
and some information about library maintenance.
Management on the Job: New Teen Space in 
a Public Library
Planning facilities that suit teen­agers in a public library can be a challenge. Jennifer Velas­
quez, Coordinator of Teen Library Ser­vices for the San Antonio (Texas) Public Library 
System offers advice on how to develop new teen space in a public library in the article 
featured in this chapter.4 First, she ­didn’t just talk to them about colors or furniture, but 
she conducted focus groups to learn how they would use the space. She asked the ques­
tion, “What do we want to happen ­here?” and then saw herself as a partner in the design 
pro­cess. Teens asked for quiet space, active space, and social space. She describes how 
­those three spaces can be contained in one small area, if the area is designed and fur­
nished with flexibility. She finds that flexibility is impor­tant for the ­future ­because teens 
may have new needs for the space and with flexibility ­these changing needs can be accom­
modated. Specifically, this flexibility involves neutral space that allows the teens to decide 
how they want to configure the area. Therefore, light movable ­tables and chairs that can 
be configured for quiet study, group proj­ects, for small group work with computers, and 
even a way to clear out ­tables and equipment for dance or yoga classes. She advocates that 
the collections for teens be very close to the teen space so that books, videos, and other 
materials are available and may be linked to programs and activities in the teen space.
Setting policies can affect library use. Many libraries offer teen spaces with a one 
computer/one person rule, furnished with rigid carrels to ­house one person and one 
computer or other piece of equipment. The goal is to help keep the space quiet. Teens ­will 
stop using a library if the space ­doesn’t fit their needs. ­Today in teen library spaces, teens 
like to look together at YouTube videos or other networked content. Therefore Velasquez 
advocates for keeping ­these kinds of library uses in mind when designing teen space. 
And to change policies that discourage use.
She also offers some advice about designing a staff desk, which she calls the wel­
coming desk. That name, rather than reference desk or information desk, shows the teen 
users that it is ok to ask questions; that the library welcomes them. She suggests adjust­
ing the desk to allow teens to ask for help by approaching a desk from the side with the 
computer facing the user. Her experience shows that the sideways desk works much better 
than an intimidating front-on desk and a library employee who seems too busy or impor­
tant to interrupt. She ends the article by suggesting that sometimes the renovated space 
for teens (age 13–18) is so desirable, ­people below the age of 13 or adults ­will be tempted 
to use it. She suggests that the space remain for teens only and that ­others be encour­
aged to check for a book in the collection and then go to other parts of the library.

Planning and Maintaining Library Facilities  113
Role of Library Director, Staff, Users, and 
­Others in Planning a Building or Renovation
As described in the above case study, the librarian has an impor­tant role 
in the design and construction of a new fa­cil­i­ty. Frequently, if the organ­ization 
is large and the proj­ect complex, a committee serves to represent the entire 
staff and may also have members of the public, student body, faculty, or other 
constituents. City or institutional employees including architects and proj­ect 
man­ag­ers from facilities departments typically work with the committee, 
bringing their expertise and representing the parent institution. Once con­
struction begins, the proj­ect team forms to meet weekly. This team provides 
ongoing communication and makes potential changes to the design in the field. 
Usually a representative from the library, an institutional facilities staff 
member, a representative from the architectural firm, and the construction 
proj­ect man­ag­er meet weekly to discuss the pro­gress of the proj­ect.
Making the Case
Convincing stakeholders that funding for new or renovated library space 
is necessary can be a challenge. ­Here are some suggestions for mounting a 
campaign for new space. If the library supports a school or college and has 
outgrown the allotted space, a recent accreditation review may aid the cause. 
Although ­there are no longer guidelines for space requirements published 
by library organ­izations or accrediting bodies, a visiting committee that per­
forms a review of a school or college may notice if the library space has limited 
seating, if the stacks are full, or if technology seems adequate for the student 
population. Although ­these accreditation reviews only occur ­every 10 years, 
or 5 if the school is weak in some areas, administrators are likely to remedy a 
poor review before the next visit. In schools and colleges, faculty and student 
senates, individual faculty members, and students may lend their voices to 
­those in the library, asking for an updated fa­cil­i­ty. All private schools and all 
colleges and universities have comparator institutions. ­These comparator 
schools are determined by looking at all the students who are accepted by the 
local school and selecting the ones who do not choose to attend the local school, 
but rather attend another institution. When reviewing that data, schools most 
students choose to attend are considered the comparators, and a case may be 
made if all or most of the comparator schools have newer library facilities. 
Likewise, corporations have competitors, and man­ag­ers of corporate libraries 
may use better facilities at competing organ­izations to argue for more space.
Most parent organ­izations develop master plans where they envision 
­future space planning for the institution. ­These master plans may plan out 
for 15 or 20 years. This gives the institution (or city) a coherent way to man­
age the planning of physical plant space and funding. A wise library man­ag­er 
would volunteer to participate in the master planning pro­cess. In cities and 
towns, public librarians and school librarians may also make the case by 
showing town leaders and school administrators the new libraries of nearby 
towns. Sometimes community members cannot envision what an excellent 
fa­cil­i­ty could offer ­until they see for themselves. It is always a good idea to visit 
newer libraries whenever planning a library. In all instances, no ­matter what 
kind of library or information center, the head of the library should have a 
vision for a new library and find ways to share that vision broadly. Some 
library man­ag­ers have gone so far as to have students develop a library 
design.5

114  Planning
Preliminary Planning
One of the most impor­tant arguments to convince college or university 
administrators is to contend that the library needs to better support the 
mission of the school. What is at the heart of any college or university? The 
answer is student learning. Scott Bennett6 makes the case that academic 
library man­ag­ers who are planning new buildings should utilize learning 
theory to design user spaces. Too often librarians know more about what does 
not function (for example heating/air conditioning prob­lems, unwelcoming 
entrance, limited wiring, and not enough space for technology). Many proj­ects 
are designed around trying to design a library with all ­those prob­lems fixed. 
Bennett argues that library man­ag­ers should begin planning way before 
any funding is made available and that man­ag­ers should think about assess­
ment, how the success of the building ­will be mea­sured before any design is 
accomplished. Working with faculty and administrators, library man­ag­ers 
need to decide how learning can take place in the library and how that 
learning can be mea­sured. The early stages of this concept ­were the develop­
ment of learning commons in schools. Even public libraries and school librar­
ies now offer some type of space for collaborative learning with easy access 
to technology.
Funding for Library Buildings
Institutions usually have funds in their operating bud­get for minor 
repairs or upgrades. However, when contemplating a major renovation or a 
new fa­cil­i­ty, funding must come from a capital bud­get. Public colleges and 
universities usually petition their state legislature for capital funds for proj­
ects like a library. This money may be supplemented with gifts raised from 
alumni. Private universities, colleges, and schools use ­either bonds, gifts, or 
a combination of the two. Funding for public library construction usually 
comes from the municipality, and also may be supplemented with revenue from 
fund raising. In many states, such as Mas­sa­chu­setts, ­there is a program to 
assist local communities with both planning and construction.7 Funding 
for new public school construction that ­will include a school library with the 
other classrooms is a part of school district funding. Special libraries rely on 
their organ­izations for funding library renovations.
Site Se­lection
The location for the library proj­ect may be obvious, especially if it is an 
expansion to an existing building. However, if a totally new fa­cil­i­ty is planned, 
a new location may be needed. The importance of choosing a site creates the 
potential for po­liti­cal be­hav­ior. Someone may have a parcel to sell or a neigh­
bor may not want a fa­cil­i­ty in his neighborhood. In the case of school librar­
ies, site choices are not made by a library building committee, ­because the 
library ­will be part of an entirely new building. In academic libraries and 
special libraries, multiple groups may be vying for one site. For public librar­
ies to stay above potential disputes, the building committee needs to develop 
site se­lection criteria before looking at any possibilities.
Many ­factors need consideration:
•	 Size of the parcel
•	 Availability of the site

Planning and Maintaining Library Facilities  115
•	 Cost of the land
•	 Accessibility of the site
•	 Adjacent users and ser­vices
•	 Orientation of the site
•	 Zoning of the site
•	 Topography of the site
•	 Shape of the site
•	 Availability of parking and/or public transportation
•	 Hidden obstacles and subsurface conditions of the site.8
The committee also may want to add local criteria such as location near 
schools, downtown shopping, or other requirements. The committee should 
rank ­these criteria, giving extra points to criteria that are priorities. The 
next step is to actually look at the sites and to assem­ble drawings or tax maps 
if pos­si­ble. Each site is evaluated using a spreadsheet based on objective cri­
teria. The sites with the highest scores ­will undergo further investigation 
and scrutiny ­until a choice is determined.
Steps to a Library Design
­After a site is selected and a bud­get developed for the proj­ect, the design 
of the library comes next. The first task is to develop an architectural pro­
gram, which is a document that describes in words and assigns the amount 
of space in square feet for ­every room and space. The architect ­will take this 
program and use it to design the spaces. ­Because this is the guide that archi­
tects ­will use, it is very impor­tant to think through each space and to get 
the details right before any drawings are made. If someone wants to make a 
change ­later in the pro­cess, the costs may be prohibitively high.
Often librarians choose a specialist to develop an architectural program. 
The person writing the program ­will develop a template or form for each room 
or library area that includes:
•	 name of area
•	 purpose of area
•	 number of occupants (staff and users)
•	 size mea­sured in square feet
•	 description of equipment, furniture, book collections, ­etc.
•	 a listing of architectural requirements such as location, adjacency 
(direct, close, and negative), acoustical sensitivity, security issues, spe­
cial lighting needs, special electrical, data and communication, plumb­
ing, special heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), and 
other comments.
Adjacencies help architects understand where ser­vices and collections 
should be located. A circulation desk should be located near the front door 
(direct adjacency), information commons should be located near group study 
rooms (close adjacency), and the ­children’s room should be located away from 
quiet study areas (negative adjacency).

116  Planning
The completed architectural program confirms the size and functional­
ity of spaces that ­will be designed. This program may need to be revised to 
work within a set bud­get.
A comparison sheet drawn up showing each program area as it exists 
currently, as described in the program and in a comparable library, ­will help 
decision makers. An example is shown in ­table 5.1

Planning and Maintaining Library Facilities  117
Selecting an architect and other design professionals may be done in a 
number of ways. The institution may have a preferred architect, or the facil­
ities department may put out a request for information (RFI) to solicit a 
number of architects who might be interested. They ­will review the RFI and 
prob­ably interview a small number of architects. Members of the se­lection 
committee should visit any libraries designed by the architect candidates 
and be suspicious of architectural firms that have not designed a library in 
the past. ­There are cases where the first library of an architectural firm is 
excellent, but ­there are also cases where prob­lems unique to libraries are 
not considered by architects who have no experience with libraries; lighting 
and storage issues can often be poorly designed. The role of the architect is 
to work with the building committee, using the program as a guide. The 
architects work in three stages, each with more detail as the design becomes 
more complete.
The first is schematic design, where a basic layout of the rooms and 
spaces is developed. ­There ­will be a lot of back and forth, no ­matter how com­
plete the program. Once the basic idea of where all the doors and spaces ­will 
be located, the architects seek ac­cep­tance of the schematic design and move

118  Planning
on to the design development phase, where more detail is added. ­Actual fur­
niture, stacks, and equipment are shown on the drawings. The final phase 
of design is developing the construction documents. ­These are the multilay­
ered drawings that a builder ­will use first to bid for the job and then to actu­
ally construct the library. ­There is a sheet for lighting, for plumbing, for 
telecom, ­etc. All the built-in cabinets and shelving is specified and shown in 
detail.
Construction estimates should be made by the architects at the end of 
each phase so that every­one is comfortable that the building ­will be built 
within bud­get. If ­these estimates are too high, and this happens often, then 
the architect may need to work with the committee to find ways to make the 
building smaller, or adjust expensive finishes or make other changes to save 
money. This pro­cess is termed “value engineering.” Sometimes a value engi­
neering firm is hired to look at design plans, work with the architects, and 
find ways to save money.
Another area of this pro­cess is interior design, where someone chooses 
colors, furniture, fabrics, win­dow treatments, and light fixtures to complete 
the proj­ect. Working with a design professional ­will result in better, more 
durable products. Lighting in libraries is particularly challenging and should 
be set up with flexibility in mind. During the lifetime of the building, furni­
ture and even stacks ­will be moved; the ceiling lights should still provide 
adequate illumination.
Construction
Once the organ­ization is satisfied that the proj­ect is ready and the con­
struction documents are complete, the proj­ect is put out for bid. This means 
that potential builders ­will estimate what they think it ­will cost to build the 
proj­ect and offer to do the work at a set fee. Normally organ­izations choose 
the lowest bidder to do the construction. If the fa­cil­i­ty is located in a new 
space, then the librarians only need to plan a move at the end of construc­
tion. If the building is undergoing a renovation, then man­ag­ers need to con­
sider how to make materials accessible to users, and how to work with the 
contractors to minimize noise, fumes, dust, and electrical outages. Ideally, 
the contractors or staff from facilities ­will be excellent communicators who 
­will keep library staff informed about anything unusual. However, ­mistakes 
happen, and it is the role of the library man­ag­er to remain positive and 
remind every­one concerned about the reason for ­these incon­ve­niences: a 
bright, new, improved library or information center.
Moving libraries is a challenge and can be expensive. ­People planning a 
library move should participate in the Building and Equipment (BES) sec­
tion of the American Library Association’s (ALA) division, Library Leader­
ship & Management Association (LLAMA). BES even has a Moving Libraries 
Discussion Group.9
Sustainable Libraries
Many library renovation or new building proj­ects are designed with 
energy conservation in mind. Small changes such as changing older light fix­
tures, using timers on lights in spaces such as bathrooms, installing air 
dryers in bathrooms, orienting buildings to minimize sun glare in the sum­
mer, recycling construction materials, and many other ideas ­will pay the 

Planning and Maintaining Library Facilities  119
organ­ization over time and ­will make the library more sustainable. The U.S. 
Green Building Council has established a way to mea­sure the sustainabil­
ity of a new building. This pro­cess is called Leadership in Energy and Envi­
ronmental Design (LEED). The criteria for evaluating a construction proj­ect 
include:
•	 Site location
•	 ­Water conservation
•	 Energy efficiency
•	 Materials
•	 Indoor air quality
•	 Bonus category for innovation and design.10
In early 2017, the number of libraries listed as ­either applying for LEED 
certification or having completed a proj­ect was 686.11 Institutions, ­whether 
cities and towns, schools, colleges, universities, or companies are seeking 
ways to mea­sure and better utilize resources.
Post Occupancy Evaluation
What happens ­after the building is finished, ­after the ­grand opening and 
all the parties? This final stage is a thoughtful review of how the building is 
working. Although many renovations lack this step, Lackney and Zajfen12 
make a good case and describe the steps necessary for ­doing this kind of eval­
uation. They suggest surveying both staff and users to provide feedback on 
how the library works. Covering all aspects of a library experience, from ease 
of parking to functionality and layout, the authors suggest asking ­people who 
use or work in the building to evaluate accessibility, aesthetics, environmen­
tal quality, and safety and security. They also share additional questions for 
staff about how close the ­actual building came to the planned fa­cil­i­ty and 
for suggestions to improve the facilities. An example of a post-­occupancy sur­
vey of library users to assess the success of a renovation was conducted in 
Australia.13 This kind of attention to the fa­cil­i­ty, ­after construction and occu­
pancy, ­will provide insight into the success of the building for the users and 
staff. ­There may be small, affordable changes that could correct issues and 
make it more successful. In larger institutions with many branch libraries, 
this kind of evaluation ­will help develop a better library building program 
for ­future branch libraries.
Emergency Planning and Safety
­Every library or information center should have an emergency plan. 
­These plans and related emergency training of library staff help every­one 
involved know what to do when emergencies occur, for example, where to go 
during a fire (or drill) so that every­one in a unit is accounted for. ­Every library 
should have (and update) a basic checklist that lists specific situations and 
what an employee should do in each case. Many libraries have an emergency 
planning committee that keeps the plan up to date and oversees training 
and drills. This committee also works to designate employees who are respon­
sible for clearing the building. Committee members represent all aspects of 

120  Planning
the library and often other emergency workers, such as ­people who work in 
fire and police departments. ­These officials are happy to offer a review of the 
fa­cil­i­ty for any out of date emergency equipment and to help with staff train­
ing, including fire drills ­etc. ­Because most libraries offer hours of ser­vice 
beyond nine to five, Monday through Friday, usually with fewer man­ag­ers 
available, training eve­ning and weekend employees is especially impor­tant.
Part of emergency planning is to stock supplies including ­simple ­things 
like sheets of plastic to protect materials from leaks, fans, a telephone tree 
to contact ­people in the organ­ization, and phone numbers for contractors 
who ­will come during an emergency. Some libraries package emergency kits 
throughout the departments in the library. Practical articles, such as flash­
lights, batteries, gloves, note pads, and pen may be included in the kits.14 Fire, 
floods, ­water leaks, natu­ral disasters, medical and security emergencies 
happen, and library and information center employees need to be prepared.
No ­matter how detailed and up to date, a policy is only good if the employ­
ees in the library or information center have had recent emergency training. 
A ­great resource for emergency planning is the Northeast Document Conser­
vation Center’s Web site. This nonprofit organ­ization offers an online template 
for any cultural institution to use to develop an emergency plan. Using the tem­
plate on their Web site15 makes it easier for an organ­ization to make sure 
that someone has planned and pulled together all the relevant information.
Establishing a safe and secure workplace for staff is a joint responsibil­
ity. Man­ag­ers can work hard to ensure a good environment, but staff mem­
bers also need to cooperate and participate. For example, repetitive motion 
injuries can be a prob­lem for library staff, especially ­those who do not have 
to move from their desks for long periods. A man­ag­er can ensure that a work 
site analy­sis is conducted and training provided, but the employee needs to 
pay attention to posture and other suggestions to avoid injury. Also, employ­
ees need to understand their roles during an emergency and to carry out 
­these roles in the plan.
Overall one never knows when or if an emergency ­will strike. Careful 
planning helps make sure that any emergency ­will be well managed: ­people 
­will know what to do and where to go, and every­one ­will be kept safe during 
an emergency.
Library Maintenance
In most libraries, the ­people who clean and perform small repairs are 
not employed by the library, but rather work for another unit in the parent 
institution or are hired by an external com­pany. Although most ­people want 
to do a good job, sometimes working with facilities personnel can be frus­
trating ­because they do not always communicate about what they are ­doing 
and when the work ­will be performed. The key to success, when working with 
­house­keeping and maintenance personnel, is to treat them like library or 
information center employees, communicate with them, and invite them to 
library or information center events.
In a larger organ­ization, it is a good idea to delegate someone to serve 
as the primary liaison to facilities and maintenance personnel. In a small 
library, this work usually falls to the director. This liaison should have good 
­people skills and ­will need to learn about cleaning, repairs, and facilities 
maintenance. Often the facilities staff ­will be willing to educate the liaison 
in the workings of their trades. This person does not need to know how to 
repair a toilet or ser­vice air conditioning, but should have some knowledge 

Planning and Maintaining Library Facilities  121
about what regular ser­vice ­these items need and should know how to watch 
for signs if something is not working properly. They also need to be good at 
follow-up and tracking many details.
Some libraries develop ser­vice plan agreements with facilities and main­
tenance departments. This agreement defines the nature of the work done 
by cleaning personnel, for example, how often wastebaskets ­will be emptied 
in rest­rooms or how often vacuuming ­will be performed. Once representa­
tives from the two organ­izations sign this agreement, then the level of ser­
vice can easily be monitored and any divergence from the agreement pointed 
out. Sometimes job descriptions for ­house­keeping staff are developed, espe­
cially if ­these employees work directly for the library. Sample ­house­keeping 
contracts and job descriptions are available.16
It is always a good idea for the facilities liaison to walk through the 
library ­every day and note any issues. Graffiti, for example, tends to expand 
once it begins unchecked. This staff person ­will learn the appropriate way 
to log concerns about maintenance and how best to follow up if work is not 
completed in a reasonable time.
Depending upon the type of library or information center, maintenance 
and small repairs may be done by in-­house staff or put out to bid to outside 
contractors. Parent institutions usually fund significant repairs such as 
replacing roofs, new carpeting, or other large proj­ects. The cost of smaller jobs 
such as painting a room or replacing a few ranges of shelving may fall to the 
library and ­will need to be planned and bud­geted for annually. The work of 
an excellent building man­ag­er may go unnoticed, but a poorly maintained 
fa­cil­i­ty ­will eventually disrupt library operations.
Conclusion
Library and information center physical plants are complex, open more 
hours, have heavy use, and require an engaged man­ag­er to communicate the 
physical needs of the users and staff. Successful man­ag­ers learn the lan­
guage of facilities and communicate well with other orga­nizational personnel. 
­After a long planning, design, and building pro­cess, the hard work is repaid 
by the opportunity to work in a successful, well-­designed fa­cil­i­ty.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 The principal of West Ju­nior High School, Jake Hazard, has fi­nally convinced 
the Superintendent and School Committee that West should be renovated and 
expanded. Every­one in the school and many parents have worked hard to develop 
a library architectural program. However, this is the first time that the mem­
bers of the community have had a chance to review the plans. All the teachers, 
including Sam Greenfield, the school librarian, are attending a public school 
committee meeting that has drawn a large number of residents of the city. ­After 
the Superintendent’s pre­sen­ta­tion, a member of the audience approaches the 
microphone and asks, “I see you have included an expanded library for the school. 
­Don’t you think that most every­thing is on the Internet now? Why should we 
have to have such an outmoded space for the new school?” Jake gives Sam a nod 
to respond. If you ­were Sam how would you answer that question? Make a list 
of points for justifying libraries in the digital age.

122  Planning
2.	How to look at a library—­observational research. Visit a library or information 
center at a busy time of day. Make a note of the date and time of your observa­
tion. Do not communicate to library staff, but see what you can learn by observ­
ing. Look for the following:
•	 Before you enter the building, is it easy to see the library entrance from park­
ing or an adjacent street?
•	 Upon entering can you find signs that explain the layout?
•	 Does the library have exhibit space?
•	 Is ­there a single ser­vice point or several?
•	 What collections are located near the entrance?
•	 Does the library have meeting rooms, group study rooms, or a learning 
commons?
•	 What is the availability of technology?
•	 Is ­there enough storage space or are work areas messy?
•	 Is ­there sufficient shelving for books and journals?
•	 What is the ambience of the space?
•	 Is ­there a mix of furniture types such as ­tables, carrels, soft seating? Is the 
furniture comfortable?
•	 How is the lighting? If you revisit during the eve­ning, is the lighting still 
sufficient for viewing call numbers on lower shelves?
•	 Are ­there special function rooms such as for ­children’s programming, film 
showings, special collections?
Spend at least 30 minutes observing activities at a public ser­vice desk. Does 
the desk area appear to be well or­ga­nized? How many ­people approach the desk 
during this time? Make a list of aspects of the library design that you think are 
successful and another list of prob­lems with the design.
3.	Sally, a reference librarian, is having lunch in the faculty lounge. She joins an 
engineering professor, Walter Peterson. Walter finishes his sandwich and then 
starts questioning Sally about the plans for a new engineering library. “Gosh, 
it seems to me that the university should spend the money increasing faculty 
salaries and not enhancing space for the library. I am quite comfortable with 
the existing library.” How should Sally respond? Think of all the options for fund­
ing a library: state funding, donations, or bonds. Why would it be impossible for 
the university to use funding for a building to increase faculty salaries?
4.	You are a technical ser­vices employee at the library in the City Art Museum. You 
have been asked to serve on a committee to develop an emergency plan for your 
library. To date ­there has been no emergency planning for the library; however, 
the museum itself does have a plan for evacuating visitors and protecting the art­
work. Make a list of questions and issues you have about what should be included 
in an emergency plan.

1.	 You are noticing a lot of graffiti in some quiet sections of the library. How ­will you 
go about dealing with this prob­lem? Discuss pos­si­ble solutions with your group.
2.	Make a list of questions you have for the architect candidates who ­will be inter­

thing was wonderful ­until you learned that the beautiful library ­will cost more 
than bud­geted. You need to take out 15 ­percent of the program in order to stay 
within the bud­get. Where do you start?

Marketing Information 
Ser­vices
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the necessity of marketing the library or information ser­vice to 
constituents
•	 Know the role marketing plays in the success of a strategic plan
•	 Structure a marketing strategy for specific institutional needs
•	 Recognize the components of a good marketing plan
•	 Practice ways to communicate the value of information ser­vices to the community
•	 Understand the distinction between the concepts of public relations, public­
ity, and advertising
•	 Know basic approaches to evaluating a marketing plan
Effective marketing of library and information ser­vices is a vital activity in 
­every type of library and information ser­vices organ­ization. According to the 
American Marketing Association, marketing is defined as “the activity, set 
of institutions, and pro­cesses for creating, communicating, delivering, and 
exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and 
society at large.”1 Customer-­centered marketing is at the core of successful 
ser­vice, and understanding the marketing mix and creating value is vital to 
the health of all libraries. Marketing is the step that follows strategic plan­
ning and is an effort to communicate to and engage the users and potential 
users of the information center in the activities based on the plan’s goals. For

Management on the Job: Architecture Library 
at Ball State University
A good example of how a branch library staff developed a brand and implemented a 
marketing plan within the larger academic library is the experience of the Architecture 
Library at Ball State University. The two-­person staff demonstrated that even a small 
library staff can develop a brand and use it in all communication to market the library. 
They chose a ­simple, clean, and con­temporary font to identify the branch library in all 
their communication. By using a consistent, student-­focused message the library staff 
communicated what the library had to offer. They used scans of attractive book jackets 
and DVD covers to promote the collection. Focusing on two campaigns per year, they 
utilized all marketing channels, including posters, slides for institutional flat screens, 
e-­mail distribution lists, printed newsletters, and Facebook and Twitter feeds. They also 
partnered with a local archive to increase the library’s exposure. Striving to make their 
physical space inviting and offering fun activities at points in the semester, ­these activ­
ities brought students into the space and helped to reinforce their marketing message. 
Furthermore, they understood that all student interactions are an impor­tant aspect of 
marketing the library. Therefore they focused on giving each student the best pos­si­ble 
ser­vice. “Marketing and branding have become tools that make telling the story of the 
library easier for us, and they are well within the grasp of any library, including the aca­
demic branch library.”3
the success of the marketing plan and the organ­ization, all employees need 
to understand and share a commitment to the goals of the organ­ization, so 
that each employee can communicate the organ­ization’s story. A marketing 
plan defines ways for all involved to effectively communicate ­these goals to 
constituents. As the marketing plan is carried out, staff should be assessing 
the effectiveness of components of the plan and making adjustments as nec­
essary.2 No ­matter how large or small the library or information center, mar­
keting should be a priority activity.
This chapter ­will pres­ent an introduction to the topic of marketing, rea­
sons for the importance of marketing, the role of a marketing plan, and the 
effective evaluation of a marketing campaign.
Marketing: A Strategic Component
One of the most impor­tant, yet seemingly elusive, concepts of a strategic 
plan is the development of a marketing strategy, an outcome of the planning 
pro­cess. Basically, the two activities are inextricably tied together. Mar­
keting can be described as the pro­cess of identifying the wants and needs of 
the population of library and information center customers, identifying the 
capabilities of the organ­ization to address ­those needs, and then developing 
or adjusting ser­vices and products to satisfy vari­ous targeted segments of 
that market. This requires knowing the organ­ization’s own capabilities, 
establishing commitments, and identifying customer needs. The marketing 
analy­sis pro­cess can facilitate making strategic decisions about product 
design, promotion, and distribution to satisfy ­those needs.
This marketing strategy requires primary understanding of the mission 
and vision of the information ser­vices organ­ization. That vision and mission, 
developed as the primary guiding princi­ple of the strategic plan itself, serves 

Marketing Information Ser­vices  127
as a basis for initiating and developing the pro­cess of communication and 
marketing within the library’s community. Therefore, the most impor­tant 
guiding princi­ples already have been identified for the library organ­ization. 
The outcome of a more focused marketing strategy can now fulfill one impor­
tant aspect of the overall plan: good information ser­vices. The rigor neces­
sary for implementing such a plan focuses upon the value of information and 
knowledge as well as the promotion of information ser­vices as a primary 
­factor in customer satisfaction.
The beginnings of a marketing plan ­will have been built into the over­
all strategic plan, which began by involving the ­whole community (adminis­
tration, staff, and users) in the planning pro­cess and thereby encouraging 
­every segment of the information organ­ization to have a say and to buy into 
the outcome of a strategic plan. That basic planning pro­cess ­will have not 
only identified goals and objectives but also initiated the discussion of how 
the library or information center would accomplish them. Just as with the 
strategic plan, this marketing effort requires a separate, analytical approach 
in its own right to ensure success, and this pro­cess starts with a specific mis­
sion statement for marketing.
The most likely focus of such a statement, which leads to eventual action, 
is one of assuring or reassuring an identified customer base that their needs, 
identified in the pro­cess, ­will be met through or­ga­nized commitment to the 
library mission, values, and philosophy of ser­vice identified in the strategic 
plan. That fact ultimately ­will be translated into actionable terms that can 
be understood by every­one involved in this marketing-­driven pro­cess. Spe­
cific focus is on implementation of a communication plan promoting the basic 
priorities of information ser­vices.
A comprehensive marketing program encompasses not just the strategic 
plan’s primary concern of “What are we ­here for?” It also requires a follow-­
through to market many of the goals and objectives of that plan. The market­
ing plan has several subgoals, including validating or changing perceptions 
in terms of developing products and ser­vices, delivering ­those products and 
ser­vices in an efficient and effective manner, and analyzing use of and satis­
faction with ­those identified products and ser­vices to confirm success or as a 
signal to adjust systems and pro­cesses to ensure success. Such a plan becomes 
the showpiece of a wide range of activities that are involved in meeting the 
needs of customers and giving value to ­those efforts. In that sense, the mar­
keting component is obvious in ­every aspect of the strategic plan. Other­wise, 
once a strategic ser­vice goal is identified and implementation has begun, how 
do customers know it exists and how can its success or failure be validated? 
Viewing strategic planning and marketing in the same context strengthens 
both the major plan and recognizes marketing as a necessary pro­cess for 
the plan’s success.
A clear strategy determines what resources are available or ­will be avail­
able, and how all the resources and energies of the library organ­ization ­will 
be applied to achieve the goals set out by the marketing initiative. This is 
necessary ­because it is of ­little value to have a strategy if ­either the resources 
or the expertise to implement the program are not available. Clearly, this 
strategy determines how all the resources available from the library and the 
energies of the library staff ­will be applied to achieve the goals. Several com­
ponents can be identified as necessary in the development of a marketing 
strategy. In this pro­cess, an old reliable method, commonly identified as the 
“marketing mix,” can be considered: the pro­cess around the Cs (customer, 
con­ve­nience, and communication) and Ps (product, price, place, pro­cess, par­
ticipants, and promotion) of the mix. Basically, the overall marketing plan, 

128  Planning
inherent in ­those catchwords, focuses upon structuring a strategy to achieve 
a desired primary marketing outcome.
How does one begin to address ­those basic philosophical questions of ser­
vice? In the strategic plan, and this integral marketing component, marketing 
research is required to identify the demands for ser­vices or products. Effective 
marketing commences with understanding users, their expectations, the 
patterns of access by seekers and their preferences, and the barriers that 
exist in attracting potential customers. It also requires establishing an 
ongoing relationship that links information ser­vices with that primary user 
population and, just as vital, a larger public, including donors and potential 
donors, governments, the media, taxpayers, and ­others who might have a 
financial interest or public/or­gan­i­za­tional opinion about the library’s success.

Marketing Information Ser­vices  129
The beginning of this identification pro­cess is an integral part of the environ­
mental scan conducted as part of the strategic plan discussed in chapter 4 that 
identified the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) 
set in the po­liti­cal, economic, social, and technological (PEST) climate. Parts 
of that initial phase, most often identified as the marketing audit, should have 
been introduced in the community analy­sis and user needs components of 
the strategic plan. Therefore, revisiting the initial analy­sis of the market sit­
uation identified in that plan can now help develop specific marketing objec­
tives and provide a solid base for a marketing plan. If that pro­cess has not 
already been done, however, it must be accomplished at the beginning of a mar­
keting strategy.
Two impor­tant components belong in the total marketing strategy, start­
ing with internal marketing, which includes good internal communications 
and a unified concept of customer consciousness among all staff. In other 
words, staff must be aware of and embrace the value of customer satisfaction. 
Only when this happens can an effective strategy be developed to address 
the second component of customizing ser­vices to meet community needs. In 
­today’s information-­intense and competitive electronic environment with 
Internet searching, social media, e-­books, streaming video, and other compet­
ing information resources, such customization becomes vital. A good justifi­
cation for marketing a library that might help library employees understand 
the need for marketing is shown in figure 6.3.
Marketing: The Audit
A follow-up focused marketing audit, emanating from that strategic 
planning pro­cess, identifies the needs and activities necessary to promote 
­those systems and ser­vices. From the marketing perspective, answering 
“Who?, What?, When?, Where?, and How?” provides guidelines for develop­
ing the necessary marketing strategy. Each of ­those basic questions must be 
answered through the analytical pro­cess of identifying the market and its 
vari­ous segments, ensuring that the organ­ization can provide the necessary 
ser­vices, developing a responsive schedule of when the ser­vice can be provided, 
and then developing an infrastructure for success. All of this activity is

related to the primary goal of developing a strategy to enhance an ongoing 
relationship between the users and the providers of information ser­vices.
The strategic planning pro­cess, leading into this specific segment of a 
plan, ­will have identified the more philosophical question of “Why?” that is 
the essence of the library’s existence. From that base, the library and/or 
information center staff ­will have identified the mission of information 
ser­vices for that par­tic­u­lar organ­ization and in that pro­cess ­will have 
addressed the philosophical question of why ­there is a need for marketing.
For marketing purposes, the most impor­tant reasons can be enumerated:
•	 Competition for customers and resources; recognition that the library 
is not the only information source available, and that this fact brings 
new meaning to the need to promote the library’s value in a crowded 
arena.
•	 On a benign level, libraries, like “motherhood” and “God,” are good. 
Therefore, they have been taken for granted by certain segments of 
the population. However, neither library employees nor the users of 
their ser­vices should assume that complacent attitude. An aggres­
sive strategy is required.
•	 At a dif­fer­ent level, many libraries remain virtually irrelevant to 
funding authorities ­because ­those who hold the purse strings do not 
perceive the value. ­There appears to be a misplaced perception of 
“stuffing loads of money into a rat hole, and for what?” This attitude 
requires better public understanding of why libraries are vital.
•	 With changing social trends and technological development, the 
needs and expectations of seekers of information are constantly 
changing. This changing scenario requires libraries to create an 
infrastructure, both physical and personal, that is responsive and 
conducive to customer satisfaction. It also requires educating the 
public on the importance of accurate and au­then­tic information and 
how to evaluate it.
It must be understood that marketing is not just publicity or promotion, 
product creation, public relations, or even pricing and distribution. Rather, 
each of ­those is but one component of the overall marketing pro­cess to be 
developed through this detailed internal marketing audit and assessment. 
The ultimate success of this comprehensive pro­cess is customer satisfaction, 
the primary goal of ­every information ser­vices organ­ization. With the library’s 
mission statement addressing information delivery as a primary objective, 
the institution already should be prepared to develop an effective and effi­
cient marketing plan. Marketing personnel collect and use demographic, 
geographic, behavioral, and psychological information to fulfill the organ­
ization’s mission, inspire public awareness, and educate.4
A primary step is to revisit the assessment of the organ­ization’s capa­
bilities, the strengths and weaknesses as well as the opportunities and 
threats that would have been originally identified as the components of the 
SWOT analy­sis of the overall strategic planning pro­cess as discussed more 
fully in chapter 4. This specific exercise for marketing purposes, as already 
mentioned, is commonly called the marketing audit. By examining the organ­
ization’s profile, one is able to assess its capabilities to develop a marketing 
program. What systems and ser­vices are already in place, how might they 
be adjusted if desirable, and what new ones might need to be developed? Can

Practice Your Skills
In 1917, the American Library Association conducted a survey of library publicity. ­Here 
is one response to that survey from an eastern village library with an income of $450 
per year: “I am just beginning to realize the duty and the privilege of systematic publicity 
in connection with our ­little library. It is a deplorable condition of ­things when so many 
books valuable in helpfulness in ­every line of work or study stand idle on the shelves.”5 
Where would you start to develop a marketing plan for such a small and under-­resourced 
library? Make a list of activities you would undertake to market the collection.
the organ­ization afford the development of a new or greater program with 
current resources? If not, what is the likelihood of additional resources being 
allocated or sought through donations or redirection of existing resources? 
What technological capabilities are in place to ensure success of expanded 
efforts? What other organ­izations compete with or, more desirably, com­
plement ­those ser­vices? What expertise is pres­ent among the staff to effec­
tively, efficiently, and aggressively develop such a program? Recognizing the 
importance of this complex yet valuable pro­cess, many large libraries and 
information centers now have dedicated management staffs with vari­ous 
titles, including director of marketing and publishing, development officer, 
or public relations coordinator to coordinate activities relating to marketing 
and fundraising.
Marketing: The Value ­Factor
In some ways, marketing pres­ents a relatively new challenge as well as 
an opportunity for many librarians who have traditionally recognized the 
public good of information ser­vices and have assumed an automatically 
agreeable, willing, and ­eager public. Now, greater po­liti­cal, economic, social, 
and technological pressures, ­those PEST components of ­every librarian’s life, 
as explained in chapter 4, mandate a concerted effort to demonstrate the 
organ­ization’s value. This can be accomplished through several ways. It 
requires:
•	 Determining what customers and potential users want and how they 
perceive the library as the most appropriate instrument for meeting 
­those needs. This pro­cess is usually accomplished through a variety 
of means: for example, surveys, interviews, and focus groups.
•	 Segmenting the population so that specific ser­vices can be identi­
fied and tailored to the needs of ­those specific groups. The market 
segmentation pro­cess categorizes customers by identifying unique 
characteristics and common needs, such as location, technical com­
petence, profession, age, and so forth. The common thread is access 
to information.
•	 Recognizing and enumerating what it ­will take to provide ­these ser­
vices in terms of staff, expertise, physical layout, access, collections, 
technology, and so forth.
•	 Developing affordable strategies to satisfy information delivery goals 
and objectives based on the results of that audit and research, striking

Talk About It
Ted Abbott, director of the Beford Public Library, is preparing for a meeting with his man­
agement team. The library recently completed a strategic plan that was well received 
by stakeholders, but now he needs to develop a cost-­effective marketing plan and sell it 
to his staff. He won­ders how to convince his management team that marketing the 
library is productive and necessary. He heard one man­ag­er refer to the “M” word and he 
knows that ­others are not convinced. How should he approach his team? Should he con­
duct a brainstorming session for ideas, delegate a small group to develop a plan, or just 
do it himself? What would you do? In a small group, make a list of specific steps you 
would take to begin marketing this library, beginning with convincing the library staff 
that the time is well spent.
a balance between price and value. In this reasoning, one can para­
phrase Oscar Wilde’s comment, “In ­these days ­people know the price 
of every­thing and the value of nothing.”6
•	 Detailing the places that are the most con­ve­nient locations of ser­
vices from the perspective of the customer. This also includes Web 
sites and social media links, as well as physical facilities.
•	 Promoting the results of that effort through identified channels so 
that users and potential users know what products and ser­vices are 
available. ­Those include, among ­others, personal skills, print on 
paper, and electronic; that is, a description of “what we do and how 
we do it.” Promotional approaches to users include advertising, pub­
lic pre­sen­ta­tions, working with media outlets and other public rela­
tions efforts, direct marketing, publications (including such ­things 
as flyers and blog newsletters), book sales, friends’ groups and other 
lobbying groups, Web pages, social media, and so forth.
•	 Periodically and routinely evaluating the pro­cess.
Communication: Promotion as a Basic Ele­ment
Ongoing public relations is the best tool for explaining to the public the 
values that all libraries and information centers uphold.7 Previously, mar­
keting communication was a one-­way, no-­response approach. However, ­today’s 
interactive media, including Web sites, blogs, and social media, enable librar­
ians to develop and maintain a more interactive, responsive dialogue with 
their public. Successful marketing requires identifying reasons that cus­
tomers use and potential customers might use the information ser­vices of 
a par­tic­u­lar type of library, in a par­tic­u­lar location, at a par­tic­u­lar time, in a 
par­tic­u­lar format, for a par­tic­u­lar reason. The pro­cess of identifying some 
of ­those intangible values is difficult, ­because it requires developing profiles 
of vari­ous user groups, mentioned previously, that are intended to be the 
recipient base for ser­vices. It requires recognizing dif­fer­ent needs in dif­fer­
ent groups that might use information ser­vices in dif­fer­ent ways. Then it 
requires developing dif­fer­ent products and ser­vices to meet ­those varying 
needs.
With this analy­sis in place, vari­ous methods can be employed in the 
pro­cess of getting the message across to likely users so that the ser­vices ­will 

Marketing Information Ser­vices  133
meet the needs of the community. Internal motivation of the staff is a primary 
­factor that affects the bottom line. That promotional commitment builds staff 
morale, enhances productivity, and creates team spirit. The marketing goals 
and objectives identified in the strategic plan pres­ent an opportunity to 
move from the so-­called push mentality of persuasion to a pull mentality of 
identifying what is needed, a pro­cess that has been carried out in the strate­
gic planning pro­cess. This helps ­those working in organ­izations to manage 
change in order to stay competitive and efficient. Therefore, success in this 
effort begins with an informed, positive, dedicated staff committed to infor­
mation ser­vices.
Each of the following concepts forms one impor­tant segment of a compre­
hensive marketing package: public relations, publicity, advertising, ambience, 
fundraising, and access.
•	 Public relations helps an organ­ization and its publics adapt mutually 
to each other. Librarians must acknowledge vari­ous attitudes and 
values of potential users and the notion that ­because they reflect the 
external environment, they also ­will guide the development of ser­vices. 
Librarians cannot develop a product or ser­vice in a vacuum without 
knowing what is needed and wanted. This requires analyzing and 
interpreting needs as well as understanding attitudes. It requires 
interaction between providers and potential seekers of information 
ser­vices. A public relations proj­ect is an ongoing pro­cess, not a one-­
time activity. It is an attempt to develop an understanding among 
users and potential users of information ser­vices of the value of infor­
mation to ­people in their professional lives and in the development 
of the organ­ization of which they are a part, as well as in their personal 
lives, ­whether seeking reading for plea­sure or factual knowledge. 
Developing an image of the library by inducing ­those potential users 
requires some proof of successful “information fulfillment,” some indi­
cation of past success or potential success in the product or ser­vices 
of the library.
•	 Publicity is a way of creating awareness of the systems and ser­vices 
in place to address vari­ous segments of the population’s information 
and knowledge needs. It is a tool of public relations meant to per­
suade. Several ways of communicating with ­those identified primary 
audiences are through Web sites, blogs, and other social media, as 
well as the traditional print-­on-­paper and broadcasting modes, and 
by presenting at community meetings. A positive message is the 
librarian’s most impor­tant role as information provider, connecting 
seekers with information and knowledge. Much of the time, this type 
of marketing is through public sources, not directed by the library. 
Examples are interviews with staff or externally produced articles 
in newspapers or online. In-­house productions of publicity items 
include displays, posters, bookmarks, and so forth. Blogging and other 
social media are effective publicity tools, offering short, frequently 
updated postings on library events, staff picks, and news.
•	 Advertising is just a part of marketing, even though many assume it 
is all of marketing. By focusing on advertising, other aspects of the 
program are often overlooked. The advertising subset should fit with 
all the other components of a marketing program. ­Because it is an 
impor­tant part of the program, it is a key to reaching the target 
population. The core purpose of such advertising is to communicate 

134  Planning
information about ser­vice(s), introduce new ser­vices, keep the library 
in the public’s eye, or announce the opening of a new fa­cil­i­ty. When 
advertising is used in any format care must be taken to ensure that 
this subset of the program flows logically from, and is consistent with, 
other parts of the overall marketing strategy.
•	 Ambience of the environment should support the message. Physical 
layout and design offer librarians one of their greatest marketing 
opportunities. Attractive and inviting design and layout provide a 
vision through inspirational spaces that embody the values and qual­
ities of the ser­vice, attract and retain the public, and can be respon­
sive to their changing needs.
•	 Fundraising: although this is a primary activity within itself and 
many librarians consider it too impor­tant to be conducted as a sub­
set of marketing, it is mentioned ­here to support the proposition that 
it is a pro­cess that supports marketing efforts. An alternative term, 
preferred by many, is library development. This involves securing 
funds, through an or­ga­nized effort, to augment traditional monies in 
order to provide additional or special ser­vices, programs, or other 
resources identified as desirable in order to achieve the stated goals 
and objectives of the library. A number of ave­nues are available, includ­
ing foundation and corporate funding, gifts from bequests or in kind, 
endowments, and capital campaigns. Much of fundraising relates to 
marketing the library and information ser­vices; common ave­nues, 
such as exhibits, newsletters, programming, and so on, tie the two 
closer together. For more detail on this subject see chapter 20.
•	 Access to the library is also impor­tant for marketing to be successful. 
Workplace routine cannot outweigh user con­ve­nience, including hours 
of operation or locations of specific collections. Other ­factors, such as 
availability of public transportation and parking and handicap-­
accessible spaces, are vital.
There are many resources available on marketing and public relations. 
The American Library Association offers a wealth of resources for market­
ing libraries from the LLAMA PRMS (Library Leadership and Management 
Association, Public Relations and Marketing Section.8 The community aware­
ness campaign called “Geek the Library”9 also provides ­free information and 
training for public librarians who wish to explore marketing. An excellent 
book with practical ideas for marketing libraries is by Carol Smallwood, Vera 
Gubnitskaia, and Kerol Harrod.10
Evaluating: Checks and Balances
In this complex and changing world, ­there is ­little time for action with­
out a carefully reasoned rationale, and marketing is one of ­those actions. “In 
addition, accountability demands evaluative data to document the status 
and quality of library ser­vices.”11 How does one mea­sure the success of a mar­
keting effort? As with all planning pro­cesses, a follow-up activity must be 
integral to a successful initiation, implementation, and evaluation of a mar­
keting program. One can anticipate or even expect certain outcomes of the 
pro­cess. The most obvious ones are an increasing number of ­people using the 
library, more money brought in to the library, and more ­people participating 

Marketing Information Ser­vices  135
in programs. The results of good library marketing might result in willingness 
to financially support certain ser­vices offered or willingness on the part of 
the larger organ­ization—­local, regional, or national government; university or 
college; school district; private or public com­pany or foundation—to increase 
funding based upon demonstrated goal achievements through proactive mea­
sures that both create and prove value for the larger community.
Practical questions for evaluating a marketing activity include
•	 ­Shall we repeat this proj­ect?
•	 What would/should we change?
•	 If we do something differently, what ­will it be?12
An in­ter­est­ing article by Soraya Ziaei and Fatemeh Nooshinfard13 
addresses using the marketing mix to evaluate and compare library Web sites 
and provides an excellent framework for evaluating a marketing activity.
Conclusion
Marketing information ser­vices has moved from being a task to being 
a required component in ­every library organ­ization’s program of ser­vices. 
A well-­planned, well-­constructed marketing strategy supports the organ­
ization’s goals of information ser­vices. Marketing is a valuable tool librarians 
use to demonstrate orga­nizational effectiveness to funding sources; the 
evaluation of a marketing strategy addresses the question of “How are we 
­doing?” In a way, it is an accountability check. It is one way of ensuring that 
libraries are responding effectively to what their public wants and needs. It 
is also a way of establishing a desirable relationship not only with users but 
also with other segments that have the potential to provide support includ­
ing governments, media outlets, donors, corporations, and publishers. That 
is why marketing is so impor­tant to the life of the library organ­ization and 
why it must be valued by both library staffs and seekers and users of infor­
mation and knowledge.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Sidney White, reference librarian at Whitfield Public Library, has just had it. 
He and his colleague, Samantha Curt, are leaving a meeting with the director, 
where she assigned them to develop a marketing plan for the library. “It seems 
like we have taken months to develop our strategic plan and now she wants more 
planning. When are we ­going to get time to do our work?” If you are Samantha, 
what would you reply to Sidney? Please develop a list of reasons why marketing 
is crucial to the success of a strategic plan.
2.	Working with another student, identify a library that you think has a good mar­
keting strategy. List two examples of ser­vice that impress you. You could focus 
on the library’s Web site, the physical building, or social media outlets. ­After 
you have looked at this library, how does it compare to another library that you 
think has failed to live up to its expectations and potential? For this second 
library, identify marketing activities that are lacking. What recommendations 
do you have for improving that library’s messaging?

students?
4.	Customer satisfaction should be a goal for every­one who works in the library or

ing student workers or volunteers, embraces that goal? Develop a list of “inter­
nal marketing” ideas.
5.	 According to Philip Kotler, “Marketing is the homework that a com­pany does to 
figure out what the com­pany should make.”15 What homework do you think a 
library should do? What do libraries “make?” Do you agree that this “home­
work” is impor­tant? If so, how should it be accomplished?
3.	At a staff retreat, librarians at the State University brainstormed how to bet­
ter market the library. They agreed that one goal for this year’s marketing plan 
would be to focus on students and faculty who do not use the library. Make a list 
of ­things this group should consider when developing a marketing plan for non­
users. For example, how would you identify nonusers, how would you find out what 
nonlibrary information sources they use? How would you communicate to them?
4.	Evaluation of marketing is necessary. Select a library or information center 
with a presence on social media. What if it was your job to decide if the social 
media marketing campaign achieved goals? Make a list of ways you could eval­
uate the success of this marketing effort.

Section 3
Organ­izing
The man­ag­er’s planning function, described in the previous section, is closely 
aligned with the organ­izing function. The planning pro­cess helps an organ­
ization define its goals and objectives. Once ­these are established, man­ag­ers 
must next design an orga­nizational structure to facilitate the achievement 
of ­those goals and objectives. Organ­izing involves determining what tasks 
are to be done, who is to do them, how the tasks are to be grouped, and how 
all the tasks are to be coordinated. This function entails dividing an opera­
tion into smaller, more manageable units and ensuring that each unit’s work 
is compatible with the ­others. By organ­izing the workflow, the man­ag­er estab­
lishes the structure of the organ­ization.
This section ­will examine the components of the organ­izing pro­cess. It 
­will discuss ways to break apart the work done in an organ­ization (special­
ization) as well as ways to bring it back together (coordination). ­These chap­
ters ­will cover many aspects of organ­izing, including why organ­izing is 
impor­tant, how to choose the most appropriate structure, and when reor­ga­
ni­za­tion should be considered. The discussion ­will touch on theories of organ­
ization from classical to con­temporary and conclude with an examination of 
the orga­nizational structures most commonly found in ­today’s libraries and 
information agencies.

Recently, many librarians have been experimenting with modifying their 
library’s orga­nizational structures to better meet the challenges of a new 
information environment. ­Today’s library users have changed expectations 
for ser­vices and collections, and libraries have reor­ga­nized in response to 
­these new demands. Another ­factor ­behind much recent reor­ga­ni­za­tion has 
been the need to trim the bud­get while still attempting to satisfy the needs 
of both employees and patrons. Many of the reorganizations in libraries have 
resulted in “flatter” (less hierarchical) structures that reflect the growing 
importance of the use of teams. ­These reor­ga­nized structures are usually 
more collaborative and have fewer management silos, which is a term used 
to describe departments or sectors that do not share information or work 
cooperatively with other parts of the organ­ization.
Like all other organ­izations, libraries differ in many ways. They vary 
greatly in size and type. They also differ in orga­nizational structure. ­These

Management on the Job: The Reor­ga­ni­za­tion of the 
Jane Bancroft Cook Library
Libraries of all types are facing the challenge of reor­ga­niz­ing to meet new and contin­
ued demands on their ser­vices. The Jane Bancroft Cook library, located in Sarasota, 
Florida, is a small shared library supporting the academic programs of the New College 
of Florida and the University of South Florida–­Sarasota-­Manatee. Before the reor­ga­ni­
za­tion, staff members ­were segregated into departments that hampered interaction, 
and the orga­nizational structure reinforced separation between public and technical 
ser­vices. The reor­ga­ni­za­tion began in 2009 when the systems and technical ser­vices 
departments ­were merged. The next year, the reference and circulation desks ­were com­
bined providing a one-­stop approach for users needing ­either function. In 2011, circulation 
and interlibrary lending ­were merged. ­After the restructuring, the library was or­ga­
nized into two sections: Research, Instruction, and Outreach Ser­vices and Bibliographic, 
Access, and Metadata Ser­vices. ­There have been many benefits from the reor­ga­ni­za­
tion. It broke down long-­standing silos within the library and has allowed staff to be 
used more effectively. Communication and collaboration among librarians has improved, 
as has ser­vice to library patrons. The new organ­ization structure provides a more 
holistic view of staff responsibilities and better meets the needs of 21st ­century library 
users.1
Periodic reor­ga­ni­za­tion is a necessity in modern organ­izations but it is often stress­
ful to both users and employees. How does the Cook Library’s reor­ga­ni­za­tion appear to 
better serve both patrons and library staff? Do you think that the gradual implementa­
tion of the change was a good approach? Can you envision some pos­si­ble difficulties the 
staff might have in the reor­ga­ni­za­tion pro­cess? What can be done to minimize stress to 
both patrons and employees?
differences can be clearly seen by comparing the orga­nizational charts of dif­
fer­ent libraries. Orga­nizational charts, which depict all of the staff positions 
in relation to one another, provide a graphical indication of how widely librar­
ies’ orga­nizational structures may vary. Libraries also vary in their orga­
nizational culture, which may be defined as the set of assumptions, beliefs, 
and be­hav­iors shared by the ­people who work in a specific organ­ization.
A close link exists between the planning and the organ­izing functions 
of management. First, man­ag­ers plan in order to establish the organ­ization’s 
goals and objectives. Next, man­ag­ers or­ga­nize to provide a structure that 
­will allow the organ­ization to achieve its strategic objectives. The structure 
of an organ­ization is crucial to its success. Consequently, both man­ag­ers and 
non-­managers need to understand why the organ­ization is ­shaped as it is. 
Although most of the decisions about organ­izing are made by upper-­level 
man­ag­ers (often with the input of midlevel man­ag­ers), all employees work 
within an orga­nizational structure, and its form affects every­one. In addi­
tion, as ­today’s organ­izations face rapidly changing environments, they must 
often modify their structures in response. Understanding the managerial 
function of organ­izing ­will help employees to understand both the enterprise 
where they work now and the one that may employ them tomorrow.
Chapter 7 ­will introduce you to the concept of organ­izations, which is 
the term used to describe groups of ­people structured to pursue a goal. It 
includes a discussion of orga­nizational charts and how they usually (but not 
always) reflect the real­ity of the management structure. In conclusion, the 
chapter ­will discuss orga­nizational culture and its influence.

Organizations and Organizational Culture  143
Organ­izing
As the term implies, organ­izing provides shape and structure to a work­
place. To or­ga­nize, man­ag­ers must look at all the tasks that have to be done, 
and then decide how they ­will be done and by whom. This set of decisions, the 
organ­izing function, has long been central to the study of management. Early 
writers such as Henri Fayol devoted more attention to organ­izing than to any 
other managerial function. To ­these theorists, an orga­nizational structure was 
a lasting entity. They perceived such structures as stable and almost always 
hierarchical, with power flowing in an orderly manner from the workers at 
the top of the hierarchy to ­those below.
However, the rapidly changing environment of the past few de­cades 
has necessitated a rethinking of orga­nizational structure. Much of this 
rethinking has come in the wake of increasing competition and the growing 
importance of computerized information in all types of organ­izations. In librar­
ies, specific ­factors driving this change are the increasing importance of net­
worked technologies, the use of the cloud for storage, the digitization of almost 
all library materials, and the development of power­ful search engines.2
Many of the reor­ga­nized organ­izations have challenged or even discarded 
the old conventions about structural stability as they work to become more 
efficient and effective. Hierarchies have been flattened by the removal of lay­
ers of ­middle man­ag­ers. The model of organ­ization now being touted by 
management experts is flexible and adaptable to change, with relatively few 
levels of formal hierarchy and loose bound­aries around functions and the 
units that perform them. Commonly, ­these new orga­nizational structures 
designate teams of workers to ­handle specific tasks on a permanent or semi-­
permanent basis.
Indeed, personnel in libraries have additional compelling reasons to 
reor­ga­nize. In recent de­cades, libraries have been transformed by the infor­
mation technology (IT) revolution. No longer do traditional print resources 
predominate; now they coexist with digital electronic resources, which are 
of increasing importance year by year. Users who once expected to come to the 
library for access to resources now expect to have access through electronic 
gateways both inside and outside the library. Librarians must now consider 
access to materials as much as the materials themselves. It is not surpris­
ing, then, that libraries have needed to restructure their orga­nizational 
patterns.
What orga­nizational structure is best suited for this new type of library? 
As ­will be seen in this section, ­there is no one answer to that question. Among 
the related questions that must be asked are: What is required for this trans­
formation? What organ­ization best suits the new real­ity of libraries? How­
ever, to begin, it is impor­tant to understand what organ­izations are.
What an Organ­ization Is
One way to define an organ­ization is as a boundary-­maintaining, goal-­
directed, and socially constructed system of ­human activity.3 Let us examine 
that definition a bit more closely. Organ­izations are socially constructed; they 
are deliberately created by ­humans. They are goal-­directed, which means 
that they are purposive systems in which members pursue a certain set of 
goals. They maintain bound­aries; the distinction between members of the 
organ­ization and nonmembers serves to separate organ­izations from their 
environments. However, ­those bound­aries are almost always permeable, 
meaning that organ­izations are necessarily affected by their environments.

144  Organ­izing
Organ­izations are the basic building blocks of modern society. Their for­
mation is inevitable ­because of the limitations of individuals. When a single 
person cannot do all the work that needs to be done, ­there is no choice but to 
involve ­others and thereby create an organ­ization. Of course, organ­izations 
vary greatly in size and in purpose: the local Rotary Club, the American 
Library Association, General Motors, and Microsoft are all organ­izations.
Often organ­izations are composed of specialists working together on a 
common task. Unlike society, community, or ­family—­the traditional social 
aggregates—­such organ­izations are purposefully designed and grounded nei­
ther in the psy­chol­ogy of ­human beings nor in biological necessity. Although 
a ­human creation, an organ­ization is meant to endure—­not forever, perhaps, 
but most are designed to last for a considerable period of time.4
Work-­related organ­izations have come to play a more impor­tant role in 
­peoples’ lives than ever before. For instance, 200 years ago the United States 
was a country in which almost all workers ­were self-­employed as farmers or 
in­de­pen­dent craftspeople. Now, by contrast, most ­people spend their working 
life as one employee among many in an organ­ization.
Although composed of individuals working together to accomplish some 
objective, organ­izations are more than simply an aggregation of ­people. They 
have characteristics of their own, over and above the characteristics of their 
members. For example, organ­izations have a distinct structure; they have 
rules and norms that have developed over time; they have a life cycle that 
usually extends beyond the life spans of individuals; and they usually have 
a set of goals, policies, procedures, and practices. They function in an exter­
nal environment that affects many of ­these characteristics. They are likely 
engaged in pro­cessing some kind of input and turning it into an output. They 
interact with other organ­izations, and they have to change internally to keep 
up with external pressures.
Most of the organ­izations in existence ­today are relatively small. In 2012, 
­there ­were approximately 5.73 million businesses in the United States, and 
89.6 ­percent of ­those firms employed fewer than 20 workers.5 As you might 
expect, libraries display the same pattern: ­there are many small libraries, 
some with just a small number of employees, and a few very large ones, which 
may have many hundreds of workers. According to the latest statistics pro­
vided by the American Library Association, the United States has approxi­
mately 120,000 libraries, over 98,000 of which are school libraries. ­These 
libraries employ approximately 366,000 ­people; slightly more than 166,000 
of ­these employees are officially classified as librarians.6
Like the ­humans that establish them, organ­izations have life cycles: they 
come into existence, they grow, and they become mature. They may flourish 
for a while, but they then usually begin to decline and, ­unless they are revi­
talized, they often die (see figure 7.1). Although some organ­izations, such as 
the Roman Catholic Church, the Icelandic Parliament, and a few universi­
ties, have been in existence for many centuries, most organ­izations are short-­
lived, coming and ­going in a much shorter time period than the ­humans 
who formed them. To endure, organ­izations must adapt to meet changing 
conditions.
Many entities have begun to experiment with changing their orga­
nizational structures to address ­today’s competitive, complex environment. 
Much of this restructuring has occurred within the corporate world, which 
usually leads the way in orga­nizational transformation. However, the need 
to examine and perhaps reshape the orga­nizational structure is as impera­
tive in libraries as in the for-­profit sector. As was discussed in chapter 3, fast-­
paced change is certainly a part of the environment of all types of libraries.

Jo Owen in The Death of Modern Management writes,
To understand just how ephemeral success is, look back 25 years. . . . ​Only 40 of 
the Fortune 100 from 25 years ago are still in the Fortune 100. Well over half of 
the top companies have been overtaken or taken over inside a generation. Looking 
slightly further back, just 87 of the original S & P 500 companies from 1957 still 
exist: less than 20% have survived near or at the top for 50 years. That is a survival 
rate which confirms the ephemeral nature of success. We can be sure that many 
of the paradigms of success which are being celebrated ­today ­will be quietly 
forgotten tomorrow.8
Success is ephemeral, and in the corporate world, successful organ­izations come 
and go. What ­factors do you think contribute to the rise and fall of profit-­making 
organ­izations? Do the same ­factors contribute to the success of not-­for-­profits, such as 
libraries?
­These changes have led library man­ag­ers in libraries to consider pos­si­ble 
restructuring. Many of the same forces that have influenced other types of 
organ­izations also have affected libraries: increased automation, reduction 
in bud­gets, users’ changing information needs and expectations, and a 
greater need for staff autonomy. As a consequence of ­these systemic changes, 
librarians have had to reexamine the orga­nizational structure of the library 
itself. Some have completely discarded the old structure; in other libraries, 
the reor­ga­niz­ing has been incremental. However, restructuring is a difficult 
task with few easy answers. Often, organ­izations have restructured to solve 
one prob­lem, but with the new structure have inadvertently created many 
more. Nevertheless, it is imperative for man­ag­ers in all organ­izations to 
periodically examine their structure and consider ­whether the existing 
orga­nizational structure is still appropriate. Clinging to an orga­nizational 
structure that worked well yesterday may prevent an organ­ization from meet­
ing the challenges of both ­today and tomorrow. All organ­izations need to be 
dynamic microcosms and respond to their environment.7

146  Organ­izing
Orga­nizational Structuring and Restructuring
Although the terms organ­ization and orga­nizational structure are often 
used interchangeably, more precise definitions illustrate their differences. 
The organ­ization is the group of individuals who have joined together to 
achieve an objective. An orga­nizational structure (sometimes called an orga­
nizational design) is the system of relationships, both formally dictated and 
informally developed, that governs the activities of coworkers seeking to 
accomplish common objectives. This structure is the outgrowth of the organ­
izing pro­cess.
Orga­nizational structure is one of the interrelated components that 
define any organ­ization. In this context, structure refers to the definition of 
individual jobs and their relationship to each other as depicted on a formal 
organ­ization chart. Structure reflects how responsibility is distributed, how 
individual positions are coordinated, and how information is officially dis­
seminated. Changing an organ­ization’s structure is known as restructuring 
or reor­ga­ni­za­tion.
As mentioned earlier, periodic restructuring is practically inevitable if 
an organ­ization is to endure. ­Because the original structure was created at 
a certain time, in a certain set of circumstances, by ­human beings, it is nei­
ther permanent nor sacred. Indeed, it has been said that most organ­izations 
existing ­today ­were created to meet goals and objectives that no longer exist 
for ­those organ­izations. Yet man­ag­ers have traditionally been reluctant to 
alter an established orga­nizational structure. This may be due to fear of 
change or failure to see how new activities call for revamped orga­nizational 
structures. Holding on to an old orga­nizational structure while working to 
achieve new goals and objectives results in confusion, inefficiency, and dupli­
cation of effort. When competition is sparse or the outside environment is 
relatively static, an outdated orga­nizational structure does ­little harm, but 
prob­lems ­will ensue when competition intensifies and the environment 
becomes more turbulent.
Near the end of the 20th ­century, many organ­izations all over the world 
began to restructure using the princi­ples of business pro­cess reengineering 
(BPR). BPR was the latest of a long line of managerial reforms intended to 
make organ­izations more effective and efficient. As the name implies, BPR 
consists of analyzing the workflows and pro­cesses within an organ­ization and 
then restructuring the pro­cesses in order to improve quality, per­for­mance, 
and productivity. A business pro­cess is a set of logically related tasks per­
formed to achieve a defined business outcome. One of the main ­drivers for 
BPR was the increased reliance on information technology and networks in 
all organ­izations and the impact that ­these had on all business pro­cesses. 
The key characteristics of BPR are: radical change, taking a pro­cess perspec­
tive, outlining a new structure, customer focus, catch up or maintain best 
practices, top-­down approach requiring top-­management support, changing 
culture, and focus on core competencies.9
Many organ­izations experimented with BPR, but more recently fervor 
for BPR as it was originally envisioned has begun to wane. However, consid­
ering the pro­cesses within an organ­ization as a focal part of reor­ga­ni­za­tion 
is now a standard approach. Many libraries and other public sector organ­
izations have already used aspects of BPR in reor­ga­ni­za­tion efforts, and more 
are adopting this approach.10 For instance, the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) 
has gone through an entire reengineering of its system, converting itself from 
a paper-­based system to an electronic one.11 Examining business pro­cesses

The United States Postal Ser­vice (USPS) traces its roots back to 1775 when Benjamin 
Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general. This venerable institution is being 
threatened by changes in its environment and in November 2011 reported a $5.1 billion 
loss. A big ­factor in the financial crisis in the USPS is that annual mail volume has 
dropped more than 20 ­percent (some 40 million pieces) from five years before the report. 
The decline is the result of the increased use of e-­mail and the advent of online bill paying. 
In addition, some of its highest-­margin ser­vices, such as international and overnight 
delivery, have been largely surpassed by private firms such as FedEx and UPS. Post­
master General Patrick Donahue stated, “­We’re in a deep financial crisis ­today ­because 
we have a business model that’s tied to the past. We are expected to operate like a busi­
ness, but ­don’t have the flexibility to do so. Our business model is fundamentally inflex­
ible. It prevents the Postal Ser­vice from solving its prob­lems.”12
The USPS is a good example of an organ­ization whose very existence is threatened 
by changes in its environment. This institution needs to be reinvented for the digital 
age. Imagine that you have been hired as a con­sul­tant by Mr. Donahue. What changes 
do you think USPS might institute to make it ­viable again? In the face of all the prob­
lems being faced by USPS, would it be better to close it down and let all of its functions 
be assumed by the private sector? Are ­there ser­vices presently provided that might dis­
appear in this case? Could the United States get along without a national postal ser­vice?
and how they can be improved is a good way to begin to reenvision an organ­
ization’s structure.
Making the right changes in a rapidly shifting world is especially hard. 
Drastic environmental changes frequently lead to the extinction of entire 
types of organ­ization, if the orga­nizational sector is not able to change in 
response. An example is the buggy whip industry. Once automobiles became 
the dominant means of transportation, the makers of buggy whips had few 
customers. Fortunately, orga­nizational change is usually gradual, and this 
type of change provides the possibility for numerous small adaptions to be 
made that ­will allow a par­tic­u­lar type of organ­ization to survive. However, 
gradual changes in the environment may lull an organ­ization into ignoring 
the magnitude of the differences that are occurring. Charles Handy, the Brit­
ish management expert, recounts a story that can serve as a cautionary tale 
for every­one interested in orga­nizational change. In his book, The Age of 
Unreason, Handy states that if a frog is placed in a pot of cool ­water and then 
the ­water is gradually heated, the frog just gets more comfortable as the 
­water warms, and it slowly sinks into a tranquil stupor. The frog ­will not 
move, even when the ­water reaches the boiling point, and thus the slow tem­
perature change results in its death.13 This story does not seem to be rooted 
in scientific fact, but it is a power­ful meta­phor to describe how gradual change 
can lull an entity, be it frog or organ­ization, into ignoring the larger conse­
quences of what is happening in the world around it.
Since the 1970s libraries have adjusted to many changes in their envi­
ronments, but they have been able to make ­these changes in a relatively grad­
ual manner. Bit by bit, libraries have incorporated information technology 
into almost all aspects of their operations, have become familiar with serv­
ing users virtually, and have grown comfortable with hybrid collections where 

148  Organ­izing
many items are licensed and not owned. Although libraries as organ­izations 
have undoubtedly adapted, the recent pace of change in the environment 
means that incremental change may no longer be sufficient. Radical change 
­will be required if libraries wish to remain successful in the Fourth Indus­
trial Revolution, and part of this change ­will involve restructuring the library 
to meet the changing needs of users.
­Because ­there is no universal “best way” to structure libraries or any 
other organ­ization, wise man­ag­ers are exploring their options. The best man­
ag­ers periodically evaluate the structure of their organ­ization, examining 
both the need for and the design of its pro­cesses. In this age of accelerating 
change, advances in information technology are permitting ­people to do their 
jobs in dif­fer­ent and better ways, and organ­izations usually need to be 
restructured to reflect ­these changes.
Developing an orga­nizational structure with which the organ­ization can 
achieve its planned goals and objectives efficiently is not easy. Moreover, as 
orga­nizational structures get larger and involve additional ­people, more com­
plex prob­lems arise. The structure must incorporate the identification and 
grouping of similar or related activities, and it must allow the assignment of 
­these activities to appropriate subgroups. It must provide for the coordina­
tion of activities ­under a man­ag­er, while also enabling the man­ag­er to del­
egate authority and responsibility as necessary to carry out the assigned 
activities. Even in the corporate world ­there is much indecision about the 
methods and results of reor­ga­ni­za­tion. As Johansen and Swigart write, “We 
have outlived the usefulness of models from the industrial era but ­don’t yet 
have robust orga­nizational models for the information era.”14 However, as 
Greenwood and Miller state, “It is a cliché to say that organ­izations are faced 
with an unpre­ce­dented array of challenges. It is perhaps less obvious to note 
that the most urgent and pervasive among ­these challenges can only be 
addressed by the continual and deliberate orchestration of organ­ization 
design on an ongoing basis.”15 Although the pro­cess is difficult, man­ag­ers in 
organ­izations must continue to strive to design a structure that meets the 
needs of ­today.
Libraries currently are or­ga­nized in a variety of ways, ranging from very 
flat to traditional hierarchical organ­izations. ­There is no optimum way to 
or­ga­nize, and therefore no consistent prescription for the best type of struc­
ture. Traditional hierarchies work best in some situations, whereas in ­others 
the flatter structures now in vogue are more suitable. As in so many other 
areas of management, the best orga­nizational structure depends on the par­
tic­u­lar circumstances. Orga­nizational theorists now urge the organ­ization 
to think about what it hopes to accomplish before adopting any orga­nizational 
structure. The ­factors in question include market, location and which design 
best enhances the organ­ization’s core competencies. “The executive’s operat­
ing focus becomes how to create congruency—­the fit among all orga­nizational 
components consistent to the chosen organ­ization design—so that the organ­
ization is the most efficient.”16
Getting Started with Organ­izing
One of the most impor­tant aspects of organ­ization is choosing the 
structure of the organ­ization, especially as an enterprise grows and addi­
tional workers are hired. Man­ag­ers are concerned with three related goals 
when they make design decisions. They want to (1) create a setting in which 
man­ag­ers can consistently influence employees to do their par­tic­u­lar jobs;

If your library has inflexible job descriptions and structures that box ­people in, 
you ­either have a failure on your hands or an optical illusion. Quite often job 
descriptions and organ­ization charts are boxy and limiting, but they ­don’t describe 
what actually happens day to day; the library functions in ad hoc ways without 
observing the official bound­aries and constraints. If you work in a library and 
happen across your job description, chances are it ­will seem like an artifact from 
a time capsule, quaint and amusing. Wow, was I ­really ­doing that last year? 
Mostly, they ­don’t get looked at ­unless someone new is being hired, at which point, 
­after some hilarity, they are rewritten. On the job, ­people figure out what needs 
­doing and they do it.19
The quotation above was written by Barbara Fister, who blogs about libraries for 
Inside Higher Education ­Today. Why does she think that inflexible job descriptions and 
structures that “box ­people in” mean you have ­either a failure or an optical illusion? 
Why do job descriptions become outdated so quickly? Is it pos­si­ble and advisable for an 
organ­ization to maintain up-­to-­date job descriptions?
(2) foster collaboration among individuals, which is necessary for successful 
operations; and (3) put together a cost-­effective system.17
Most organ­izations need ­little structure in their early years ­because they 
are still very small with all the advantages of small organ­izations: they are 
flexible, fairly inexpensive to maintain, and have clear accountability. Deci­
sions are made by just a few ­people, and communication can be very informal. 
However, as a successful organ­ization grows, having some sort of formal 
structure with written policies and guidelines becomes critical; this structure 
serves to divide the responsibilities and the authority for decision-­making. 
When OCLC (then the Ohio College Library Center) began in 1967, the organ­
ization consisted of two employees: its founder, Frederick G. Kilgour, and one 
secretary. OCLC in its earliest days prob­ably gave ­little thought to formal 
orga­nizational structure. Now it has become a complex worldwide corporation 
with 16,000 member libraries in more than 100 countries and territories and 
more than 1,000 employees in 19 offices in 11 countries.18 The man­ag­ers of 
OCLC have had to structure the organ­ization carefully to ensure it achieves 
its objectives. The larger an organ­ization, the more complex its structure 
becomes.
Some organ­izations remain small and, therefore, never need to think 
seriously about orga­nizational structure. For instance, a small public library 
with a handful of employees ­will be able to retain a relatively informal orga­
nizational structure. However, ­every growing organ­ization ­will reach a point 
at which a formal orga­nizational structure becomes essential to its success.
For that reason, few successful start-­ups become ­great companies, 
largely ­because they respond to growth and success in a counterproductive 
way. Entrepreneurial success is fueled by creativity, imagination, bold moves 
into uncharted ­waters, and visionary zeal. But as a com­pany grows, its oper­
ations become more complex. It, therefore, requires rules and standard pro­
cedures to avoid tripping over its own success—­all ­those new ­people, new 
customers, new ­orders, new products. A work environment that had once been 
­great fun soon becomes unwieldy and disorganized.20

Imagine that you are about to gradu­ate from an MLIS program and are beginning to 
interview for professional positions in libraries. You think that you want to work in an 
academic library and are especially interested in user instruction. Would you prefer to 
work in a small academic library with perhaps five professional employees, all of whom 
do a bit of user instruction in the course of their job or in a large ARL library where you 
would be part of a 10-­person user instruction department? What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of each job? Which job do you think might provide better preparation for 
positions you might want to apply for in the ­future?
Fast-­growing libraries similarly call for increasing complexity in struc­
ture. For example, consider the case of a small special library within a bur­
geoning corporation. When the library is first established, one librarian may 
suffice to perform all the operational tasks, including acquisitions, cata­
loging, reference, interlibrary loan, and online searching. However, as the 
parent corporation grows larger, so too does the demand for information sup­
plied by the library, so more employees must be hired. Now a man­ag­er must 
make decisions about the organ­ization of that library. The expanded library 
and its new employees could be deployed in many ways; the man­ag­er’s task 
is to establish the structure that ­will be most effective and efficient. It is pos­
si­ble for all employees to work on all of the tasks, with each spending a frac­
tion of their time ­doing acquisition, reference, cata­loging, and so forth. More 
likely, however, the work ­will be divided in such a way that each employee ­will 
more or less specialize in one of ­these tasks.
Division of ­labor enables workers to be more efficient. Despite this greater 
efficiency, however, too much specialization often results in tasks that are 
too narrow in scope and therefore boring and unsatisfying to the employee; 
this issue ­will be discussed further in sections 4 and 5 of this book. Larger 
organ­izations are more likely to involve specialization; in smaller ones, 
employees often have to perform many types of functions, and roles are much 
less differentiated. Contrast the cases of a librarian working as the only 
librarian in a school library and a reference librarian working in a large aca­
demic research library that employs 300 professionals. Obviously, the school 
librarian ­will, of necessity, perform a wider range of tasks than the academic 
librarian in a specialized position. Persons working in what have been termed 
one-­person libraries have to be generalists who can perform many func­
tions well.
In the case of the corporate library described previously, the library man­
ag­er would prob­ably decide that each employee should specialize to some 
extent. In that case, the man­ag­er would allocate the tasks in such a way that 
one employee would be in charge of acquisitions, one in charge of licensing, 
two would focus on cata­loging, three would work in reference ser­vices, and 
so on. One man­ag­er would likely be accountable for the operation of the entire 
library. Among that person’s responsibilities would be coordinating the many 
library tasks to ensure that all pro­cesses work smoothly together and all 
objectives are accomplished. Such a person, the library director, would be the 
one making the ultimate decisions about the orga­nizational structure.
The structuring of this library illustrates two key concepts in organ­
ization: specialization and coordination. When more than one person is 

Organizations and Organizational Culture  151
working ­toward an objective, each worker must know which par­tic­u­lar tasks 
to do, so as to avoid confusion and duplication of effort. ­Every man­ag­er of an 
organ­ization must decide how to distribute its tasks; this specialization 
involves breaking the organ­ization into parts. Then the organ­ization’s man­
ag­ers must decide how to coordinate all the specialized departments; that is, 
how to reintegrate the parts in order to assem­ble a complete product or ser­vice. 
All large organ­izations must both specialize and coordinate. The methods 
that libraries use to specialize and coordinate ­will be discussed in greater 
depth in chapter 8.
Formal and Informal Organ­izations
Organ­izations may be classified as formal or informal. A formal organ­
ization refers to the formal relationships of authority and subordinates within 
a com­pany. This is the organ­ization as it is defined by the deliberate distri­
bution of tasks, functions, and authority. The formal organ­ization comprises 
all of the official, standardized work relationships. An informal organ­ization, 
on the other hand, is more loosely or­ga­nized and flexible. It is often created 
spontaneously. Informal organ­izations may exist in­de­pen­dently of formal 
organ­izations; for instance, four ­people who gather periodically to play bridge 
constitute an informal organ­ization.
As it happens, many informal organ­izations exist within the confines of 
a formal organ­ization. ­After the formal organ­ization has been established, 
informal organ­izations arise naturally within its framework. The unofficial 
relationships within a work group constitute the informal organ­ization. ­These 
informal groups often have leaders whose positions never show up on the 
orga­nizational chart. Unlike the formally appointed leader who has a well-­
defined position from which to influence ­others, the informal leader does not 
have officially sanctioned authority. Instead, the leader of an informal group 
is typically chosen by the group itself; he or she is the person that the other 
members feel is critical to satisfying their specific needs at a specific time. 
Leadership in informal groups often changes rapidly, with vari­ous individu­
als revolving in and out of leadership roles.
Informal organ­izations are never found on the organ­ization chart, 
but they often have a profound impact on the formal organ­ization. Their 
influence can ­either enhance or subvert the organ­ization’s effectiveness. 
Classical management princi­ples usually ignored the existence of informal 
organ­izations, and many man­ag­ers still underestimate the importance of 
­these informal entities. However, the orga­nizational role of an individual 
employee derives from both the formal and informal relationships.
Libraries as Organ­izations
This chapter focuses on formal organ­izations. Libraries are one type of 
formal organ­ization; most libraries are not-­for-­profit, ser­vice entities with 
special orga­nizational characteristics. Libraries differ from profit-­making 
organ­izations ­because they are ser­vice organ­izations that provide informa­
tion, not more tangible materials. ­Because they have a long history, they have 
accumulated specific conceptions of function and method that often make for 
rigid structure and re­sis­tance to change. Usually, libraries function as aux­
iliaries to larger enterprises, such as universities, schools, and municipali­
ties, and not as in­de­pen­dent entities, and as a result are subject to external 

152  Organ­izing
pressures from po­liti­cal bodies, faculties, and users. Libraries are also dis­
tinctive ­because they are staffed in the higher echelons by personnel with 
gradu­ate training, making for a highly-­educated core staff, and are typically 
administered by professionals who are promoted from the ser­vice ranks, not 
by ­career man­ag­ers.21 Although libraries are one distinct type of organ­
ization, they share many characteristics with other kinds of organ­izations. 
Throughout this section, libraries ­will be the focus of attention, but the the­
ories and princi­ples apply to all organ­izations.
Organ­ization Charts
A useful aid for understanding horizontal and vertical differentiation of 
roles is the organ­ization chart, which graphically depicts the organ­ization’s 
overall structure. ­These charts are so prevalent that, when “they hear the 
word structure, most ­people think of boxes on charts.”22 Although an orga­
nizational chart includes individual staffers, its primary function is to show 
how lines of authority link departments. Such information is valuable, but 
remember that the “orderly ­little boxes stacked atop one another . . . ​show you 
the names and titles of man­ag­ers but ­little ­else about the com­pany—­not its 
products, pro­cesses, or customers—­perhaps not even its line of business.”23
On ­these charts, lines of authority are usually illustrated by solid lines, 
while lines showing staff orga­nizational units are often dotted or dashed 
lines. Formal communication follows the lines of orga­nizational units and 
authority. Informal lines of communication, of course, are not shown on the 
traditional organ­ization chart.
On any organ­ization chart, authority flows downward and outward; it 
does not return to the point of origin. For example, in figure 7.2, the main 
line of authority begins with the director, flows down to the assistant direc­
tor, and from that position further down and outward to the three functional 
departments. The business office is supervised by the director only. In that 
case, authority flows right from the director down and out to the business 
office, where it stops. In other words, in this library, the assistant director 
reports to the director, as does the head of the business department. The 
heads of the circulation, reference, and technical ser­vices departments report 
to the assistant director. Understanding that authority flows outward and 
FIGURE 7.2. Organ­ization Chart Showing Authority Lines

Organizations and Organizational Culture  153
then stops is crucial for interpreting organ­ization charts. ­Here, the business 
office has no authority over the assistant director or any other orga­nizational 
unit shown in the figure.
In the library represented in figure 7.3, the director has authority over 
the ­human resources office. ­Because the ­human resources office performs a 
staff function, this authority is depicted with a broken line. The ­human 
resources office serves in an advisory capacity to the director and to all other 
units of the organ­ization, without authority over any unit. However, the 
­human resources office, in its internal operation, has solid-­line authority over 
the payroll functions.
Some of the blocks in figures 7.2 and 7.3 represent individuals (e.g., 
director and assistant director), while ­others represent functions (e.g., circu­
lation, reference, and technical ser­vices). The blocks that represent functions 
encompass all assigned activities, including ­those performed by the man­
ag­er. Therefore, the blocks that seem to represent individuals actually rep­
resent the collection of activities assigned to that position. For the director 
in figure 7.2, activities include the direct supervision of the business office; 
in figure 7.3 the director’s activities include overseeing the ­human resources 
office. In both charts, the assistant director is responsible for day-­to-­day 
supervision of the three operating units, but other activities also are assigned 
to this position. Although it may appear that a unit of the organ­ization struc­
ture is designated by an individual’s title, one must recognize that the orga­
nizational block includes all the activities of that position.
Few organ­izations are as ­simple as ­those represented by figures 7.2 and 
7.3. Some are very complex, leading to large, complicated, and sometimes 
confusing orga­nizational charts. Occasionally, the orga­nizational status of 
a unit is misunderstood ­because of its chart location. It is commonly believed 
that the higher on the chart the unit appears, the greater is its status and 
authority. This is untrue. The importance of any given orga­nizational unit 
is illustrated by the line of authority and the number of man­ag­ers that that 
authority passes through before reaching the unit.

154  Organ­izing
Organ­ization charts can define and describe channels of authority, com­
munication, and information flow. They can show the status or rank of mem­
bers of the organ­ization, along with each supervisor’s span of control. The 
creation of an organ­ization chart helps the man­ag­er identify prob­lems or 
inconsistencies in the division of ­labor, such as the assignment of unrelated 
or dissimilar activities to a unit.
­Every library, regardless of size, should have an up-­to-­date organ­ization 
chart. It should be available to all staffers to help them understand relation­
ships within the library. However, an organ­ization chart, a static model of a 
dynamic pro­cess, is limited in its power. It ­will show how the work is divided, 
who is supervising whom, the nature of the work assigned to each compo­
nent, and the successive layers of superiors and subordinates. It ­will not show 
the relative importance or status of the orga­nizational units, the amount of 
responsibility and authority given to positions on the same management 
level, clear distinctions between line workers and staffers, or ­every key rela­
tionship in the orga­nizational network. It ­will also not show the informal 
organ­izations (and communication channels) that logically and necessarily 
extend the formal structure.24
Several other orga­nizational charts can be found on this book’s compan­
ion Web site. Although most are traditional in form, ­others are arranged in 
other formats such as circles. Analy­sis of the charts reveals that some work 
structures violate the princi­ples of organ­izing. For example, on some of the 
charts, certain positions have two or three supervisors. On ­others, some 
supervisors’ span of control is larger than is usually recommended. An organ­
ization chart often reflects local situations that may be holdovers from the 
past, or may represent the intent of the top administrator, regardless of the 
general princi­ples of orga­nizational design.
Orga­nizational Culture
Orga­nizational culture is a term used to describe the collective assump­
tions, value systems, and norms that groups develop to cope with prob­lems 
of external adaption and internal integration.25 Each organ­ization tends to 
develop its own orga­nizational, or corporate, culture as norms of the group 
arise and become manifest in employee be­hav­ior. In the corporate world, 
many organ­izations have very strong cultures. Google, for example, has devel­
oped a culture based on the philosophy of its found­ers, Larry Page and Sergey 
Brin. According to the Google Web site, its culture emphasizes maintain­
ing a small com­pany atmosphere:
We strive to maintain the open culture often associated with startups, in 
which every­one is a hands-on contributor and feels comfortable sharing 
ideas and opinions. In our weekly all-­hands (“TGIF”) meetings—­not to 
mention over email or in the cafe—­Googlers ask questions directly to 
Larry, Sergey and other execs about any number of com­pany issues. 
Our offices and cafes are designed to encourage interactions between 
Googlers within and across teams, and to spark conversation about 
work as well as play.26
IBM also has a strong corporate culture, but its culture differs substantially 
from the one at Google. The culture at IBM has adapted over the year and is 
no longer the very formal “white shirt and tie” culture that existed in the 
past. However, IBM’s size, products and internal reporting patterns have

Talk About It
According to Kilman, organ­izations themselves have “an invisible quality—­a certain 
style, a character, a way of ­doing ­things—­that may be more power­ful than the dictates of 
any one person or any formal system. To understand the soul of the organ­ization requires 
that we travel below the charts, rule books, machines, and buildings into the underground 
world of corporate cultures.”28
Think about an organ­ization you know well, ­either a library or another type of organ­
ization, and try to tease out the vari­ous ele­ments of its orga­nizational culture. Can you 
identify its symbols, special language, heroes, slogans, myths, or ceremonies? Would 
you say that this organ­ization has a weak or a strong orga­nizational culture?
resulted in a culture that is dif­fer­ent from the one found at Google. In a similar 
fashion, the corporate cultures of Amazon, Cisco, and Microsoft are also all 
dif­fer­ent ­because they are reflections of distinct parent organ­izations.
Libraries also have their own orga­nizational cultures, and they may vary 
widely. For instance, in some, the employees dress in a professional manner, 
while in ­others, employees dress much more casually. In some libraries, the 
workers tend to socialize a ­great deal while off the job, whereas ­others man­
ifest ­little interaction outside of work hours. In some libraries, the director 
is addressed formally, using a title, such as Dr. Brown or Ms. Smith. In other 
libraries, every­one is on a first-­name basis. The ways in which workers dress, 
socialize, and interact are just a few facets of orga­nizational culture.
An enterprise’s orga­nizational culture comes from three main sources: 
(1) the beliefs, assumptions, and values of the organ­ization’s found­er; (2) the 
learning experiences of group members as the organ­ization evolves; and 
(3) fresh beliefs, values, and assumptions brought in by new members and 
leaders.27 Of ­these, the primary influence on an organ­ization’s culture is 
usually top management, ­because ­these man­ag­ers have a profound influence 
not only on the tangible aspects of organ­izations, such as structure and tech­
nology, but also ­because they are typically the creators of symbols, ideologies, 
language, beliefs, rituals, and myths.
Orga­nizational culture is composed of many ele­ments. Among the most 
common:
•	 Symbols are objects or acts that convey meaning to ­others. Some 
symbols one can find in libraries are work spaces (traditional offices 
or cubicles), the type of decorations on the wall, and the open or closed 
doors of supervisors’ offices. Terminology is the shared language that 
helps cement an organ­ization’s identity. Library workers use vari­
ous acronyms, such as LC or RDA, that are understood by most 
librarians but by few outsiders.
•	 Group norms are the implicit standards or ways of acting that 
evolve within an organ­ization. For example, at some libraries, all 
staff meetings start exactly on time; at ­others, they tend to start five 
to ten minutes late.
•	 Slogans are phrases or sentences that ostensibly express an organ­
ization’s values. Sometimes ­these slogans are taken from the organ­
ization’s mission statement.

156  Organ­izing
•	 Heroes are the men and ­women who best exemplify the attributes 
of the culture. The experienced reference librarian who always finds 
the right answer and the library director who is able to defend the 
library against proposed bud­get cuts might be held up as heroes 
within their organ­ization.
•	 Myths or stories are the retellings of real or ­imagined events (typ­
ically in the distant past) in the lives of figures associated with the 
organ­ization. ­These stories are told and retold to new employees 
­because they reinforce the organ­ization’s values. Stories about the 
founder or an early leader of the organ­ization are common.
•	 Ceremonies are the rituals that mark a special event. Many librar­
ies have annual ceremonies, such as an employee appreciation din­
ner or a reading of banned books during National Library Week.
All of ­these ele­ments and often many more influence an organ­ization’s 
culture. Furthermore, orga­nizational culture has vari­ous levels, some clearly 
vis­i­ble and some less so. As is seen in figure 7.4, Edgar Schein describes three 
levels of culture: artifacts, espoused values, and shared basic assumptions.
•	 Artifacts are vis­i­ble manifestations of under­lying cultural assump­
tions. ­These might include be­hav­ior patterns, rituals, physical envi­
ronment, stories, and myths. Artifacts are easily discerned and 
relatively easy to understand. For example, some organ­izations’ dress 
codes are artifacts. Schein warns against trying to infer the deeper 
levels of an organ­ization’s culture from the artifacts alone, ­because 
individuals inevitably proj­ect their own feelings and reactions onto 
a given situation. For example, if an individual sees a very informal 
organ­ization, he or she may interpret that casualness as inefficiency—
if that individual’s own assumptions include the idea that informal­
ity means a less serious attitude ­toward work.
•	 Espoused values are the shared values of the organ­ization. For 
example, many libraries have mission statements that tell employ­
ees and patrons what the library seeks to accomplish. Codes such as 
the ALA Code of Ethics could be considered to be part of a library’s 
espoused values. ­These values reflect the organ­ization’s beliefs and 
provide a framework to guide its members’ actions.
•	 Basic assumptions are the invisible but identifiable reasons that 
group members perceive, think, and feel the way they do about cer­
tain issues. ­These basic assumptions can be so deeply held within a 
group that its members ­will find be­hav­ior based on any other prem­
ise inconceivable. They are so fundamental that they are likely to be 
neither confronted nor debated, and thus they are extremely diffi­
cult to change. ­These assumptions often deal with “fundamental 
aspects of life—­the nature of time and space; ­human nature and 
­human activities; the nature of truth and how one discovers it; the 
correct way for the individual and the group to relate to each other; 
the relative importance of work, ­family, and self-­development; the 
proper role of men and ­women; and the nature of the ­family.”29
Schein argues that the web of basic under­lying assumptions can act as 
a cognitive defense mechanism for individuals and the group; as a result, cul­
ture change is difficult, time-­consuming, and anxiety provoking. “The bottom 

Organizations and Organizational Culture  157
line for leaders is that if they do not become conscious of the cultures in which 
they are embedded, ­those cultures ­will manage them. Cultural understand­
ing is desirable for all of us, but it is essential to leaders if they are to lead.”30 
Schein stresses the need for se­nior management to focus on basic assump­
tions. Artifacts can be changed and new values articulated, but ­unless the 
basic assumptions are altered, the organ­ization’s culture is likely to stay the 
same.
When corporations run into trou­ble, man­ag­ers often think they need to 
“fix” the culture. For example, when it was discovered that U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs had kept veterans waiting months for critical health 
care, many pundits called for a reform in the culture, which they called a 
corrosive bureaucracy. However, a recent study has suggested that culture 
is not something that you can “fix.” Instead changes in the culture take 
place ­after an organ­ization has made changes in the pro­cesses and struc­
tures that caused the prob­lem in the first place. Culture is an outcome, not 
a cause or a fix.31

Practice Your Skills
Our world is becoming increasingly globalized and librarians often have to work with 
­others from dif­fer­ent cultures. Go to https://­www​.­geert​-­hofstede​.­com​/­geert​-­hofstede​.­html 
and read more about the six cultural dimensions discussed above. First, discuss where 
you think your country of origin falls on ­these six dimensions. Then go to https://­geert​
-­hofstede.com​/­countries​.­html and see if you are correct. Next compare your country of 
origin to another country that you have visited or hope to visit. What are the differences 
in the cultural values between the countries? Imagine you ­were ­going to take a job as a 
man­ag­er in the second country. Do you think you would need to modify your managerial 
style to be successful?
Global Differences in Orga­nizational Culture
Geert Hofstede, a Dutch scholar, studied national differences in orga­
nizational be­hav­ior. He identified six cultural aspects that embody national 
and regional differences. ­These characteristics are:
•	 Power distance: the degree to which a society accepts in­equality 
in its ­people’s levels of power.
•	 Uncertainty avoidance: the extent to which a society seeks to min­
imize uncertainty and risk.
•	 Individualism versus collectivism: ­whether ­people are expected 
to act primarily as individuals or as members of a group.
•	 Masculinity versus femininity: the value that society places on 
ste­reo­typical male or female values, for example, the idea that ­women 
are modest and caring whereas men are assertive and competitive.
•	 Long-­term versus short-­term orientation: ­whether the society 
attaches more importance to the ­future than to the past and pres­ent.
•	 Indulgence versus restraint: ­whether the society allows relatively 
­free gratification of ­human desires related to enjoying life and hav­
ing fun, or ­whether the society believes in delaying such gratifica­
tion by use of strict social norms.32
To find out more about Hofstede’s cultural differences and to see the scores 
for your own country, go to http://­www.geert​-­hofstede​.­com​/­. In an increas­
ingly global world where organ­izations and individuals commonly work 
with their counter­parts in other countries, it is impor­tant to remember that 
­there are often vast differences between the norms of one country and ­those 
of another and that ­people’s thoughts and actions are deeply influenced by 
­these norms.
Getting to Know the Culture
Among the first ­things that newly hired employees learn at any job is 
“the way ­things are done ­here,” including information about the organ­ization’s 
history, its cast of characters, and its expectations about employee be­hav­ior. 
If the organ­ization’s culture and an employee’s expectations are not a good 

Organizations and Organizational Culture  159
fit, the result is an unhappy employee. In many cases, when this mismatch 
occurs, employees resign from their jobs or are asked to leave ­because they 
cannot conform to the culture. It is impor­tant for prospective employees to 
find out as much as pos­si­ble about the orga­nizational culture before accept­
ing a job.
At the same time, employers also look for a good match when filling posi­
tions. To maintain their orga­nizational culture, they must recruit and hire 
employees who ­will fit into it. Man­ag­ers further reinforce the orga­nizational 
culture by (1) what they pay attention to; (2) the way they react to critical 
incidents and crises; (3) how they allocate rewards; (4) the way they carry 
out role modeling and coaching; (5) their methods for se­lection, promotion, 
and removal; and (6) their vari­ous orga­nizational rites, ceremonies, and sto­
ries.33 If an organ­ization wished to change its inherent culture, it would 
have to restructure all of ­these aspects.
Although the culture of two organ­izations of the same type may be sim­
ilar, each ­will have its own distinctive features. In the world of corporate 
mergers, one of the most difficult hurdles has been bringing together the 
orga­nizational cultures of the two entities. Mergers are less common in the 
not-­for-­profit sector, but even libraries sometimes face the need to merge. In 
cases where academic libraries have merged with university computing cen­
ters, the cultural clash between ­these two types of institutions is often a chal­
lenge. Public libraries that have merged with academic libraries, as in San 
Jose, California, faced a similar task of making two institutions into one.34 The 
same difficulty occurs when autonomous libraries are integrated into a uni­
fied system and must merge the preexisting individual cultures into a unified 
­whole.35 Often it takes longer than expected to merge the institutions, and, 
frequently, the cost savings envisioned in the merger do not materialize.36
Obviously, changing an organ­ization’s culture is difficult, ­because usually 
it is deeply ingrained in all of the individuals who work ­there. Orga­nizational 
culture is a cause of inflexibility in organ­izations. Employees resist change 
­because they have “always done it this way.” However, some organ­izations, 
such as ­Toyota, have intentionally ­shaped a corporate culture that welcomes 
change.37 Research has shown that the most successful organ­izations not only 
have strong cultures, but they also have adaptive ones. The learning organ­
izations described in chapter 2 usually display adaptive cultures. Employees 
in learning organ­izations are rewarded for questioning the status quo and the 
current way of ­doing ­things. Such an organ­ization values change and risk-­
taking, an approach that most experts expect to be crucial for the success 
of tomorrow’s organ­izations. They must be able to adapt when cultural values 
that have worked in the past become outdated. Ironically, the most successful 
organ­izations are sometimes the most resistant to change; their past successes 
have convinced them that their ways are the correct ones. As a result, they 
are less responsive to their constituencies and unwilling to take risks. This 
re­sis­tance to change allows new rivals to gain ground on them and begin to 
take away their market share.
The traditional library orga­nizational structure has worked well in the 
past, but librarians now face increasing competition as they continue the 
transition from paper-­based to digitally based collections. It is easier to cling 
to the tried and true than to make changes, especially when none of the new 
models has been shown to be a reliable replacement. Yet if libraries are to 
endure into the ­future, their man­ag­ers must experiment with changes in 
their organ­ization and their culture. As Philip Evans and Thomas Wurster 
state, “The paralysis of the leading incumbent is the greatest competitive 
advantage enjoyed by new competitors. It is an advantage they often do not 

160  Organ­izing
deserve, since if the incumbent would only fight all-­out by the new rules, the 
incumbent would often win.”38 However, it is very difficult to give up the 
­things that organ­izations have done well over the years, practices based on 
­those “core competencies that ­were built over de­cades, the object of personal 
and collective pride and identity.”39
What ­will happen if libraries do not change? Commercial enterprises 
that fail to track changing customer expectations or that make a product that 
no longer sells ­will eventually go out of business. Libraries ­will not go out of 
existence, at least not in the near ­future. Nevertheless, they may well be 
gradually supplanted by competing information providers. If individuals can 
go elsewhere for what they need and get the information quickly and easily, 
they may have ­little use for libraries that continue to depend on old models, 
for example, providing assistance only at desks physically located within 
library buildings. Librarians must seek a new competitive advantage, mov­
ing from the need to survive to something better, ­unless they wish to be left 
with responsibilities for low-­margin ser­vices that no one ­else (including ­those 
in the for-­profit world) wants to provide.40 The USPS, whose pres­ent precari­
ous position was described earlier, serves as an example of what can happen 
when an organ­ization allows this to happen.
Libraries have a long and respected history and have had past success 
in making successful adaptions, including weathering the impact of the 
Gutenberg revolution when libraries made the transition from manuscript 
to print collections. ­These past changes have allowed the orga­nizational type 
known as libraries to survive for centuries; in fact, they are among the old­
est types of organ­izations in existence. However, it is evident that libraries 
­will need to continue to evolve if they are to maintain a place in the new infor­
mation ecosystem. For libraries to continue to flourish, librarians must do 
more than rest on their laurels. They must make changes. Library man­ag­
ers currently face enormous challenges in trying to or­ga­nize libraries to meet 
the demands of tomorrow. They must develop a mind-­set that welcomes 
change, and welcoming change is far easier to accept in theory than in ­actual 
practice. Librarians’ experiments with dif­fer­ent orga­nizational structures 
and modifications in the orga­nizational culture must continue. If librarians 
are not willing to deconstruct their own organ­izations and make ­these 
changes, someone ­else ­will force the changes upon them.
Conclusion
This chapter has provided an overview of organ­izations and their cul­
tures. Chapter 8 ­will cover the methods that organ­izations use to specialize 
and coordinate. Chapter 9 ­will look at the most common orga­nizational struc­
tures being used by ­today’s libraries and explore how some libraries are 
beginning to restructure.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	While still in high school, Steve Jobs met fellow computer buff Steve Wozniak 
who had graduated from the same high school a few years before. The first Apple 
computers ­were built in 1976 in the Cupertino, California, garage belonging to 
Steve Jobs’s parents. The two Steves built 50 computer boards and sold them 

Organizations and Organizational Culture  161
through a local dealer. The Apple II computer was introduced two years ­later. 
Sales began to skyrocket. When Apple went public in 1980, sales hit the billion-­
dollar mark. The two young entrepreneurs became instant multimillionaires. 
Apple was intended to be a new type of com­pany in which the old corporate rules 
­were scrapped. ­There would be no dress codes, no formal meetings—­nothing 
to get in the way of what ­really mattered: creating computers that, Apple prom­
ised, would change the world. As demand for the products increased and more 
employees ­were hired, however, seasoned man­ag­ers ­were needed to ­handle the 
organ­ization’s rapid growth. Soon friction developed between the two cofound­ers 
and the new management, and by 1985 neither Jobs41 nor Wozniak was associ­
ated with Apple.42
New start-up organ­izations often flourish ­under creative and charismatic 
leaders who have both an understanding and a passion for the technology under­
lying their success. However, as organ­izations grow, they need chief executives 
with a dif­fer­ent set of skills, including the ability to delegate and to operate in 
a highly structured setting. If you ­were hired as a con­sul­tant to a fast-­growing 
new organ­ization and asked to provide management advice, what would you sug­
gest? Is it pos­si­ble to keep the same type of orga­nizational structure and culture 
in a larger organ­ization as was pres­ent in a smaller one? Must orga­nizational 
cultures marked by creativity and informality necessarily become more formal 
and structured?
2.	The academic library at Madison College, with a collection of 400,000 volumes, 
serves 150 faculty members and 3,000 students. The library has a director and 
two assistant directors and is divided into six departments, each with its own 
department head. The work atmosphere is fairly formal; the director is always 
addressed as Dr. Gossman, and all of the other administrators are addressed 
using their titles. Most of the librarians wear business attire. Meanwhile, the 
academic library at nearby Monroe College has a collection of about the same 
size and serves approximately the same number of students and faculty but is 
very dif­fer­ent. Rather than maintain established departments, the library direc­
tor interacts closely with the other employees in a team-­based approach. As a 
result, this library feels much more casual. All employees are on a first-­name 
basis, and all dress informally, often wearing jeans.
Superficially, ­these two libraries resemble each other in size and purpose. 
How do they differ in orga­nizational structures and cultures? Would you prefer 
to work in one of ­these libraries more than the other? If so, why?
3.	“Library reorganizations done in a top-­down manner, even with the best of 
intentions, ­will reflect only administrative priorities ­because their tools can 
only be used to strengthen their position. Reorganizations done solely for admin­
istrative prerogatives necessarily must exclude, suppress, and obscure counter-­
truths, thus treating the provisional motivations of administrative action as 
permanent realities. For real innovation to occur, new tools must be found by 
reaching into the minds, perspectives, and motivations of the stakeholders—­
librarians, staff, students, and patrons—in the reor­ga­ni­za­tion.”43
Do you agree with Steve Staninger that top-­down reorganizations are rarely 
successful? Choose a par­tic­u­lar type of library and imagine that you are in 
charge of reor­ga­niz­ing an out-­of-­date structure? How would you go about the 
pro­cess?

Discussion Questions
1.	Johansen and Swigart describe the chaotic feeling that results from working 
inside an organ­ization that is in the midst of restructuring:
Business organ­izations are changing, ­whether they want to or not. 
The changes are chaotic—­the experience from inside or close to a large 
corporation, as well as the feeling inside your stomach. The pyramids of 
corporate strength have flattened into a web of orga­nizational ambiguity. 
Individual employees no longer have a sturdy structure to climb. Instead, 
planning a ­career is more like crawling out on a webbing of rope, grasp­
ing for stability that comes and goes quickly.44
What can man­ag­ers do to help make the experience less chaotic? Does orga­
nizational change always have to be threatening?
2.	Dess et al. wrote, “Orga­nizational structure has traditionally been viewed as 
layers of boxes neatly stacked atop one another, connected by solid and dashed 
lines. This view focused our attention on hierarchy, reporting relationships, 
division of ­labor, and accountability. The new corporate architecture requires a 
dif­fer­ent mindset: the emphasis is on results rather than maintaining internal 
relationships.”45
Why ­doesn’t the traditional way of viewing organ­ization structure work in 
­today’s new environment?
3.	 Rosabeth Moss Kanter recently commented, “Orga­nizational structures that 
allow divisions and departments to own their turf and ­people with long tenure 
to take root creates the same hardened group distinctions as Congressional 
redistricting to produce homogeneous voting blocs—­all of which makes it eas­
ier to resist compromise, let alone collaboration.”46
It is difficult for organ­izations to change their structures, but as Kanter 
points out not ­doing so can pres­ent prob­lems. Have you ever worked in an 
organ­ization that was territorial and divisive? How can a rigid orga­nizational 
structure lead to inflexibility and conflict?
4.	Orga­nizational culture has many ele­ments, including “heroes” and “stories and 
myths.” Think about an organ­ization with which you are familiar. Does that 
organ­ization have heroes and myths, and, if so, why ­were they impor­tant to that 
organ­ization?

The Fundamentals of 
Organ­ization: Specialization 
and Coordination
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the importance of both specialization and coordination within an 
organ­ization
•	 Know the differences between vertical and horizontal specialization
•	 Be able to discuss the seven methods used to create departments in libraries
•	 Be familiar with the differences in decision making in centralized and decen­
tralized organ­izations
•	 Be able to explain the importance of del­e­ga­tion within an organ­ization
•	 Be able to discuss why ­there is no one “optimal” orga­nizational structure for 
libraries
All organ­izations require some sort of structure. Orga­nizational structure 
is the mechanism used to divide all the necessary tasks among the organ­
ization’s employees and to guarantee that employees perform ­those tasks in 
the right order and at the right time. As organ­izations grow, they necessar­
ily get more complex, so the need to structure becomes more critical.
Consider, for example, the United States Library of Congress, the largest 
library in the world. It was established in 1800 with an appropriation of $5,000. 
The library’s first collection consisted of 740 books and three maps; its first 
librarian did double duty as clerk of the House of Representatives.1 A library 

166  Organ­izing
of that size with a part-­time librarian had ­little need for orga­nizational 
structure ­because its one employee performed all the tasks. ­Today the Library 
of Congress has a collection of more than 162 million items including more 
than 38.6 million books in 470 languages, more than 70 million manuscripts 
and the world’s largest collections of ­legal material, films, maps, sound record­
ings, and sheet ­music.2 With more than 3,000 permanent full-­time employ­
ees, the library requires an elaborate orga­nizational framework, one that not 
only allows its workers to specialize in their tasks but also enables its man­
ag­ers to coordinate the output of all ­these vari­ous departments.3
The larger the organ­ization, the more elaborate its operational structure 
­will be. As was discussed in chapter 7, small enterprises with only a few work­
ers can have very ­simple orga­nizational structures. Larger organ­izations, 
however, all need more substantial structures, involving specialization (divid­
ing all the work into distinct tasks for vari­ous individuals or departments) 
and coordination (making sure all tasks are accomplished in the proper 
sequence) in order to align the organ­ization’s resources with its strategic 
objectives.
This chapter ­will cover some key concepts in the managerial function 
of organ­ization, examining the ways in which the tasks performed in an 
establishment are subdivided (specialization) as well as the ways in which 
they are brought back together (coordination). The discussion ­will cover such 
ele­ments of organ­ization as span of control, del­e­ga­tion, power and authority, 
unity of command, and line and staff designations. It ­will also examine the 
advantages and disadvantages of centralized and decentralized orga­nizational 
structures.
Management on the Job: Reor­ga­ni­za­tion of 
the University of Kansas Library
Libraries of all types are experimenting with modifying long-­standing orga­nizational 
structures to better meet the needs of their users. ­There is no one standard approach 
to ­these reorganizations as each library attempts to restructure its organ­ization in 
response to the needs of a par­tic­u­lar institution, environment, and group of users. A good 
example of this restructuring is provided by the University of Kansas (KU), which 
recently began a pro­cess of rethinking the entire orga­nizational structure of its library.4 
Although the new orga­nizational structure had not been completely implemented at 
the time a recent report was written, the pro­cess undertaken by KU provides a useful 
model for any library thinking about reor­ga­niz­ing; many of the challenges that arise 
as part of any restructuring ­were confronted by ­these librarians as part of their major 
reor­ga­ni­za­tion effort.
Although the KU librarians had previously been engaged in a number of smaller 
initiatives to update their structure, in 2012 they began an attempt to “rethink the 
entire library organ­ization—­from the bottom up and from the top down.” The librarians 
at KU recognized that the changes that have occurred in higher education and scholarly 
communication have created “stresses on library orga­nizational structures that are 
typically constructed around well-­defined, standardized functions, not designed for rapid 
change, reconfiguration, or easy adoption of new roles.”5
For the first phase of the reor­ga­ni­za­tion the library used con­sul­tants who identi­
fied some of the shortcoming of the existing structure. The con­sul­tants recommended 
that the library begin a pro­cess of assessing its structure, leadership, and collaborative 
pro­cesses and further recommended the elimination of orga­nizational “silos” that created 

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  167
Specialization
Specialization is a concept that has been practiced in organ­izations at 
least since the publication of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations in 1776. 
Smith believed that a nation’s wealth could be increased if organ­izations 
directed their workers to specialize. Instead of having one individual exe­
cute an entire job, each job is broken up into its component parts, with each 
part of the job handled by a dif­fer­ent individual. Smith described one fac­
tory in which pins ­were produced. In this factory, 10 workers ­were able to 
produce as many as 48,000 pins a day ­because the task of making a pin had 
been subdivided into a series of smaller tasks, such as straightening the wire 
and cutting it. If each worker had been making the ­whole pin alone, that indi­
vidual could have produced only about 20 pins a day.8 By having individual 
workers specialize in specific parts of the tasks of the entire enterprise, work­
ers become expert in their par­tic­u­lar area and overall efficiency is greatly 
increased.
As a first step in structuring an organ­ization, attention is paid to special­
ization. To implement specialization, an organ­ization divides the necessary 
tasks along two dimensions, horizontal and vertical. Horizontal specialization 
results in the creation of vari­ous departments, with the employees in each 
performing specific tasks. Vertical differentiation, as the term suggests, uti­
lizes a hierarchy as a means of assigning authority, power, accountability, 
and responsibility within the organ­ization.
To structure an organ­ization horizontally, man­ag­ers begin by identifying 
all necessary tasks and then grouping similar or related ones into subunits 
in a logical fashion. Some of the blocks of tasks ­will be of primary importance 
to the organ­ization; ­others ­will be secondary. The man­ag­er must decide on 
the proper relationship among the blocks, determining which ones should be 
put together or separated.
Although it is difficult to identify ­every task needed to be performed, 
according to Peter Drucker, it is more impor­tant to identify an organ­ization’s 
key tasks than to attempt to identify all its tasks. Drucker proposes that 
impediments for communication and collaboration and the establishment of “cross-­cutting 
work systems focused on end-­to-­end pro­cesses that deliver valued output for [their] cus­
tomers.”6 The remaining steps of the reor­ga­ni­za­tion review ­were handled in-­house 
primarily by the library’s Orga­nizational Review Team (ORT), a representative group 
that was established to purposefully include all levels of staff to maximize the knowl­
edge and expertise of the team.
The library abandoned many of the methods it had used in the past to specialize 
and coordinate. New departments and divisions ­were established. Changes in the admin­
istrative structure ­were recommended, and the library moved ­towards a more team-­based 
structure. New methods to improve cooperation and collaboration ­were implemented.7 
Although the report was written before the implementation of the final decisions about 
the reor­ga­ni­za­tion, the structure of the KU library has already been greatly modified. 
As a result, it ­will better meet the needs of its pres­ent users, and ­because the new struc­
ture was designed to be more flexible and agile, it ­will be able to better adapt to ­future 
needs.
In what ways could this new orga­nizational structure be more responsive to the 
needs of the library’s users? What advantages and disadvantages do you think are 
associated with the KU Library’s approach to reor­ga­ni­za­tion?

168  Organ­izing
Practice Your Skills
Think about a library or another organ­ization that you know well. In that organ­ization, 
what are the key tasks that are essential to that organ­ization? Using Drucker’s frame­
work, in what areas is excellence required to achieve the organ­ization’s objectives and 
where would poor per­for­mance most affect the results?
someone designing an orga­nizational structure start with the following two 
questions:
1.	 In what areas is excellence required in order to achieve the organ­
ization’s objectives?
2.	 In what areas would poor per­for­mance endanger the results, if not 
the survival, of the enterprise?
He recommends, in short, that organizers identify the tasks that are crit­
ical to the success of the organ­ization and build on that basis.9
Similarly, other management experts urge man­ag­ers in organ­izations 
considering reor­ga­ni­za­tion to ask themselves, “What business are we in?” 
­These experts point to the plight of U.S. railroad companies, which almost 
became extinct ­because they thought they ­were in the train business instead 
of the transportation business.10 The lesson to be drawn from the railroads 
is that organ­izations that want to succeed should never define themselves 
by what they produce but should always orient themselves to current cus­
tomer needs.
Pitney Bowes provides a good example of a corporation that became more 
successful by reenvisioning its purpose. Founded over 90 years ago, Pitney 
Bowes lost its mono­poly on postage meters and suffered financial difficulties 
­until its executives conceptualized its mission more broadly. The com­pany 
now describes its mission as “helping our clients navigate the complex world 
of commerce. We provide data so businesses can market to their best cus­
tomers. We enable the sending of parcels and packages across the globe. And, 
we secure payments through statements and invoices to keep our clients mov­
ing forward.”11 By rethinking its mission and expanding into new areas, the 
corporation soon returned to profitability.
Although Pitney Bowes was successful in adapting to change, it is easy 
to think of other organ­izations or ­whole sectors of organ­izations that no lon­
ger exist ­because the environment in which they operated changed and they 
did not. The daily newspaper is an example of an industry in the modern 
world that is threatened by changes in its environment. In the United States 
alone, hundreds of newspapers have gone out of business since the beginning 
of the 21st ­century. The newspaper industry is making many attempts to 
make its product relevant in the new digital age, but its ­future remains 
uncertain. Print journalism is a legacy media industry in a world rapidly 
moving into a digital age. ­There has been a steep and continuous decrease in 
the amount of advertising newspapers can attract, which has resulted in the 
remaining newspapers trying to decrease costs while they are attempting to 
establish new revenue streams. The challenge that all legacy newspapers 
face is how to reconfigure their product to meet the expectations of ­today’s 
audiences who prefer digital instead of paper access to news.12

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  169
In a similar fashion, libraries have also had to reexamine their place in 
the digital world. Librarians now consider themselves to be in the informa­
tion business (rather than just in the book or printed-­material business) and 
are adapting to make changes in their organ­izations that ­will make them 
relevant to users of ­today and tomorrow. However, it is tremendously diffi­
cult to change preexisting mindsets, and it is often hard to be objective when 
one is very close to a situation. All of the individuals working in libraries 
­today are bound to some extent by their past experiences, and thus it is chal­
lenging for them to envision a vastly dif­fer­ent “library” of the 21st ­century. 
As much as pos­si­ble ­these workers should try to set aside the model of the 
library organ­ization they are familiar with and think about the needs of 
­future users. What should the library of tomorrow look like? What ser­vices 
should be provided and what values should be preserved? This pro­cess ­will 
help facilitate the structural changes needed to allow libraries to be success­
ful in performing a new and expanded mission.
Parts of an Organ­ization
Designing an organ­ization is similar to building a ­house. Although 
­houses may have many types of architecture, ranging from traditional colo­
nial to modern con­temporary, and although they may range in size from 
small cottages to large mansions, almost all ­houses share common charac­
teristics. They all have a foundation, a roof, certain essential rooms, and ways 
to provide such ser­vices as electricity and ­water. Organ­izations are designed 
in a similar fashion. They have a fairly standard set of building blocks that 
must be assembled into a structure. Of course, the types and number of blocks 
­will vary with the size and the kind of institution, and the pieces can be 
put together in many dif­fer­ent ways. Man­ag­ers attempting to or­ga­nize (or 
reor­ga­nize) are, meta­phor­ically speaking, the architects of the structure; they 
are shaping the orga­nizational space to meet the needs and aspirations of the 
enterprise.
The princi­ple of “form follows function” is one that has been long associ­
ated with modern architecture.13 In architecture, this princi­ple means that 
the shape of a structure should be based on its intended purpose. The same 
princi­ple should be employed by man­ag­ers when they are organ­izing or reor­
ga­niz­ing. They should focus on the objectives the organ­ization is trying to 
achieve and structure the organ­ization accordingly.
­There are many ways that the basic ele­ments of organ­izing can be cat­
egorized. One of the most commonly used frameworks was provided by Henry 
Mintzberg, a Canadian management expert, who categorized the six basic 
ele­ments of organ­izations as:
•	 A strategic apex, which consists of the organ­ization’s top manage­
ment responsible for the overall functioning of the organ­ization;
•	 The operating core, made up of the workers who carry out the mis­
sion of the organ­ization;
•	 The ­middle line, the cadre of midlevel man­ag­ers who coordinate 
the activities of the vari­ous units. One of midlevel man­ag­ers’ primary 
functions is to transmit information to and from the operating core 
to the top-­level man­ag­ers in the strategic apex;
•	 The technostructure, comprising ­those units that provide the 
organ­ization with technical expertise;

170  Organ­izing
•	 The support staff, workers who provide expertise in areas such as 
marketing or ­human relations;
•	 The ideology, which is the halo of beliefs, traditions; norms, and val­
ues that make up the culture of the organ­ization.14 ­These six compo­
nents are illustrated in figure 8.1.
In a large library, the director and the assistant and associate directors 
comprise the strategic apex. The heads of the vari­ous departments make up 
the ­middle line. Employees in units such as library systems make up the 
technostructure, whereas employees in units such as personnel and public 
relations constitute the support staff. The largest group, the operating core, 
consists of the employees who work in areas such as circulation and refer­
ence. They are the ones carry­ing out the organ­ization’s mission of linking 
­people to information. The organ­ization’s ideology surrounds the other ele­
ments. Although some small organ­izations do not contain all of Mintzberg’s 
categories, most larger ones do. The relative size and importance of each com­
ponent varies according to ­factors such as the age and size of the organ­
ization, and the type and complexity of its endeavors.
Methods of Departmentalization
One of the basic components of organ­ization is the division of tasks that 
need to be performed. The division of tasks on a horizontal basis typically 
results in the establishment of vari­ous departments with the employees 
in each department assigned to a dif­fer­ent subset of the overall set of tasks

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  171
that need to be performed. Organ­izations have traditionally established 
their departments using five methods: by function, by territory, by product, 
by customer, and by pro­cess. Librarians have developed two additional ways 
of creating departments: by subject and by the form of resources. Librar­
ies not only use all ­these methods but frequently combine them, producing 
hybrid methods of departmentalization. Despite many new approaches to 
orga­nizational structure, ­these seven methods still serve as the primary 
approach for establishing an organ­ization’s subdivisions and each ­will be 
discussed briefly.
Function
In business, the most common orga­nizational design is the functional 
structure. For instance, a furniture manufacturer would need to have depart­
ments dealing with functions such as production, marketing, sales, and 
accounting. In libraries, too, this method of departmentalization is wide­
spread, with vari­ous departments specializing in the functions of circulation, 
reference, acquisition, cata­loging, and management.
Functional design has many advantages. It brings together specialists 
with similar backgrounds and interests, allowing for further specialization 
within each function. For instance, a library with a large number of area stud­
ies collections might have a cata­loging department with both a Slavic and 
an East Asian cata­loger.
Overall, the functional design appears to work best in organ­izations 
that do not need close collaboration among departments ­because this type 
of design may result in the creation of functional “silos,” that is, units within 
an organ­ization that are self-­contained and do not communicate with each 
other. Not only is ­there ­little communication, ­there may be a ­great deal of 
competition. As Steven Romero commented, “The leaders managing ­these 
functional silos worked hard to get where they are and the groups define their 
existence in the enterprise. They devote themselves to the success of their 
team and they protect their turf like junkyard dogs.”15
This competition among departments often results in competition for 
resources or clashes over procedures. In some libraries, the reference and 
cata­loging departments may disagree about the proper classification or sub­
ject headings for a par­tic­u­lar book. Frequently, workers assigned to a single 
functional department may lose sight of the larger organ­ization’s end prod­
uct, especially when the workers have ­little contact with the product’s end 
users. Although the functional method of departmentalization is commonly 
used, man­ag­ers must be sure it does not create an obstacle to interdepart­
mental communication and collaboration.
Territory
When an organ­ization operates throughout a wide geographic area, its 
top management frequently groups activities on the basis of territory and 
places each geographic area’s activities ­under the direction of a dif­fer­ent 
man­ag­er. Multinational organ­izations, for example, ­will have divisions to 
deal with specific parts of the world, such as North Amer­i­ca, South Amer­
i­ca, or Eu­rope. This structure enables the organ­ization to adapt to local sit­
uations pertaining to the ­labor market, the area’s needs and prob­lems, and 
on-­site production issues.
Although libraries do not face the multinational challenges of large 
corporations, librarians often rely on this princi­ple of territory or area in 

172  Organ­izing
structuring their organ­izations. Public librarians have always concerned 
themselves with the location of their central fa­cil­i­ty and the areas served by 
branch libraries, bookmobiles, and storefront libraries. Academic librari­
ans place branches (such as a science library, an architecture library, or an 
education library) in close proximity to the location of a par­tic­u­lar clientele. 
School systems usually have school libraries in individual schools through­
out their districts, and students typically attend the school that is nearest 
to their homes.
For libraries, the primary advantage of this type of organ­ization is that 
locating individual units in close proximity to the targeted users is not only 
con­ve­nient for the user but also allows librarians to become familiar with 
user needs and offer better ser­vice. Territorial organ­ization also provides a 
platform for managerial training. Branch man­ag­ers who oversee a geo­graph­
i­cally separate unit with relative autonomy gain valuable managerial expe­
rience and are often promoted to a higher position within an organ­ization.
The biggest disadvantage of territorial organ­ization is that like functional 
organ­ization, it often hampers orga­nizational coordination and communica­
tion. In addition, rivalries often crop up among the dif­fer­ent divisions. Fi­nally, 
territorial organ­ization can lead to duplication of effort or resources.
Librarians have long disagreed about how much geographic centraliza­
tion is optimal. Administrators tend to ­favor a more centralized structure 
­because it allows for tight control and certain bud­getary advantages. Users 
typically prefer a more decentralized system, which offers greater con­ve­
nience and more personalized ser­vice (although this decentralizing often 
provides prob­lems to users working in interdisciplinary areas).
In an attempt to better meet the needs of users in remote locations, many 
libraries for at least the past de­cade have “embedded” librarians in specific 
locations to provide library ser­vices to ­those users. Although for centuries 
librarians ­were defined as individuals who worked in libraries, in ­today’s dig­
ital age that definition is changing as users no longer have to come to a 
physical location to use the library materials. Embedding librarians within 
specific departments, divisions, or groups allows ­those librarians to build the 
type of relationships and provide the ser­vices once associated with branch 
libraries but without many of the expenses associated with maintaining mul­
tiple branch libraries. The practice of embedded librarianship has been 
employed primarily by academic and health science libraries, but other types 
of libraries including public and law libraries have also experimented with 
this structure.16 Embedded librarianship provides an in­ter­est­ing example of 
the use of a type of specialization that has been redesigned to meet the needs 
of ­today’s library users.
Some of the arguments against territorial decentralization have been 
weakened with the increasing prevalence of digitization of library material. 
The use of new methods of document storage and retrieval such as online 
cata­logs and electronic access to reference materials and full-­text journals 
and books has eliminated the need to purchase duplicate copies of material 
for branch locations. However, it is undoubtedly more eco­nom­ical for any 
library to have only one central location than to provide material and ser­
vices at many dispersed locations. A recent study has shown a growing num­
ber of large academic libraries are closing branch or departmental libraries, 
especially science libraries ­because the digitization of the journal lit­er­a­ture 
has decreased the need for a maintaining a collection of print resources in 
proximity to users.17 The utility of branch libraries has been debated for 
de­cades, and libraries are still grappling with the best approach to territo­
rial organ­ization.

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  173
Product
Large profit-­making corporations that are involved in diverse lines of 
business find specialization by product to be particularly useful. Creating 
subdivisions based on individual product lines gives a man­ag­er complete con­
trol over every­thing related to that product line, including profitability. For 
instance, Proctor and ­Gamble is a large U.S. consumer product com­pany 
based in Cincinnati, Ohio, with sales of almost $70 billion in 2016. This 
com­pany’s brands include Tide, Crest, Bounty, Gillette and Olay, and the 
com­pany is or­ga­nized into 10 product categories: Baby Care, Feminine Care, 
­Family Care, Grooming, Oral Care, Personal Health Care, Hair Care, Skin 
and Personal Care, Fabric Care and Home Care.18
­Because libraries do not produce a diverse array of products, librarians 
rarely adopt a product-­based orga­nizational structure. Although the output 
of a library’s print shop (such as a bibliography or a brochure) or systems office 
(such as the library’s Web site) might be considered a product, such products 
are never the main focus of the library’s overall operation.
Customer
Businesses, especially retailers, commonly adopt this structure. Depart­
ment stores have ­children’s, men’s, and pe­tite departments to cater to spe­
cific, clearly defined customer groups. Librarians often use the same structure 
as well. Since the late 1800s, specialized ­children’s departments have been 
among the most-­used sections in public libraries. Librarians in public librar­
ies have also targeted other customer groups such as young adults or business 
users. Academic librarians use this structure when establishing special­
ized libraries for undergraduate student use.
Talk About It
Some academic libraries have experimented with embedding librarians within courses 
instead of locating them in remote sites as in the examples described above. ­These 
librarians are commonly embedded in online courses to provide help for students, situ­
ated themselves perhaps in remote locations; however, librarians can also be embedded 
in courses taught face to face. Typically, the embedded librarian is part of the learning 
management system, for instance, Blackboard, Moodle, or Sakai. ­These librarians pub­
licize their ser­vices to the students in the class and then provide help by answering 
questions, assisting with research proj­ects, or even providing library instruction for 
students in the class.
As more institutions of higher education provide increasing numbers of courses 
and ­whole degree programs online, embedding a librarian in a course is a way to ensure 
that online students receive the same library support as on-­campus students. It also 
pres­ents a new way of departmentalization in terms of orga­nizational structure. This 
chapter has provided seven methods used by libraries to permit specialization of work. 
When librarians are embedded within courses, what method (or methods) of departmen­
talization is being used? Do you think that this model of departmentalization might 
become increasingly prevalent as digital information and technology become ubiqui­
tous? How are other organ­izations that once relied on customers coming to a place but 
now have a large online presence using “embedded” specialists to help ­those customers? 
Is ­there anything that librarians could learn from organ­izations such online retailers?

174  Organ­izing
The advantage of this approach is that it allows individual libraries to 
meet the special and widely varying needs of users. Its disadvantages are 
similar to ­those of functional or territorial departmentalization. Coordina­
tion among departments is often difficult, and departments may end up com­
peting, especially for resources. In addition, when bud­gets get tight, ser­vices 
to some groups may be eliminated. For example, some public librarians have 
eliminated their young adult departments. A number of universities have 
closed their undergraduate libraries ­because administrators believed that 
undergraduates could be better served by the main library.
Pro­cess
The process-­based structure results when an organ­ization subdivides its 
workers according to activity or pro­cess. A pro­cess is defined as “a set or col­
lection of activities that takes more than one kind of input and that, taken 
together, produce a result of value to the customer.”19 Unlike the functional 
structure described earlier, the process-­based structure looks not only at the 
activities being performed in an organ­ization but also at how ­these activi­
ties interact with one another and the customer. Pro­cesses typically have: 
(1) customers, ­either internal or external, and (2) usually cross departmen­
tal bound­aries, ­because they are executed by more than one orga­nizational 
subdivision. So, to reiterate, a pro­cess is neither a function nor a department, 
but a series of activities that result in an output that is of value to a customer. 
Obviously such a structure works only if man­ag­ers have a clear understanding 
of how the vari­ous pro­cesses interrelate.
­Because many of the pro­cesses in libraries are split among several func­
tional divisions, organ­izing by function instead of by pro­cess often leads to 
fragmentation and low customer satisfaction, ­because no single department 
owns the entire pro­cess. Customers are not interested in the pro­cess itself but 
in the output, as a result, anytime an organ­ization can be designed around 
pro­cess, it should lead to greater customer satisfaction.20
Consider the common library pro­cess of getting books to users. That pro­
cess typically is split across several departments, including collection devel­
opment, acquisitions, cata­loging, and so forth. The pro­cess could be slowed 
at any time ­because it not the responsibility of one unit but instead is divided 
among many.
Improving pro­cesses usually gives the organ­ization a competitive advan­
tage. Michael Porter and Victor Millar suggest analyzing pro­cesses by 
focusing on the so-­called value chain.21 A value chain is comprised of the full 
range of activities that an organ­ization has to perform to bring a product or 
ser­vice to the customer. In a factory that manufactures a product, the chain 
would begin with the raw materials used and then would consist of every­
thing ­else that is done to the product before it is purchased by the customer. 
In a library, one common value chain is that of putting a library book on a 
shelf ready for the user. This value chain consists of selecting the book to be 
purchased, purchasing the book, cata­loging the book, adding the biblio­
graphic rec­ords to a system, putting the bibliographic information on the 
volume, and then actually placing the volume in the appropriate place on the 
shelf. A user seeking that specific volume is not interested in all the func­
tions that took place to get the book on the shelf, but only in the final result. 
An organ­ization that can lower the cost or improve the speed or accuracy of 
arriving at that final result ­will have a competitive advantage over one that 
cannot.

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  175
Talk About It
Barbara Fister has commented on the difficulties that may arise when library man­ag­ers 
“perpetuate the notion that an organ­ization is a structure made of positions assembled 
like Tinker Toys, and the ­people in them are parts that are popped into place and, if the 
position changes shape, popped out so that a differently-­shaped piece can be inserted.” 
Reor­ga­ni­za­tion often demands that an existing structure be taken apart and reshaped 
into a new one with dif­fer­ent component parts, yet as Fister warns, “library positions 
are not boxed sets of tasks. They are a set of interconnected and flexible responsibilities 
woven together to meet the library’s goals. The tasks involved in meeting ­those respon­
sibilities ­will change constantly. And so ­will the ­people with ­those responsibilities—­
given the opportunity.”25
What are the disadvantages associated with treating an organ­ization as a set of 
Tinker Toys? What should any man­ag­er contemplating reor­ga­ni­za­tion do to keep the 
organ­ization’s employees from feeling as though they are interchangeable parts that 
can be popped in and out of place? When structural reor­ga­ni­za­tion is necessary, how 
can man­ag­ers best help employees adjust to the impending changes?
For organ­izations such as libraries that have traditionally been depart­
mentalized by function, focusing on pro­cesses is difficult. Although process-­
based organ­ization is rare in libraries, a growing number are incorporating 
pro­cess within reor­ga­ni­za­tion of existing departments.22 Reor­ga­ni­za­tion 
based on pro­cess has been especially common in technical ser­vices depart­
ments.23 For example, California State University-­Northridge reor­ga­nized 
its technical ser­vices department and began by making changes in pro­cesses 
that yielded substantive results. ­These librarians streamlined copy cata­
loging procedures and increased productivity by 50 ­percent, with much of 
the time savings coming from discontinuing superfluous verifications between 
the cata­log rec­ord and the item in hand.24 Although few libraries are depart­
mentalized based on pro­cess, team-­ and matrix-­based organ­izations, dis­
cussed in chapter 9, usually incorporate more attention to pro­cess than more 
traditional structures do.
In addition to ­these five conventional ways of establishing departments, 
libraries have or­ga­nized themselves according to two additional aspects: sub­
ject and form of resources.
Subject
Academic and large public libraries rely extensively on the subject 
method of departmentalizing. In academic libraries, subject departments can 
be narrowly focused, for instance, a theatre arts collection, or they can have 
a broad scope, incorporating related subjects into collections based on human­
ities, social sciences, or science.
A subject structure has definite advantages. All materials pertaining 
to a topic have been gathered together, which is con­ve­nient for users. The 
librarians working with ­these materials usually have special training in the 
subject ­matter and can provide more in-­depth reference ser­vice and reader 
guidance. However, the disadvantages include higher costs stemming from 
the necessary duplication of material and the hiring of specialized person­
nel. In addition, each department must be staffed, even when library usage

Arrange to speak with a man­ag­er you know. Discuss with the man­ag­er what type of 
orga­nizational structure his or her organ­ization uses to departmentalize the activities 
that are performed ­there. Why did the organ­ization choose that structure? Do you 
think another structure might be more appropriate? If so, which?
is low. One reference librarian at a central desk might suffice to ­handle all 
inquiries when demand is low, but four subject-­area reference desks require 
four librarians, even if inquiries are few. Meanwhile, although subject depart­
ments are con­ve­nient for users working strictly within one field, users who 
are pursuing interdisciplinary proj­ects must go to many departments for the 
materials they need.
Form of Resources
Many librarians have used format (the form in which information 
resources are issued) as a basis for organ­ization. It is not unusual to find 
separate departments for maps, audiovisuals, periodicals, electronic resources, 
or archives. Many of ­these specialized forms pres­ent their own prob­lems 
in acquisition, storage, ­handling, or organ­ization, so librarians working in 
format-­based departments tend to ­handle all functions for that department’s 
resources, including functions that are normally performed at a central loca­
tion. For instance, a government documents department may be responsible 
for ordering, pro­cessing, providing reference ser­vice for, and circulating all 
government documents. Format-­based departments are most useful when 
patrons wish to work with one par­tic­u­lar type of resource, such as manu­
scripts or archives.
More commonly, however, users seek information about specific topics, 
rather than in certain formats, and may therefore easily miss relevant mate­
rials ­housed in format-­based departments. As digital material replaces printed 
material in libraries, such departments ­will likely become less common.
New Approaches to Horizontal Specialization
The seven methods of departmentalization discussed above are the tra­
ditional ways that libraries have horizontally specialized but new approaches 
to forming departments are beginning to appear. It is fair to say that librar­
ies ­today are in the midst of a period of experimentation about how they 
should be or­ga­nized. The days when a library was a physical collection that 
had to be used within a specific location are gone. Libraries ­today are mov­
ing away from obsolete orga­nizational structures that center around a library 
building and a largely print collection. At pres­ent, however, ­there is no uni­
form model and ­today’s libraries continue to experiment and innovate as they 
attempt to achieve an optimal orga­nizational structure.
As figure 8.2 illustrates, departments in libraries are established in 
vari­ous ways and most combine many of ­these approaches discussed above. 
A large public library, for example, generally has a circulation department 
(function), subject department (which combines several functions), branch 

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  177
libraries (territory), ­children’s ser­vices (customer), business ser­vices (cus­
tomer), government documents collections (form), and several ­others. Only the 
smallest and most specialized rely on a single orga­nizational method.
Consequently, ­there is no one “right” way to establish departments within 
an organ­ization. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and a 
man­ag­er should be aware of both. No ­matter how good an orga­nizational 
structure might be, it ­will not and should not last forever. As institutions 
change, their orga­nizational structures must be reshaped to reflect new 
situations. Organ­izing or reor­ga­niz­ing departments requires man­ag­ers to 
look at the necessary tasks, the ­people who ­will accomplish them, the users or 
customers who are being served, and any pertinent external and environ­
mental ­factors. Although a regular reexamination of structure is an impor­tant 
task for man­ag­ers, they should also remember that employees frequently 
feel threatened by orga­nizational restructuring. Man­ag­ers should be careful 
to communicate any planned changes to employees and attempt to reassure 
them by explaining why the changes are necessary and how their roles might 
change in a new orga­nizational structure.
FIGURE 8.2. Types of Departments Found in Libraries

178  Organ­izing
The Hierarchy
Within the structure of an organ­ization, specialization exists in two 
dimensions. We have just discussed horizontal specialization, the assignment 
of all the orga­nizational tasks to departments and subunits. The vertical 
form of specialization is embodied in the structuring of authority within a 
hierarchical structure.
In an organ­ization, authority can be defined as the degree of discretion 
conferred on an employee that empowers him or her to make decisions and 
issue instructions. When a man­ag­er is assigned to a department or subunit, 
that man­ag­er is then delegated a mea­sure of responsibility and authority by 
his or her superior. This del­e­ga­tion is necessary ­because if man­ag­ers are 
responsible for task completion and employee supervision, they must have 
the authority to arrange ­matters for efficient per­for­mance.
The vertical hierarchy is the mechanism that channels authority from 
top management down to the man­ag­ers of subsidiary units, which enables 
man­ag­ers to coordinate the efforts of many individuals as they perform a 
variety of tasks. The concept of a vertical hierarchy is central to classic orga­
nizational theories, but the lines of authority that flow from top to bottom of 
a hierarchy are not as clear-­cut ­today in an age when an increasing number 
of organ­izations are using teams, encouraging horizontal communication, 
and instituting multiple reporting patterns.
Nonetheless the concept of the vertical structure with authority emanat­
ing from the top down is still an impor­tant one. ­Every organ­ization needs a 
FIGURE 8.3. Vertical and Horizontal Specialization within Libraries

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  179
well-­defined chain of control to achieve its objectives. All subordinates must 
know to whom and for what they are responsible, and the bound­aries of each 
man­ag­er’s authority should be clear. This vertical structure allows authority 
to flow down, one level at a time, from the top to the bottom of the structure. 
This chain of control is referred as the scalar chain or the scalar princi­ple. 
The scalar princi­ple requires that ­there be one ultimate authority located at 
the top of the organ­ization, and that from this apex, lines of authority descend 
to ­every subordinate position. The clearer the line of authority, the more effec­
tive the communication and hence the better the organ­ization ­will perform. 
Henri Fayol, the French management theorist, described the scalar princi­ple 
as “the chain of supervisors ranging from the ultimate authority to the lowest 
ranks. The line of authority is the route followed—­via ­every link in the chain—
by all communications which start from or go to the ultimate authority.”26
As organ­izations order and rank their departments, a vertical (scalar) 
hierarchy develops. This hierarchy may be illustrated as a pyramid, with the 
ultimate authority residing at the peak, and managerial authority fanning 
out as it flows downward. The positions at the top of the pyramid deal with 
broader tasks and responsibilities, ­those at the bottom with more specific 
tasks and responsibilities. To fully understand the vertical hierarchy, it is 
necessary to become familiar with a number of specialized terms that are 
associated with it including authority, power, del­e­ga­tion, centralization, decen­
tralization, unity of command, span of control, and line and staff positions.
Power and Authority
The words power and authority are sometimes used interchangeably, but 
in management ­these two terms are not synonymous. Authority is a super­
visor’s legitimate right to direct subordinate workers and to expect ­those 
subordinates to follow ­those directions to attain the objectives of the organ­
ization. Authority flows down the organ­ization’s vertical chain of command 
and is vested in the position and not in the person holding it. A library direc­
tor has authority to issues ­orders to his or her subordinates, however once 
that director no longer holds that position, he or she no longer has author­
ity in that organ­ization.

The Alexis Group is a medium-­size information consulting com­pany with about 50 employ­
ees. Bob Smith has just been appointed chief executive officer, and ­will be in charge of 
all com­pany operations. Also working at Alexis is Mark Simonds, who oversees all the 
firm’s information technology, and who has a keen sense of what is needed to keep the 
com­pany’s complicated IT system ­running well. Whenever ­there is an IT prob­lem, the 
employees turn to Mark for a solution. Mary Malone, who has worked at Alexis for more 
than 20 years, is Bob Smith’s administrative assistant. She decides how vacation days 
are allocated and how travel expenses are reimbursed. Then ­there is Tony Smith, who 
seems to be every­one’s friend ­because of his winning personality and ­great sense of 
humor.
Name the type of power possessed by each of ­these individuals and give one exam­
ple of how he or she might use that power to benefit the organ­ization. Can you think of 
times when ­these vari­ous types of power might pres­ent a prob­lem in an organ­ization?
Power on the other hand is defined as the potential ability to influence 
or control the actions of ­others. A person may possess power without neces­
sarily possessing authority. About 50 years ago two social psychologists, John 
French and Bertram Raven, studied the sources of power. Despite its age, 
their research is still very helpful in understanding how some ­people within 
organ­izations are able to have power over ­others within the same organ­
ization. French and Raven identified five types of power:
1.	 Legitimate power comes from a formal management position. 
Based on authority, it accords with one’s position within an orga­
nizational structure. This type of power is synonymous with the 
authority described above. It is power that derives from the posi­
tion a person holds.
2.	 Reward power stems from the power to provide positive conse­
quences, including bonuses, raises, promotions, or even compliments.
3.	 Coercive power derives from the capacity to inflict punishment.
4.	 Expert power is based on expertise or knowledge. ­People whose 
positions are not high in the chain of command may nevertheless 
have a ­great deal of power ­because of their knowledge.
5.	 Referent power derives from the re­spect and esteem that is 
accorded to an individual who is perceived to be admirable and wor­
thy of ­others’ re­spect.27
In summary, authority is the ability to influence that is associated with 
a person’s orga­nizational position, while power may be derived from sources 
other than a job title. Many organ­izations contain individuals who have power 
derived from sources other than that associated with their formal positions 
on the orga­nizational chart.
Del­e­ga­tion
In an effective organ­ization, the person whose position gives him or her 
ultimate authority ­will delegate some of that authority down the chain of 
command. A man­ag­er can delegate to subordinates almost anything for 

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  181
Talk About It
It is often hard for man­ag­ers to ­really let go and delegate both responsibility and author­
ity. ­After delegating, good man­ag­ers need to observe and support their direct reports 
instead of telling them what and how to do a task. Micromanaging defeats the purpose 
of del­e­ga­tion and never allows employees to develop their skills at making decisions. If 
you want your direct reports to develop their own skills, you “have to permit them to 
make ­mistakes and figure out how to correct them.”28
Why do you think that so many supervisors find it hard to delegate? What are the 
warning signs that a man­ag­er is not delegating properly? What can be done to encour­
age man­ag­ers to feel more confident in delegating work to their subordinates?
which that man­ag­er has responsibility, though usually ­there are some pre­
scribed limits; man­ag­ers cannot delegate all authority without abdicating 
their managerial role. Indeed, even ­after delegating authority, a man­ag­er 
remains ultimately responsible for the actions of subordinates. In real­ity, 
most man­ag­ers delegate too ­little; some cling tenaciously to authority and 
delegate as ­little as pos­si­ble. Many worry about delegating authority ­because 
they fear that subordinates might make a ­mistake or perform poorly. Mean­
while, some man­ag­ers feel that they are not ­doing their jobs ­unless they make 
all of the decisions, even smaller ones that subordinates could easily ­handle. 
Such man­ag­ers spend a disproportionate amount of time on minor decisions, 
not realizing that ­doing so diverts their time and attention from more impor­
tant decisions that only they can make.
Effective man­ag­ers know how to delegate and are willing to let go of 
some of their authority. They trust their subordinates, although they realize 
that ­these subordinates ­will sometimes make ­mistakes; ­these man­ag­ers take 
the risk ­because they know del­e­ga­tion is necessary for an organ­ization to be 
effective. They also remember that responsibility cannot be delegated with­
out authority. A subordinate who has been delegated responsibility without 
authority ­will prob­ably be unable to function effectively.
Centralization and Decentralization
Earlier in this chapter, in the context of horizontal departmentalization, 
we discussed the issues of centralization and decentralization. Within 
a vertical hierarchy, centralization and decentralization do not refer to 
geographic dispersal but to the distribution of decision-­making authority. 
Highly centralized organ­izations concentrate authority within the hierar­
chy’s highest echelons, meaning that almost all decisions are made by ­people 
at the top. Centralized organ­izations are often termed command and control 
organ­izations, ­because decisions relating to both command and control remain 
in the hands of top management. Centralization’s major advantage is its tight 
coordination of decision making. ­Those few man­ag­ers with the power to make 
decisions have almost complete control over ­those decisions.
By contrast, decentralized organ­izations delegate decision-­making 
authority to lower levels within the orga­nizational structure. As institutions 
become larger and more complex, they tend to decentralize. Decentralized 
organ­izations are frequently called participative ­because employees partici­
pate more in the decision making. Centralization and decentralization can 
best be envisioned as two ends of a continuum. Organ­izations where a high

degree of retention of power, duties, and authority is retained by top man­
agement are centralized; in contrast, ­those where a high degree of del­e­ga­
tion of duties, power, and authority has been delegated to lower levels of the 
organ­ization are decentralized. Although top man­ag­ers ­will usually retain 
the authority to make the most impor­tant decisions and to establish the poli­
cies that affect the entire organ­ization, the rest of the authority ­will be del­
egated to ­middle and lower level man­ag­ers or to teams. The greater the 
decentralization, the lower the level where decisions are made.
A centralized organ­ization has some advantages. If only one person or a 
small group of ­people are making decisions, the decision-­making pro­cess 
should be efficient and uniform. In a very small organ­ization, relying on one 
person to make decisions may work. However, in larger organ­izations with 
centralized structures the number of decisions that need to be made exceed 
the ability of one person to make them. As a result, most of ­today’s organ­
izations are moving away from a command and control configuration ­toward 
a more participative structure. Employees are being empowered to make 
decisions on their own.
This type of decentralization has several advantages. First, in most 
organ­izations ­there are so many decisions to be made that tightly controlled 
decision-­making is likely to result in inaction and then orga­nizational paral­
ysis. In many of ­today’s libraries, decisions tend to be made at what­ever 
orga­nizational level possesses the greatest amount of relevant information. 
Permitting workers who have the necessary information to make at least 
some of the decisions that ­will affect them facilitates the creation of groups 
and teams who are able to collaborate often across departmental lines. Decen­
tralization also enables organ­izations to respond more promptly to local con­
ditions. Rather than spend time transmitting information for decision making 
all the way up the chain of command, a decentralized organ­ization can make 
decisions and act in a timelier fashion. Fi­nally, a decentralized structure 
stimulates motivation. An organ­ization seeking to attract and retain cre­
ative, intelligent ­people can better do so by giving them considerable power 
to make decisions.
Information technology has also had a role in the decentralization of 
decision making ­because its increasing importance in organ­izations has 
allowed many organ­izations to reduce the number of ­middle man­ag­ers result­
ing in a flatter, more decentralized structure. Although technology can be 
used to increase top-­down control and demotivate workers when jobs are 
downgraded ­because they require less skill, it can also empower employees 
by providing information they need to make decisions. Thanks to informa­
tion technology, every­one in an organ­ization now is able to have immediate 
access to reliable information. Information technology also permits the easy 
sharing of information up and down the orga­nizational ladder. In libraries 
and information centers, where many workers are highly educated and 
skilled, information technology is likely to play a key role in further decen­
tralization of decision making.
The disadvantages of the command-­and-­control corporate model in both 
the for-­profit or not-­for-­profit sphere is becoming increasing apparent, and 
tight centralization is being abandoned in most 21st ­century organ­izations. 
As Peter Senge writes, “In a world of increasing interdependence and rapid 
change, it is no longer pos­si­ble to figure it out from the top. Nor, as ­today’s 
CEOs keep discovering, is it pos­si­ble to command ­people to make the pro­
found systemic changes needed.” 29

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  183
Unity of Command
A classic management princi­ple pertaining to vertical hierarchy is unity 
of command. According to this princi­ple, each employee should have only one 
supervisor who makes assignments and assesses the worker’s success in com­
pleting ­those assignments. However, as modern organ­izations have become 
more complex, employees often have multiple bosses. For example, some large 
libraries have subject bibliographers reporting to both the head of collection 
development and the head of technical ser­vices. An employee with more than 
one supervisor is in the awkward position of having to decide whose work 
has priority, the amount of time to be spent on each task, and whose direc­
tives to follow. Unity of command protects the employee from such undesir­
able situations. Although the princi­ple of unity of command is not always 
adhered to, nonetheless employees need to be protected from the demands of 
competing supervisors. When faced with conflicting ­orders, the employee 
should be able to consult a single higher level supervisor who can resolve the 
conflict. It is also very impor­tant when an employee has more than one super­
visor, that the job description clearly spell out the worker’s duties, the priori­
ties among the duties, and the amount of time to be spent on each one.
Span of Control
Just as employees should not be accountable to too many supervisors, 
man­ag­ers should not be responsible for too many employees. Span of control 
(sometimes called span of management) refers to the number of ­people or 
activities someone can effectively manage. A man­ag­er who supervises many 
employees is said to have a wide span of control, whereas one who supervises 
just a few has a narrow span of control. Obviously, a man­ag­er’s span of con­
trol is closely related to how many levels of hierarchy exist within the organ­
ization. When ­there is a broad span of control, ­there are fewer man­ag­ers, 
meaning that the organ­ization tends to be flatter.
A wide span of control with many orga­nizational units reporting to one 
man­ag­er creates a flat or horizontal orga­nizational structure with few ver­
tical levels of operation. Figure 8.5 shows an organ­ization with only two lev­
els of operation: the director and the unit man­ag­er for each specific activity. 
In such situations, the scope of knowledge required of the director is exten­
sive indeed, and supervision of each unit, ­because ­there are so many, ­will 
prob­ably be minimal.
On the other hand, narrow spans of control result in a tall, vertical orga­
nizational structure. Figure 8.6 shows a vertical organ­ization with four levels 
of operation. The Director directly supervises the Assistant Director and the 
Head of ­Human Resources. The Assistant Director has four direct reports: 
the heads of the Extension, Reference, Circulation, and Technical Ser­vices 
Departments. Three of the department heads also supervise subunits related 
to their departments. As the organ­ization chart illustrates, each supervisor’s 
span of control is narrow. In this organ­ization, the director has direct super­
vision over only two ­people, rather than the 12 positions shown in figure 8.5.
When the number of subordinates exceeds one man­ag­er’s span of con­
trol, an organ­ization would be wise to think about reor­ga­niz­ing to narrow 
the span by adding an additional layer of ­middle man­ag­ers to the hierarchy. 
The upper level man­ag­er would then supervise only a small number of ­middle 
man­ag­ers instead of interacting with all of the lower level man­ag­ers.
­There is no ideal span of control or optimal number of subordinates. 
Recent research shows that effective spans of control vary in size, depending 

184  Organ­izing
on the type of organ­ization and the sort of activity that is being supervised. 
As a result, man­ag­ers nowadays try to maintain what­ever span of control 
seems most appropriate to their specific situation.
Two of the criteria used to determine this are the number and variety 
of tasks being managed. If all the units assigned to one man­ag­er have simi­
lar activities, that man­ag­er’s span of control can widen. If the units’ activi­
ties vary extensively and require thorough knowledge, a narrower span of 
control is more appropriate. The broader or more detailed the necessary 
knowledge becomes, the fewer units the man­ag­er should be assigned.

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  185
Line and Staff Positions
In creating a vertical structure, organ­izations distinguish between 
line and staff positions. Almost all organ­izations have positions that fall into 
­these two categories but the distinction between the two is sometimes con­
fusing. ­People in line positions are responsible and accountable for attain­
ing the organ­ization’s primary objectives. They have the formal authority to 
issue ­orders to their immediate subordinates. ­Because ­people in line positions 
are charged with carry­ing out the organ­ization’s primary objectives, they 
have the final decision-­making authority. ­People in staff positions lack this 
type of authority. Instead individuals holding staff positions provide advice, 
support, and ser­vice to the line man­ag­ers but do not have the authority to 
make the final decisions. An old adage is “Line tells; staff sells.” In other 
words, ­people in line positions have the authority to give ­orders, while ­those 
in staff positions have to convince line man­ag­ers to adopt their suggestions. 
Final decision-­making authority in organ­izations is vested in line positions 
to maintain a clear chain of command throughout the organ­ization.
As libraries have grown in size and complexity, more staff positions have 
been created to provide support, advice, and information. For such functions 
as public relations, systems, ­human resources, planning, fund-­raising, and 
bud­geting, many libraries now employ staff members skilled in ­those par­tic­
u­lar fields to provide input to the line man­ag­ers. A library ­human resources 
office, for example, may be responsible for receiving job applications, inter­
viewing applicants, maintaining personnel files, and recommending promo­
tions or transfers. But, generally, the ­human resources director does not have 
the authority to make hiring and firing decisions. For instance, the ­human 
resources director ­will facilitate the search for a new department head, but 
the ­actual se­lection of a candidate is made by someone ­else, most likely by the 
library director, often with input from a search committee. Only individuals 
in a line position are empowered to make this kind of decision.
Conflicts often develop between line and staff personnel, usually when 
­people have unclear notions of their duties resulting in confusing authority 
relationships and friction. If staff employees misunderstand their support 
role in the organ­ization, they ­will be frustrated and confused. At the same 
time, if line man­ag­ers continually disregard the advice of individuals holding 
staff positions, perhaps fearing that they may undermine their own position 
and authority, the employees in staff positions ­will be underutilized and their 
Practice Your Skills
The Centreville Public Library has expanded rapidly as the population of Centreville 
has almost doubled over the past de­cade. A few years ago, the library employed only 
20 ­people. Now it employs 150. The man­ag­ers of more than 20 diverse departments report 
directly to Margaret Minty, the library director. Lately, Ms. Minty has felt that that all 
her time is taken up by supervising and responding to prob­lems. She never has time to 
concentrate on her other managerial responsibilities, and she seems to be getting far­
ther and farther ­behind in planning and bud­geting. Last week the town man­ag­er com­
mented that she seemed to be very distracted and scattered and suggested that she 
rethink her job responsibilities.
Using management terminology, can you identify her prob­lem? What do you recom­
mend she do to improve her managerial effectiveness?

expertise wasted. Top man­ag­ers should be sure that every­one understands 
the distinct role of ­these two types of positions. They should encourage line 
personnel to listen to staff and keep them fully informed, so that the staff 
can in turn play their intended role of offering support and advice.
Coordination
The first part of this chapter has dealt with how organ­izations structure 
themselves by breaking work down into smaller units and creating subunits 
in charge of specific sections of the overall tasks that need to be accomplished. 
This aspect of structure is called specialization. Division of work, or spe­
cialization, is one impor­tant aspect of organ­ization, but coordinating ­those 
vari­ous tasks is equally impor­tant. ­Every organ­ization, except for the very 
smallest, must divide its tasks among several departments. At the same time, 
man­ag­ers must coordinate or integrate ­these departmental activities, bring­
ing together all the individual job efforts to achieve the given objective. 
Coordination is the integration and synchronization of all the activities of 
the organ­ization to provide unity in achieving the organ­ization’s goals and 
objectives.
Man­ag­ers sometimes strug­gle to strike the right balance between too 
much and too ­little interdepartmental coordination. If ­there is too ­little, 
staff in each department ­will focus inward, on their own responsibilities. 
All the departments ­will pay too ­little attention to the organ­ization’s over­
all objectives, and the lack of a big-­picture perspective ­will likely lead to 
duplications or omissions in the work. On the other hand, with too much 
coordinating, departments may get in one another’s way so that ­little gets 
accomplished.
Sometimes librarians complain that ­because they spend all their time 
in committee meetings, they have no time to do their “real” work. This is an 
exaggeration, of course, but it is true that committees and meetings in all 
types of organ­izations consume a ­great deal of time. Meetings are a good way 
to coordinate work among units, but if allowed to proliferate or drag on, they 
can take far too much time away from the organ­ization’s real work. Man­ag­
ers therefore should strive to maintain a balance between specialization and 
coordination.
Coordinating Mechanisms
Man­ag­ers in an organ­ization can achieve a coordinated workflow in 
many ways:
•	 Vertical hierarchy is the primary tool for coordinating and inte­
grating work where the power and accountability associated with 
each level of the hierarchy help ensure that all departments work 
compatibly together.
•	 Planning techniques, such as ­those discussed in chapters 4 and 
5, can also provide another means of coordinating. For example, 
agreed-­upon plans and standard operating procedures provide guid­
ance for members of the organ­ization, who are then more likely to 
perform in a manner consistent with the organ­ization’s overall goals.
•	 Orga­nizational manuals and policies act as a coordinating 
mechanism by specifying how activities are to be conducted in each 

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  187
unit. ­These functional statements are designed to ensure that all 
tasks are covered and that the separation of the overall duties and 
functions provides the mix necessary to achieve orga­nizational objec­
tives. In a larger sense, any information that is shared with employ­
ees throughout the organ­ization is a means of coordinating the efforts 
of the entire organ­ization.
•	 Committees, which often draw members from vari­ous parts of the 
organ­ization, encourage communication and participation in decision-­
making, which leads to greater coordination.
•	 Staff positions, by providing assistance and advice to man­ag­ers 
throughout an organ­ization, also promote coordination.
Coordination is always easier in less complicated organ­izations. Many 
management experts recommend that organ­izations maintain a basic sim­
plicity of form. Thomas Peters and Robert Waterman, in their classic study 
of successful organ­izations, found that the most successful ones had a ­simple 
structure that was easily understood by employees.30 Good orga­nizational 
structure clearly delineates bound­aries and zones of accountability. That 
clarity aids in coordination and often corresponds with simplicity in form.
The work of Henry Mintzberg in categorizing the structural ele­ments of 
organ­izations was discussed at the beginning of the chapter. Mintzberg also 
provides a very helpful model for understanding how organ­izations coordinate 
their work. He identified five mechanisms that are used in coordination.
•	 Mutual adjustment means informal communication. ­Because it is 
so ­simple, mutual adjustment is the coordinating mechanism used 
in the simplest of organ­izations, such as a small library with few 
employees. No elaborate hierarchy is necessary, and all workers can 
easily communicate with one another. Hence, informal discussion by 
itself brings about coordination of activities.
•	 Direct supervision, occurs when one individual takes responsibil­
ity for the work of ­others, issuing instructions to them and monitor­
ing their actions. In a library with individual departments, mutual 
adjustment alone does not suffice to coordinate work. It requires a 
hierarchy in which, as Mintzberg says, “one brain coordinates several 
hands.”31 This hierarchy is formed when support staff members are 
supervised by professional librarians.
Mintzberg’s three remaining methods of coordination all involve stan­
dardization. With standardization, at least some coordination is achieved 
before the work is undertaken. In a sense, standardization incorporates coor­
dination into the design of the work, thereby reducing the need for additional 
coordinating mechanisms.
•	 Standardization of work pro­cesses occurs when the content of 
each job is specified, programmed, and made uniform. Supervisors 
overseeing such workers have ­little need to coordinate ­because the 
specificity and uniformity of the job guarantees a certain result. The 
classic case of this type of standardization is an assembly line, where 
workers perform highly specific tasks. In a library, the pro­cessing of 
material for mailing would likely be a highly standardized work 
pro­cess.

188  Organ­izing
•	 Standardization of outputs occurs when the results of the work, 
for example, the dimensions of the product or the nature of the 
per­for­mance, are specified. Librarians standardize many of their 
outputs; for instance, bibliographic data are usually standardized 
by means of a tool like RDA.
When neither the work nor its outputs can be standardized, man­ag­ers 
can attain some level of coordination by standardizing the worker.
•	 Standardization of skills occurs when the employer specifies that 
certain training is necessary to perform the work. Most U.S. librar­
ies require an American Library Association (ALA) accredited mas­
ter’s degree for entry-­level professional positions. Although curricula 
differ among programs, a person who has earned an ALA accred­
ited degree is assumed to possess the initial skills and knowledge 
needed to be a professional librarian.
Mintzberg sees the five coordinating mechanisms as a continuum; as 
orga­nizational work becomes more complicated, the means of coordination 
shift from mutual adjustment to direct supervision and then to standard­
ization of work pro­cesses, to standardization of outputs, and, fi­nally, to stan­
dardization of skills.32
Coordination serves as the glue that holds together the vari­ous units of 
the organ­ization as it moves ­toward achieving its objectives. The larger and 
more complex an organ­ization becomes, the more it needs ­those coordinat­
ing mechanisms. Although an organ­ization may ­favor one par­tic­u­lar coordi­
nating mechanism, no organ­ization relies on a single one, and most mix all 
five. Some mutual adjustment and direct supervision are always required, 
regardless of the extent to which the organ­ization relies on standards, and 
as shown above, librarians use all five mechanisms to coordinate their work.
This chapter has covered the methods by which organ­izations divide 
themselves into subunits for specialization, as well as the ways they inte­
grate ­those subunits to enable coordination. ­Those two activities are the 
essential ele­ments of orga­nizational design. They are equally impor­tant and 
neither can be neglected in structuring or restructuring an organ­ization 
­because if ­either is neglected, the organ­ization ­will not be able to achieve its 
objectives. The next chapter ­will discuss how libraries have used ­these two 
essential ele­ments of specialization and coordination to shape the varying 
orga­nizational structures found in libraries.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Samuel Shea has been employed by the ­Sullivan State University Library for 
the past 45 years. He came to SSU (when it was still ­Sullivan State College) as 
a new gradu­ate from library school. He ­rose through the ranks and has been 
library director for 36 years. When he was first hired ­there ­were only three 
professionals on the staff. Since then, the library has grown and now employs 
12 professionals, 25 clerical workers, and a number of student assistants. None­
theless, Mr. Shea still runs the library like a one-­man show. He tightly controls 
every­thing that goes on. He originates ­every procedure and ser­vice. He even 

The Fundamentals of Organ­ization  189
draws up the schedules for the student assistants, since he is sure he knows 
better than anyone ­else when and where they are needed. But, ­after 45 years, 
Mr. Shea is retiring next month, and you have just been hired as the new direc­
tor. You are excited but a bit concerned about what you learned when you ­were 
interviewed.
•	 ­There is no orga­nizational chart, but the library seems to be or­ga­nized as it 
was 45 years ago. Although ­there are the usual departments, the department 
heads are ignored. Every­one goes to Mr. Shea for answers since he makes all 
of the decisions.
•	 ­There have never been any regularly scheduled staff meetings.
•	 ­Orders for supplies are only placed once a year, since Mr. Shea ­handles them.
•	 ­There is no user instruction provided since Mr. Shea thinks college students 
should arrive knowing how to use the library.
•	 Mr. Shea refuses to have ­either chat or online reference, ­because he feels that 
­people should come to the library for ser­vice.
What difficulties do you see in making changes in a library like this one? 
Where ­will you start? What changes ­will you try to implement first?
2.	It is never easy to change an organ­ization’s structure and thus the tendency is 
often to let ­things remain as they are. The “­we’ve always done it this way” mind­
set is a constraint that impedes any organ­ization’s pro­gress. Ironically, it is 
especially hard to envision change when an organ­ization seems to be successful. 
Success tends to tie an organ­ization to the past, and ­today’s success sometimes 
creates tomorrow’s prob­lems. Think of an organ­ization that you know well. 
Then think how it might be restructured using both the princi­ples of special­
ization and coordination. What would be the advantages that would come with 
the new structure? What might be some pos­si­ble disadvantages?
3.	­There is an old saying, “If it ­ain’t broke, ­don’t fix it.” Using the same organ­
ization that you worked with above, provide a rationale for leaving its orga­
nizational structure as it is now. If an organ­ization’s structure seems to be 
working well, how would you know when it is necessary to make changes in the 
organ­ization?
4.	In an article in ­Legal Reference Ser­vices Quarterly, Timothy J. Gallina describes 
some alternatives models that might be used for presidential libraries in the 
United States. Presidential libraries are now very geo­graph­i­cally decentralized 
with each former president establishing a separate library serving both as an 
archive and a museum. Some experts have suggested that a central depository 
for presidential rec­ords would be a better approach to meeting the information 
needs of scholars.33
For a researcher working on a proj­ect that spans several presidential admin­
istrations, more centralized presidential libraries would seem to be a better 
approach. What are the advantages of the decentralized model being used at 
pres­ent? Can you think of disadvantages of a centralized model? If you ­were a 
presidential scholar, which model would you prefer?

Discussion Questions
1.	 Every­one has heard the old adage, “If you want it done right, do it yourself.” Why 
do effective man­ag­ers have to disregard this adage? What happens if they ­don’t?
2.	In a recent research report examining orga­nizational structure in academic 
libraries, Roger Schonfeld stated that many library directors now view orga­
nizational structure not as enduring but transient, only appropriate to a given 
period in a library’s history. Thus it is not something to try to perfect but some­
thing to be regularly rethought as the needs of the library and its users change.34
What are the advantages and disadvantages of frequently changing the 
orga­nizational structure of a library? If you ­were a director, what would you do 
to make any planned orga­nizational change as effective as pos­si­ble?
3.	Henry Mintzberg wrote, “­Every ­human activity—­from the making of pots to 
the placing of a man on the moon—­gives rise to two fundamental and opposing 
requirements: the division of ­labor into vari­ous tasks to be performed and the 
coordination of ­these tasks to accomplish the activity. The structure of an organ­
ization can be defined simply as the sum total of the ways in which it divides its 
­labor into distinct tasks and then achieves coordination among them.”35
Do you agree with this statement? How have you seen ­these two require­
ments fulfilled in an organ­ization with which you are familiar? Do you think that 
organ­izations find ­either part of this requirement easier to carry out? What 
happens if ­either is neglected?
4.	James Neal, the former vice president for Information Ser­vices and university 
librarian at Columbia University, wrote: “We invest enormously in the ­people 
who work in a library organ­ization both in terms of the responsibilities we 
assign them and in their growth and development; yet we ­don’t always provide 
them with the authority to make decisions and carry out their assignments 
effectively.”36
Has ­there ever been a time when you felt you lacked the authority to carry 
out a task that was assigned to you? When man­ag­ers fail to delegate the author­
ity to accomplish a task, what is the result?

Organizational Structures
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the differences between mechanistic and organic orga­nizational 
structures
•	 Know why ele­ments of the bureaucratic structure continue to be used in so many 
con­temporary organ­izations
•	 Be able to discuss why it is difficult to change any already existing orga­nizational 
structure
•	 Be familiar with some of the ways libraries have modified bureaucratic struc­
tures to make them more organic
•	 Be able to discuss some steps that should be taken before a reor­ga­ni­za­tion begins
The last two chapters have introduced the fundamental ele­ments that make 
up organ­izations. ­These individual ele­ments combine to form a structure, 
which serves as the framework that allows an organ­ization to conduct, coor­
dinate, and control its activities vertically, horizontally, and laterally. The 
basic building blocks of organ­izations can be put together in many ways, and 
no one type of structure is suitable to all organ­izations ­because each is 
affected differently by ­factors such as rate of growth, competition, technol­
ogy, customers, and environmental uncertainty.
­Because of the challenges of a rapidly changing environment, organ­
izations of all types need to engage in a “continual and deliberate orchestra­
tion of organ­ization design on an ongoing basis.”1 ­Today ­there is a widespread 
interest in modifying the old structures of the past, and many organ­izations 

194  Organ­izing
are experimenting with new designs to better meet con­temporary needs. 
Fortunately, ­there are many options for organ­izations seeking to restruc­
ture. While historically ­there ­were only a few tried-­and-­true orga­nizational 
designs, ­today’s world abounds with alternative models of organ­izations and 
variations continue to proliferate.
Whenever man­ag­ers structure or restructure an organ­ization they are 
engaged in orga­nizational design. ­These man­ag­ers are acting as orga­nizational 
architects building a new structure as they move around the basic building 
blocks such as the relationship between vari­ous task specializations, the 
lines of power and authority, and the pro­cesses that shape how work flows 
throughout the organ­ization. In this design pro­cess, man­ag­ers are reexam­
ining and reshaping the structure in an attempt to better align the organ­
ization’s structure with its mission and objectives. The end result of this 
pro­cess may be an orga­nizational structure very dif­fer­ent from the one that 
existed before, but one that ­will be more efficient and provide better ser­vice 
to users.
Orga­nizational structures can be roughly categorized into two types: 
mechanistic or organic. For years, most large organ­izations, including librar­
ies, ­were structured in a mechanistic or hierarchical fashion, usually as 
bureaucracies. The trend ­today is to move away from strictly mechanistic 
structures. While most libraries still retain ele­ments of a mechanistic struc­
ture, an increasing number are moving to become more organic.
This chapter ­will first examine the characteristics of mechanistic and 
organic organ­izations and then cover the advantages and disadvantages of 
bureaucracy, a commonly used form of orga­nizational structure. Next, it ­will 
focus on the dif­fer­ent approaches libraries are using as they move ­toward 
more organic orga­nizational structure, and the ­factors that man­ag­ers need 
to keep in mind when they are considering orga­nizational structure. The 
chapter ­will close with a brief overview of the types of orga­nizational struc­
tures that are likely to be used in the libraries of the ­future.
Management on the Job: The Restructuring of 
the PH&S Oregon Libraries
Libraries of all sorts are being restructured to meet the needs of their users. In some 
cases, this restructuring has been undertaken in response to bud­getary cutbacks. The 
reor­ga­ni­za­tion of the Providence Health & Ser­vices (PH&S) libraries in Oregon provides 
a good example of a restructuring that both reduced costs and improved ser­vices. It is 
also a good example of restructuring in a small library system; PH&S comprises three 
hospital libraries in Portland and one in Medford.2 The reor­ga­ni­za­tion was triggered by 
the departure of two library man­ag­ers. ­Because of a hiring freeze imposed by PH&S 
administration, it was deci­ded that the two library man­ag­er positions would not be 
filled, and instead a new position—­director of regional library services—­would be estab­
lished to oversee all of the PH&S libraries in Oregon. Once the new library director was 
appointed, a strategic planning pro­cess began. Key stakeholders provided feedback on 
the library and its ser­vices. Some recurring themes emerged from ­these information-­
gathering sessions. Many users ­were unaware of what was available through the library 
and uncertain about how to access resources. Users also complained about the difficulty 
of access and requested more online resources and training. To make the library more 
responsive to user needs, a new orga­nizational structure was implemented consisting

Mechanistic and Organic 
Orga­nizational Models
Orga­nizational structures can be classified into two broad categories: 
mechanistic and organic. Mechanistic organ­izations are ­shaped in a tradi­
tional, pyramidal, hierarchical pattern. Such organ­izations are designed in 
a machine–­like fashion, with their parts working together to produce a stan­
dard, uniform output. ­There is a strict hierarchy, with authority highly cen­
tralized at the top, and a clear chain of command ­running from the top of 
the organ­ization to the bottom. Mechanistic organ­izations are characterized 
by formalized rules and procedures, and employees typically work on tasks 
separately with ­little interaction among them. Employees in mechanistic 
organ­izations are sometimes compared to cogs in a machine. Their actions are 
controlled by rules, and they do not engage in in­de­pen­dent decision making; 
as a result, they can be easily replaced by ­others when they leave. A manufac­
turing firm with an assembly line consisting of a large number of workers 
­doing repetitive tasks and a small number of man­ag­ers issuing ­orders is an 
example of an extremely mechanistic organ­ization. Burns and Stalker, two 
British theorists who first described mechanistic and organic structures, 
stated that the mechanistic design works best for organ­izations that per­
form many routine tasks and operate in a stable environment. On the other 
hand, for organ­izations that are required to adjust to many environmental 
changes, the organic structure functions better.5
The organic orga­nizational structure is based on a biological meta­phor, 
and fittingly, such systems are designed to remain open to the environment. 
When conditions change, an organic structure enables the organ­ization to 
act promptly. Organic structures are more decentralized with decision mak­
ing dispersed throughout the organ­ization. When necessary, employees in 
organic organ­izations use their own initiative to change the way they work. 
of one unit providing “a unified ser­vice and a streamlined organ­ization. From four sep­
arate libraries, one team was born.”3 This new structure resulted in greater efficiency 
and productivity, less isolation for the staff working alone at smaller sites, and encour­
aged greater collaboration and learning.
As a result of restructuring, the library implemented a number of changes. The 
ser­vices and resources provided became more standardized, and uniform policies, pro­
cedures, and statistics ­were developed. In the area of collection management, print jour­
nal titles ­were reduced by 80 ­percent in the first year and multisite licenses negotiated. 
The library instituted a single Web site and began a marketing campaign to reassure 
users that the quality of ser­vices would not suffer. Overall, the results of this restruc­
turing ­were positive. Although the PH&S Oregon library lost two-­thirds of its profes­
sional staff (1.85 FTE) and incurred a bud­getary decrease of 27 ­percent, the library 
expanded “business, usage, awareness, and collections through orga­nizational inno­
vation and improved efficiency following regionalization.”4
What steps did the PH&S Oregon libraries follow before the reor­ga­ni­za­tion? How do 
you think ­those steps influenced the reor­ga­ni­za­tion? Although the new structure seems 
to be very successful, can you think of any disadvantages that might result from this 
centralized structure? How does the new structure reflect changes that are occurring in 
libraries of all kinds?

196  Organ­izing
Talk About It
Charles Handy reminds us, “Organ­izations used to be perceived as gigantic pieces of 
engineering with largely interchangeable ­human parts. We talked of their structures 
and their systems, of inputs and outputs, of control devices and managing them, as if 
the ­whole was one large factory. ­Today the language is not that of engineering but of 
politics with talk of cultures and networks, of teams and co­ali­tions, of influence or power 
rather than control, of leadership not management.”7
Why has the language used to describe organ­izations changed over the years? 
How are relationships between man­ag­ers and nonmanagerial employees dif­fer­ent now?
Employees often work in teams. An organic orga­nizational structure is char­
acterized by:
•	 An emphasis on lateral and horizontal flows of communication
•	 Personal influence based largely on the authority of knowledge, 
rather than job title or hierarchical position
•	 Members of the organ­ization maintaining a total orga­nizational ori­
entation instead of narrowly focused departmental views
•	 Less precise, more flexible job definitions, with duties that change 
according to circumstances
•	 A commitment by many members to professional standards that ­were 
developed by groups outside the formal organ­ization. For instance, 
many librarians identify as much with their profession as with the 
institutions that employ them.6
In almost ­every re­spect, the organic institution is the opposite of the 
mechanistic organ­ization. In place of standardization and formal relations, 
organic structures are marked by loose, informal working relationships and 
the solving of prob­lems as needs arise.
Pure mechanistic and pure organic systems are on opposite ends of a 
continuum. A small group of scientists working in a laboratory represents 
an organic structure; a large, highly structured factory that produces a stan­
dard product for a stable market represents a mechanistic one. However, 
most institutions fall somewhere between ­these two extremes, and many 
organ­izations contain both organic and mechanistic units. As can be seen in 
figure 9.1, mechanistic and organic structures differ in four major aspects: 
complexity, formality, participation, and communication. It is impor­tant to 
remember that one type of structure is not intrinsically better than another, 
but the structure selected by an organ­ization must be a good match for its 
employees, customers, and objectives.
In the past, most libraries, ­because of their size, the technology used, 
and the ser­vices performed, ­were or­ga­nized in a mechanistic or bureaucratic 
fashion. ­Today, most libraries are trying to move away from the mechanistic 
to a more organic type of structure. However, few are pure organic systems, 
­because this type of orga­nizational structure is difficult to implement in large 
organ­izations. Some small public, special, and school libraries manage to 
maintain an organic structure, as do some small academic libraries that have

Think of a library (or other type of organ­ization) with which you are familiar. What 
kind of orga­nizational structure does it have? What does the orga­nizational chart look

­adopted a collegial mode of governance. ­These libraries are or­ga­nized like 
academic departments, typically with librarians considered to be faculty and 
a rotating department head selected periodically. Most large or medium-­size 
libraries have too many employees to allow a pure form of an organic struc­
ture. As a result, most libraries ­today are hybrid structures moving gradu­
ally ­toward the organic end of the continuum as they look for ways to make 
large organ­izations function more like small ones with greater flexibility, 
adaptability, and employee participation.

Bureaucracies
For well over a ­century, one form of mechanistic structure, the bureau­
cracy, has been widely used, and historically most libraries have been or­ga­
nized in this way. The term “bureaucracy” is often applied in a derogatory 
fashion connoting cumbersome structure, red tape, and too many rules and 
regulations. Although now often regarded as outdated, bureaucracies ­until 

198  Organ­izing
recently ­were viewed very favorably, ­because man­ag­ers considered this orga­
nizational structure much more effective than any other.
As discussed in chapter 2, Max Weber, a German sociologist, proposed 
bureaucracy as a solution to the prob­lems encountered in many early 20th 
­century organ­izations, which ­were still being managed like the small, family-­
owned businesses that had existed before the Industrial Revolution. ­Because 
bureaucracy is impersonal, rational, and based on rules rather than on ­family 
or friendship ties, it is, according to Weber, the most efficient form of organ­
ization in the modern world. The characteristics of a bureaucracy can be 
seen in ­table 9.1. Weber’s work on bureaucracy brought together many con­
cepts already discussed in this section including division of ­labor, horizontal 
specialization, hierarchy of authority, and standardization of work pro­cesses 
and had a profound influence on how ­people think about organ­izations.
More recently, attention has been paid to the dysfunctional aspects of 
bureaucracies. Much of this criticism focuses on bureaucracies’ internal work­
ings, especially the unintended consequences of rule-­based control.8 Other 
criticisms center on the traditional bureaucracy’s relationship to its environ­
ment and its tendency to ignore the outside world. The bureaucratic orga­
nizational model is seen as flawed ­because it treats the organ­ization as if it

Systematic specialization of

Dividing all of the organ­ization’s work into specific 
areas of competence gives each employee and 
supervisor authority over his or her functions and 
prevents interference with other workers’ jobs.
A well-­ordered system of

work
Rules serve (a) to standardize operations and 
decisions, (b) as repre­sen­ta­tions of past learning, 
and (c) to protect incumbents and ensure employ­
ees get equal treatment.
Learning rules also facilitates incumbents’ 
technical competence, ­because the rules indicate 
what decisions to make and when to make them.
Hierarchy of positions such 
that each position is con­
trolled by a higher one
The hierarchy of authority is impersonal, based on 
rules, and the individual with greater expertise 
holds the superior position. This systematically 
ensures compliance with rules and coordination.
Complete separation of the 
organ­ization’s property and 
affairs from the incumbents’ 
personal property and affairs
This separation prevents the demands and 
interests of personal affairs from interfering with

Practice Your Skills
In a 2014 article in The Wall Street Journal, Joseph White commented, “Texas billion­
aire, H. Ross Perot, once said that where he came from, if you see a snake, you kill it. But 
at General Motors, if you see a snake, you hire a con­sul­tant on snakes, then you form a 
committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a ­couple of years.”13 Although Perot’s 
remark was made over 25 years ago, it is, according to White, still true ­today ­because 
GM retains a bureaucratic structure with a ­great deal of red tape and a very slow deci­
sion making pro­cess. The article focuses on the reasons that it took GM almost 10 years 
to eliminate defective ignition switches that caused cars to shut down suddenly. Accord­
ing to White, GM is “burdened by bureaucratic complexity, and unable to decisively 
address a defect putting lives at risk.”14
Bureaucracies have many advantages, but they have long been criticized for their 
over-­complex structures, which result in slow decision making. What are some of the 
reasons that it takes an organ­ization like GM so long to make a decision? Why do you 
think GM is still or­ga­nized as a bureaucracy? Can you think of ways that decision mak­
ing might be speeded up in large bureaucracies?
­were a closed system unaffected by the uncertainties of environment.9 Many 
critics fault the bureaucratic model for being overly mechanical and conse­
quently ignoring the ways individuals and groups actually behave within 
organ­izations.10 Fi­nally, the complexity of bureaucratic organ­izations is con­
sidered in­effec­tive in dealing with change in an unstable environment.11
In stable environments, bureaucracies are likely to be the most efficient 
types of orga­nizational structure. In this type of environment, conditions 
change slowly, and thus organ­izations face ­little pressure to alter their estab­
lished methods. Organ­izations ­handle information that is largely predict­
able. Plans can be carefully developed over time, and exceptions occur so 
rarely that upper-­level decision makers have plenty of time to respond. The 
rules and procedures characteristic of bureaucracies are well suited to a sta­
ble environment.
­Today, however, the environment is turbulent and changes in ­factors 
such as technology occur more rapidly than ever before. When organ­izations 
encounter frequent change, they must be flexible; long lists of policies and 
rules become increasingly irrelevant when decisions must be made quickly. 
Bureaucracies are “structures designed to perfect programs for contingen­
cies that can be predicted, not prob­lem solving ones designed to create new 
programs for needs that have never been encountered.”12 Thus, they do not 
perform as efficiently in uncertain times.
­Because of doubts about the bureaucratic structure’s suitability for 21st-­
century organ­izations, many management experts have suggested that this 
form of organ­ization should be replaced with a structure that is more con­
gruent with the needs of ­today. Laloux, for example, uses a five-­color model 
to illustrate the five types of orga­nizational structures that he says have 
evolved over the years. The earliest, most primitive type of structures ­were 
­those imposed by power­ful overlords who kept underlings in order through 
fear (Laloux classifies ­these as “red” structures). The red structures ­were 
followed by two bureaucratic models (amber and orange). According to Laloux 

200  Organ­izing
the latest two steps in the evolution are two “post-­modern” paradigms: the 
green organ­ization, which is characterized by employee empowerment and 
egalitarian management, and the teal organ­ization where employees are 
completely self-­managed. Laloux argues that all organ­izations should be 
moving ­toward the teal model ­because “it’s time to stop trying to fix the old 
model and instead make the leap to the next one. It ­will be better suited to 
the complexity and challenges of our times.”15
Bern­stein et al. also point out the advantages of the self-­managed organ­
ization, sometime called a holacracy. In a holacracy, teams are the basic 
components of the organ­ization and ­these teams design and govern them­
selves. Bern­stein and his colleagues state that their “research and experi­
ence tell us that ele­ments of self-­organization ­will become valuable tools for 
companies of all kinds,” but warn of the challenges facing companies that 
embrace the approach too quickly.16 ­These authors write that “blanket argu­
ments for or against broadly applying the princi­ples of self-­management miss 
an impor­tant point: Most organ­izations, particularly large corporations, 
should adopt ­these techniques in part, not in ­whole.”17
Hamel reiterates many of prob­lems associated with bureaucracy includ­
ing “a thicket of policy rules, a multilayered hierarchy, and a host of man­
agement processes—­built to ensure conformity and predictability,” and he 
suggests a revolution is needed to replace bureaucracies by self-­managed 
organ­izations.18 “Bureaucracy and self-­management are ideological oppo­
sites, like totalitarianism and democracy. To build a self-­managing organ­
ization, you ­can’t just prune the brambles of bureaucracy—­you have to uproot 
them.”19 However, Hamel realizes that you cannot just “blow up the old struc­
tures,” and in his ­later writings he suggests the need to move more slowly in 
replacing bureaucracy, which he describes as the orga­nizational equivalent 
of kudzu, an herbicide-­resistant, invasive plant that is almost impossible to 
eradicate.20
Indeed, bureaucracy is amazingly resilient, and it is still one of the most 
common methods of orga­nizational structure found worldwide. For example, 
the U.S. government uses bureaucratic management, as do state and most 
local governments. In fact, the use of the bureaucratic structure has been 
growing; since 1983, in the United States, the number of man­ag­ers and super­
visors has nearly doubled, while employment in other occupations has increased 
by less than 40 ­percent.21 Despite its shortcomings, more ­people are work­
ing in large, bureaucratic organ­izations than ever before.
Why is it so difficult to move beyond bureaucracy? One of the major rea­
sons is that bureaucracy is the form of structure most familiar to both man­
ag­ers and workers. In addition, many man­ag­ers have a vested interest in the 
hierarchy ­because they have worked their way up; having acquired a mana­
gerial position, they are not likely to look favorably on a reor­ga­ni­za­tion that 
would downgrade formal titles and ranks. But the biggest hurdle is that ­there 
is no well-­established way to move to one of the post-­bureaucratic organ­
izations advocated by Hamel and Laloux; any top-­down program that abol­
ished an existing bureaucracy is almost sure to fail ­because front line employees 
are typically used to being told what to do and, without practice, do not have 
the skills necessary to manage themselves. ­There are anecdotal accounts, but 
no proven road maps showing the way from one structure to another. For this 
reason, a gradual approach to replacing a bureaucracy is the best one.22

Designing Adaptive Organizational Structures  201
Modifying Library Bureaucracy
Most libraries, ­because of their size, the technology they use, and the ser­
vices they perform still retain a basic bureaucratic structure. However, times 
are changing. Although libraries have sometimes been criticized for not 
implementing structural change quickly enough, a growing number of librar­
ians have accepted the idea that the traditional hierarchical system needs to 
be modified and have begun to seek out alternatives to bureaucracy.
Libraries seem to be adopting the path advocated by management 
experts such as Hamer and Bern­stein and are taking a gradual approach to 
replacing bureaucracy. Overall, few radical changes have occurred, but many 
libraries are indeed restructuring. We see this most often in large libraries, 
which have enough employees to require complex orga­nizational structures. 
Although in general, ­these organ­izations still retain some aspects of the 
hierarchical structure, a growing number of larger libraries are experiment­
ing with a wide variety of structural modifications to that hierarchy.
An overview of recent library lit­er­a­ture provides numerous examples of 
libraries that ­either are in the pro­cess of changing or have already changed 
their organ­ization structures by reorganizations and mergers. The under­
lying rationale ­behind all the reor­ga­ni­za­tion is the desire to design new 
structures that ­will allow libraries to better serve the users of ­today. In the 
past, libraries ­were centered around buildings and collections; in ­today’s 
world, the growing use of digital material has forced a reexamination of how 
libraries are or­ga­nized. Libraries are merging branches, consolidating ser­
vices points, and reshaping traditional functional departments such as ref­
erence and cata­loging.25 Some of ­these reorganizations have been triggered 
by bud­getary pressures. ­Others ­were instituted by new library directors who 
­were appointed with the mandate to make changes in the library.26 Library 
reor­ga­ni­za­tion has also been the result of an increase in interinstitutional 
cooperation. Orga­nizational bound­aries have become more permeable as 
libraries now collaborate with one another in new joint ventures, such as 
statewide licensing consortia. Another force that is leading to restructuring

Joy Huebert and Mark Nixon describe an incident where too many rules impeded the pro­
vision of good ser­vice. An el­derly ­woman walked through a snowstorm to get a library 
book ­because she wanted something to read. However, when she arrived at the library 
she discovered that she had forgotten to bring her library card. When she tried to check 
a book out, a library staff member, despite knowing the ­woman well, refused to let her 
have the book. She told her, “We ­can’t sign this book out to you without your card.” The 
staff member explained, “Well, it’s the rules,” the staff person said. “We re­spect the 
rules. We ­can’t break the rules. The rule is the rule for every­body.”23 This vignette epito­
mizes the negative image of bureaucracies as places where inflexible rules often result 
in poor ser­vice. As Huebert and Nixon write, “Our professional love of order, rules, and 
organ­ization, has left many libraries chained to Byzantine policies and procedures that 
replace the dictates of good customer ser­vice and even common sense.”24
Imagine you are the director of the library where the el­derly ­woman was refused 
ser­vice, and you overheard the exchange recounted above. Would you speak to the 
staff member or let her decision stand? What changes do you think you might make to 
improve ser­vice?

202  Organ­izing
is an increased use of outsourcing; many library man­ag­ers attain from out­
side sources goods and ser­vices that ­were once produced in-­house. The main 
motivations for outsourcing are typically lowering costs and enhancing effi­
ciency.27 For example, many librarians now purchase “shelf-­ready” books 
from vendors; thus, all the steps in preparing a volume to go on the shelf are 
outsourced. Moving a pro­cess that was once performed internally to an out­
side source inevitably leads to changes in structure.
Although some libraries have restructured comprehensively and imple­
mented an entirely new structure, many libraries have changed in ways that 
perhaps are not reflected on their orga­nizational charts. Many have ­adopted 
hybrid structures, organ­izing some departments more organically than 
­others or have employed so-­called overlays, modifications imposed on the 
basic bureaucratic pyramid. Although the hierarchy remains largely intact, 
many library man­ag­ers are flattening the pyramid and allowing more 
employee input into decision making. This piecemeal change to bureaucra­
cies has been termed “bureaucratic hybridization” or soft bureaucracy.28
Libraries as a ­whole have retained many of the defining ele­ments of 
bureaucratic structure but have introduced modifications to make it more 
in tune with the demands of the pres­ent. For now, libraries do seem to be fol­
lowing the advice of two management experts, Bryan and Joyce, who state 
that if organ­izations want to raise the productivity of their professionals, they 
“must change their orga­nizational structures dramatically, retaining the 
best of the traditional hierarchy while acknowledging the heightened value 
of the ­people.”29
Some Commonly Used Modifications to 
Bureaucratic Organ­izations
Librarians have dealt with increasing complexity by creating vari­ous 
types of coordinating positions and temporary groups, but, as discussed 
above, in most cases, such modifications are superimposed upon the traditional 
bureaucratic structure. The modification made may be traditional, such as 
committees, or more innovative, such as teams, it may be permanent, such 
as a matrix orga­nizational structure, or more transitory, such as groups work­
ing on a specific proj­ect. The following section ­will discuss some of ­these 
modifications to the standard hierarchy.
Committees
Committees are one of the oldest and most common methods of modifying 
a hierarchy. Committees are especially useful when a pro­cess falls outside 
the traditional departmental domains and the single chain of command. In 
response, man­ag­ers from the related domains create a committee of repre­
sentatives from the units involved. Standing committees often deal with 
ongoing issues, such as staff development. Ad hoc, or temporary, committees 
are formed as required by circumstances. For instance, in the hiring pro­cess, 
many libraries use search committees. The power held by committees varies. 
In some libraries, committees have the authority to establish policy; in 
­others, they play only an advisory role.
Committees provide a means to bring a wide variety of knowledge and 
experience to bear on a topic. The participation of staff members can be useful

in fostering employees’ commitment to policies and decisions. Committees 
are often slow to act, however, and they are costly ­because they consume time 
that participants could be using in other ways.
Proj­ect Management
Proj­ect management teams (in some organ­izations called task forces) are 
similar to ad hoc committees, except that their assignment is often full time 
rather than part time; employees generally leave their primary jobs to devote 
all their time to working on a specific proj­ect for a given period. Typically, 
the proj­ect management team is working on a temporary task to create a 
specific product, ser­vice, or result; upon completion, the group’s members 
return to their primary jobs. The proj­ect management approach is particu­
larly valuable when the undertaking:
•	 Is a one-­time task that has a broad scope and specific, definable results
•	 Is unfamiliar or lacks pre­ce­dent
•	 Calls for a high degree of interdependence among the tasks, and
•	 Is of high importance.
Proj­ect management has been utilized in libraries for many years, but 
it is becoming more common as libraries use proj­ect management groups to 
deal with new, unfamiliar, or complicated proj­ects, such as the installation 
of an integrated library system or the building of a new fa­cil­i­ty. At the Uni­
versity of Arizona, proj­ect management has been used for over 30 proj­ects, 
including digitizing a print index, implementing the library’s institutional 
repository ser­vice, and planning for the closure of a branch library.30 Uni­
versity College Dublin Library used proj­ect management in planning, devel­
opment, and management of its institutional repository ser­vice.31 Formal 
proj­ect management methodologies have been developed to assist with deal­
ing with the complexity of managing the vast array of issues within a typi­
cal proj­ect. In addition, specific software is often utilized to help with cost 
control, allocation of ­people and resources, communication, collaboration, and 
scheduling.32
Matrix Orga­nizational Structure
First introduced in the aerospace industry in the 1960s, the matrix 
structure is less straightforward than the traditional hierarchical organ­
ization. The matrix structure is a permanent structure that combines proj­ect 
management with departments or­ga­nized by function. Proj­ect management 
is superimposed over ­those departments as a horizontal overlay, hence the 
name matrix. In proj­ect management, group members are withdrawn from 
their departments and temporarily assigned to the proj­ect man­ag­er, and 
for the duration of the proj­ect, group members must report to both the proj­
ect man­ag­er and their department supervisor. In matrix management, 
dual assignments become part of the permanent orga­nizational pattern. An 
employee in a matrix organ­ization has two or more upward reporting lines to 
bosses from dif­fer­ent sections such as product, function, or region.33 A matrix 
management structure represents an attempt to retain the advantages of 
functional specialization, while adding the improved coordination that is 

204  Organ­izing
characteristic of proj­ect management. The Readers’ Ser­vice Department 
illustrated in figure 9.2 uses a matrix orga­nizational model. In this example, 
the librarians divide their time (in varying proportions) among several func­
tions, each of which has a coordinator. Each of the librarians reports not only 
to the assistant director but also to a coordinator of a specific function.
Although many businesses, including banks, insurance companies, and 
chemical manufacturers, have implemented a matrix orga­nizational pattern, 
this structure is still not common. One reason it has not been more widely 
­adopted is that it is often confusing. Matrix organ­izations violate many man­
agement princi­ples, especially the princi­ple of unity of command, which was 
discussed in Chapter 8. The ­simple chain of command is replaced by multiple 
authority relationships, in which man­ag­ers function as team leaders rather 
than as traditional man­ag­ers.34 ­People who work in such an environment need 
to be able to tolerate a ­great deal of ambiguity. As two library man­ag­ers wrote, 
matrix management is “difficult to implement. It runs against our cultural 
bias, and it is sufficiently complex and ambiguous that it requires virtually 
constant monitoring to keep it ­running well. Most of us have lived in hierar­
chical organ­izations all of our lives and it is difficult for us to even visualize, 
much less adapt to, another form of organ­ization.”35
Consequently, few libraries have ­adopted a pure matrix organ­ization. 
Some of the few that tried it have abandoned the structure.36 Similarly, in 
the for-­profit sector, a number of corporations experimented with the matrix 
management orga­nizational pattern and then eliminated it ­because of its 
FIGURE 9.2. A Readers’ Ser­vices Department Or­ga­nized with 
a Matrix Structure

complexity and lack of clear-­cut authority lines. Although few libraries use 
the pure form of matrix organ­ization, matrix-­like structures such as proj­
ect management teams exist in many libraries ­today, ­either as part of their 
overall orga­nizational structure or in specific units of the library.37 Some 
libraries have implemented a quasi-­matrix structure where librarians devote 
a portion of their time to a subject area while spending part of their time on 
a functional area of expertise.38 Embedded librarians, discussed in the last 
chapter often have matrix-­like reporting patterns.39 Despite the difficulties 
associated with matrix organ­izations, the flexibility associated with the 
matrix seems to be well suited to ­today’s environment, and as a result, it is 
likely that more libraries ­will fully or partially implement matrix-­like struc­
tures in the ­future.
Teams
An increasing number of libraries are using teams, which provide yet 
another way of modifying the traditional hierarchy. The team approach pro­
vides a basic redesign of how work is accomplished; instead of man­ag­ers over­
seeing groups, groups manage themselves. When employees work as a group 
to perform related tasks, the overall pro­cess is no longer a set of individual 
jobs but a shared group task. Self-­managing or autonomous teams take over 
many of the functions traditionally reserved for man­ag­ers, including deter­
mining work schedules and assigning jobs. Self-­managing teams sometimes 
go by other names (self-­directed, self-­maintaining, self-­leading, and self-­
regulating work teams, to name a few), depending on the organ­ization, but 
their duties are similar. Such teams are groups of employees charged with a 
complete, self-­contained package of tasks that relates ­either to a final prod­
uct or to an ongoing pro­cess. Team members possess a variety of technical 
skills and are encouraged to develop new ones in order to increase their ver­
satility, flexibility, and value to the work team. Through per­for­mance sched­
uling and output inspection, the team monitors and reviews the overall 
pro­cess or product, often assigning problem-­solving tasks to group members. 
The team approach fosters creativity and risk taking by creating a climate 
in which members listen to one another and feel ­free to put forth ideas with­
out being criticized.
Libraries began using self-­managed teams in the late 1980s, and their 
popularity grew in the 1990s. Now, in the 21st ­century, self-­managing work 
teams are one of the most common overlays to the bureaucratic structure of 
large libraries. Some libraries have used the team approach throughout the 
enterprise, whereas ­others use teams only in a few departments. Although 
­there are no comprehensive statistics about the number of libraries using 
teams, a 2011 survey of academic librarians reported 28 ­percent of the librar­
ies responding ­were entirely team-­based, 33 ­percent ­were partially team-­
based, and 39 ­percent ­were not using teams.40 Among academic libraries at 
least, the use of teams is very common, and teams are increasingly used in 
other types of libraries. Despite their increasing popularity, organ­izations 
that have switched to the team approach report that ­doing so is neither easy 
nor fast. The hierarchical format, with all of its deficiencies, is still the most 
familiar one to both man­ag­ers and employees, and sometimes the old cer­
tainties look very alluring. It is impor­tant for any library considering teams 
to understand that becoming a team-­based organ­ization means undergoing 
a radical change in orga­nizational culture. Chapter 17 contains more infor­
mation on managing teams and team building.

206  Organ­izing
Reshaping the Library’s 
Orga­nizational Structure
Although ­there are yet few signs of a radical reor­ga­ni­za­tion of libraries, 
man­ag­ers in all types of libraries are considering implementing new types 
of orga­nizational structures to enable them to better serve their users. In 
general, most are considering ways to flatten their structures and to make 
their organ­izations more flexible and responsive. However, any reor­ga­ni­za­
tion is complicated ­because the changes typically have to occur while the 
library continues to provide current ser­vices.
If a library decides to proceed with reor­ga­ni­za­tion, the first step is to 
decide what type of structure is needed. Peter Drucker, who has written 
much about orga­nizational structure, provides three ways to determine 
this: (1) activities analy­sis, (2) decision analy­sis, and (3) relations analy­sis.41 
The activities analy­sis requires the man­ag­er to perform a detailed and thor­
ough analy­sis of all activities so as to determine what work has to be per­
formed, which activities belong together, and where ­these activities should 
be placed in the orga­nizational structure. The decision analy­sis identifies the 
kinds of decisions that are needed, where in the structure of the organ­ization 
they should be made, and the degree of involvement of each man­ag­er in the 
decision-­making pro­cess. The relations analy­sis emphasizes the relationships 
among the units of the orga­nizational structure, the responsibilities of each 
man­ag­er to the vari­ous units, and the responsibilities of the vari­ous units to 
each man­ag­er.
Man­ag­ers interested in implementing structural changes should learn 
as much as pos­si­ble from reading on the topic and talking to ­others who have 
gone through such changes. Analyses such as the ones Drucker proposes can 
be helpful in conceptualizing the best type of structure for a specific library. 
Techniques such as ­those used in business pro­cess reengineering, which 
focus upon reexamining an organ­ization’s critical pro­cesses, can also be use­
ful. In addition, it is helpful to gather information from as many of the library 
stakeholders as pos­si­ble including data, especially about library use and 
satisfaction. Often task forces are assembled to help provide input from 
many constituencies.42 Some librarians have used con­sul­tants during this 
planning pro­cess; ­others have done it with planning committees drawn from 
library employees; still ­others have used both approaches. In the end, though, 
a structure should be chosen for a par­tic­u­lar organ­ization ­because it serves 
Practice Your Skills
You are the director of the Brickton Public Library, a large public library in a major 
U.S. city, that has just restructured its organ­ization and implemented team-­based 
management throughout the system. It has been brought to your attention that Ms. 
Kasey, the former head of the cata­loging department is not ­doing well ­under the new 
system. She is now a member of the cata­loging team but appears to be very unhappy. 
She is disruptive at team meetings, speaks out publicly against the new type of organ­
ization, and is even suspected of trying to sabotage the work of the cata­loging team. You 
have scheduled a meeting to speak with Ms. Kasey.
What is ­going on ­here, and what approach would you take to try to solve this prob­
lem? What would you say during your meeting?

Designing Adaptive Organizational Structures  207
Talk About It
“Library reorganizations are difficult, time consuming, and evoke in staff a fear of change 
exacerbated by the knowledge that the change ­will not be an abstraction, but something 
that ­will directly affect their lives and jobs. Existing job classifications and descriptions, 
and perhaps even salaries, are in question when the library embarks on a reor­ga­ni­za­
tion, and ­there are, inevitably, winners and losers.”43
Imagine that you are a director of a library and have deci­ded that the pres­ent 
structure is obsolete and needs to be replaced. How could you help alleviate some of the 
difficulties that Rhoda Channing described in the paragraph above?
that organ­ization’s specific needs, not ­because it is being implemented 
elsewhere.
The second step in any structural change is to consider ­whether the 
employees ­will be able to work effectively in the proposed new structure. One 
aspect to contemplate is the personal style of the organ­ization’s man­ag­ers. 
Not all man­ag­ers adjust well to a flatter, less bureaucratic style of organ­
ization. Would a drastic change to the library’s structure be congruent with 
the pres­ent man­ag­ers’ styles? If not, it ­will likely fail, ­unless the struc­
tural changes are accompanied by other changes, such as replacing man­
ag­ers or providing them with in-­depth training on how to manage in the 
new environment.
­Those who learned to manage in the command-­and-­control mode often 
feel more comfortable using that style of management. However, top-­level 
man­ag­ers likely ­will not be the only personnel who need help adjusting to a 
new structure. Many lower-­level staff and ­middle man­ag­ers also may find 
the transition difficult. All employees should have access to staff development 
programs that ­will ready them for the new structure. Again, the ­human side 
of the organ­ization ­will be critical in the success or failure of a new type of 
orga­nizational structure. It cannot be stressed too much that dif­fer­ent struc­
tures ­will demand dif­fer­ent types of management expertise and dif­fer­ent 
types of employee skills, and that worker training ­will be crucial. As the 
director of one library that has reor­ga­nized wrote, “The key to making the 
reor­ga­ni­za­tion work is staff education and training. This point cannot be 
overemphasized. Moreover, educational efforts must target all staff, includ­
ing management.”38
The third step is to develop a strategy for transitioning from the cur­
rent configuration to the new configuration. This is the implementation stage 
of the pro­cess. Recent accounts of libraries’ approaches to restructuring pro­
vide some insights and guidance. Indeed, according to ­these accounts, suc­
cessful restructuring always includes a ­great deal of employee input. ­Unless 
employees understand the reasons for the structural change and buy into 
that change, the transformation is unlikely to be effective. Staffers must 
understand the concepts under­lying the new structure in order to partici­
pate fully. Further, ­because a successful transformation requires staff devel­
opment and training during both planning and implementation phases, the 
undertaking calls for a large investment of time and money.
Throughout the entire pro­cess, effective communication is essential. It 
needs to be both internal and external, ­because the library is usually part 
of a larger organ­ization that must also be informed about the proposed 

208  Organ­izing
changes. (Orga­nizational communication ­will be discussed in depth in chap­
ter 16.) If man­ag­ers neglect to keep employees abreast of proposed changes, 
rumors ­will be rampant. Changes in orga­nizational structures can be very 
threatening, but good communication helps alleviate employee anxiety. 
Almost all the descriptions of organ­ization transformation in libraries and 
other settings have stressed the time, effort, and expense involved in the pro­
cess, with most commenting that implementation took longer than they had 
anticipated.
The last step is to realize that, even ­after the reor­ga­ni­za­tion is accom­
plished, the pro­cess is likely not finished. Some method of assessment must 
be built into the pro­cess so workers can determine:
•	 ­Whether the new structure is successfully carry­ing out the organ­
ization’s goals and objectives
•	 What aspects are working well, and
•	 Which ­things still need to be changed.
In most settings, participants consider the reor­ga­ni­za­tion to be an iter­
ative pro­cess. Typically, not every­thing works well ­after the first reor­ga­ni­
za­tion attempt; planners have to fine-­tune some ­things and correct some 
­mistakes. Nevertheless, with greater flexibility built into the system, facing 
­future changes ­will be easier, and the restructuring pro­cess ­will be seen as 
an evolutionary one.
In summary, any structural reor­ga­ni­za­tion requires effort and cannot 
be implemented quickly. ­People ­will make ­mistakes during the pro­cess. To 
preserve the momentum, it is impor­tant to reward small successes along the 
way and to keep employees focused on the anticipated results of the reor­ga­
ni­za­tion. If the library’s staff feels mired in the pro­cess of structural change, 
they can gain encouragement from published reports about libraries that 
have finished the initial stages of reor­ga­ni­za­tion. Almost all report greater 
productivity, increased flexibility, better communication, and improved deci­
sion making.
The Library Organ­ization of the ­Future
As we have seen, libraries, like many other institutions, are moving 
slowly away from rigid hierarchies to more organic forms of organ­ization. 
Such a move helps address tensions that often exist in libraries between the 
professional status of many employees and the traditional bureaucratic form.
Libraries have been seeking to identify the most appropriate orga­
nizational structure for many de­cades now, a period in which libraries have 
under­gone a dramatic transformation. The changes that have already 
occurred have led many to speculate about the libraries of the ­future. Much 
of this speculation has centered on the ­future of a library as a physical entity. 
It is true that the digital revolution has changed the old conception of a library 
as being just a “place.”
A ­great deal has been written about the virtual library and the library 
without walls. In the strictest sense, such a library would not be a physical 
entity at all; the storage function traditionally performed by libraries would 
be eliminated, ­because all information would be available via computer tech­
nology. The libraries that have gone the furthest in assuming this type of 
structure have been in corporations. Some large multinational firms rely 

Designing Adaptive Organizational Structures  209
heavi­ly on information professionals in widely separated locations who pro­
vide that information via electronic resources. Typically, ­these types of librar­
ies have very small collections. ­Because the professionals employed in ­these 
libraries function as parts of virtual teams, they can work together despite 
rarely seeing one another face-­to-­face.44 The PH&S Library described ear­
lier in the chapter is one that is moving in this direction.
It is in ­these types of libraries that we see the closest approximation to 
a new orga­nizational model being implemented in some for-­profit enterprises. 
­These new organ­izations are often called virtual, boundaryless, or networked 
organ­izations, and although dif­fer­ent ­people use the terms slightly differ­
ently, in general they all describe a structure that is geo­graph­i­cally dispersed 
and undergirded by information and communication technology. Rather than 
being ­housed ­under one roof, ­these types of organ­izations are not defined or 
limited by horizontal, vertical, or external bound­aries; instead, they are 
widely dispersed, and can grow and shrink as needed. Usually, they have a 
small hub that coordinates the organ­ization’s functions, but most of the rest 
of the organ­ization is subcontracted. The networked organ­ization is com­
mon in the corporate world. For example, in December 2015, Apple directly 
employed 66,000 employees in the United States, and ­there ­were another 
627,000 employees worldwide employed to supporting the iOS ecosystem.45 
Many of ­those other employees ­were in countries such as China and working 
for other companies that engineer, build, and assem­ble iPads, iPhones, and 
other Apple products. Only a minority of them works directly for Apple; most 
are employed by subcontractors. Networked organ­izations provide a high 
level of flexibility. As circumstances demand, they can expand, contract, and 
swiftly change directions. ­There is ­little administrative overhead.
Of course, ­these networked organ­izations also have disadvantages. 
Decentralization and distance make them harder to coordinate. Employee 
loyalty is low ­because the link between employees and the organ­ization is 
very weak.46 The networked organ­ization can demand certain standards in 
working conditions, but ­because the majority of employees are distant, ­these 
standards are often disregarded. Bradsher and Duhigg describe the long 
hours, coerced overtime, and harsh working conditions endured by many 
workers at the FoxConn City fa­cil­i­ty in China, where iPhones and iPads are 
manufactured.47 Figure 9.3 depicts a networked organ­ization.
As libraries become less dependent on place, more of them may take on 
a networked or virtual structure. Already, many libraries are displaying com­
ponents of virtual organ­izations. For instance, the libraries that are mem­
bers of Question Point, a 24–7 virtual reference ser­vice, are able to provide 
reference ser­vice to their users at any time or place thanks to an interna­
tional, digital network of libraries.48 Almost all librarians now have access 
to collections of electronic resources that are not owned or managed by the 
library itself but by some sort of a library aggregator.
It is easy to imagine that the first totally virtual library might be part 
of one of the universities that serves only distance students. ­These universi­
ties are linked into a vast network and provide classes to students situated 
across the country and the world. Consequently, one might imagine such 
universities incorporating a library with a network type of orga­nizational 
structure. In networked organ­izations, a central core or hub coordinates the 
enterprise, with all of the other functions subcontracted or outsourced to 
other groups that are linked electronically to that core. The functions of the 
library would be geo­graph­i­cally dispersed. Though the individuals in the core 
of the library might still be ­housed near the university’s central offices, the 
other units could be almost anywhere in the world, thanks to the electronic 

210  Organ­izing
linkage. The individuals working in the core could outsource electronic mate­
rials’ acquisition and licensing, user assistance, and perhaps user instruc­
tion to help students wherever they might be. Systems specialists could be 
located at a distance. If users ­were billed for the use of material, the neces­
sary accounting department could also be located off-­site. Meanwhile, the 
­people in the central core would be the administrative nexus that would coor­
dinate this networked library, even if all of its functions ­were supplied from 
elsewhere. The only interaction between librarians and users would be elec­
tronic. This type of library would be truly virtual.
In the near ­future, few libraries ­will take this route, but some are con­
templating such a ­future. The libraries at the Mas­sa­chu­setts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) have released a preliminary report that envisions the MIT 
libraries as an “open global platform” providing ­people worldwide (regard­
less of ­whether they are affiliated with MIT) access to information they need 
to help solve global challenges, such as access to clean ­water.49 The report is 
still preliminary and does not provide specifics about the orga­nizational 
structure of this global platform (it is recommended that another group be 
formed to study library redesign); however, this vision is one of a library mov­
ing in the direction of being a boundaryless organ­ization.
The move ­towards more networked libraries raises the question of how 
long libraries ­will continue to exist as actually physical spaces. Some librar­
ies, Georgia Tech’s being one of the most recent, are redefining the library 
from a place filled with books to an online ser­vice organ­ization. Ninety-­five 
FIGURE 9.3. A Networked Organ­ization

­percent of all the books in the Georgia Tech collection have been moved to a 
storage fa­cil­i­ty.50 It is likely that more academic libraries ­will go to a model 
of small satellite libraries, containing just a few books and journals, scat­
tered throughout the campus; ­these libraries would mostly transmit infor­
mation online. Students and faculty also would have access to electronic 
resources from their dormitory rooms, offices, or homes. Most special libraries 
­will continue to have small collections with more and more of their informa­
tion provided electronically. Public libraries could be much more decen­
tralized, with small branches or kiosks in government offices, businesses, 
shopping malls, or other locations. The branches would not have to own a 
large number of materials; instead, the librarian could have material avail­
able electronically and could respond to users’ needs upon request. Public 
library patrons would have access to materials from their home computers. 
However, public libraries considering such a ­future need to be certain that 
all their patrons continue to have equitable access to the collections. ­These 
libraries would also have to consider how to provide ser­vices, such as toddler’s 
story times, that are difficult to replicate virtually. It is likely that despite 
­these moves ­towards virtual libraries, at least in the near ­future, most librar­
ies ­will continue to exist as physical spaces although perhaps with a smaller 
footprint than before.
New technologies ­will doubtless continue to have a major impact on the 
structure of all types of libraries, but, at this point, one can only speculate 
about the ultimate effects. Many conjecture that technological advances ­will 
permit libraries of the ­future to be even more decentralized, thus providing 
their users with the geo­graph­i­cally dispersed, individualized ser­vice that 
they have always preferred. Efforts to introduce more flexibility into librar­
ies and information centers, including the use of cross-­functional teams, are 
likely to lead to libraries and information centers with more fluid bound­aries 
between departments. Even more changes in library structure are likely, 
accustoming workers to organ­izations that periodically are reshaped to fit 
new needs.51 In the libraries of the ­future, man­ag­ers ­will have to pay even 
closer attention to orga­nizational structures to ensure they continue to 
achieve library objectives.
In short, the libraries of 2050 ­will be dif­fer­ent from ­those of ­today. The last 
de­cades have brought huge changes in the orga­nizational structure of librar­
ies: the flattening of the hierarchy, the use of teams, and the greater inclu­
sion of employees in decision making. However, the perfect orga­nizational 
design for ­today’s libraries has not been found, primarily ­because ­there is 
more than just one successful model. An organ­ization’s design should be con­
tingent upon its environment, its objectives, the tasks employees must per­
form to achieve ­those objectives, and the characteristics of ­these employees. 
Each library ­will need to discover what works best for a par­tic­u­lar situation 
and it ­will likely to be common to have more than one type of structure within 
an organ­ization.52
Although organ­izations must be ready to change their forms in response 
to changing conditions and needs, too much or too frequent reor­ga­ni­za­tion 
can be disastrous. The structure’s core must remain stable, ­because neither 
an organ­ization nor its employees can function effectively while anticipating 
yet another complete restructuring. Robert Kaplan and David Norton warn 
that following the latest trends about restructuring can sometimes lead to 
“nightmares as companies start engaging in expensive and distracting 
restructuring.”53 They argue that it is far more effective to choose a design 
that works reasonably well, and then to develop a system to keep the structure 
in tune with the organ­ization’s strategy. As they point out, reor­ga­ni­za­tion is 

212  Organ­izing
extremely expensive, and new structures often create new orga­nizational 
prob­lems that replace the ones they ­were designed to overcome. Restructur­
ing an organ­ization is not to be undertaken lightly; for most librarians, the 
decision not to abandon the traditional structure but instead merely to rede­
sign around the edges is likely to have been a wise one. Fine-­tuning an 
existing structure is far easier than implementing a completely new one.
Like every­thing ­else, management trends change over time. At pres­ent, 
the flat orga­nizational structure is in fashion. What we should learn from the 
pendulum swing of management trends is that any prob­lem has more than 
one solution, and that it is a ­mistake to adopt any prevailing model (of orga­
nizational structure or anything ­else) without seeing ­whether that model 
suits the circumstances of one’s par­tic­u­lar organ­ization. For example, the 
rush to flatten structures has taught us a ­great deal. In certain types of 
organ­izations, flatter structures ­will provide more efficiency and effective­
ness, but flattening is not the only, or necessarily the best, approach to use 
for ­every organ­ization. Library man­ag­ers can, and should, avoid the pendu­
lum swings by systematically addressing the entire range of orga­nizational 
issues including structure and culture. The staff in each organ­ization must 
consider the needs of its users and only then design a structure to help it 
achieve its objectives. As much as pos­si­ble, man­ag­ers should involve library 
employees in designing the new organ­ization. Broad employee participation 
­will create a better structure, ­because the employees have detailed knowl­
edge of their departments’ workings, and that knowledge ­will ensure that the 
rationale ­behind the new structure is clear. Such participation ­will also make 
it easier to implement the new structure, ­because participation strength­
ens ­people’s commitment to the final product.
Conclusion
Each organ­ization must be structured in a way that enables it to achieve 
its objectives. The structure must allow workers to specialize while also coor­
dinating and integrating the activities of ­those workers. Although organ­izing 
is one of the most impor­tant managerial functions, it must be remembered 
that it is not an end in itself; it is merely a means to allow the organ­ization 
to reach its goals. The design princi­ples discussed in this section are tools, 
which in themselves are neither good nor bad. They can be used properly or 
improperly, and that ­will determine the outcome.
To obtain the greatest pos­si­ble simplicity and the greatest fit, organ­
ization designers must start out with a clear focus on crucial activities that 
produce key results. ­Those activities have to be structured and positioned in 
the simplest pos­si­ble configuration. Above all, the architect of the organ­ization 
must keep in mind the organ­ization’s purpose.
Orga­nizational structures fail if they do not encourage workers to per­
form at their highest levels. As many experts have noted, too much reor­ga­
ni­za­tion can result in a demoralized workforce, especially when the employees 
do not understand or have ­little input into the orga­nizational changes. In 
such cases, employees may feel that the orga­nizational structure is consid­
ered far more impor­tant than the ­people who work ­there. In many cases, 
reor­ga­ni­za­tion has led to downsizing, resulting in many workers losing their 
jobs, while ­those who remain feel overworked and anxious about orga­nizational 
instability. At the same time, ironically, man­ag­ers in ­these restructured 
organ­izations often stress the importance of their employees while treating 
large numbers of them in a very cavalier fashion.

Designing Adaptive Organizational Structures  213
An organ­ization’s structure is impor­tant, but its employees are more 
impor­tant. So, while libraries and other types of organ­izations search for 
more efficient, more suitable structures, man­ag­ers must keep in mind that 
any structure’s effectiveness depends primarily on the per­for­mance of the 
­people working ­there. ­Today’s most successful organ­izations are ­those in 
which top executives meet environmental and competitive demands by focus­
ing less on the quest for an ideal structure and more on developing the abili­
ties, be­hav­ior, and per­for­mance of individual man­ag­ers.
The next two sections of this book ­will focus on the organ­ization’s 
employees and ­will discuss the managerial functions of dealing with ­human 
resources and leading. They ­will cover the impor­tant and challenging issues 
associated with the ­people who work within an organ­ization.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 When Warren Newport Public Library, a medium-­size library outside of Chi­
cago, deci­ded to reor­ga­nize, it went about it in this way: “Whereas the standard 
corporate reor­ga­ni­za­tion often involves merging departments, this exercise 
began at the task level with a zero-­based approach to what we ­were ­doing and 
who would most logically get it done. The exercise began with a comprehensive 
listing of current library activities at all levels of ser­vice, both in contact with 
our customers and ­behind the scenes. ­Every activity was evaluated for rele­
vance in relation to the library’s current long-­range planning goals, and we 
culled unnecessary activities from the final list. The remaining activities ­were 
then grouped together functionally, and logical patterns of oversight emerged”.54
Think about a library with which you are familiar. Assume that the library 
has deci­ded to reor­ga­nize and to adopt the approach described in this excerpt. 
Identify the list of activities that are currently done, evaluate each for current 
relevance, and then group them together in a logical fashion that could form 
the basis of a restructuring.
2.	Sydney Smith has just been appointed as director of the Piedmont University 
(PU) Library and, as is often the case, this new director has arrived with ideas 
about how to make the library function better. The staff expects that ­there ­will 
be changes made in many aspects of the organ­ization as a result. The PU library 
has had the same orga­nizational structure since 1999, and both the director 
and the staff feel it is outdated. Although the provision of digital resources and 
ser­vices has become a primary focus of the library, its orga­nizational structure 
does not reflect this. In addition, Smith came from an institution that success­
fully used teams in the library and thinks that a team-­based structure might 
work in this library also. The staff knows that changes need to be made, but at 
the same time, they are a bit apprehensive about losing their old comfortable ways 
of ­doing ­things. The director has appointed a committee to recommend what 
modifications should be made in the library’s organ­ization and to propose a 
timetable for restructuring.
The scenario described above has become common in libraries of all types. 
Imagine that you are a member of the committee appointed to recommend mod­
ifications to the organ­ization structure. What methods would you use to decide 
how to restructure? How would you ­handle the transition between the old and 
new? How you would deal with any employees who are threatened by change?

214  Organ­izing
3.	The librarians in one small library who deci­ded to change from a hierarchical 
to a collegial structure explained their reasoning as follows:
“[W]e previously had a vestigial hierarchy, laid out in a pyramid ­shaped 
chart that mimicked standard library organ­izations: we had a director, 
heads of technical and public ser­vices, and the remaining librarians in a 
third tier. But having three layers of hierarchy among six librarians makes 
about as much sense as having a captain and a first mate in a rowboat. . . . ​
In fast-­changing times, we ­couldn’t work within a system, however vestigial, 
in which some of us stood around waiting for ­orders—or in which ­people 
best positioned to make informed decisions felt compelled to go through 
layers of command for approval. And in practice, we usually ignored ­those 
vestiges of traditional hierarchy. It made sense to us that the best decisions 
are made by a group of ­people working together with a shared knowledge 
base and a shared sense of responsibility for the entire operation.”55
What would be gained by eliminating the hierarchy in this library? What 
might be lost?
4.	A new governor has just been elected who ran on the campaign pledge to make 
state government more efficient. He wants to trim the “fat” and eliminate bureau­
cratic bloat. He has deci­ded to begin his improvements by focusing on the Motor 
Vehicle Department (MVD), the state agency that issues ­drivers’ licenses, vehicle 
plates, and registrations. He visited a nearby MVD and spent some time observ­
ing. He reported that even before the office opened, the line of ­people waiting was 
already long. By midday, the line extended around the building. Inside custom­
ers waited in slow moving lines before poorly marked win­dows to get or renew 
a driver’s license or to get a registration or a tag. Often when customers fi­nally 
got to the clerk, they discovered that they ­were standing in the wrong line and 
­were asked to go somewhere ­else. Customers ­were frequently upset and the clerks 
appeared to be overworked and rude. The Governor then went to a McDonald’s 
for lunch. ­There he found that ­there ­were several lines that moved quickly. 
­There was good signage with the menu vis­i­ble when a customer entered. The 
workers ­were polite; if an order could not be immediately filled the customer was 
asked to step aside and then brought to the front of the line to receive the com­
pleted order. The restaurant was very clean and had a friendly feel to it. The 
governor began to won­der why the MVD ­couldn’t be more like a McDonald’s.
The governor has just hired you as a con­sul­tant to improve the quality of 
the Motor Vehicle Department offices around the state. What ideas might you 
borrow from McDonald’s to improve ser­vice at the MVD? What are some of the 
issues and prob­lems of redesigning the MVD to be more like McDonald’s? What 
would be some of the first changes you would make? What princi­ples of organ­
ization design are you following?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Carl Guarino, a top executive of SEI, a large successful financial ser­vices organ­
ization, stated, “We reject the idea that ­because ­people sit at the top of the organ­
ization, power resides with them and control comes down the line. Power is 
much more diffused and dispersed in this organ­ization. Power ­doesn’t come

from position, but from influence and the ability to engineer consensus—­not in 
the Japa­nese sense of una­nim­i­ty but in terms of the participation and support 
required to get ­things done.”56
SEI’s approach violates many of the tenets of bureaucracy. What do you 
see as the major advantages and disadvantages of this type of organ­ization?
2.	Two professors from the University of Amsterdam’s School of Business, J. Strik­
werda and J. W. Stoelhorst, interviewed a number of business executives. They 
reported that ­these executives “had nothing positive to say about the organ­
izing princi­ples of the matrix organ­ization.” This type of structure was viewed 
very negatively with executives stating it resulted in “unclear responsibilities, 
a lack of accountability, and po­liti­cal ­battles over resources resulting in risk-­
averse be­hav­ior and loss of market share.57
In theory, the matrix structure offers many advantages. However, it is a 
difficult structure to implement. What are the major prob­lems you see with the 
structure? Do you think you would like to work in an organ­ization that utilizes 
a matrix form of organ­ization?
3.	Although the bureaucratic form of orga­nizational structure has been criticized 
in recent years, it still has many proponents. Elliot Jaques, in an article entitled 
“In Praise of Hierarchy,” wrote, “The hierarchical kind of organ­ization we call 
bureaucracy did not emerge accidentally. It is the only form of organ­ization that 
can enable a com­pany to employ a large number of ­people and yet preserve unam­
biguous accountability for the work they do. And that is why, despite all its 
prob­lems, it has so doggedly persisted.”58
What aspects of the bureaucratic structure allow it to preserve account­
ability for a large number of employees? Why have large organ­izations, includ­
ing libraries, historically favored this form of structure? Why are organ­izations 
trying to move away from bureaucratic structures?
4.	Carla Stouffle, former library director at the University of Arizona, which was 
one of the first organ­izations to adopt a team-­based structure, wrote, “Perhaps 
the library personnel who have to make the greatest changes and who ­will face 
the most difficulties in the transformation of the library are library adminis­
trators. The roles of the director, assistant directors, and department heads must 
change from man­ag­ers, controllers, directors of activities, deciders and evalua­
tors to leaders, coaches and facilitators. All ­these administrators must be will­
ing to give up a ­great deal of decision-­making authority and become much more 
comfortable with being challenged, having to explain, not having the last say, 
and living with ambiguity and uncertainty.”59
Why do administrators have prob­lems abandoning the traditional hierar­
chy? What steps could be taken to help them adjust more easily?

Section 4
­Human Resources
­After an orga­nizational structure is developed for a library or information 
center, the next area is learning about the ­people who work within that struc­
ture. This area is called ­human resources (HR).
The ­human resources functions encompass all the tasks of attracting 
and retaining an organ­ization’s staff. ­These tasks include recruitment, 
se­lection, training, evaluation, compensation, and development of employees. 
All of ­these responsibilities are termed ­human resources management. The 
reason for the use of “­human resources” is that organ­izations understand 
that in addition to bud­get and the physical plant, the ­people who work in the 
library have a ­great value and are also resources. All resources are impor­
tant, but good ­human resources are the greatest asset an organ­ization can 
have.
The “­Human Resources” section of this textbook provides an overview 
of this aspect of library and information center management. Chapter 10 
describes the dif­fer­ent types of employees who work in a typical library, dis­
cusses the orga­nizational framework that must be established before an 
enterprise can begin hiring staff, and provides an overview of the pro­cess of 
recruiting and hiring. Chapter 11 focuses on functions that relate directly 
to the individuals who hold jobs within an organ­ization. ­These employee-­
centered functions include training, developing, evaluating, compensating, 
and disciplining. Fi­nally, chapter 12 looks at some of the general issues that 
have affected ­human resources management in libraries: covering such top­
ics as personnel procedures and policies, ­career development, mentoring, 
health and safety, external regulations, and ­unionization.

Staffing the Library
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Know the types of jobs available in libraries and information centers
•	 Understand the ele­ments of a job description
•	 Recognize that libraries want to attract a diverse workforce
•	 Know the steps to filling a position and applying for a position
One of a library man­ag­er’s most impor­tant functions is structuring the 
organ­ization’s ­human resources. This ­human resources (HR) function com­
prises many ele­ments, but two of the most basic are structuring and defining 
all the positions within an organ­ization and then finding capable individu­
als to do ­those jobs. Of course, this work is normally done incrementally, since 
any organ­ization is unlikely to have all jobs open at one time.
This chapter ­will provide an introduction to the HR function of manage­
ment. It ­will give an overview of the types of workers employed by libraries 
and how their positions are structured. ­After that, it ­will examine the pro­cess 
of recruiting and hiring employees.
Way in the past, employees often ­were considered interchangeable, easily 
replaced components of their organ­izations, but a dif­fer­ent view predominates 
­today. Man­ag­ers now consider their employees to be resources, just as the 
funding to operate the organ­ization and the building in which it is ­housed are 
resources. The HR function of management has been transformed by this 
attitude ­toward employees. HR specialists are considered a strategic part of 

222  ­Huma n Resource
the management team, instead of merely paper-­pushing clerical workers. 
They spend much of their time matching orga­nizational prob­lems to HR solu­
tions and, by ­doing so, demonstrating the impact that HR has on the bud­
getary bottom line.1
Large libraries usually have specially trained man­ag­ers who oversee 
HR. Often ­these HR/personnel directors have a master’s degree in library 
and information science (MLIS) with additional course work and experi­
ence in HR management. Many libraries and information agencies, how­
ever, are too small to have someone serve as a full-­time HR or personnel 
specialist. In ­those cases, ­either the director performs the top-­level HR func­
tions relating to the entire organ­ization, or the HR functions are handled 
by the library’s parent organ­ization (for instance, the appropriate county or 
city government office for a public library and the central office for a school 
district).
Even so, in ­every library, large or small, all man­ag­ers, from directors 
down to front-­line supervisors, are involved in HR functions. ­Because almost 
­every operation in the library is affected by how well employees perform, 
library man­ag­ers must be able to ­handle ­people if they want their organ­
ization to be effective and efficient. A man­ag­er’s degree of responsibility for 
HR increases as he or she moves up the hierarchy, but every­one in the organ­
ization should understand the basic princi­ples of HR management.
­After all, ­every man­ag­er must inevitably deal with challenging (and 
sometimes frustrating) people-­related prob­lems. ­There are times when no 
sooner is one personnel prob­lem solved than another develops. Although some 
man­ag­ers have the mistaken notion that every­one can be treated identically, 
techniques that have worked well with one employee frequently ­will not be 
effective when dealing with another, ­because each person is dif­fer­ent. ­Because 
no organ­ization is static, the ­people in it and the prob­lems associated with 
them ­will necessarily change as well. So, although learning the basic princi­
ples of HR management is relatively easy, dealing with employees is a never-­
ending challenge.

This chapter is about staffing the library and mostly written from the perspective of the 
employer. Laura Saunders article, “The Public Ser­vices Job Hunt: Observations and 
Advice,”2 offers advice on successful job hunting from the perspective of a job seeker, pro­
viding advice for ­people new to the library and information center job market. Although 
the article is focused on jobs in public ser­vices, most of the author’s advice ­will apply to 
any job seeker. Saunders begins by saying that applicants for jobs in library and infor­
mation science (LIS) must be strategic in their job hunting and application pro­cess. 
They need to think about what they can offer an institution, what skills and abilities 
they offer.
Saunders starts by discussing what library employers are looking for in ­future 
employees. Key qualities include: technical skills of all kinds, the highly impor­tant 
ability to evaluate new technologies and make decisions and recommendations about 
which to adopt, and the openness and ability to experiment with technology. She also 
noted that reference librarians ­will need to have a good understanding of social

The Increasing Complexity of HR Management
Managing HR has become more complex in the last few de­cades. One 
reason is the increasing diversity of the workforce. As the workforce becomes 
less homogeneous, a man­ag­er has to learn to deal with ­people from many 
dif­fer­ent backgrounds. Diversity is a broad term encompassing not only race, 
media, Web design, and online search skills. But more impor­tant, they ­will need to be 
comfortable with changes to online information delivery including supporting distance 
education.
Although technical skills are impor­tant, some employers focus on interpersonal 
skills, believing that customer orientation, comfort with instruction, and adaptability 
are not ­things that can be taught as easily as technology. Some employers say that non­
library work experience with ­people, such as food ser­vice or retail, are transferable to 
the library environment.
Specific advice on resumes and cover letters includes the warning that all corre­
spondence should be carefully written, without errors. Resumes from recent gradu­ates 
or students in their last semester should begin with education and it is acceptable to 
apply for positions just before you gradu­ate, if you give a graduation date. Work experi­
ence should be listed in reverse chronological order.
The purpose of a resume and cover letter is to show how and why the candidate is 
a perfect match for the open position. Therefore each job opening should have a letter 
and resume that is tailored for that position; it is good to use the words from the job ad 
­here. Employers say never use a standard, generic letter or resume.
Getting the interview shows that the employer thinks you are qualified for the open­
ing. Prepare for the interview by thinking about questions the search committee might 
ask and formulating answers. Also develop good questions for the committee by ­doing 
specific research about the job, environment, and parent institution. The interviewee 
needs to demonstrate a keen interest in the opening and the institution. Successful inter­
viewees ­will always dress in good business attire and be prepared.
Some organ­izations ask for a pre­sen­ta­tion, to show that that the candidate is com­
fortable in front of an audience. Be sure to ask who the audience ­will be, so the pre­sen­
ta­tion ­will be suitable. ­After the interview thank members of the search committee and 
offer your enthusiasm for the opening. Do not contact them again ­unless you have new 
information, such as an accepted paper or article. Depending on the institution, the order 
of the interview and other ­factors such as search committee member illness can prolong 
the wait.
The author advocates networking, which is developing a number of contacts who 
might help advise and advocate for a candidate. Professors are obvious choice, but appli­
cants may also find ­people with whom to network at conferences, in classes, and formally 
through alumni offices. Asking a professional in a desirable organ­ization that may not 
have an opening for an informational interview may be a way to gain information about 
the institution and demonstrate the applicant’s interest and abilities.
Saunders concludes that job hunting can be a full-­time job in itself and may take 
from three to six months. She advises not to get discouraged and to consider expanding 
the job search sights to a broader geographic area or to dif­fer­ent positions or types of 
institutions. She also advises that once a candidate secures that first position, be sure 
to share knowledge and experience and help ­others network.

ethnicity, and gender, but also such characteristics as age and physical abil­
ity. This diversity enriches the organ­ization, but it also can pres­ent prob­lems 
­unless man­ag­ers understand the needs of all their workers and accept the 
challenge of managing a heterogeneous workforce.
Another ­factor that adds complexity to HR management is the level of 
expectations held by most con­temporary workers, especially well-­educated 
employees who expect their jobs to be meaningful and to provide opportuni­
ties for promotion and ­career advancement. Most employees are not content 
to remain in dead-­end jobs where they have no input into the decisions that 
affect them. Library man­ag­ers must therefore seek ways to empower employ­
ees by delegating and decentralizing decision making and by increasing 
employees’ control over their work environment.
Yet another major ­factor that is changing the nature of HR in libraries 
and information centers is technology. In the past two de­cades, technology 
has caused the restructuring of many library jobs, the creation of ­others, and 
the elimination of still ­others. Technology brings many obvious benefits to 
library workers and users; at the same time, it complicates the jobs of man­
ag­ers and employees. For example, some employees find it difficult to adapt 
to technology that is constantly changing. Also, in some organ­izations, tech­
nology is used to monitor employees’ work, which produces stress for many. 
Technology can also create physical prob­lems, often caused by the repetitive 
motions involved in using keyboards for long periods of time. Man­ag­ers have 
had to become more knowledgeable about technology’s potentials and pitfalls 
as well as its impact on employees.
Technology and bud­get limitations have also caused some organ­izations 
to downsize, meaning that in many cases; the remaining staffers do more 
work than they had previously and often work at a higher level. Other organ­
izations are relying more heavi­ly on part-­time or temporary workers, or have 
outsourced pro­cesses that used to be performed internally. Both of ­these situ­
ations pres­ent additional complexities for HR man­ag­ers to ­handle.
As discussed in the previous section of this book, many of the hierarchi­
cal orga­nizational patterns are also being modified ­because of technology. 
Instead of a structure in which all workers report to one supervisor, in many 
organ­izations the workforce is now divided into teams, which, to some extent, 
manage themselves. A team structure ­will benefit workers, but it also pres­
ents new challenges to man­ag­ers.
Lastly, a growing number of external regulations, especially ­those from 
state and federal governments, have made the man­ag­er’s job more compli­
cated. The purpose of ­these employment-­related regulations is to make organ­
izations safer and more equitable. External regulations are not new; laws 
relating to pay, safety, and ­labor relations have been in place for de­cades. 
However, the number of regulations with which organ­izations must comply 
has increased. Man­ag­ers now need to understand and keep abreast of ­these 
vari­ous, often complex, regulations.
Types of Staff
Generally, a diverse group of employees with vari­ous levels of education 
and responsibility are employed in libraries. Indeed, as more technology has 
been incorporated into library pro­cesses, the staff has of necessity become 
more varied.
Professional librarians almost always constitute the smallest group 
of library employees. In general, to be considered a professional librarian,

Practice Your Skills
“One of the best tips I’ve personally ever received [for successful job search preparation] 
is to think ahead before the interview by anticipating questions and preparing answers. 
This allows you to practice ‘elevator speeches.’ ”4 Develop a 30-­second “elevator speech” 
that explains why you want a specific ­career. Practice this speech with another person, 
give and receive feedback, and hone the speech ­until it is brief, to the point, and compel­
ling. This practice ­will help when you experience real interviews.
someone must have earned an MLIS. Sometimes ­these professionals also 
hold another advanced degree (master’s or doctorate) in a par­tic­u­lar subject 
field. This is especially true in academic libraries where librarians often have 
faculty status. The professional librarians do ­those tasks that are predomi­
nantly intellectual and nonroutine, ­those requiring “a special background 
and education on the basis of which library needs are identified, prob­lems are 
analyzed, goals are set, and original and creative solutions are formulated 
for them, integrating theory into practice, and planning, organ­izing, commu­
nicating, and administering successful programs of ser­vice to users of the 
library’s materials and ser­vices.”3 Professional librarians serve in leadership 
roles, directing the total organ­ization along with the vari­ous departments 
and subunits. They also have the necessary expertise to fulfill patrons’ 
information needs and perform complex work in technical areas.
Another set of employees, the support staff, consists of workers perform­
ing a varied set of skilled tasks, from paraprofessional to clerical. The sup­
port staff is usually the library’s largest group of full-­time employees, and 
their activities cover a wide range of essential duties, such as entering, cod­
ing, and verifying bibliographic data; maintaining book funds; ordering new 
materials; circulating materials; claiming serials; and copy cata­loging. This 
support staff ­handles the routine operations in most departments. The edu­
cational backgrounds of ­these workers vary widely. Some may have high 
school diplomas, but many have bachelor’s degrees, and some have gradu­ate 
degrees of vari­ous kinds. Man­ag­ers in libraries need to hire both librarians 
and support staff with strong technology backgrounds. In fact, many librar­
ies and information centers now employ specialists to work specifically with 
technology, for instance, to manage the library’s databases, perform usabil­
ity studies, and maintain Web sites. ­These technology specialists also have 
a variety of types of degrees and training.
In addition, libraries usually employ numerous part-­time employees. 
Part-­time employees, such as pages in public libraries and student assis­
tants in academic libraries, work at easily learned, repetitive tasks, such as 
retrieving items from the stacks, staffing a branch library desk, or shelving 
returned books. Sometimes libraries have part-­time professional openings 
for working eve­ning and weekend hours, or for a specific proj­ect.
As mentioned previously, libraries are labor-­intensive organ­izations, and 
so the largest part of their bud­gets has traditionally been devoted to staff. 
In the past, the rule of thumb for allocating library bud­gets was 60 ­percent 
for personnel, 30 ­percent for materials, and 10 ­percent for other expenses. 
­Because the costs for library technology and library materials are climbing 
steeply, man­ag­ers have tried to reduce staff size in order to cut HR costs, 
becoming “leaner and meaner.” Library and information center man­ag­ers,

Talk About It
Outsourcing broadly defined is utilized in many aspects of the work of a library. To get 
a ­handle on how ­these changes are evolving, think about a library where users relied 
mostly on materials held in that library. Over time, users are now privy to the world of 
information and want much more than what is held in their local library.
Think about a specific area of a library and describe how that ser­vice or work space 
has changed by utilizing outsourcing or outsourcing-­ like activities. For example a 
library may offer a pay-­per-­view ser­vice for journal articles that are not held locally or 
may make some collection decisions based on interlibrary loan requests. In the latter 
case if enough library users request a title or journal, the library may deem it cost effec­
tive to own the material rather than continuing to borrow it. In this case the users are 
helping in the materials se­lection pro­cess or put another way, some aspects of collection 
development are outsourced to library users.
For this exercise, select an aspect of a library and discuss if all or part has been 
outsourced in recent years. Try to think beyond the examples given ­here. Has ­there been 
outsourcing in circulation, technical ser­vices, reference, special collections, or reader’s 
advisor ser­vices? Please describe them.
like man­ag­ers in other organ­izations, are striving to improve productivity. 
Many are using part-­time and contract workers to achieve more flexibility 
and to save money. A survey showed that almost a quarter of all 2010 MLIS 
gradu­ates are working in part-­time professional positions, and over 10 ­percent 
are working in temporary positions.5 Other man­ag­ers are using part-­time 
and contract workers to provide such ser­vices as janitorial and grounds keep­
ing functions. Volunteers are used to help fill the personnel gap: in schools, 
librarians manage parent volunteers and school “clubs,” and in public librar­
ies, high school students volunteer their ser­vices.
Library man­ag­ers outsource a variety of functions including shelving, 
materials se­lection, and cata­loging to outside agencies or companies. The 
term outsourcing refers to purchasing from an outside source certain ser­vices 
or goods that an organ­ization previously provided or produced for itself. 
­Because of bud­get cuts, library man­ag­ers are exploring outsourcing as a way 
to save money and also reallocate their employees to new ventures. Studies 
have shown that although in certain situations outsourcing does cut costs, 
it is not less expensive in all situations. However, outsourcing does result in 
changes in working with an organ­ization’s HR, especially when contracted 
workers are brought in to work within an organ­ization.6
­These methods of getting work done with dif­fer­ent types of workers may 
pres­ent prob­lems for a man­ag­er. For example, a clash of attitudes about val­
ues and ser­vice may arise between the permanent staff and ­these more tem­
porary workers.7 Long-­term contract workers, who are typically hired as a 
cost-­cutting mea­sure and do basically the same jobs as regular employees 
without receiving benefits, may resent the dual standard of compensation. 
Also, library man­ag­ers have less control over the ­people who are ­doing out­
sourced work than they do over employees of the organ­ization itself. On the 
positive side, however, bringing contract workers into an institution that has 
had ­little employee turnover can result in fresh perspectives and new ideas.8 
In summary, like other organ­izations, library staff must become more pro­
ductive, but ­these economizing mea­sures can make both the man­ag­er’s work 
and the employees’ lives more challenging.

Staffing the Library  227
Despite attempts to reduce the number of employees, the percentage of 
library bud­gets devoted to staff has not significantly declined. According to 
a report issued in 2016, in 2014 public libraries still devoted more than two-­
thirds of their bud­gets to staff.9 For academic libraries in 2012, the comparable 
figure averaged 49 ­percent.10 Although the percentage of bud­get allocated to 
staff may not have diminished, the work of both support staff and librarians 
has evolved, especially with changes in technology and an increasing reliance 
on outsourcing.
One of the most difficult issues that library administrators face is how 
to appropriately match the level of work to the type of employee. For many 
years, professional librarians spent at least part of their working day ­doing 
tasks that did not require a professional background. This was especially 
true in small libraries, ­because, in many, the professional librarian was the 
only employee. During the 1930s and early 1940s, it was not uncommon to 
find libraries in which more than half of the workers ­were classified as pro­
fessional librarians. By contrast, in the past few de­cades technological inno­
vations have altered the work of most ­people in libraries. Support staff who 
used to file, hand circulate, and pro­cess materials now do not need to do ­those 
jobs and they are now expected to be comfortable with computers and other 
equipment and software. In fact they perform work previously done by librar­
ians, such as copy cata­loging, light reference, and supervising pages or stu­
dent workers.
Although some small libraries still have only one professional librarian 
and perhaps a clerical worker, in larger libraries ­today the staff ratio is usu­
ally one professional librarian to three support staffers. In some libraries, 
the ratio of support staff to each professional is even larger. Many libraries 
are using a technical/professional category for employees who do not have 
an MLIS, but who have significant experience or technical education to man­
age work in a library. ­These kinds of positions are usually technology related, 
but also could be managing staff in cata­loging, branch libraries, ­etc. ­These 
positions provide a goal for staff; they can look forward to promotion oppor­
tunities while remaining in the ranks of staff.
The LIS Education and ­Human Resource 
Utilization Policy
The most comprehensive discussion of desirable staffing patterns for 
libraries is the American Library Association’s (ALA) revised Library and 
Information Studies Education and ­Human Resource Utilization policy.11 
This document states that: (1) libraries require skills other than ­those of 
librarianship, and (2) nonlibrarians must have equal recognition in both the 
professional and the support ranks.
­People with skills other than ­those of librarianship contribute greatly 
to the quality of library ser­vice, and every­one whose expertise contributes to 
the library’s effective per­for­mance should be equally recognized. To accom­
plish this goal, the document recommends that libraries establish a dual 
­career lattice that ­will allow both librarians and nonlibrary specialists to 
advance in their ­careers.
In addition to recognizing the importance of specialists, the LIS Educa­
tion and HR Utilization policy recommends that librarians be able to advance 
within an organ­ization without becoming administrators. In many librar­
ies, employees must assume greater supervisory responsibility in order to be 
considered for promotion and advancement. But the ALA recommends that 

228  ­Huma n Resource
administrators recognize and reward financially the impor­tant role played 
by nonadministrative librarians. The LIS Education and HR Utilization pol­
icy states:
[­There are] many areas of special knowledge within librarianship 
which are equally impor­tant [as administration] and to which 
equal recognition in prestige and salary should be given. Highly 
qualified persons with specialist responsibilities in some aspects 
of librarianship—­archives, bibliography, reference, for example—­
should be eligible for advanced status and financial rewards 
without being forced to abandon for administrative responsibilities 
their areas of major competence.12
The formerly strict demarcation between support staff and professional 
librarians has been eroded as virtually all library employees have become 
knowledge workers.13 Support staff members increasingly perform tasks pre­
viously handled by professional librarians. Both professional librarians and 
support staff have new job titles reflecting this increasing diversity. For 
instance, librarians are not just called librarians anymore. Increasingly, 
their titles encompass the technological role they play within the library. 
Nowadays professional journals and electronic mailing lists are filled with 
job postings using terms such as emerging technologies librarian, data assets 
man­ag­er, digital curator, digital ser­vices librarian/coordinator, health/sci­
ence informatics administrator/analyst, technology development librarian 
and user experience designer.14 Academic, medical, and law libraries also 
search for embedded librarians.15 Similarly, the types of support workers 
employed in libraries and information agencies have increased in number, 
reflecting the staffers’ changing and varied responsibilities. Some support 
personnel job classifications can be seen in ­table 10.1.
It seems inevitable that library staffing patterns ­will continue to shift 
and that the realities of bud­geting ­will force librarians to find eco­nom­ical 
ways to get the work done. This dynamic is apparent in most libraries, espe­
cially the outsourcing tasks that core workers once performed, such as cata­
loging, pro­cessing, and materials se­lection (approval plans).
The Orga­nizational Framework for Staffing
As described in the previous section, organ­izations come into being when 
the overall task is too large for any one person to accomplish alone. Like all

organ­izations, libraries are networks of interacting components; jobs are the 
individual blocks with which the organ­ization is built.
Although the terms position, job, and occupation are often used inter­
changeably, they actually have distinct definitions in ­human resources 
terminology.
•	 A position is a collection of tasks and responsibilities that constitute 
the total work assignment of one person. Thus an organ­ization has 
as many dif­fer­ent positions as it has ­people employed ­there. The 
Slavic language cata­loger in a large academic library holds a posi­
tion, as does the bookmobile driver in a public library.
•	 A job is a group of positions that involve generally the same responsi­
bilities, knowledge, duties, and skills. Many employees, all performing 
slightly dif­fer­ent work, may be classified ­under the same job title. 
A library may employ many circulation assistants, all of whom have 
dif­fer­ent responsibilities but whose duties are similar enough for them 
to be classified in the same job group.
•	 An occupation is defined as a general class of job found in a number 
of dif­fer­ent organ­izations; for example, librarianship is considered 
an occupation.
A job should always be a planned, defined entity consisting of assigned 
tasks that require similar or related skills, knowledge, or ability. Man­ag­ers 
should design a job carefully, identifying all its tasks, to ensure maximum 
effectiveness for the organ­ization. A job’s tasks should be similar or related, 
and all tasks should require approximately the same level of education. A 
task that is so complex as to require extensive education should not be paired 
with one so ­simple that it could be performed by someone with just a high 
school diploma. Further, the tasks assigned to any given job should all require 
roughly the same level of experience. Some tasks can be performed only by 
­people with years of experience, whereas ­others can be executed by novices.
Fi­nally, all tasks assigned to a job should call for comparable degrees of 
responsibility. Some tasks have end responsibility, which means that the com­
pleted task ­will not be reviewed by anyone. When someone has a job with 
end responsibility, that individual’s action is final. Other jobs require ­little 
or no end responsibility. Revisers in a cata­loging department may have end 
responsibility, whereas the cata­logers whose work is to be revised have no 
end responsibility. To summarize, a well-­defined job has assigned to it tasks 
that are comparable in:
•	 The amount of required education
•	 The amount of required experience
•	 The degree of responsibility.
To increase their flexibility, organ­izations are now designing jobs that 
take advantage of employees’ multiple skills. More organ­izations are encour­
aging cross-­training;16 that is, having employees learn techniques associ­
ated with jobs that are not their own. This ensures that if a specific need 
­were to arise, additional employees would know how to get that job done. With 
cross training, staffers are being encouraged to work with and across mul­
tiple functions and units. The employees benefit by having a broader under­
standing of the organ­ization and a more diverse skill set.

230  ­Huma n Resource
As mentioned above, flexibility and broadening of job responsibilities are 
a new concept. The traditional method of job allotment—­giving narrow, spe­
cialized portions of a large task to specific workers—is known as division of 
­labor. Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations (1776), first wrote about the 
benefits of division of ­labor.17 When each job consists primarily of a few ­simple, 
repetitive tasks, man­ag­ers need not invest time in training workers or search­
ing out highly skilled employees. All organ­izations, including libraries, are 
rethinking the design of their jobs, seeking better ways to carry out the 
organ­ization’s objectives.
Job enrichment is especially impor­tant for organ­izations like libraries 
and information centers. This is ­because the educational level of most library 
employees is typically quite high, and well-­educated workers usually prefer 
intellectually challenging jobs. Rather than just a group of assigned tasks 
that are quickly mastered and soon become monotonous and boring, a job 
should have a large enough scope to challenge employees and encourage them 
to increase their skills, knowledge, and abilities. Some library jobs involve 
prescribed procedures that must be followed to maintain uniformity or 
­because of standardized methodologies. Such jobs are generally low in the 
hierarchy. Nevertheless, even at this level, employees should be given ­every 
opportunity to be creative, to exercise initiative, and to vary the routines of 
the job, while still maintaining the established standards. Good man­ag­
ers welcome suggestions for ways to improve pro­cesses and ser­vices from 
employees.
Although “empowerment” is now the buzzword in all types of organ­
izations, we must remember that some workers do not want to be empowered. 
A basic rule of HR management is to match the individual to the job. Accord­
ingly, workers who want neither autonomy nor empowerment should not be 
placed in positions requiring them to work without supervision and direction. 
At the same time, the talents of a ­great many workers are underutilized, 
and both the employees and the organ­ization benefit if jobs are designed to 
allow ­these ­people to work to their full potential. If library administrators 
want employees to be innovative and responsible, the jobs must give the employ­
ees the opportunity to develop ­these attributes.
J. R. Hackman and G. R. Oldham have proposed a model of job enrich­
ment that identifies five essential dimensions. ­These dimensions are:
•	 Skill variety: the extent to which a job involves dif­fer­ent activities 
that use vari­ous skills and talents
•	 Task identity: the extent to which a job requires completing an 
entire piece of work from beginning to end
•	 Task significance: the worker’s perception of the job’s importance
•	 Autonomy: the degree to which employees have the freedom to plan, 
schedule, and carry out their jobs as desired
•	 Feedback: the extent to which a job enables the employee to get 
information about the effectiveness of their per­for­mance.
As figure 10.1 illustrates, ­these core job characteristics foster certain 
psychological states so that the worker can experience the meaningfulness 
of the work, take responsibility for the outcome of the work, and gain knowl­
edge of the work’s ­actual results. ­These psychological states enhance an 
employee’s feeling of motivation, quality of work performed, and satisfaction 
with work; they also lead to low absenteeism and turnover.18

Staffing the Library  231
Just as organ­izations are changing, so are the jobs within organ­izations. 
Man­ag­ers need to look at the jobs in their organ­ization and see if they are 
designed in a way that balances the need for efficiency with the need for more 
enriched jobs to ensure employee motivation and to make sure that the impor­
tant work is getting accomplished.
Job Descriptions
­After a job has been established, the man­ag­er’s next step is to write a 
job description that specifies the duties associated with that job; the rela­
tionship of that job to other units within the institution; and the personal

characteristics (such as education, skill, and experience) workers ­will need 
to perform the job. Most government agencies and private companies now 
require job descriptions for all employees. Although job descriptions vary from 
organ­ization to organ­ization, they generally contain the following ele­ments:
•	 Job identification: typically includes the job title, the specific line 
number, and department.
•	 Job summary: details the job’s major responsibilities and justifies 
its existence.
•	 Job activities and procedures: describes the tasks performed by 
the jobholder, sometimes specifying by percentage the amount of time 
devoted to each task. It should clearly delineate the duties and respon­
sibilities of the job, although some flexibility is often indicated by 
inserting a phrase such as “and other duties on occasion as assigned.” 
This enumeration of activities and procedures is the most impor­tant 
part of the job description. It tells the employee the exact tasks for 
which he or she ­will be responsible, while also indicating to the super­
visor which tasks require training, supervision, or evaluation. With­
out this section of the job description, neither the employee nor the 
supervisor would know what the employee was expected to do.
•	 Relationship of the job to the total institution: states the title 
of the person to whom the employee reports, the number of employees 
or the name of the orga­nizational unit supervised by this job, and 
the internal and external relationships that go with the job.
•	 Job requirements: as established by each organ­ization, identifies 
the minimum acceptable qualifications necessary for an employee 
to perform the job. Requirements often include level of education; 
amount of experience; and special skills, knowledge, or abilities; and 
all of ­these ele­ments should be necessary for the successful per­for­
mance of the job. Sometimes job requirements are set unrealistically 
high, which then artificially restricts the pool of pos­si­ble applicants. 
Employers should be especially careful that the job specifications 
do not reflect the characteristics the organ­ization would like the 
employee to have and focus instead on the attributes that are actu­
ally necessary to perform the job effectively. Failure to do so can 
result in a ­legal prob­lem since job specifications (e.g., an educational 
requirement such as a college degree) that are not essential for suc­
cessful job per­for­mance are considered invalid and may violate Title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Job descriptions fulfill several impor­tant administrative and HR needs. 
At first, a job description may be used in recruiting new employees. Not only 
does the recruiter know precisely the capabilities for which to search, but the 
candidate also knows exactly what is expected if he or she accepts the job. For 
this reason, the job description should always be made available to applicants 
and is usually in the job advertisement.
­After the hiring stage, the job description becomes the basis for deter­
mining training needs and for identifying tasks that require additional train­
ing before the employee can perform them well. ­Later, the job description 
acts as a framework for the employee’s formal per­for­mance review. Job 
descriptions also are used to help man­ag­ers evaluate a job’s worth, thereby 
aiding them in developing a compensation structure. Figure 10.2 shows a

Job Analy­sis
Whenever a position is open and before it is advertised, a man­ag­er 
should, as a ­matter of course, review the job description and decide if changes

are necessary. In some institutions this step is necessary to justify a new 
hire. ­Because of such changes and ­because employees, by emphasizing or 
deemphasizing certain tasks, also have the power to alter their jobs drasti­
cally, man­ag­ers in organ­izations should occasionally perform a job analy­sis of 
all similar jobs. Such an analy­sis enables them to find out what work is actu­
ally being done in a specific job title and if it has appropriate compensation.
Vari­ous methods may be used for a job analy­sis. Some of the most com­
mon are direct observation of the job, interviews, written questionnaires, and 
daily logs or diaries in which employees rec­ord what they do day to day. The 
results of a job analy­sis can be useful in revamping job descriptions, in spec­
ifying which skills and abilities a worker ­will need to do a given job, and in 
determining the appropriate compensation for that job. A job analy­sis also 
can indicate when a job needs to be redesigned and redefined. Employees 
sometimes feel threatened by a job analy­sis, but in most cases, the resulting 
data helps an organ­ization manage its HR more effectively. This translates 
into better training, per­for­mance evaluations, and promotion opportunities, 
as well as possibly more equitable pay.
A complete job analy­sis of all positions is time-­consuming, demands 
extensive expertise, ­causes significant disruption to an organ­ization and may 
result in employee expectations that cannot be met. As a result, library 
administrators undertake complete analyses only infrequently. At such 
times, library administrators often call in special HR or management con­
sul­tants or HR staff from a parent organ­ization to help with the analy­sis.
To keep jobs up-­to-­date between complete analyses, supervisors should 
keep track of and report any significant changes in their units’ tasks. Also, 
some institutions conduct periodic audits of each department’s jobs. The audit 
involves comparing the tasks that are actually being performed to the ones 
specified in the job description. When discrepancies are found, two ­things 
can happen. If certain essential tasks are not being carried out, the employee 
changes his or her work habits. If changes have occurred in the job for legit­
imate reasons (e.g., the introduction of new equipment or technology), the job 
description is updated to reflect the real­ity. ­These audits often come about 
as part of the employee’s annual review.
Job Evaluation
­After designing jobs and writing accurate job descriptions, the next step 
is to arrange all the jobs within the organ­ization in a hierarchical order. The 
usual procedure is to identify each job’s requirements and its contribution to 
the organ­ization and then to classify it according to importance. Skill, edu­
cation, experience, and the amount of end responsibility commonly figure into 
this evaluation.
A number of methods exist for assigning jobs to ranked categories. Some 
organ­izations use the point method. They develop a quantitative point scale 
and, ­after identifying the ­factors involved in a job, assign point values to 
­these ­factors. The higher the number of points, the higher the job ranks 
within the hierarchy. Other organ­izations use a ­factor system, in which each 
job’s rank is calculated by comparing it to the ­others and also by subdivid­
ing each job into ­factors that have dollar values attached to them. The ­factor 
method is similar to the point method but with a monetary scale in place of 
a point scale.
Two nonquantitative systems are widely used for evaluating jobs. ­Simple 
ranking systems compare ­actual positions to one another to create a ranked 
hierarchy. Similarly, a job classification system sorts out jobs on the basis of 

Staffing the Library  235
duties, skills, abilities, responsibilities, and other qualities. The jobs are 
grouped into classes that are arranged in a hierarchy. Regardless of the sys­
tem used, it is always the job that is classified, not the employee holding the 
job. This is an impor­tant point, ­because some employees may bring more 
skills or talents than the job requires.
At that point, the hierarchically arranged jobs ­will be divided into specific 
groups, the configurations of which vary from library to library. Usually, all 
professional librarian positions fall into one group; library technicians and 
paraprofessionals into another; library assistants, clerks, and custodians 
into still ­others. Each group ­will have its own hierarchical levels based upon 
the experience, education, and responsibility associated with each job. Each 
level gets a job title. Jobs requiring the same level of education, experience, 
and responsibility ­will have the same title, although the tasks may differ. 
Both an experienced reference librarian and an experienced cata­loger could 
be classified as Librarian III. Figure 10.3 shows a hierarchy of professional 
library positions.
The same procedure is used for all other job groups. A hierarchy of 
support -­level positions appears in figure 10.4.
­There is no standard number of levels within each group. In larger insti­
tutions ­there may be many, in smaller ones only a few. Very often the positions 
in the library are not separated from positions in the larger organ­ization, 
­whether a com­pany, a municipality, or a university setting. Comparable jobs 
to ­those in the library can be found elsewhere in the organ­ization. For example 
a branch supervisor might have a rank that is equivalent to an office man­ag­er 
in city hall, or a reference librarian in a public library might be comparable 
to a high school teacher.
Recruitment and Hiring
Once a library’s positions are established, they need to be filled. Filling 
­these jobs is a multistep pro­cess, which is illustrated in figure 10.5. The first 
step is recruiting applicants to apply for the jobs. Recruitment involves seek­
ing and attracting a pool of applicants from which qualified candidates for 
a vacant position can be chosen. Recruiting is impor­tant ­because library 
FIGURE 10.3. A Hierarchy of Professional Library Positions

236  ­Huma n Resource
administrators want to attract the best qualified applicants for any open 
position. This means that the vacant position needs to be advertised. Most 
organ­izations require that job openings be advertised.
When designing a search to fill a vacant position, man­ag­ers first need 
to consider the ­labor market from which candidates ­will be drawn. In most 
libraries, ­people from the local ­labor market fill support staff positions. Open­
ings are advertised only in local publications, and as a result they are gener­
ally filled by individuals already living in the area. Many vacancies for 
professional librarians are filled from the national ­labor market. Almost all 
libraries and information centers recruit top administrators nationally. Jobs 
may be advertised in national periodicals, such as American Libraries, 
Library Journal, College and Research Libraries News, but ­these periodicals 
are expensive and have a long lead time between when the ad is placed and 
when it is published. The Internet has changed the way open positions are 
advertised. Many newspapers and specialized publications run their classi­
fied ads on their Web sites.19 Many individual libraries advertise open posi­
tions on their own Web sites and on social media, such as Twitter. And they 
post job vacancies to specific online communities such as the American Asso­
ciation of Law Libraries’ research and instruction group or the private law 
firm group for a reference opening at a law library. ­These are likely to reach 
FIGURE 10.4. A Hierarchy of Support-­Level Positions
FIGURE 10.5. Stages in Recruiting and Hiring

Staffing the Library  237
a wide range of ­people with the appropriate background and interest.20 
Advertising on the Internet is advantageous to both the organ­ization and the 
job seeker: it is focused, far reaching, and rapid.
Attracting a Diverse Workforce
All types of institutions increasingly value diversity among their employ­
ees because library staff should be like the communities they serve. “Issues 
of diversity are central concerns for a field dedicated to promoting widespread 
and equitable access to information and information literacy, both in the com­
position of the profession and in need for practice infused with cultural com­
petence.”21 Understandably, ­because libraries serve a multicultural clientele, 
most librarians aim to hire a culturally diverse staff.
In an attempt to increase minority hiring, libraries and LIS schools have 
tried vari­ous approaches. Some libraries have introduced undergraduate 
internship programs designed to attract minorities to the profession. ­Others 
have established minority residency programs for new MLIS gradu­ates. 
In addition, many libraries have instituted diversity plans to coordinate 
their minority outreach. LIS schools have intensified their active minority 
recruitment efforts as well, some by offering special scholarships. Similarly 
the ALA’s Spectrum Initiative has provided LIS graduate-­study scholar­
ships to African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and 
Native American/Alaskan Native students.22 The Association of Research 
Libraries offers a number of programs to help enhance diversity in libraries 
including partnering with the Society of American Archivists and the Mod­
ern Language Association.23
Man­ag­ers should make an effort to attract qualified applicants of all 
races, ethnicities, and other abilities. According to the ALA, among the most 
common recruitment challenges that institutions encounter in recruiting a 
diverse workforce are poor access to networks of diverse professionals, inter­
view methods that fail to demonstrate a commitment to diversity, and hir­
ing pro­cesses that do not allow for adequate time to develop diverse candidate 
pools. The ALA has provided a list of helpful tips for improved recruitment 
and hiring practices at http://­www.ala​.­org​/­advocacy​/­diversity​/­workforced​
evelopment​/­recruitmentfordiversity.
Internal and External Applicants
Applicants for a given job often include internal candidates, employees 
of the organ­ization who seek job transfers or promotions, and external can­
didates, ­people from outside the organ­ization. Recruiting for external and 
internal personnel brings advantages and disadvantages. Recruiting exter­
nal candidates enables hiring man­ag­ers to tap a larger pool of talent. In addi­
tion, new employees bring fresh insights and perspectives to the organ­ization. 
The major disadvantage of external recruiting is that it generally takes lon­
ger and is more expensive than internal recruiting, plus the candidates are 
not as well-­known as internal candidates. It also takes more time for an 
employee hired from the outside to get oriented to the organ­ization.
Filling positions with internal candidates has the advantage of foster­
ing high morale. Employees have an additional incentive to perform well 
­because of the possibility they ­will be promoted when openings occur. Inter­
nal recruiting also enables management to more accurately appraise the can­
didate’s suitability. In such cases, the internal candidate is a known ­factor, 
whereas the external candidate is comparatively unknown; therefore, the

Talk About It
Dorothy’s rise through the ranks of her department had been amazing. Being the right 
person at the right place at the right time had something to do with it. Tomorrow she 
­will be a department head supervising ­those who had the same job and even one person 
who had been her boss. She ­didn’t think of herself as ambitious, but did speak out when 
she had an idea and liked to improve the work of the department. Now how is she ­going 
to ­handle Don, who thought he should have gotten the job (even though he had not 
applied for it). She could see on his face that he was resentful and would be difficult to 
win over. What suggestions do you have for Dorothy? Have you been in this situation? 
What steps should she take to work successfully with Don? What could her supervisor 
do to help the situation?
se­lection of an internal candidate is less risky. However, one pos­si­ble disad­
vantage arises if the position is an attractive one and many internal candi­
dates apply: the ­people not chosen may react negatively. For that reason, 
man­ag­ers must build procedural fairness into ­every search, so that even 
unsuccessful candidates ­will feel the se­lection was fair and objective.
Internal promotion has its inherent prob­lems and limitations as well. 
The most dangerous is prob­ably orga­nizational inbreeding. Internal can­
didates who get promoted tend to perpetuate what they have seen done 
in the past; as a result, the organ­ization may miss out on new ideas and 
innovations.
In general, the best policy is prob­ably to fill most vacancies from within, 
assuming ­there are fully qualified ­people to take on ­these roles. At the same 
time, it is also wise to hire outsiders for at least some high-­level positions; 
this brings new ideas into the organ­ization.24
Matching the Applicant to the Position
Se­lection refers to actually choosing the candidate who is most likely to 
do the job successfully. The objective is to achieve a good fit when matching 
the qualifications of the applicant and the requirements of the position. 
Matching them successfully is very impor­tant, ­because a bad match costs 
time and money, not only for the person hired, who is likely to be unhappy or 
unsuccessful, but also to the organ­ization. Such cases often require correc­
tive mea­sures: training, transfer, demotion, or termination of employment.
Time spent selecting the right person for a position is time well spent. 
Organ­izations often do not realize how many of their scarce resources they 
are investing in each new employee. If the se­lection pro­cess includes a search 
committee, the cost of hiring increases even more. A new employee who is 
hired and dismissed within six months is expensive enough. Most studies 
show that a bad hire of that type typically costs an organ­ization approxi­
mately $40,000 in severance pay, training, wasted ­human resource time, 
loss of productivity, and impact on employee morale.25 An even greater cost 
is an employee who is hired and stays in the job 25 or 30 years but never 
works up to his or her potential. That employee could easily cost an organ­
ization well over a million dollars over the course of a ­career. In ­today’s eco­
nomic climate, most organ­izations do not have the luxury of keeping employees 
who do not work up to their full potential; however, in some instances, 

Staffing the Library  239
tenure or other job protections make termination of such bad hires very 
difficult. In summary, a good employee is well worth the investment, but an 
organ­ization that hires the wrong applicant makes an expensive ­mistake. 
Selecting the right candidate is particularly impor­tant nowadays when many 
libraries have ­little staff turnover. If the right candidate is not found the first 
time, it is better to advertise the position again rather than to hire someone 
just for the sake of filling the position.
The Se­lection Pro­cess
Any organ­ization benefits from a well-­designed candidate se­lection sys­
tem. Typically, the se­lection pro­cess includes multiple steps. For support staff 
­these steps would be application forms, applicant testing, personal interviews, 
verification of past per­for­mance and background, and hiring. For professional 
staff the steps include forming a search committee, developing a job adver­
tisement, advertising, phone interviewing, in-­person interviewing includ­
ing meetings with the search committee, interviews with other staff and the 
director, and, in some cases, a pre­sen­ta­tion. ­After the search committee gath­
ers feedback and deliberates about all the candidates, it sends its recommen­
dation to dean or director. In larger libraries, the se­lection pro­cess is usually 
coordinated by the HR department.26 The final hiring decision is usually 
made by the director.
Application Pro­cess
Librarians often use standardized application forms for vacant support 
staff positions. In the case of professional positions, applicants submit a cover 
letter and a résumé. Upon receiving an application, the employer must ensure 
that the applicant has the experience and the education needed for the job. 
The employer looks for steady pro­gress in experience and also for any indi­
cations that the applicant might pose a prob­lem, such as unexplained gaps 
in work history. Information on the application form allows an employer to 
make tentative judgments about an applicant’s suitability; it also screens out 
obviously unqualified candidates.
Interviewing the Candidates
­After the pool of candidates has been narrowed down, the employer 
should invite the most promising applicants in for an interview. Sometimes 
library man­ag­ers ­will conduct a first round of interviews by telephone to fur­
ther narrow the pool of candidates, and then choose ­those who ­will be invited 
for an in-­person interview.
The job interview is the single most impor­tant tool in the candidate 
se­lection pro­cess. Many institutions hold multiple interviews, thus allowing 
more man­ag­ers and staff members to participate in the se­lection pro­cess. In 
universities, academic librarians may also be interviewed by teaching fac­
ulty. In school districts, principals as well as HR personnel usually inter­
view prospective school librarians.
The purpose of the interview is to supplement the information already 
obtained through other sources. The interviewer learns more about the appli­
cant’s technical and professional knowledge, experience, and personal char­
acteristics. The applicant learns more about the job itself, clears up any 
uncertainties about the position or the organ­ization, and meets the staff that 
he or she would work with if hired.

240  ­Huma n Resource
The interview should focus entirely on job requirements, and the inter­
viewer should seek information about the candidate’s suitability for this job. 
All questions should be job-­related. The Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) has forbidden the use of interview questions that are 
not related to job requirements. Interviewers may not ask questions about 
race, religion, gender, national origin, age, or handicaps. Some examples of 
prohibited questions are listed in ­table 10.2.
Interviewing is a skill that can be improved with practice. To start, inter­
viewers should prepare for the session. They should be familiar with the 
information provided on the application form or résumé and cover letter. An 
interviewer also should draw up an outline listing questions to be asked and 
specifying the information to be sought. He or she should ask the same basic 
questions of all candidates for a specific position. In addition, the interviewer 
should be sure to choose a location for the interview that ­will be private and 
­free from interruption.
During the interview itself, an interviewer should try to put the appli­
cant at ease. A relaxed applicant ­will act more like his or her normal self. 
The candidate should be encouraged to talk, but the interviewer must main­
tain control of the conversation and remember that its objective is to gather

information that ­will aid in the se­lection pro­cess. Often interviewers spend 
too much time discussing the organ­ization and the position and thus never 
obtain the necessary information from the applicant. The best interview from 
the perspective of the search committee is one in which the applicant does 
most of the talking.
The interviewer must listen carefully and note pertinent facts. He or she 
should refrain from excessive note-­taking, ­because it may inhibit the appli­
cant. The interviewer should phrase questions a certain way. Open-­ended 
questions elicit the best answers, ­because they force a candidate to think 
through a situation. The interviewer should avoid leading questions; that is, 
questions that signal the desired answer. Instead of asking, “You ­wouldn’t 
object to weekend work, would you?” say, “Tell me how you feel about work­
ing weekends.” The interviewer should never be judgmental. By expressing 
neither disbelief nor shock at a candidate’s response, the interviewer encour­
ages the candidate to reveal failures as well as successes. As soon as the 
interview is over, the interviewer should make a point of recording his or her 
impressions of the applicant. If the interviewer delays this step, he or she 
may forget valuable information and impressions about the applicant.
Background Verification
­Either before or ­after the interview, the employer ­will want to verify the 
candidate’s background information by contacting references and previous 
employers. Most jobs require that the applicant list references, which are 
preferably academic or professional. If the applicant has a work history, pre­
vious employers are the most valuable source of information.
Reference checking is frequently conducted by telephone. The conven­
tional wisdom is that individuals provide franker and more specific informa­
tion on the phone than in writing. Some organ­izations, however, have a policy 
of divulging information about past employees only in writing; the amount 
and type of information provided varies from organ­ization to organ­ization.
Fear of lawsuits has made reference checking more difficult. Former 
employers have become hesitant about giving references for fear of lawsuits 
by their ex-­employees. Some organ­izations are now willing to confirm only 
that the individual was once employed ­there. Usually, however, a prospective 
employer can verify the accuracy of the job information, such as position held, 
last salary, supervisory responsibilities, and reasons for leaving. The pro­
spective employer may also ask ­whether the previous employer would rehire 
the employee and why. Previous or pres­ent supervisors usually provide accu­
rate assessments but may sometimes give better-­than-­deserved recommen­
dations, ­either ­because they would like to see the applicant move on or ­because 
they do not feel comfortable giving out negative information. Reference check­
ers should probe and follow up if they feel that the person giving the refer­
ence is hesitant or noncommittal. Employers should ask all references the 
same set of basic questions about all candidates, and ­those questions should 
relate only to an applicant’s job per­for­mance. If an applicant does not list 
supervisors from recent jobs as references, a prospective employer might want 
to contact them anyway. Very few applicants falsify their credentials, but it 
is always wise to verify the information given. If a par­tic­u­lar educational 
background is required, the employer should confirm the applicant’s school 
rec­ord. For some positions, employers may also perform criminal and credit 
checks.
It is impor­tant for job applicants to remember that many recruiters and 
employers now use social networking sites (such as Facebook or LinkedIn) 

242  ­Huma n Resource
and search engines (such as Google) to look online for publicly available infor­
mation about an applicant that might affect a hiring decision.27
Making the Hiring Decision
The last step in the se­lection pro­cess is choosing the individual to fill 
the vacant position. Some librarians solicit input from many employees, espe­
cially for professional positions. Search committees, which are commonly 
used in academic libraries, are one way to involve peers in the se­lection pro­
cess. Usually the search committee recommends a ranked list of finalists for 
the position, and then an administrator makes the final choice.28 At some 
libraries and information centers, the director always makes the final deci­
sion; at ­others, the immediate supervisor may choose, subject to the approval 
of higher management. If the employer has effectively performed all steps in 
the se­lection pro­cess and the interviewer has gathered all the appropriate 
information, the decision is quite likely to be sound; the applicant’s quali­
fications ­will match the job requirements, and the placement should be 
successful.
However the candidate, if offered the position, has the final decision. The 
job is offered with a specific salary. The salary may be determined by ­union 
scale or could be based on bud­get, salary range of other employees in that 
job, and the director’s estimate of the candidate’s experience and education. 
Often ­there is some room to negotiate and especially with professional posi­
tions, the candidate might ask for more money, or other benefits. For example 
the policy for vacation may state that the employee earns a set amount of 
vacation time each month, but the candidate has already made plans for an 
expensive vacation that ­will come before he or she has enough time accumu­
lated. That candidate may ask to take more vacation time before it is actually 
earned. Other negotiable items include paying for moving expenses, start 
date, or in the case of a tenured faculty position in the library, the candidate 
may negotiate the year he or she ­will come up for tenure and promotion. Of 
course the higher the position in the organ­ization’s hierarchy the more likely 
­these kinds of negotiations ­will be successful. This type of negotiation is deli­
cate. A candidate should not bring up salary ­until they have an offer. Then 
if they ask for more money or other benefits and are refused, they can take the 
lower offer or walk away from the opportunity. It is worth remembering that 
the search pro­cess is time consuming and expensive for an organ­ization, and 
therefore it is always worth asking for a ­little more.
Without careful hiring practices, an organ­ization may be plagued by 
high staff turnover. A moderate amount of turnover is healthy, allowing an 
organ­ization to bring in employees with fresh ideas and dif­fer­ent experiences; 
excessive turnover can be costly; with each departure, the organ­ization must 
find and train a replacement. High turnover can also threaten morale ­because 
the remaining employees feel that the organ­ization is in a constant state of 
change, which increases workload, producing stress and uncertainty. An 
excessive amount of turnover should cause a library to examine carefully its 
hiring and recruitment practices.

Practice What You Have Learned
1.	Go to the ALA Jobline or other source for library jobs and select an advertise­
ment for an opening that you might like to pursue. Carefully read the posting 
and develop a cover letter that you would use to demonstrate both your qualifi­
cations and enthusiasm for the position.
2.	Take another advertisement for a position that interests you and pretend you 
are on the search committee. Formulate eight questions that you might recom­
mend the committee ask candidates for this opening.
3.	 This time select a job opening and research the institution. Pretend that you 
have been called for an interview. What information should you know before 
you go on site? Make a list of ways you might find institutional information 
that ­will help you decide if you want to work ­there.

that you, as a candidate, might ask a search committee at that institution.
pro­cesses for training, evaluating, and compensating ­those employees. Chap­
ter 12 ­will continue the HR topic by covering special situations.
Discussion Questions
1.	 Should you ever apply for a position where you are lacking some of the specified 
requirements? Discuss examples of when it might be OK to apply for a job 
when you are missing some of the requirements.
2.	Form into groups of three or four and discuss your experience with the job search 
pro­cess. Examples of discussion questions could be: ­Were you interviewed by 
one person or a committee? How did you find out about the opening? Did you 
ever hire someone ­else? How did that go?
3.	“It is time for parents to teach young ­people early on that in diversity ­there is 
beauty and ­there is strength.” — Maya Angelou. Form a group and discuss this 
quotation. How does diversity make libraries stronger? What kinds of diversity 
are found in library and information centers? Make a list of how diverse employ­
ees might contribute to an organ­ization.
4.	­There are libraries that ­will not consider a staff member for a professional posi­
tion, even ­after the staff member has gained an MLIS. What would the ratio­
nale be? What do you think of such a policy?

The ­Human Resources 
Function in the Library
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Know the importance of orientation for new staff and librarians
•	 Understand that staff development is an ongoing pro­cess and that both the 
employer and employee have a role in an employee’s development
•	 Understand the reasons for a per­for­mance appraisal system and a variety of 
ways to evaluate employee and supervisor job per­for­mance
•	 Understand when progressive discipline is necessary and the steps of dealing 
with an employee who is underperforming
•	 Recognize how an organ­ization fairly manages employee compensation
•	 Be acquainted with systems of employee recognition and rewards
•	 Be familiar with typical employee benefit systems
The work of ­human resources (HR) continues in this chapter, which describes 
how a new employee is brought onboard once the job offer has been accepted. 
Usually on the new employee’s first day of work, he or she ­will begin orientation 
and training. Throughout the employee’s time on the job, vari­ous other HR 
issues ­will arise. Given the rapid pace of change in libraries and information 
centers, training and staff development continue to be essential. Supervi­
sors, in most situations, are responsible for evaluating the per­for­mance of 
employees. Sometimes an employee wishes to file a grievance; occasionally an 
employee needs to be disciplined or terminated. ­These activities are among 

248  ­Huma n Resource
a man­ag­er’s HR responsibilities. This chapter ­will provide an overview of the 
major HR functions that occur between an employee’s initial day on the job 
and departure from the organ­ization.
Management on the Job: Onboarding Experience 
of New Librarians
Most articles on HR programs designed for orienting new employees focus on the pro­
grams and activities that are required of all new employees, and are written from the 
perspective of the employer. In Bruce Keisling’s and Melissa Laning’s article, “We Are 
Happy to Be ­Here: The Onboarding Experience in Academic Libraries,”1 the focus is on 
how new librarians, who have been at work for fewer than 24 months, feel about how 
well they ­were oriented and socialized to their new place of employment. This orientation 
pro­cess, which can take several weeks or as long as a year or more, is termed “onboard­
ing.” The goal of onboarding is to help new employees feel engaged and committed to 
their jobs.
To find out how successful onboarding programs are in academic libraries, the 
authors conducted an interview study of 20 librarians asking them about their onboard­
ing experiences. Questions included ­these topics:
•	 The orientation they received
•	 Any orga­nizational learning they had between the time of the job offer and start­
ing work
•	 Questions about first six months of work
•	 Sense of engagement with their new organ­izations
•	 Professional aspirations
•	 What the organ­ization learned about the new employee during the onboarding 
experience, and
•	 Suggestions for improvements to the experience.
The results ­were tabulated and or­ga­nized into common themes. Most respondents 
participated in a campus-­sponsored orientation and had meetings with key ­people. More 
than half of the respondents mentioned new faculty orientations, checklists, and tours 
as part of the onboarding experience. Meeting with key ­people including supervisors, 
library administrators, and peers in other departments within the library ­were listed 
as the most helpful. Some felt the program lacked structure and that the pro­cess was 
too self-­directed. When asked about strengths the participants brought to the library, 
most mentioned job-­related skills and prior experience. Many also mentioned their rela­
tional skills and ability to work well with ­others. One-­third indicated that they brought 
new ideas or a willingness to question the status quo. When asked about how the organ­
ization learned about their strengths, they ­either answered mentor/supervisor observa­
tion or “not sure.” When asked why they ­were chosen over other candidates, they could 
not answer. This was a missed opportunity. Employers should communicate about the 
skills or experiences that ­were decisive in the hiring so that employees may understand 
why they ­were selected and focus on ­those traits.
When asked about the time between when they accepted the offer and started to 
work, most respondents focused on the tasks of moving to a new community. A few

Onboarding, Training, and Staff Development
Starting a new position has challenges: an employee may have relocated 
to a new city or town, the work environment and culture of the organ­ization 
may be dif­fer­ent, and the ­people are new. Even if an employee has just been 
promoted or changed jobs within an organ­ization, challenges exist. How ­will 
it be to supervise previous colleagues? ­Will jealous subordinates resist new 
ideas? The concept of onboarding ­will help new employees understand the 
culture and norms of the organ­ization. In this ever changing world, train­
ing should be ongoing over the work life of an employee. Staff development 
is a concept that both employers and employees should embrace. Companies 
and organ­izations offer staff development opportunities, and employees, 
understanding that learning never ends, should take full advantage of them.
Onboarding
For many years in most organ­izations, a new employee would spend the 
first day at work, meeting a few ­people, getting an assigned work/office space, 
and filling out paper work for employee benefits and passwords. ­Here is a 
satire of onboarding: what not to do in this situation.
Welcome to the com­pany. We know it’s your first day and all, 
but ­we’ve been busy with deadlines for a major proj­ect and ­we’re 
not quite ready for you. Your office ­will be down the hall to your 
right, but for now, it’s in a storage closet we cleared out next to 
the rest­room. And your computer is on order, I think; check with 
Francine—­that’s her in [the] ­giant office with the win­dow. See 
John to order business cards, ­after he comes back from vacation 
appreciated acts of welcoming and offers of assistance during the transition. When asked 
about lessons learned during the first six months, they mentioned how to get ­things done, 
and learning who could help them succeed. They wanted to learn more about orga­nizational 
structure and relationships, especially getting to know ­people outside their immediate 
work area and understanding per­for­mance expectations.
In summary, the researchers learned that the onboarding period is an intense time 
for learning. New employees need to understand who has influence and institutional 
authority, and how to get ­things done. They learned that the new organ­ization is prob­
ably dif­fer­ent from a former workplace and that prior knowledge does not always trans­
late. Employees wanted to understand expectations so that they would be sure to do a 
good job. This research indicates that the time of onboarding is a time of self-­reflection 
about abilities and preferred work styles and for establishing a professional identity.
One key point about the onboarding pro­cess is that it is also a time for the organ­
ization to learn about the employee’s strengths and to help establish a work setting that 
­will yield a happy and productive employee. Employers focus intently on what a candi­
date ­will bring to the position, but in many cases do not follow-­through personally once 
the candidate is employed. They could, for example create opportunities for the new 
employee to utilize ­those skills on vis­i­ble and high-­priority proj­ects. ­These authors and 
­others2 who advocate for fully developed onboarding programs feel that focusing more 
on what each new employee brings to the job and creating work environments to sup­
port a variety of work styles ­will result in not only happy productive employees but also 
improved efficiency and prob­lem solving.

does ­those, too, plus network access! To get you started on your 
proj­ect, ­we’ve left a stack of plans and documentation on your 
desk. ­There’s also an employee handbook with a form in the back 
you need to sign ­after ­you’ve “read” it (wink wink). Any ques­
tions? As your new boss, I’m ­here to help.3
Now more organ­izations recognize that engaging new employees, not 
just on the first day, but for many months or even a year in an “onboarding” 
program is likely to produce better results. ­These include employees who are 
more loyal, engaged in their work, and connected to their colleagues and ­will 
be more likely to stay.4
The following are components of a successful onboarding program as rec­
ommended by the Association of College and Research Libraries:
•	 Socialization
•	 Policies
•	 Safety
•	 Communication
•	 Mentoring/buddy
•	 Significant program length
•	 Checklist for all levels, and
•	 Unique activities identified by individual institutions.5
Most libraries utilize some kind of orientation or onboarding program.
The purpose of orientation is to help make the new employee familiar 
with the orga­nizational culture. All new employees, regardless of position, 
need to be socialized into the institution’s culture and taught its history, tra­
ditions, and norms.6
When -­ new employees are socialized into the organ­ization, they are 
given an overview or tour of impor­tant departments such as the HR office, 
the public information office, and vari­ous subject or functional departments 
to learn how their roles fit into the total organ­ization. Specific aspects of orga­
nizational policy include details about the organ­ization’s goals, objectives, 
and philosophy, as well as details that employees need to know right away: 
where to park or public transportation schedules, passwords and network­
ing information, benefits such as retirement plans, vacation and sick leave 
policies, pay periods, direct deposit forms and when to expect the first pay 
check, how to report illness, and for hourly workers, time reporting systems. 
Safety issues such as the existence of an emergency plan and what to do in 
case of an emergency such as a flood, fire, or violent person should also be 
part of the onboarding experience. New employees ­will be given information 
about how to communicate in the organ­ization, e-­mail accounts, and the 
appropriate use of technology. The supervisor may offer suggestions as to how 
to best communicate; for example, does the supervisor prefer regular meet­
ings, memos, or informal chats? It is usually the supervisor’s responsibility 
to make sure that the new employee has all the information he or she needs 
to get off to a good start. However many institutions also assign an experi­
enced, enthusiastic mentor or “buddy” to help the new employee adjust and ask 
questions in a comfortable friendly environment. Although the supervisor is 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  251
responsible for the employee’s orientation and work, a mentor who is not in 
the direct line of authority is a good option for helping the employee under­
stand the culture and is someone to whom the employee can talk.7
­Table 11.1 Onboarding Responnsibilities8 provides a perspective of the 
roles and steps involved in onboarding a new employee. All of this onboarding 
cannot be accomplished in a day or a week, but needs to evolve and fill in gaps 
as the employee becomes familiar with the job. Some organ­izations offer 
unique activities to further help the onboarding pro­cess; examples include 
welcome coffee, getting-­to-­know-­you exercises, and games. Libraries and 
information centers that follow ­these suggestions ­will have the most success

with new employees and new employees ­will enjoy a faster introduction to the 
job. Table 11.2 shows how typical new employee orientation programs differ 
from onboarding programs.
Initial Job Training
Training starts on day one and should be overseen by the new employ­
ee’s supervisor. It is rare to have the departing employee available for instruc­
tions since most institutions do not have funding to double fund a position. 
Sometimes subordinates can participate in the on the job training, but the 
supervisor should take the main responsibility.
Job training takes many forms. The least helpful method is to briefly 
describe the necessary tasks and then let the employee figure out the rest. 
The new employee, who is already uneasy in a new environment and with new 
responsibilities, ­will absorb ­little of the supervisor’s conversation. In such 
cases, some employees ­will observe coworkers, figure out the job from the job 
description, or learn the job on their own despite the supervisor. ­Others ­will 
fail, and their failure is the fault of the poorly prepared supervisor. Rather, the 
supervisor should carefully plan the onboarding experience and tailor it to 
the individual employee. The most effective supervisors have a checklist and 
spend time listening to the employee to understand gaps in understanding or 
needs for training. Then carefully planned training sessions ­will be effective.
Training and educating workers requires far more than demonstrating 
job skills, of course. New employees must also learn to fit into the organ­
ization’s culture, with its norms for acceptable and unacceptable be­hav­ior. 
Experienced staff members play a vital role in helping new employees make 
this transition effectively.9 New employees can look to more se­nior staff mem­
bers as role models or turn to them as teachers or coaches when deeper knowl­
edge is called for.
Training and Staff Development for 
Established Employees
New employees ­aren’t the only workers who need training. Any library 
staff member needs ongoing education to stay current, with the rapid changes 
taking place in all types of libraries. Although the terms training and staff 
development are often used synonymously, ­there is a distinction to be made. 
Training frequently means learning skills or knowledge that are required 
for the pres­ent job, whereas staff development involves learning on a larger 
scale, ­going beyond the pres­ent job, and looking ­toward the ­future. Even so, 
­because preserving a distinction between ­these two types of learning can be 
difficult, this book ­will discuss them together. (The related function of ­career 
development ­will be covered in chapter 12.)
Training can take place in vari­ous ways. Man­ag­ers who identify spe­
cific training needs might schedule recurring sessions about certain topics, 
such as conducting effective per­for­mance evaluation interviews, preparing 
per­for­mance evaluation reports, preparing departmental bud­get recom­
mendations, or conducting task analy­sis to revise job descriptions. Train­
ing sessions that concern all units of the organ­ization could be conducted 
­either by an in-­house specialist or by an expert con­sul­tant or trainer com­
missioned for this purpose.
In another training approach, some libraries adopt the vision of man­ag­
ers and supervisors as coaches for the employees they oversee. Like a good 
coach, a supervisor should act as a role model, help the employee set realistic 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  253
goals, give feedback on per­for­mance, suggest ways to improve that per­for­
mance, and provide reinforcement and encouragement. The supervisor and 
the employee should not view themselves as adversaries; they are on the same 
team, both trying to improve the organ­ization’s overall per­for­mance. A com­
mitment to coaching “sends the message that continuous learning is accepted 
practice. Coaching models how we must be with each other if we are to achieve 
our best individual and orga­nizational per­for­mance.”10 (More information 
about coaching is contained in chapter 17.) Increasingly, training is offered via 
online courses, webinars, or teleconferences. Also vendors of library technol­
ogy and databases usually provide training on their products at no cost for 
library employees.
Employees should also make use of the many professional development 
and educational programs that exist outside the organ­ization. Local, regional, 
and national conferences and workshops provide opportunities for employee 
development and growth. As library operations become more complex, library 
workers have an even greater need to take courses beyond the first professional 
degree. Recognizing this, many institutions ­will fund tuition for employees 
who take formal courses related to their jobs. Of course most academic librar­
ians have the benefit of ­free tuition personally or for ­family members. This 
benefits the organ­ization with employees who are interested in learning and 
developing broader perspectives.
Job exchanges locally, nationally, or even internationally11 can be effec­
tive ways for employees to gain perspective and renewal. The librarians who 
are exchanging jobs may also exchange housing, cars, and even pets. The 
exchange usually benefits both libraries as new ideas and approaches are 
described and tried out. Australian librarians use this approach to staff 
development ­because of the geographic isolation of that country. The Ameri­
can Library Association’s International Relations Round ­Table (IRRT) keeps 
an extensive list of international librarian opportunities.12
Some administrators in libraries are attempting to transform their 
libraries into “learning organ­izations,” in which “­people continually expand 
their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expan­
sive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set ­free, 
and where ­people are continually learning how to learn together.”13 (More 
information about learning organ­izations can be found in chapter 2.) The 
learning organ­ization generally has a team-­based culture, open flows of infor­
mation, empowered employees, and decentralized decision making.14 This 
type of organ­ization can grow and adapt in response to environmental changes. 
To encourage this flexibility, staff in learning organ­izations attempt to formal­
ize information exchanges. One attribute of a learning organ­ization is that 
staff members bring their knowledge about a topic to the ­table to share with 
­others who are less well-­informed, building information for all.
Man­ag­ers in such organ­izations must be open to suggestions and be will­
ing to make changes; they must also be able to admit ­mistakes to their own 
superiors without fear of reprisal. The emphasis is on continuous growth and 
training. At their best, learning organ­izations translate new knowledge into 
new ways of behaving.15
In summary, if librarians are to stay up-­to-­date, they need to continue 
learning. Man­ag­ers in ­every library, regardless of size or type, should plan 
training and staff development programs with activities scheduled and 
or­ga­nized along a structured continuum. Such programs enable employees to 
grow on the job, preparing to advance as opportunities pres­ent themselves. In 
other words, good staff development programs also contribute to employees’ 
­career development and at the same time, through such programs, employers

can identify potential supervisors and begin to train them for pos­si­ble pro­
motion. Employees are too valuable for any institution to neglect training 
programs that help personnel develop to their full potential.16
Per­for­mance Appraisals
A per­for­mance appraisal is the systematic evaluation of an employee’s 
job-­related strengths and weaknesses. Man­ag­ers in all types of organ­izations 
are responsible for evaluating their employees. Some workers are better than 
­others at specific jobs. Some workers take the initiative and carry through 
an assignment with ­little supervision, while ­others may be unreliable or 
require close supervision to ensure they complete proj­ects successfully. Some 
employees do not come to work on time or have many unapproved absences. 
When pay increases or promotions are in order, a supervisor needs a tool to 
help distinguish the excellent performers from the mediocre ones, from ­those 
who do not fit at all. A consistent, written appraisal system provides a sound 
method of assessing employee per­for­mance.

Man­ag­ers in some organ­izations have shifted the focus of their evalua­
tions in response to other changes in the enterprise. As we have seen, organ­
izations, especially the team-­based ones, often expect the supervisor to act 
more as a coach than as a boss. In such cases, the employee gets continuous 
feedback, with formal assessments taking place only once a year.
According to learning theory, immediate feedback helps learners improve 
their per­for­mance. All employees need feedback more often than once a year, 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  255
and good supervisors provide it. Usually, the ongoing feedback comes in a 
more informal, spontaneous fashion, whereas annual evaluations are more 
formal and structured. Care should be taken when a supervisor is giving an 
employee negative feedback about a per­for­mance. This conversation should 
be private and soon ­after a prob­lem has occurred. Supervisors should never 
surprise an employee with a negative review, but should have given feedback 
all year long leading up to that review if the employee’s per­for­mance has not 
improved.
Judging another person’s per­for­mance is difficult, and often supervi­
sors and subordinates alike feel ambivalent about annual reviews. Some 
writers have likened appraisals to paying taxes, in that both are ­things that 
man­ag­ers are obligated to do but would prefer to avoid. Also, although most 
employees want per­for­mance feedback, they prefer to hear positive feedback 
that accords with their self-­image as good performers not negative feed­
back that points out their weaknesses.
Why Supervisors Give Appraisals
Formal per­for­mance assessments have two main objectives. The first is 
to determine how well an employee performs on the job. The second is to com­
municate that information to the employee. This way, if the employee needs 
improvement, he or she knows where the deficiencies lie or how to take a bet­
ter approach next time. Clearly, to achieve this second objective, the super­
visor must convey this information and then develop a remedial plan with 
the employee; other­wise, the employee’s per­for­mance is unlikely to improve.
Per­for­mance appraisals generate the information HR man­ag­ers need to 
make impor­tant decisions about promotion, demotion, and termination of 
employees. A good appraisal system helps man­ag­ers promote outstanding 
workers and weed out or improve the per­for­mance of poor performers. Such 
a system should include a written assessment of the worker and a private 
meeting to discuss the findings. Most organ­izations also link pay raise deci­
sions to an employee’s per­for­mance rating.
By providing concrete feedback, per­for­mance appraisals help employees 
improve their per­for­mance. Supervisors should be aware that some employ­
ees have a strong fear of the appraisal pro­cess and should try to make employ­
ees comfortable and secure while they perform the review.17 The appraisal 
pro­cess should encourage employees to establish personal development goals 
that ­will in turn further the goals of the institution. Fi­nally, per­for­mance 
appraisals can assist man­ag­ers who need information for determining orga­
nizational and individual training needs.
When to Do Appraisals
Each organ­ization should decide when and how often per­for­mance 
appraisals ­will be administered, although often the schedule and frequency 
is mandated by a parent body, such as a state government or a university. 
Regardless of who makes the decision, ­there should always be a definite 
schedule, and each employee should know the times and frequencies of per­
for­mance appraisals.
While, most commonly, per­for­mance appraisals recur once a year, they 
should happen often enough that employees know ­whether their per­for­mance 
is satisfactory. If not, they should know what steps to take for improvement; 
indeed, some employees need appraisal more than once a year. Informal per­
for­mance assessments should occur several times a year to supplement the 

256  ­Huma n Resource
formal annual review. This is particularly impor­tant when an employee 
needs to improve per­for­mance or correct a be­hav­ior. If an employee makes a 
­mistake, the supervisor should communicate about it in a timely fashion and 
not wait for the annual review.
New employees need appraisal more frequently than veteran workers do. 
Accordingly, most organ­izations require new staff members to serve a pro­
bationary period before being hired permanently. A good supervisor ­will dis­
cuss the job description and the new employee’s per­for­mance with him or 
her several times during the probationary period before administering a final 
per­for­mance rating.
Some institutions schedule all per­for­mance evaluations at the same 
time, which enables a supervisor to compare all subordinates. Two draw­
backs of grouping all the appraisals are that supervisors who must carry 
out many reviews in the same period can be overwhelmed, resulting in poorly 
prepared per­for­mance evaluations; and when every­one in the organ­ization 
is working on evaluations, the productivity of the organ­ization decreases. To 
avoid overload, man­ag­ers in some institutions schedule per­for­mance evalu­
ations on each anniversary of an employee’s permanent appointment. It is 
thought that this approach distributes the workload over the entire year so 
that man­ag­ers can make more careful judgments.
Who Does the Appraisals?
Employees’ per­for­mance is usually evaluated by their immediate super­
visor, who regularly observes their work. In some institutions, however, the 
common custom of supervisor review is replaced or supplemented by other 
methods including peer appraisals, supervisor appraisals, 360-­degree apprais­
als, and self appraisals.
Peer Appraisals: Some professional librarians, primarily academic 
ones, are rated by their peers. ­Because many academic librarians have fac­
ulty status, they undergo the same type of peer per­for­mance review used for 
most faculty members in higher education. Professional librarians interact 
with one another and are usually familiar with one another’s work. In addi­
tion, many ele­ments of a librarian’s job, particularly at the departmental 
level, require cooperative work. Thus, they should be good judges of one anoth­
er’s per­for­mance. In addition to peer appraisals of their overall job per­for­
mance, some academic librarians who teach instructional units have their 
teaching evaluated by peers.18
Supervisor Appraisals: Some organ­izations allow subordinates to 
assess the per­for­mance of their immediate supervisor. For this type of appraisal 
to succeed, considerable trust and openness are essential; in most cases, 
subordinates do not evaluate their bosses ­unless their anonymity is guaran­
teed. Evaluations of a supervisor by subordinates are seen only by that super­
visor’s man­ag­er. This type of evaluation has two main purposes: to guide 
the supervisor’s self-­development and to allow employees to express their 
viewpoints. The pro­cess must be done correctly using a valid and reliable 
instrument, ­because inaccurate and inadequate information about a super­
visor could create a distorted view of the supervisor’s per­for­mance, and, thus, 
could potentially lead to ­legal challenges.19 The Arizona Health Sciences 
Library instituted an upward evaluation system that has been very success­
ful.20 Upward evaluations provide a good way for employees to have a voice in 
how their supervisors are evaluated, but if done only once a year, have the 
same limitations of not giving negative feedback in a timely manner.
360-­Degree Appraisals: Another approach to per­for­mance review is 
termed 360-­degree or multirater feedback, which incorporates confidential 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  257
per­for­mance assessments from a variety of sources, including direct reports, 
man­ag­ers, peers, and internal and external customers, as well as the indi­
vidual employee. All reviews are anonymous and are usually compiled by the 
HR department into a report for the employee. This 360-­degree approach 
gives an employee feedback on per­for­mance facets that may be overlooked 
in a traditional top-­down assessment. One reason for its increasing use is 
that administrators in many organ­izations have eliminated layers of ­middle 
man­ag­ers, leaving the remaining man­ag­ers with wider spans of control. Now 
facing the difficulty of accurately assessing even more employees, such man­
ag­ers can benefit by getting input from other coworkers. Another impetus 
for the adoption of 360-­degree feedback is the ever-­larger number of organ­
izations using self-­directed teams; team members are in the best position to 
knowledgeably assess a teammate’s per­for­mance.
This type of evaluation yields valuable data, but it can be very threat­
ening to individual man­ag­ers. It also can be very time-­consuming. Imagine 
that a library with 30 employees deci­ded to institute this type of per­for­mance 
appraisal, with each employee to be evaluated by six other employees using 
an appraisal instrument that took 45 minutes to complete. It is easy to see 
how costly this appraisal method would be in terms of time and effort 
expended. Another impor­tant ­factor is that this system should show how 
employees are helping the organ­ization achieve strategic planning goals, not 
just aspects of the job description.21 In fact this should be part of ­every 
employee’s evaluation.
If an administrator decides to institute 360-­degree personnel apprais­
als, the pro­cess must be planned carefully. Implementing a well-­designed 
system takes time. As with all other appraisal systems, supervisors need 
support from top management; in addition, ­because employees know their 
jobs best, they should help develop the appraisal criteria. Every­one partici­
pating in the pro­cess should also undergo training in giving and receiving 
360-­degree feedback. If employees are given feedback but do not know how 
to absorb it, they do not know what actions to take. As one expert states, 
“­There is often too much focus on getting the feedback and mining the data 
and too ­little focus on using the feedback for job-­related or be­hav­ior change.”22 
As with any new system, the procedure prob­ably should be pilot-­tested in a 
single area before being ­adopted library-­wide. Man­ag­ers should monitor the 
system to be sure it is performing as designed and be ready to modify it if it 
is not.
Self-­Appraisals: In some organ­izations employees are asked to evaluate 
themselves. ­Here are a few questions that are common in self-­appraisals:
•	 What ­were your most significant accomplishments for the year?
•	 What barriers did you find in trying to complete responsibilities or 
achieve your goals?
•	 What are your areas of strength?
•	 What areas do you believe need improvement?
•	 What new skills do you need to improve your per­for­mance?
Workers are much less defensive if they themselves point out their short­
comings, instead of the man­ag­er ­doing so. Unfortunately, however, not all 
employees can evaluate themselves accurately, and often the employee’s eval­
uation is at odds with that of the supervisor. Where self-­appraisal is used, it 
is almost always combined with another type of appraisal and ultimately the 
supervisor’s evaluation takes pre­ce­dence.

258  ­Huma n Resource
What­ever type of per­for­mance appraisal program may be instituted, 
se­nior man­ag­ers must not only support it but must also orient and train 
supervisors. ­Unless the upper echelons of management are supportive, the 
program likely ­will be in­effec­tive. Management support includes giving 
supervisors sufficient time to carry out the appraisals. Many supervisors dis­
like the pro­cess of evaluating their employees; even more find it difficult to 
discuss deficiencies with them. Training can help supervisors be more com­
fortable with the entire appraisal pro­cess.
Before any system of per­for­mance appraisal is instituted, man­ag­ers 
must be clear about specifying the per­for­mance standards against which an 
employee’s work ­will be judged. ­These standards usually fall into three 
categories:
•	 Quality-­Quantity Standards: How well does the employee per­
form the vari­ous tasks in the job description, and how much of each 
task does the employee accomplish?
•	 Desired Effect Standards: Is the work complete, accurate, and 
timely? Does it support the goals and objectives of the institution and 
users? Does the employee gather sound data as a basis for judgment 
and decisions?
•	 Manner of Per­for­mance Standards: Does the employee cooper­
ate well with ­others, without friction? Can the employee adapt to new 
programs or pro­cesses?
If departmental supervisors interpret standards differently or give 
greater weight to one standard over the ­others, inequity in evaluation ­will 
result. To avoid this, supervisors in many organ­izations are provided with a 
per­for­mance evaluation manual in which top management has defined the 
standards. ­Needless to say, all ­factors being assessed should be job-­related 
and also show how the employee is furthering the goals of the organ­ization.
Prob­lems in Rating
­Because appraisals are done by ­human beings, they are subject to vari­
ous weaknesses and errors. ­Table 11.4 lists the most common errors in per­
for­mance appraisal. Fortunately, certain techniques can reduce ­these errors. 
Training is essential to ensure accurate per­for­mance appraisals. Keeping 
good rec­ords of employee per­for­mance can also lessen errors. Supervisors 
should have input into the type of appraisal system that is used; they ­will 
then use it more effectively. And to minimize errors, top management must 
make it clear that all supervisors are to take per­for­mance appraisal very 
seriously. Indeed, not only should good appraisals be expected, but they 
should also be rewarded. When administrators in the organ­ization expect 
well developed appraisals and systematically reward supervisors who consci­
entiously carry out ­those appraisals, it lays the foundation for an effective 
per­for­mance evaluation structure.
Methods of Per­for­mance Appraisal
­Because ­there are no standard methods of per­for­mance appraisal, no 
par­tic­u­lar method works best in all settings. Instead, many effective methods 
exist. In general, staff in all departments within an organ­ization ­will agree 
upon a single method or combination of methods. The chosen method may be 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  259
that used by the parent institution, as in the case of a library that forms part 
of a larger business, municipal, or academic system. If library man­ag­ers are 
­free to select the method used, staff committees may have input into this 
decision. In larger libraries, the HR office often plays a key role in selecting 
and developing the method. The most commonly used per­for­mance appraisal 
methods include essays, ranking, forced distribution graphic rating scales, 
behaviorally anchored rating scales, and a combination of methods.
Essays: In this method, the rater describes an individual’s per­for­mance 
in a written narrative. Sometimes the essay is unstructured, but usually the 
rater is asked general questions about the employee’s job knowledge, strengths 
and weaknesses, and promotion potential. Essays’ major drawback is that 
their length and content may vary, and consistency in assessment is there­
fore hard to achieve. The rater’s writing ability also may affect the appraisal, 
in that an employee’s rating looks comparatively poor when it is poorly 
expressed. Essays are most effective when combined with another appraisal 
technique.
Ranking: Several ranking systems exist for employee appraisal. With 
the ­simple ranking method, the supervisor ranks employees’ per­for­mance 
from best to worst. In alternative ranking, the supervisor begins by choosing 
the best and worst performers, and then selects the next-­best and the next-­
poorest performers. This pro­cess continues, alternating from top to bottom 
of the scale, ­until all employees have been ranked. For the paired comparison 
method, supervisors systematically compare each employee with ­every other 
­TABLE 11.4. Common Errors in Per­for­mance Appraisals
The halo effect: when the rating assigned to one characteristic unduly influences 
the rating on all ­factors. For example, a supervisor who thinks an employee is 
outstanding in one area gives that individual high ratings on all aspects being 
evaluated.
Prejudice and partiality: when a supervisor’s personal feelings about a 
subordinate affect the rating given to that subordinate. This is a serious error. 
Note that it is illegal to consider race, creed, color, religion, politics, nationality, 
or gender in evaluating work per­for­mance.
Leniency or strictness: when dif­fer­ent supervisors use dif­fer­ent standards for 
evaluation, so that similar employees receive vastly dif­fer­ent ratings. Some 
supervisors rate all their subordinates highly ­because they do not want to face 
low-­rated employees’ resentment or disappointment. Equally damaging are low 
ratings across the board, which indicate supervisors have artificially high 
standards that few workers can ever meet.
Central tendency: when a supervisor hesitates to use the rating scale’s high or 
low extremes, resulting in all scores clustered about the center. On a normal 
distribution curve, most ­people ­will be rated closer to the mean than to any other 
point. When all ratings are clustered at the center, however, most of the value of 
the per­for­mance appraisal is lost.
Contrast: when a supervisor mea­sures not the work the employee has actually 
done but the work the supervisor thinks the employee is capable of ­doing.
Association: when a supervisor working on many evaluations rates ­factors at the 
same level merely ­because the questions are together on the page. This often occurs 
when the supervisor is tired and makes hurried judgments without all the facts.
Recency: when a supervisor appraises only the employee’s recent work, rather 
than assessing the work done over the entire appraisal period.

260  ­Huma n Resource
employee, one at a time. The advantage of ranking systems is their simplic­
ity. The major disadvantages are that they do not reveal the degree of dif­
ference between persons in adjacent ranks, and that workers with the same 
per­for­mance rating must be given separate ranks. Furthermore, compar­
ing groups of employees to one another is dubious, ­because the workers 
ranked highest in one unit may not be as good as ­those ranked highest in 
another unit.
Forced Distribution: Designed to address a common prob­lem with rat­
ing scales when too many ­people are rated on the high end, the forced distri­
bution rating system prevents clustering. It does so by requiring that the 
assessor place a certain percentage of employees at vari­ous intervals on the 
per­for­mance scale. Usually, a supervisor allocates 10 ­percent to the highest 
echelon and 10 ­percent to the lowest, with the other employees assigned pro­
portionately. The resulting distribution is intended to be a normal bell-­shaped 
curve (figure 11.1). However, the under­lying assumption of this method, that 
per­for­mance ratings ­will constitute a normal curve, may be untrue. Also, 
note that this method is very difficult to use when evaluating a small number 
of employees.
Graphic Rating Scales: In libraries and information centers, this is 
the most commonly used appraisal method. The assessor evaluates the 
employee on such ­factors as quantity of work, dependability, initiative, job 
knowledge, and accuracy. A very ­simple form is used in some organ­izations, 
with each evaluation ­factor listed, defined, and followed by a rating spectrum. 
The supervisor indicates an employee’s rating for each ­factor by marking the 
appropriate spot on the horizontal line.

Accuracy in the Correctness of Work Performed
Poor
Fair
Average
Good
Excellent
Unfortunately, supervisors have ­great difficulty agreeing on the defini­
tion of terms like average or good. No ­matter how much training supervi­
sors may have received, each ­will interpret ­these terms differently. In recent 
years, HR staff members in most institutions have improved the graphic rat­
ing scale by incorporating short phrases to describe each per­for­mance level. 
The most difficult part of developing ­these new scales is to provide a short 
phrase that cannot be misinterpreted, thus assuring similar interpretations 
by dif­fer­ent supervisors. In such a form, accuracy might be evaluated as 
follows:
Accuracy in the Correctness of Work Performed
Makes 
frequent 
errors
Careless, 
often makes

of errors
Usually 
accurate
Requires ­little 
supervision; is 
exact and 
precise most of 
the time
Requires 
minimum of 
supervision; is 
almost always 
accurate
One reason for the popularity of graphic rating scales is that they require 
relatively ­little time to construct and administer. In addition, they force an 
evaluator to consider several per­for­mance dimensions, and standardized 
scales are comparable among departments and individuals. Their biggest 
drawback is that they are susceptible to such errors as the halo effect, central 
tendency, or leniency. Also, by their nature all rating scales look backward, 
judging employee per­for­mance over a past assessment period, instead of show­
ing the employee objective goals for improvement. An example of a graphic 
rating scale appears in figure 11.2.
Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS): BARS attempt to 
correct some of the deficiencies in the graphic rating scale. As a management 
team develops BARS, jobholders and supervisors actively participate, help­
ing identify key job dimensions and responsibilities. Each job is likely to have 
several dimensions, with a separate scale for each. The anchors are specific 
descriptions of ­actual job be­hav­iors that represent specific levels of per­for­
mance, as determined by supervisors. When ­doing a per­for­mance appraisal 
using BARS, the assessor reads through the list of anchors on each scale (i.e., 
for each job be­hav­ior) and selects the anchor that best describes the employ­
ee’s job be­hav­ior. Each anchor has a value, with the combined values for each 
job dimension constituting an employee’s overall evaluation.
If good behavioral statements are provided as anchors, using BARS can 
help reduce errors. Also, ­because man­ag­ers and jobholders alike participate 
in developing BARS, employees are more likely to accept the results of this 
appraisal method. Figure 11.3 shows a scale that might be used to evaluate 
the job dimensions of program promotion and public relations. Such a BARS 
could be used to evaluate librarians who ­handle program promotion in a pub­
lic library.
BARS take more time to develop than graphic rating scales, in part 
­because supervisors must develop a separate form for each job. As a result, 
BARS may be impractical in smaller organ­izations, where ­there are often so 
few employees in each specific job that the scales are not needed.23 ­Because 
this system is difficult to implement, it is not widely used in libraries.

Combination of Methods: ­There are many types of per­for­mance 
appraisals, and no one type is uniformly best. Many organ­izations use dif­
fer­ent methods for dif­fer­ent types of employees or combine two dif­fer­ent 
approaches to create a hybrid system. It is very common to have graphic rating 
scales combined with an essay to provide additional information about an

employee’s per­for­mance. Or as said above, a self-­evaluation combined with a 
review from the supervisor could pres­ent both a framework for the evalua­
tion and an opportunity for discussion.
The Per­for­mance Appraisal Review Pro­cess
The per­for­mance appraisal pro­cess takes vari­ous forms, but some ele­
ments are common to almost all of them. Someone from the office responsi­
ble for appraisals (prob­ably HR or the library director’s office) distributes the 
appropriate forms and provides training to both the employee and the super­
visor. The office also provides information specifying the employee to be 
evaluated, the person responsible for completing the form, and the form’s due 
date. Man­ag­ers are using online appraisal forms to standardize the pro­cess 
and make it more efficient.
­After receiving the form, the rater is obligated to evaluate the employ­
ee’s per­for­mance thoughtfully and carefully. The rater must consider the 
employee’s work over the entire rating period, not basing the assessment 
solely on recent events. This is impor­tant ­because a recent event could skew 
the review in ­either direction. And he or she must be willing to give negative 
evaluations when necessary. As stated above, ­these negative evaluations 
should come as no surprise to the employee. With ­today’s emphasis on account­
ability, it is the rater’s responsibility to be accurate and truthful in an 
employee’s per­for­mance evaluation. If the per­for­mance has been bad, the 
evaluation should reflect that. Ideally, the assessor ­will base judgments on

Talk About It
“It takes humility to ask a question about your per­for­mance. And even more 
humility to consider the answer.” Senora Roy24
A per­for­mance appraisal should be a time for dialogue; a formal time to thank the employee 
for contributions and to discuss areas that need improvement and for the employee to 
share his or her perspective on the work done. Think about any job you have had and dis­
cuss the ways you got feedback on your per­for­mance. This could be part of an informal 
or formal pro­cess. If you have not had any jobs that required a per­for­mance management 
system, use other kinds of employments such as volunteering. For example if you sold Girl 
Scout Cookies or mowed lawns, did anyone give you feedback? Discuss the situation and 
how you felt about the outcome.
contemporaneous notes from prior meetings with the employee or diary 
entries, evidence that ­will help justify the evaluation. Such mea­sures are 
especially impor­tant when an evaluation is negative. To ensure that an eval­
uation is unbiased, the rater and his or her supervisor should review the 
completed form together and come to a consensus on its accuracy. Often the 
director or the head of ­human resources ­will read all the evaluations.
The Per­for­mance Appraisal Interview
The next step in the pro­cess is a per­for­mance appraisal interview, in 
which the rater shares the results of the evaluation with the employee. Con­
ducting this interview may well be the most difficult part of the pro­cess. It 
is certainly the part that employees and their supervisors most dread. The 
employee should have a copy of the appraisal and necessary time before the 
interview to read it and make any notes.
The supervisor must prepare for the meeting, as well, possibly by exam­
ining previous per­for­mance appraisals to see the employee’s pro­gress. 
Certainly the supervisor ­will plan the meeting’s structure. The supervisor 
should make ­every effort to adhere to the established interview schedule; 
since most employees are apprehensive about ­these per­for­mance appraisal 
interviews, postponements or other schedule changes ­will only add to their 
worry and concern. Also, ­because of the sensitivity of this meeting, the super­
visor must establish as informal an atmosphere as pos­si­ble. Supervisors 
may wish to conduct the interview away from their desks, in an area with 
more informal furniture, ­because the managerial desk, as a symbol of author­
ity, may pres­ent a psychological obstacle. Fi­nally, supervisors should ensure 
that the interview ­will not be interrupted. During the meeting, the super­
visor should ask questions or make comments that encourage the employee 
to talk. The focus should be on the per­for­mance appraisal; the employee 
­will have an opportunity to respond to vari­ous ele­ments of the appraisal, 
and the supervisor can explain why certain ele­ments ­were rated as they 
­were.
The supervisor has four main objectives for this meeting: (1) to identify 
any prob­lems the employee has in performing assigned tasks; (2) to determine 
methods or procedures that might resolve ­these prob­lems; (3) to understand 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  265
the employee’s level of satisfaction with the job, the institution, and the work­
ing environment; and (4) to help the employee plan personal programs and 
activities to improve job effectiveness or prepare for advancement.
The last objective is particularly impor­tant. Working together, the 
employee and the supervisor establish current and long-­range goals for the 
employee and rec­ord them on the per­for­mance evaluation form. (At the next 
evaluation interview, the two ­will discuss the employee’s pro­gress ­toward the 
goals.) By signing the form, the employee indicates ac­cep­tance of the evalu­
ation and proposed goals.
Of course, not all interviews go smoothly. Sometimes supervisors must 
tell employees their work is not up to the library’s standards. On occasion, 
the supervisor ­will have to demote or terminate an employee. The supervisor 
should be able to anticipate when such action might be necessary, drawing 
inferences from previous and current per­for­mance reviews as well as the 
employee’s known attitude and be­hav­ior. A wise supervisor is seldom caught 
unprepared for any direction the interview takes.
Though difficult, per­for­mance appraisal is a necessary part of HR admin­
istration. Good per­for­mance review systems help employees understand how 
well they are ­doing and provide an opportunity for growth and development.
Discipline and Grievances
Eventually almost ­every man­ag­er must deal with an employee who fails 
to comply with the requirements of the job or the organ­ization. The supervi­
sor may need to invoke some sort of disciplinary procedure to resolve the 
issue. Conversely, if an employee has a complaint about the organ­ization or 
its management, the employee may need to use the organ­ization’s grievance 
protocol to resolve the prob­lem.
Discipline may be defined as the action man­ag­ers in an organ­ization 
take against an employee when his or her per­for­mance has deteriorated badly 
or when the employee has ­violated an institutional rule. Discipline communi­
cates to employees that they need to change their be­hav­ior to meet established 
standards. Reasons for disciplinary action include excessive absenteeism, 
theft, or failure to complete a degree on schedule. What­ever the cause, super­
visors must bear in mind two objectives: preserving the interests of the 
organ­ization and protecting the rights of the individual.
Most organ­izations have formal policies and procedures for ­handling dis­
cipline. It has been estimated that only about five percent of employees ever 
need discipline; the clear majority are good workers who want to do the right 
­thing.25 Nevertheless, disciplinary policies and procedures must be in place 
for supervisors to deal with the few who need them. Before establishing 
such procedures, man­ag­ers in each institution must develop rules govern­
ing employee per­for­mance and must act to ensure that each employee clearly 
understands ­these rules. If an employee violates a rule or work standard, a 
supervisor must take disciplinary action but, before ­doing so, should estab­
lish that the poor per­for­mance does not stem from external ­factors, such as 
poor training, insufficient supervision, or inadequate equipment.
Disciplinary actions take vari­ous forms, depending on the nature and 
frequency of the offending be­hav­ior. Most organ­izations employ what is 
known as progressive discipline, in which a series of steps must be taken 
before dismissal so that an employee ­will have an opportunity to correct his 
or her be­hav­ior. The mildest of ­these actions is a ­simple oral warning. ­After 
this, the penalties escalate. A typical progression is from an oral warning

Practice Your Skills
You are managing a student workforce of five workers. You have spent a ­great deal of time 
training them and making sure they understand the work they need to perform. One of 
the five students, Sam, is supposed to work from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday to cover the circulation desk. He has consistently not shown up 
for work on Fridays, giving weak excuses, and leaving you or one of your team members 
to stay late to cover for him. This has now happened three weeks in a row and you need 
to talk to him. His work per­for­mance on Mondays and Wednesdays is very good. He does 
a careful, accurate job and has a good manner with library users. You have not spoken 
to him about this before. Prepare a plan for this conversation: What do you want to achieve? 
What are the key points you want to make? How do you think he ­will react? When you 
are ready, role play your meeting with a friend and then discuss the outcome. Think, also, 
about ­whether ­there was anything you could have done before the third missed Friday 
to avoid this meeting.
that gets noted in the employee’s personnel rec­ord, to a written warning, to 
suspension without pay for varying lengths of time, and, fi­nally, to the harsh­
est penalty, discharge from the job. In cases of gross misconduct, such as 
assaulting a supervisor, an employee can be dismissed without ­these steps. 
To be ready for pos­si­ble litigation, it is very impor­tant that the supervisor 
documents each step of the pro­cess.
For discipline to be effective, the penalties must be imposed properly. 
Many HR experts refer to the so-­called red-­hot-­stove method of administer­
ing discipline. Before you touch a red-­hot stove, you are aware the punish­
ment is:
•	 Immediate: the stove burns you immediately and not some time 
­later
•	 Comes with forewarning: as you approach the stove you can feel 
the heat
•	 Consistent: the hot stove always burns you
•	 Impartial: whoever touches the stove ­will be burnt
The same is true of the best disciplinary systems. Management should 
discipline employees promptly and impersonally, without any animosity on 
the part of the supervisor. Although a supervisor should never hesitate to 
use discipline when necessary, he or she must remember that discipline is 
intended to correct a prob­lem or to modify job be­hav­ior, not to humiliate the 
employee in question. The supervisor should administer discipline calmly 
and in private, encouraging two-­way communication, and then supervisor 
and employee should agree on a follow-up plan for improving the errant be­hav­
ior. If pos­si­ble, the interview should end on a positive note, with the employee 
believing that both the supervisor and ­others in the organ­ization want him 
or her to succeed if specific steps and deadlines are met.
No one likes to administer discipline, but, if executed properly, a disci­
plinary system can be effective for job-­related employee prob­lems. In addi­
tion to correcting the individual in question, discipline may prevent other 
employees from acting in a similar fashion, assure coworkers that inappro­
priate be­hav­ior ­will not be tolerated, and demonstrate the man­ag­er’s com­
mitment to a high standard of conduct.26

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  267
Firing or Termination
In cases where none of ­these disciplinary procedures are effective, a man­
ag­er may have to dismiss an employee. Firing is the term usually used when 
an employee is discharged for cause. An employee who has committed a major 
transgression (such as stealing, gross insubordination, or the like) would be 
fired. Termination, which is slightly dif­fer­ent, results when an employee has 
failed to meet job expectations ­after a reasonable amount of time.
Discharging an employee is never easy, but the supervisor must execute 
the pro­cess correctly; the mishandling of terminations is a major cause of 
employee lawsuits. Documentation, impor­tant in all HR decisions, is espe­
cially crucial in the case of terminations. Retain all relevant evidence that 
supports the need for termination in case of litigation. Throughout the pro­
cess, man­ag­ers should treat the employee with re­spect, bearing in mind how 
traumatic it is to lose a job for any reason. At the same time, however, the 
man­ag­er has a duty to remove underperforming employees before they affect 
another worker’s morale and impede the department’s work. ­There are times 
when an employee is not the right fit for a position and might work out in a 
dif­fer­ent environment. Sometimes the situation can be sal­vaged by reassign­
ing the employee, but this employee should be on probation in the new post, 
so that if it does not work out, he or she may be terminated.
Grievance Systems
Discipline addresses the dissatisfaction that organ­izations have with 
employees. A grievance system, on the other hand, enables employees to 
address prob­lems they may have with supervisors or with the organ­ization. 
A grievance is any complaint relating to employment that someone brings to 
the attention of an organ­ization’s management. Grievance procedures exist 
in both ­unionized and nonunionized organ­izations, but when the organ­ization 
is ­unionized, the procedure is apt to be more formal and well-­defined.
In a ­unionized institution, the collective bargaining agreement estab­
lishes the procedures for ­handling grievances; steps are outlined in the ­union 
contract. In general, the first step is for the aggrieved employee to meet with 
the ­union steward (the ­union representative for that employee’s unit). The 
employee and the ­union steward discuss the grievance, and ­either the ­union 
steward ­will dismiss the complaint, or together bring the grievance to the 
grievant’s supervisor. If this step does not yield a mutually satisfactory solu­
tion, the employee and steward put the grievance in writing, and continue 
the pro­cess with the next level of management. If this fails to resolve the 
prob­lem, higher management and the HR department usually become 
involved. If the grievance cannot be solved within the organ­ization, the griev­
ant can request arbitration, in which the employer and the employee’s ­union 
bring in an outside, neutral third party to ­settle the dispute. The arbitrator’s 
decision is binding for all parties.
Many nonunionized institutions use the open-­door policy to solve employee 
grievances in an informal manner. ­Under this policy, supervisors encourage 
employees to come to their office voluntarily at any time to discuss prob­lems 
and complaints, and the assumption is made that employees ­will feel ­free to 
do so. Consequently the open-­door policy works only when the supervisor has 
been able to instill in employees a feeling of trust. Employees must feel that 
the supervisor ­will objectively hear and fairly resolve any prob­lem, and be 
confident that he or she ­will not consider them troublemakers for raising the 
issue. When the supervisor is skilled in ­human relations and is sensitive to 
employee needs and feelings, this policy can be quite successful. It gives the 

268  ­Huma n Resource
supervisor an opportunity to explain a certain action and resolve the com­
plaint or grievance face-­to-­face. Factual prob­lems are generally the easiest to 
fix, ­because they involve easily verified situations such as working conditions, 
hours of work, or changes in job procedures. Prob­lems that involve employees’ 
emotions are often much more difficult to ­handle.
­Whether ­unionized or not, all organ­izations should have formal grievance 
procedures. In a nonunionized organ­ization, management must establish 
the grievance procedure. A grievance procedure defines:
•	 The manner in which grievances are filed (written or oral)
•	 To whom the grievance is submitted
•	 How the grievance proceeds through the organ­ization’s hierarchy
•	 Where decisions about the grievance are made, and
•	 The final point of decision.
Usually, the procedures also identify actions aggrieved employees can 
take if they are not satisfied with the final decision.
Grievance procedures remove an employee from the direct and complete 
control of his or her immediate supervisor. They exist to assure employees 
that justice is available when they have a legitimate complaint against the 
organ­ization.
Employee Compensation
Salary administrators aim to establish an equitable system of compen­
sating employees. In most libraries, employees are offered only salaries and 
benefits, unlike for-­profit corporations, which often provide annual bonuses, 
stock options, or other special incentives and rewards. Note that HR special­
ists differentiate between wages and salaries. Wages refers to employee pay 
that is calculated according to the number of hours worked each week, and 
salary refers to compensation that is uniform from one pay period to the next. 
Wages are usually reported by the hour, salaries by the year.
Two other terms differentiate between ­these types of employees. Wage 
earning employees are often referred to as nonexempt personnel. Gener­
ally, nonexempt employees, so called ­because they are covered by the Fair 
­Labor Standards Act (FLSA), work in nonsupervisory positions. The law 
requires that nonexempt employees be paid time-­and-­a-­half (the hourly 
wage multiplied by 1.5) for any overtime work. Salaried workers, who are 
not covered by the FLSA, are often referred to as exempt personnel; they 
are usually managerial or professional employees. Employers need not pay 
such employees for overtime work, regardless of the number of hours on 
the job.
Salary funding for most libraries comes primarily from their parent 
institution. A few libraries also receive a smaller amount of personnel funds 
via endowments, federal or foundation grants, or, occasionally, from earned 
income. Funds from federal or foundation grants go to specific proj­ects or pro­
grams on a temporary basis; such funding is often called soft money.
Private businesses and institutions are not required to reveal the wages 
or salaries of any individual employee or group of employees. Indeed, in many 
industries, salary information is a closely kept secret. The justification for 
salary secrecy is that it prevents discontent among employees, who ­will 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  269
compare their own pay with every­one ­else’s. Most public institutions, by con­
trast, are required to make salary information available. In many states, the 
salaries of state employees are considered part of the public rec­ord and, as 
such, are available in personnel offices and may be published or be available 
online.
Some employees dislike salary disclosure ­because they feel it violates 
their privacy. Public disclosure of salaries may sometimes lead to envy and 
a loss of morale. On the other hand, many believe that open disclosure of sala­
ries acts to curb favoritism and to lessen pay discrimination. Many HR spe­
cialists feel that, if pos­si­ble, a compromise between the two positions is best. 
An organ­ization should disclose the pay ranges for vari­ous jobs within the 
organ­ization but should not reveal what any par­tic­u­lar individual is earn­
ing. In libraries, as in other organ­izations, a salary administration program 
consists of three parts: the determination of what salary to pay, the develop­
ment of a salary scale, and the pro­cess of awarding salary increases.
Determination of Salary
Personnel in all institutions where pay is for ser­vices rendered must 
receive fair and equitable compensation based on the education, experience, 
and responsibility required for the job. The higher the job requirements, the 
higher the salary should be.
Institutions must offer competitive salaries to attract and retain quali­
fied employees. Individuals with specialized education, a work background 
that demonstrates their capability and the willingness to accept responsi­
bility are always in demand. Thus the salary must be high enough to attract 
them. Although money may not be the most impor­tant motivator for some, it 
is still very impor­tant to most ­people. Therefore, man­ag­ers in an institution 
that strives to hire and retain the best ­people ­will usually pay more than 
one that ­will accept lower per­for­mance and higher turnover.
What is fair pay? The answer to this question generally involves two gen­
eral issues: (1) internal equity, or what the employee is paid compared to what 
other employees in the same organ­ization are paid, and (2) external equity, 
or what the employee is paid compared to what employees in other organ­
izations are paid for performing similar jobs. Pay dissatisfaction can erode the 
quality of an employee’s work. If organ­izations are to avert this dissatisfac­
tion, employees must believe that both internal and external equity exist.
In general, the salaries of professional librarians are competitive nation­
ally, although regional and local conditions also affect them. For example, 
­because the cost of living in big coastal cities such as New York City or San 
Francisco is higher than in smaller communities, the salary levels must be 
commensurately higher. Alternatively, some institutions have a salary scale 
where the location of the job is not a ­factor. For example the California State 
University system faculty members are on a scale. You get the same salary 
if you are in a CSU in northern CA where housing is much less expensive 
than if you live in San Jose where housing is very expensive. Salary scales 
also exist in most school districts so that years of experience and education 
put you on a salary schedule that is in concrete.
Information on librarians’ salaries can be gathered in several ways. Usu­
ally published in the October issue of Library Journal, the annual report on 
current gradu­ates of accredited LIS schools shows the regional variations 
in beginning salaries as well as the national average and median salaries.27 
The Special Libraries Association periodically conducts an in-­depth survey 
of its members.28 The Allied Professional Association and the Office for 

270  ­Huma n Resource
Research and Statistics of the American Library Association now collect sal­
ary information for public and academic libraries ­every two years.29 The 
Association of Research Libraries publishes an annual salary survey.30 Some 
state libraries issue salary data for all libraries in that state. A man­ag­er 
seeking to establish appropriate pay levels may wish to gather data by conduct­
ing a salary survey or by simply evaluating salaries offered in advertise­
ments in professional periodicals. Also the Occupational Outlook Handbook 
has data on salaries nationwide.31 Regardless of the method, ­great care must 
be taken to ensure that all the data apply to positions with the same job 
requirements.
Salaries for nonprofessional library positions are usually determined by 
the ­going rate of pay within the library’s locality. The Allied Professional 
Association and Office for Research and Statistics of the American Library 
Association had provided a national overview of salaries for library support 
staff, but that information was last collected in 2007.32 Other entities with 
information on local salaries include the school system’s district office, local 
government, employment agencies, and the Chamber of Commerce. Internet 
sites also provide salary information.
Although the amount an employee is paid is not the only ­factor in job 
satisfaction, it is often a key reason why a librarian leaves one position to go 
to another. Man­ag­ers who want to avoid excessive employee turnover should 
strive to keep their current pay rates at least at the market average for simi­
lar positions.33 If library and information center man­ag­ers wish to attract 
the most talented employees, the salaries they offer their employees should 
be as attractive as ­those offered to employees who perform similar functions 
but work elsewhere.
Development of a Salary Scale
A salary scale establishes how much each employee ­will be paid for ful­
filling the duties designated in his or her job description. Each job has a min­
imum and a maximum figure. The minimum should represent the beginning 
or entry-­level salary, with the maximum reflecting how highly the institu­
tion values the job when performed with utmost efficiency and thoroughness. 
Between the minimum and the maximum salaries are steps on the scale that 
designate pay increases signifying an employee’s greater proficiency or expe­
rience. ­After an employee reaches the top step of a given scale, the only way 
he or she can get additional money is by a merit increase or by changing jobs 
and moving to a higher salary range.
Libraries work within institutions and salary scales are worked out 
for the ­whole institution. Many external ­factors influence the pro­cess. For 
instance, federal and state minimum-­wage laws put a floor ­under the pay 
rate of the lowest-­ranking employees. As of 2009, the last time it was raised, 
the federal minimum wage was $7.25 per hour; some states and cities have 
established a higher minimum wage.34 A ­union contract with negotiated com­
pensation rates may be a ­factor. The salaries paid by competing institutions 
also have an influence on the scale. As always, the law of supply and demand 
plays a part; employees who specialize in high-­demand tasks may com­
mand a higher salary than other employees with more commonly available 
expertise.
Establishing the salary scale is closely linked to formulating job evalu­
ations. Regardless of which evaluation method has been used (e.g., the ­factor 
method or the classification method), the ultimate objective is to ascertain 
the correct pay rate for all jobs and the differences between the rungs on the 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  271
salary scale. Most institutions have salary scales that overlap in adjacent 
pay grades (although some do not). An overlapping pay scale allows an out­
standing performer in a lower grade to make more money than a below-­
average worker in a higher grade. In a like fashion, an experienced worker 
in a lower grade would earn more than a beginning worker in a higher grade.
In administering a salary scale, some commonsense princi­ples should 
be kept in mind:
•	 Equal work should command equal pay. If jobs have equal require­
ments for education, experience, and responsibility, both should pay 
the same salary. Of course, this does not prevent having a salary 
range for each job, with individuals at dif­fer­ent steps within the range.
•	 Employees need not enter a salary scale at the first step. Usually 
institutions allow a new employee with related work experience to 
enter higher on the scale.
•	 If an employee is promoted from one rank to another, for instance, 
from Librarian I to Librarian II, that promotion should not come with 
a pay cut, even if the beginning salary of Librarian II is lower than 
the employee’s Librarian I earnings. Instead, give the employee a 
somewhat higher salary as compensation for assuming more respon­
sibility. Often the raise amount is capped at 15 ­percent.
Salary Increases
Salary increases in libraries and information centers are usually deter­
mined based on length of ser­vice, merit, or some combination of the two. Length 
of ser­vice, also known as se­niority, calls for increased pay on the princi­ple 
that an experienced worker is more valuable than an inexperienced one. 
Librarians in public schools usually have pay schedules with predetermined 
steps; with each year of experience, the librarians advance a step on the sal­
ary scale. Sometimes public college and universities employees receive a uni­
form salary increase (e.g., 4 ­percent), with all employees receiving the same 
percentage raise as a reward for their increasing se­niority. Though easy to 
administer, the automatic-­increase system does not allow the organ­ization to 
reward exceptional performers or correct pay equities.
The merit system awards salary increases only for quality per­for­mance. 
In any organ­ization, some workers contribute more than ­others. Merit pay 
allows the organ­ization to reward the most valuable employees. A merit-­
based system aims to encourage all employees to work better in the hopes of 
receiving a larger pay increase. Unfortunately, no plan of merit increases ­will 
satisfy all employees. Indeed, supervisors are often accused of using merit 
systems to reward their favorite employees. The merit system is also a prob­
lem when employees receive no pay increase at all. Owing to inflation, employ­
ees who get no salary increase suffer a loss of spending power and thus may 
not be able to maintain their standard of living from year to year. If an organ­
ization uses a merit system, it should ensure that the system is carefully 
designed, well publicized, and closely related to the employees’ per­for­mance 
appraisals.
The use of teams has complicated the awarding of salary increases. Tra­
ditionally, employees have been compensated based on individual per­for­
mance, but in team-­based organ­izations, many employees are now evaluated 
and paid according to the per­for­mance of the team as a ­whole. Rewarding 
team per­for­mance instead of individual accomplishments reinforces the 

272  ­Huma n Resource
Talk About It
Working with a group of ­people, brainstorm ways that a library with limited resources 
could show appreciation to employees. What are ways that any organ­ization can utilize 
to make ­people feel that the organ­ization is grateful for their accomplishments? Would 
you single out individuals, reward teams or find a way to honor the entire staff? Or all 
three?
value and importance of teams; but collective evaluation and compensation 
works well only when all team members contribute equitably. If not, ­free rid­
ers receive as ­great a pay increase as ­those who have worked much harder. 
Determining equitable pay for team members is difficult, but like all organ­
izations, librarians need to continue finding equitable ways of rewarding 
team members. What­ever the compensation system, of course, it should be 
one that man­ag­ers can communicate easily and that employees believe to 
be fair.
Recognition and Rewards
Library workers rarely receive monetary rewards, such as stock options 
or bonuses, which are often given to employees in the private sector. In addi­
tion, in ­these eco­nom­ically challenging times, many librarians have had very 
small or no pay increases for several years. Although nonmonetary rewards 
do not compensate for lagging salaries, more and more organ­izations of all 
types are looking for no-­cost or low-­cost ways to express appreciation for 
employees. Employee recognition programs usually are successful ­because 
employees are motivated by recognition. When ­people feel appreciated, they 
identify with the organ­ization and are therefore more productive. Man­ag­ers 
must be sure that rewards relate to the organ­ization’s needs, that the reward 
system is flexible and fair, and that rewards are publicized and, if appropri­
ate, presented in a public forum. Scheduling frequent reward pre­sen­ta­tions 
­will ensure that employees receive their rewards soon ­after their achieve­
ments are recognized. Cele­brations and awards can boost morale and increase 
productivity and quality. They also contribute to a strong orga­nizational 
culture.
Employee Benefits
Employees’ compensation packages consist not only of salary but also of 
benefits. Libraries and information centers provide so many varied benefits 
that ­these extras are now a major component of total compensation. Although 
employee benefits packages are largely determined by a library’s parent insti­
tution, some benefits are required by federal or state law; in ­unionized work­
places, some are mandated as part of a collective-­bargaining agreement.
Federal and state regulations apply to almost all workers in the United 
States. Among the benefits required by ­these laws are Social Security, unem­
ployment insurance, and workers’ compensation. Unemployment insurance 
and workers’ compensation are financed solely by employer contributions. 
Social Security is financed by equal contributions from employer and employee. 
At Social Security’s 1937 inception, the combined employer-­employee tax 

The ­Human Resources Function in the Library  273
rate was 2 ­percent on a maximum of $3,000 in earnings. In 2016, the com­
bined rate was 12.4 ­percent on a maximum of $127,200. In addition, employers 
and employees each pay an additional 1.45 ­percent on total earnings for Medi­
care.35 Many low-­wage employees contribute more to Social Security and 
Medicare than they pay in federal income tax. In addition to mandated ben­
efits, organ­izations provide other types of benefits, some of which the employer 
pays for in full, and some of which require the employee to share the cost.
Several types of group insurance plans are offered. Medical insurance 
is usually provided. Recently, as the cost of medical insurance has escalated, 
many organ­izations have shifted more of the cost of premiums onto the 
employee while also raising deductibles. In addition to health insurance, 
many organ­izations provide both group life insurance and disability insur­
ance; the latter pays employees during periods of disability caused by sick­
ness or accident. Some libraries also provide other benefits, such as dental 
and vision care insurance. As noted above, in some institutions the full cost 
for ­these benefits is paid; but more commonly the employee pays a portion, 
especially for coverage of dependents.
Paid time off includes holidays, vacations, and vari­ous types of leave. 
In some organ­izations, coffee breaks and lunch breaks are a part of the 40 
paid hours. In ­others, the work day is increased to accommodate time for 
lunch and other breaks. Employee retirement plans are pension or sav­
ings plans that offer an addition to the retirement coverage offered by Social 
Security. Commonly, both employer and employee contribute to ­these plans. 
It is very impor­tant for new employees to participate in ­these retirement 
plans ­because institutions may offer a match to what the employee saves, and 
if the employee does not participate they lose out on that money, plus they 
defer saving for retirement and the benefits of compound interest.
Many employers offer access to Employee Assistance Programs 
(EAPs), which provide assessment and referral for employees who have prob­
lems with workplace tensions, depression, ­family dissension, substance abuse, 
and financial or ­legal ­matters. EAPs help employees work through ­these 
prob­lems and stay on the job.
Librarians may be offered a wide variety of other benefits, depending on 
where they work. ­These may include travel support to professional associa­
tions or other continuing professional development opportunities, moving 
expenses to the new location, tuition refunds if ­children attend the institu­
tion, and access to subsidized day care.
A current trend in private industry is the use of flexible, or cafeteria, 
plans, so called ­because they allow employees to choose certain ele­ments of 
their benefits program from a range of options. ­These plans allow employees 
to tailor a program to fit their needs. For example, an employee who is cov­
ered by a spouse’s health insurance plan might forgo the health insurance 
option and instead select a larger amount of life insurance.
Some benefits are related to the rise in the number of two-­career fami­
lies. Many such workers particularly appreciate benefits that give them flex­
ibility to meet ­family responsibilities. For example, one nonmonetary benefit 
that is increasingly common in libraries and information centers is the alter­
native work schedule, which allows for flextime or a compressed workweek. 
Employees then have some freedom in choosing the hours and days they 
work. This flexibility, of course, can be granted only if schedulers ensure staff 
coverage for user ser­vices and the fulfillment of supervisory and training 
responsibilities. Before instituting an alternative work schedule, administra­
tors should develop clear plans of action, testing targeted jobs in advance to 
determine the likely effects of the new schedule.

274  ­Huma n Resource
Another nonmonetary benefit is telecommuting, which refers to working 
outside of the office, ­whether full-­time or part-­time. Often a telecommuter 
­will work at home, usually keeping in touch with the office via e-­mail, vid­
eoconferencing, or phone. Telecommuting has advantages for both employer 
and employee. The employer need not provide a work space for the employee. 
Benefits to the employee include a more flexible schedule, fewer interruptions, 
no commute, and maximum leeway in structuring his or her work environ­
ment. Telecommuting is increasing in popularity, especially for ­those serv­
ing online education programs. Some librarians are allowed to work out of 
their homes at least part-­time on such tasks as Web site design, online ref­
erence, and writing proj­ects. To be a successful telecommuter, it is impor­tant 
“to be self-­motivated, focused, and or­ga­nized, and to have a ­family life that 
­won’t create frequent work interruptions.”36 Clearly, telecommuting provides 
ultimate flexibility for employees with jobs that can be done off-­site.
Man­ag­ers in a few libraries have instituted the practice of job sharing, 
in which two ­people split the duties of one job. Usually they also share the 
salary; benefits, such as medical insurance, are sometimes prorated, but, in 
the best cases, both employees receive benefits.
Flextime, telecommuting, and job sharing particularly appeal to employ­
ees with small ­children ­because ­these work styles enable families to spend 
more time together. Other employees also find ­these options beneficial, of 
course, and ­these alternatives sometimes enable organ­izations to keep valu­
able employees they other­wise would lose.
Many employees take their benefits for granted, not realizing that the 
employer contributions to ­these benefits add considerably to an organ­ization’s 
total ­labor cost. On a percentage basis, the cost of benefits has increased sub­
stantially in recent years. The Bureau of ­Labor Statistics reports that in 
addition to salary or wages, in 2016, the average worker in the United States 
received an additional 30.2 to 36.7 ­percent more in benefits.37
Despite its cost, a well-­designed and well-­administered benefits program 
serves both employer and employee. A man­ag­er considering a benefits pro­
gram must study each ele­ment to assess its pos­si­ble financial impact. The 
man­ag­er must be sure the program is needed and desired by the employees, 
then carefully define the program and establish the necessary policies and 
procedures. Fi­nally, the man­ag­er should inform all employees about the ben­
efits package: which benefits are available, how to obtain them, and when 
each worker ­will be eligible. Supervisors should know about the entire ben­
efits package ­because many employees and prospective employees ­will turn 
to them for information of this type.
Talk About It
Work-­life balance is a challenge for many employees. They have ever increasing work­
loads, seeming to work more and more hours. They also have a life outside of work, and 
that life makes demands as well. ­People who work exceptionally long hours may not be 
that productive. How do you think ­people can find a good balance between the demands 
of the job and home? Make a list of ideas you have used or have read and then offer them 
to a group. Listen to what they suggest.

Conclusion
This chapter has covered the primary HR functions within a library. The 
next chapter ­will discuss some general issues that affect HR management, 
such as personnel procedures and policies, ­career development, mentoring, 
external regulations, and ­unionization.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Your supervisor has asked you to make suggestions for a new staff onboarding 
program. Based on what you have learned, what components would you include? 
How long would the program last? Who would be involved? Make an outline of 
ideas and then a schedule for the program.
2.	You know that your professional development ­after your LIS program is pri­
marily your responsibility. Make a list of activities you ­will plan to undertake 
to stay current in the field. ­These can be short, medium, and long range.
3.	Sally Devins is the director of a small library with nine professional librarians, 
and she understands the value of employee development. In fact, she knows 
that if ­people leave the library and go to conferences, they ­will gain invaluable 
perspective and ideas for new ways to approach their jobs. Therefore she has 
always tried to set aside some funds in the bud­get for travel. This week she got 
a request for a large sum of money from a department head who seems a bit 
burned out. She wants to attend a conference in France. She ­will not be giving 
a paper, but just attending. You know it would be a morale boost to her to allo­
cate the funding to her, but then ­others would get less. Sally might have avoided 
this predicament, if she had developed criteria for funding travel that every­one 
would see before the year begins. You work for Sally and she has asked you to 
develop that criteria for professional development. How would you go about this 
task? Allocate a set amount to each employee? First come first served? Criteria 
such as if someone is attending a conference, the library ­will pay a percentage 
of the average cost of the trip? Or if someone is invited to give a paper, the 
library ­will pay a larger percentage? Set out a listing of what you would do and 
include a justification.
4.	“Money and salary is not a particularly good motivator in the long term.”38 Matt 
Mullenweg, web developer and founder of Wordpress. Do you agree or disagree? 
What motivates you?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Per­for­mance appraisal is sometimes defined as an evaluation given by someone 
who does not want to give it to someone who does not want to get it. The defini­
tion, unfortunately, applies to many organ­izations. What makes ­these so difficult 
for both supervisors and employees? What could be done to improve the pro­cess?
2.	Have you ever worked in a ­unionized environment? What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of ­unions? Discuss this question from both the employee’s 
perspective and that of the employer.

Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the role of mentoring
•	 Identify types of workplace stress and their remedies
•	 Recognize the need for employee safety programs
•	 Be aware of ­legal protections for employees
•	 Have an understanding of issues surrounding ­unionization
The previous two chapters discussed the ­Human Resources (HR) topics of 
staffing and managing staff in the library, the HR functions related to day-­
to-­day activities that are carried out by vari­ous man­ag­ers throughout the 
organ­ization. Meanwhile, other functions that usually lie at the periphery of 
the HR purview can also be crucial for managing ­people who work in the 
library. This chapter ­will cover some of ­those topics, from setting policies and 
procedures to addressing health and safety issues. In addition, two of the 
most impor­tant external forces affecting HR responsibilities—­legal protec­
tions for workers and unionization—­will be discussed.

280  ­Huma n Resource
HR Policies and Procedures
The development and communication of workplace policies and proce­
dures is an integral and essential part of the HR function in ­every library. 
A policy can be defined as a statement that commits management to a defi­
nite plan or course of action. Policies concerning hiring and promotion, for 
example, are used as guidelines for decision making. Therefore, by supplant­
ing ad hoc decisions, clear HR policies lead to greater consistency and conti­
nuity within an organ­ization. As discussed in the previous chapter, all 
employees rely on written policy statements to understand why salaries are 
administered as they are, how and when per­for­mance appraisals ­will take 
place, and what benefits are available to them.
Even in larger libraries that have specialized HR departments, policy 
formulation is ultimately the responsibility of the director. In most librar­
ies, however, the director establishes vari­ous policies ­after getting input from 
­others. Discussing, evaluating, writing, and distributing the policy statement 
can encourage the participation of all groups that ­will be affected by it.
An effective set of HR policies fulfills many functions. First, the for­
mulation pro­cess requires man­ag­ers to think through the needs of employ­
ees in addition to ­those of the organ­ization. Second, well-­formed policies that 
are followed by all supervisors assure consistent treatment for all employees. 
Management on the Job: A Conversation between 
Mentor and Protégé
One of the topics covered in this chapter is mentoring. A good example of how the men­
toring pro­cess works in real life is found in the Oregon Library Association publication, 
OLA Quarterly.1 In interview format, the mentor, Laura Zeigen, and her “mentee” (also 
known as a protégé), Nyssa Walsh, discuss their roles and the pro­cess and outcomes of 
a mentoring relationship. At the beginning of the discussion, Nyssa has completed her 
master’s degree and is looking for a full-­time job in an academic library. Laura volun­
teered for a mentoring program sponsored by the Oregon Library Association; the com­
mitment was for one year. She was matched with Nyssa.
Laura helped Nyssa with her cover letter, résumé, and interviewing techniques. 
­Here is an example of the advice Nyssa gave Laura: “Laura told me to think hard about 
this decision. She reminded me that when ­you’re applying for a job, ­you’re interviewing 
them as much as ­they’re interviewing you. Was this the kind of place I wanted to work 
for years? Was the boss someone I could see myself getting along with? She encouraged 
me to not just take the job ­because it was capital L [full-­time, permanent, professional 
position in an academic library]. But I was afraid I ­wouldn’t get another chance and 
when they offered me the job I took it. Folks, listen to your mentors. ­They’ve been ­doing 
this longer than you, and ­they’ve seen it all.”2 ­After she took the job, her mentor contin­
ued to offer her advice, support, and referrals to other ­people when they could be of help.
­After six months, Nyssa deci­ded to quit this job and took another. She advises ­people 
not to take the first job offered, although tempting, ­because it might not be a good fit. 
She is happy in her new position, although it is in Web development, not in an academic 
library. She has stayed friends with her mentor and knows that if she wants to go back 
to an academic library, her mentor ­will be a big help. Their relationship extended beyond 
the one-­year program and they continue to support each other. Laura concludes that in the 
mentorship pro­cess, she has learned from her protégé as well as how to be a mentor.

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  281
Clearly stated policies minimize both favoritism and discrimination. Third, 
such policies help maintain continuity, even if man­ag­ers or supervisors 
change. ­Because new man­ag­ers have a written standard to follow, policy 
remains stable, so employees need not endure vacillations with a change of 
supervisors.
A HR policy may be broad, such as “The X Library does not discriminate 
against any employee on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, or national 
origin.” Policies also may be narrow, such as “All employees are entitled to four 
weeks of paid vacation each year.” Remember that a policy is a general state­
ment of intent; it does not spell out the exact methods by which it ­will be 
implemented. Procedures identify ­those methods, setting forth the steps needed 
to accomplish a given result. A library ­will have procedures as to how vacation 
times ­will be allotted or how equal opportunity ­will be assured. For instance, 
if the allocation of vacation time reflects workers’ length of ser­vice to the 
organ­ization, this pro­cess would be described in the procedure manual.
In addition to policies and procedures, organ­izations also have rules. A 
rule is defined as a regulation or specific guide regarding be­hav­ior. Rules are 
the minimum standards of conduct for the organ­ization and should apply 
uniformly to every­one in it. Typical rules are ­those concerning the required 
number of work hours per day or the permissible number of absences. Like 
procedures, rules ensure an organ­ization’s predictability, which enables it to 
achieve its goals and function without undue disruption.
Obviously, the policies, procedures, and rules of an organ­ization should 
be put in written form, available for all to see; furthermore, they must be 
communicated to all employees. Rules that exist only in the mind of the direc­
tor fail to serve their purposes, while policy manuals locked in the director’s 
desk are just as in­effec­tive as if they had never been written.
Disseminating policies, procedures, and rules throughout an organ­
ization is an ongoing task. First, special care must be taken to distribute 
­these documents to supervisors so that they can administer them. Special 
training sessions help top management introduce policies or review them 
periodically with supervisors. For nonsupervisory employees, the workplace 
handbook or manual (usually given to new employees during orientation or 
available on the organ­ization’s intranet) lists policies, procedures, and rules. 
When a department or institution changes policies, procedures, or rules, the 
changes should be communicated and explained to employees by their imme­
diate supervisor. This task includes updating printed manuals as well as 
any material maintained online.
­Career Development
­Career development differs from both training and staff development 
(both of which ­were covered in chapter 11). A ­career is what­ever series of posi­
tions an individual ­will occupy during his or her working life. “­Career devel­
opment is the proactive planning and implementation of action steps ­towards 
your ­career goals.”3 It takes the long view, attempting over time to help 
employees shape satisfying ­careers. Ultimately, of course, each individual 
employee is responsible for her or his own ­career development, but the best 
organ­izations devote managerial attention to the topic. Helping employees 
achieve a satisfying ­career reduces turnover, and when directed at the most 
capable performers, such assistance enables an organ­ization to retain valu­
able ­human resources. At the very least, man­ag­ers should recognize the com­
plex ­career issues that employees are likely to face.

282  ­Huma n Resource
A typical ­career is thought to go through certain stages, as illustrated 
in figure 12.1.
Each stage is marked by dif­fer­ent needs and perceptions.
1.	 Precareer is the time when a person begins to think about what 
type of profession or job to pursue as a ­career.
2.	 Early ­career stage is when someone enters the job market and 
launches a ­career. An example might be a newly minted MLIS 
gradu­ate taking a first professional job. The challenges of this stage 
are landing that first position and then becoming established in the 
organ­ization.
3.	 Midcareer begins ­after a few years when the individual has 
become familiar with the field; he or she may have been promoted 
into some sort of managerial position. Plateauing, discussed ­later 
in this chapter, is a common prob­lem at this stage.
4.	 Late ­career stage is when individuals are firmly established in an 
organ­ization; typically they are highly valued for their expertise 
and orga­nizational knowledge. Many such ­people are likely to serve 
as mentors to younger professionals. ­Toward the end of this stage, 
an individual may well be looking ahead to retirement.
5.	 Retirement is the last stage in a ­career. Sometimes workers who 
have retired return to the workplace in a part-­time or temporary 
capacity, though not always at their previous organ­ization.
­These ­career stages are not always as clear-­cut as figure 12.1 might 
imply. ­People move through ­these stages at varying speeds. Furthermore, 
in an era when many ­people switch ­careers, some may not proceed through 
all the steps outlined, whereas ­others might do so several times. Showing 
arrows in both forward and backward directions indicates that ­people may 
change ­careers or retire and then return to work.
In the past, most employees expected they would start their ­careers in 
one organ­ization and stay with it ­until they retired. However, as more and 
more companies have downsized, merged, or turned to temporary or contract 
workers, that expectation has been destroyed. Nowadays, especially in the 
for-­profit sector, employees should not expect to spend their ­whole ­career 
working for a single com­pany. Instead, the new pattern requires individuals 
to engage actively in their own ­career development. The not-­for-­profit sector 
has seen fewer orga­nizational upheavals, but in most ­there are fewer oppor­
tunities for promotion. ­Because the flattened organ­izations discussed in 
chapter 9 now have fewer levels of hierarchy, and many have ­adopted new 
team-­based management, the need for midlevel man­ag­ers has diminished. 
Consequently, the ­career progression pattern that used to exist in many 
libraries—of becoming a department head, then an assistant or associate 
director, and fi­nally a director—­may be less attainable than it once was.

Talk About It
“­Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.”5 What do you think Sheryl Sandberg meant by 
this comment? Have you had a change in ­career, or ­career plans? How do you envision 
your ­career path? When would the jungle gym model best suit? Why would, for exam­
ple, a person take a job that was a step down in status or pay? How could that move the 
person’s ­career in the long run?
Now librarians need to think about “investing” in themselves as profes­
sionals if they wish to be promoted. Catherine Hakala-­Ausperk, ­career con­
sul­tant, encourages each librarian to take time to build their skills, improve 
their per­for­mance, and increase their opportunities even while ­doing their 
job well. She writes, “When you think about your mission, you should be see­
ing the big picture of what you want to do in your working lifetime . . . ​While 
surely your mission can bend a bit, it should unwaveringly move you closer, 
year by year, to the person you want to become and to achieving the profes­
sional contribution you want to make.”4
Without a doubt, the work environment in libraries ­today is dif­fer­ent 
from that of even a de­cade ago; although library man­ag­ers should make ­every 
effort to provide career-­enhancing experiences for their employees, it is also 
the responsibility of the employees to make ­every effort to acquire the skills 
they ­will need to pro­gress in their ­careers.
However, not ­every employee is interested in ­career progression; many 
have no desire to be a library director or even a man­ag­er of any type. Dif­fer­
ent ­people have dif­fer­ent aspirations. Also, some evidence suggests that ­there 
are differences between age cohorts: the wants of Generations X and Y may 
be dif­fer­ent from ­those of the baby-­boomer generation.6 Younger employees 
from the Millennial Generation want flexibility and multiple paths and time­
frames to achieve leadership positions.7
For ­people who do want to pro­gress up the administrative ladder, ­there 
are still obstacles. Few libraries have expanded their staff in recent years, 
so well-­qualified employees may be blocked from advancement simply ­because 
­there are no openings in the positions directly above them. Even worse, many 
of ­these library jobs are held by individuals who are not much older than the 
employee who is seeking advancement, a situation likely to prevail ­until they 
begin retiring. Although many older librarians are postponing retirement 
­because of the economic downturn, they ­will eventually leave the ­labor force, 
and their retirements should open up a large number of administrative posi­
tions in libraries.
Plateauing
When employees wish to pro­gress but are unable to do so, they are said 
to have plateaued. Plateauing usually occurs during midcareer and takes two 
forms.
•	 Structural plateauing occurs when an individual is no longer pro­
moted within the organ­ization.
•	 Content plateauing means that a job has become routine, and no 
challenging tasks are added to it.

284  ­Huma n Resource
What­ever the type, plateauing can make employees feel stuck 
and no longer stimulated by the promise of promotions or of 
new job content. Often plateaued workers are frustrated, 
depressed, and nonproductive. More than half of the U.S. 
workforce consists of midcareer employees between the ages of 
35 and 54. A survey of this group of employees found that they 
work longer hours than their older and younger counter­parts, 
yet “only 43 ­percent are passionate about their jobs, just 
33 ­percent feel energized by their work, 36 ­percent say they 
feel that they are in dead-­end jobs, and more than 40 ­percent 
report feelings of burnout.”8
Some employees accept plateauing as an inevitable part of a ­career; ­others 
do not. Personnel prob­lems such as irritation with fellow employees and 
intolerance of bureaucracy develop more frequently with plateaued employees 
than with ­others. In addition, often when very productive workers feel that 
they are stuck in a no-­promotion situation, they begin to look for jobs in other 
organ­izations that would offer them more opportunities.
Man­ag­ers can use many strategies to help employees overcome the stress 
of plateauing. ­These strategies include job enrichment, lateral transfers, 
cross-­training, and educating employees about plateauing to prepare them 
for periodic ­career stagnation. If feasible, it can also be helpful to restruc­
ture the orga­nizational hierarchy more horizontally so that decision-­making 
power increases in the lower ranks. Mentoring and networking opportunities 
can offer employees ­career support and open possibilities for change. At a 
more basic level, to keep workers’ enthusiasm alive and maintain the effec­
tiveness of plateaued employees, man­ag­ers should attempt to make jobs more 
in­ter­est­ing.
Then again, some employees welcome plateauing, at least at certain times 
in their ­careers. Employees often feel overwhelmed by their jobs, especially 
as technology breaks down the barrier between work and personal lives. 
Although some employees derive their primary self-­image from their jobs, 
­others find fulfillment outside the workplace. ­These employees would prefer 
to focus on their families, volunteer work, hobbies, or other activities. For that 
­matter, employees place more or less emphasis on workplace success at dif­fer­
ent times in their lives. When employees must balance ­family responsibilities 
such as caring for small ­children or an el­derly parent with ­those of the job, 
reduced pressure at work is welcome. ­Later in his or her ­career, however, that 
individual may become more job-­focused and wish to advance in the profes­
sion. Once again, man­ag­ers should remember that ­there is no single correct 
approach, and that to meet the needs of dif­fer­ent employees a man­ag­er needs 
to be flexible. One expert has suggested that the corporate ladder be replaced 
by a corporate lattice, a more adaptive framework, which allows an individ­
ual to move in many dif­fer­ent directions, not just up and down.9
Mentoring
Mentoring is a specialized form of ­career development.10 The term men­
tor is used to describe an influential person who significantly helps another, 
usually younger, person to reach his or her major goals. Although mentor­
ing has always existed in all kinds of organ­izations, only in the last few 
de­cades has its importance been fully recognized. Interest has grown ­because 
of the clear link between ­career success and having a mentor. Studies have 
shown consistently that few individuals advance to an organ­ization’s top 

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  285
administrative ranks without the help of one or more mentors.11 In addition, 
individuals who are mentored usually enjoy greater job satisfaction, more vis­
ibility within an organ­ization, and higher salaries than do ­those who do not 
have a mentor.12
Mentoring usually comprises four functions: teaching, psychological 
counseling and emotional support, orga­nizational intervention, and sponsor­
ing. The context, meaning, and experience of mentoring are slightly dif­fer­
ent for each mentor and protégé, naturally, ­because no two ­people or sets of 
circumstances are exactly alike. The protégé’s need for the mentor varies at 
dif­fer­ent ­career junctures, and the help a mentor provides ­will also vary. New 
employees need a mentor to help them learn more about the organ­ization and 
the details of the job. As a protégé gains technical competence and begins to 
ascend the orga­nizational ladder, the need for emotional support may come 
to the fore. When promotion and advancement appear on the horizon, the 
mentor can provide orga­nizational intercession and sponsor the protégé to 
meet individuals who are higher up in the organ­ization or to identify open­
ings outside the library that would be suitable.
The advantages to the protégé are clear. But ­because mentoring involves 
a considerable investment of time and effort, the mentor’s motives may be 
harder to understand. Note that altruism alone is rarely the reason a men­
tor enters into such a relationship. The benefits are almost always mutual, 
and the mentoring role is almost always professionally rewarding. Mentors 
typically enjoy passing on their knowledge and experience to ­others, and 
often feel rejuvenated by their interactions with their protégés and often gain 
from their perspective. Mentors may also receive recognition from their peers 
and from the organ­ization at large for their efforts in developing promising 
individuals for ­future leadership roles. Sometimes the protégé provides job 
assistance to the mentor, who thereby secures a valuable ally within the 
organ­ization. ­Because developing talent is the responsibility of management, 
the success of a protégé serves to validate the mentor’s worth to the organ­
ization. Having protégés who can help perform the mentor’s job demonstrates 
that the mentor is a man­ag­er who can delegate well; and as a protégé 
advances, the mentor not only shares in the glory but also builds up a strong 
network of past and pres­ent protégés.
Fi­nally, many mentors derive ­great personal plea­sure from the relation­
ship. They enjoy teaching and feel some personal gratification as the proté­
gé’s ­career advances. They are pleased to see their own work continued or 
furthered by the protégé. As one recently wrote, “Mentoring a newly hired 
librarian can be hard, time consuming work, but ­after it is over, one contin­
ues to reap its rewards.”13
Demand for mentors always outstrips supply, so some man­ag­ers in 
organ­izations have instituted programs in which new employees are formally 
matched with a mentor. Such programs sometimes succeed, but mentoring 
relationships that arise spontaneously are more likely to endure, ­because 
both mentor and protégé see each other’s value and welcome a relationship. 
Some employees have off-­site mentors who advise them remotely.
Mentoring relationships, both formal and informal, should be encour­
aged by organ­izations as a means of ­career development and growth; but in 
instituting a formal mentoring program, man­ag­ers must take care to be fair 
and pres­ent mentoring opportunities for all employees who wish to partici­
pate. Mentors often are drawn to mentor ­those who are like themselves, and 
this unconscious bias often makes mentoring opportunities less available to 
­people from underrepresented groups. Also, ­because mentoring entails devel­
oping a personal relationship with the protégé, it could result in claims of 

286  ­Huma n Resource
sexual harassment or discrimination.14 Formal guidelines may be needed to

Employers have a responsibility to ensure the health and safety of their 
employees. ­Today’s employees demand more healthy work environments, and 
most man­ag­ers are trying to provide them. For example, libraries are smoke-­
free so that employees are not exposed to second­hand smoke and many offer 
training and adjustable furniture to help employees avoid repetitive motion 
prob­lems. In case of unexpected emergencies, librarians have security and 
disaster plans and training.
Physical Stress
Overall, libraries are fairly safe places to work. However, one type of 
physical prob­lem occurs commonly in libraries: injury caused by overuse of 
equipment such as computers and scanners. If not careful, employees may 
contract a condition known as repetitive stress injury (RSI), most frequently 
in the form of carpal tunnel syndrome. RSI has long affected factory workers 
who perform the same motions constantly throughout the day. Although ­there 
is much anecdotal evidence of librarians who suffer from RSI,15 ­there are few 
studies that document the extent of the prob­lem.
Man­ag­ers in libraries and information centers have begun to take steps 
to prevent RSI and to provide relief to ­those who exhibit symptoms. Many 
have invested in ergonomic chairs, workstations, and keyboards. Some have 
instituted more frequent breaks, increased the variety of activities within 
workers’ jobs, scheduled exercise sessions, or provided training in hopes of 
preventing or alleviating RSI. Many library man­ag­ers have established ergo­
nomic standards and policies that govern the use of computers.16 ­Because 
computer use ­will continue to be an essential part of the job for most library 
employees, all man­ag­ers and employees need to be mindful of this physical 
stress.
As for other computer-­related ailments, the most common are eyestrain, 
back and neck aches, and body fatigue, which prob­ably result from sitting in 
one position for too long. The good ergonomic practices of proper positioning 
of monitors, use of supportive chairs, good lighting, adequate ventilation, tak­
ing more frequent breaks from the computer, and some basic exercises17 can 
help alleviate many of ­these complaints.
Job-­Related ­Mental Stress
Employees in all types of organ­izations are susceptible to stress, which 
is defined as the body’s response to any demand placed upon it. Although 
some who do not work in libraries may consider libraries stress-­free environ­
ments, they are not. Library workers encounter many sources of stress, just 
as workers in other office settings do.
­Today, more employees in all types of organ­izations report feelings of 
stress or tension ­because of their jobs. Orga­nizational change, if too rapid 
and frequent, can cause stress. Without a doubt, among librarians, one cause 
of stress is the profession’s ever-­increasing rate of change. Now more than 
ever, librarians are being asked to master new methods and technologies for 
­doing their jobs. Technology has speeded up many procedures and cut the 

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  287
time needed for communication but it also has added pressure to get ­things 
done faster as library users always seem to want more. Also, ­because of bud­
get cutbacks and limited resources in many libraries, librarians must often 
assume added responsibilities.
Stress arises from many sources. Role ambiguity arises when positions 
have been poorly defined and employees do not know what is expected of 
them. Some individuals feel the stress of role conflict when dif­fer­ent groups 
of ­people hold incompatible views about how he or she should behave. In cases 
where an employee must constantly deal with unpleasant or abrasive cowork­
ers, ­those interpersonal demands usually cause stress. In addition, as men­
tioned above, downsizing in many libraries has resulted in the day-­to-­day 
work being handled by fewer employees. The shrinking job market has pro­
duced stress not only for ­those ­people who do not have jobs but also for ­those 
still working, who often are assuming more responsibility at the same time 
they are worried about losing their own positions. A recent study of stress­
ors for public librarians18 found that the top 10 ­were:
	 1.	 Lots of interruptions to your work
	 2.	 Difficulties with co-­workers
	 3.	 Many deadlines to meet
	 4.	 Bud­get issues
	 5.	 Excessive workload
	 6.	 Workplace culture
	 7.	 Lack of time to finish work
	 8.	 Difficulties with management
	 9.	 Lack of recognition for your work
	10.	 Building facilities
Studies have shown that a good way to counteract ­these stressors is 
mindfulness. Mindfulness is defined as, “focus on maintaining awareness in 
the pres­ent moment and treating ourselves and ­others with patience and 
kindness.”19
­Here are some suggestions20 for ways to practice mindfulness and reduce 
stress:
•	 Breathe. This is the simplest and easiest ­thing to get back in the 
pres­ent. It seems obvious, but take time to just catch your breath.
•	 Do chores “mindfully.” It may seem silly, but instead of just blast­
ing through ­things that “need to get done,” ­there is value in paying 
closer attention and just accepting that you are ­doing them.
•	 Pay attention to your senses. So often in­ter­est­ing or pleasant sur­
roundings are ignored ­because you are wrapped in other thoughts.
•	 ­Don’t over commit your time. Easier said than done, right? Still, 
many times you may say “yes” to a proj­ect or assignment when you 
are already overwhelmed.
•	 Spend time in nature. This goes along with paying attention to 
your surroundings.

288  ­Huma n Resource
•	 Be thankful. Being thankful is a ­great practice for developing a 
more mindful state of being.
•	 Be aware of your thoughts. With mindfulness it becomes espe­
cially impor­tant to be aware of negative thoughts and not beat your­
self up about the past or obsessively worry about the ­future.
•	 Choose to start your day. Try to set aside a few moments to wake 
up and not rush into your daily routine. This is often easier said than 
done but do believe it can be helpful.
•	 Commit to listening to ­those around you. Steven Covey framed 
this expertly by explaining that persons should first seek to under­
stand and only then to be understood.21
Of course, workplace stress is not the only cause of stress-­related disor­
ders; many employees also face off-­the-­job stress ­factors, such as ­family issues 
or financial prob­lems. Sometimes, a combination of ­these produces stress, as 
when job and home responsibilities conflict. ­These challenges are deemed 
“work-­life balance.”22
Stress is not always bad, and dif­fer­ent employees are able to tolerate 
dif­fer­ent levels of stress. Without some stress in organ­izations, the staff 
would likely display much less energy and productivity. Many ­people work 
more effectively ­under mild stress. When deadlines loom, many ­people 
work faster and better. However, that same deadline may cause other employ­
ees to experience extreme stress. When stress is severe and unending, it 
becomes destructive.
Stress may be manifested as absenteeism, irritability, tardiness, or an 
inability to perform well. One of a man­ag­er’s jobs is to help identify the cause 
of the stress and try to eliminate it, if pos­si­ble. If the effects of the stress are 
more than the man­ag­er can ­handle, the man­ag­er should refer the employee 
to an employee assistance program or a medical professional for diagnosis 
and treatment.
Burnout
Burnout results from emotional strain and the stress of interpersonal 
contact, especially in cases where the job entails helping ­people with prob­
lems. Individuals who suffer from burnout typically experience physical and 
emotional exhaustion, a negative shift in their demeanor and attitude, and 
a loss of self-­esteem. Man­ag­ers’ responsibilities ­toward burnt-­out workers 
include knowing the symptoms of burnout and making workers familiar with 
them. Meanwhile, remedies for burnout can be found at two levels. At the 
personal level, employees should pursue an active life outside of work, and 
structure that life in ways that make them feel comfortable and in control. 
Also, when staffing patterns permit, man­ag­ers may retool jobs or revise sched­
ules so that librarians spend less time in areas that cause the employee 
stress. Employees may also find workshops in stress management or time 
management useful.
Man­ag­ers should pay special heed to recent findings that demonstrate 
the importance of the orga­nizational context on burnout. When employees 
feel that the organ­ization neither values nor re­spects them, they often expe­
rience burnout. Individual man­ag­ers who belittle or patronize employees and 
show no re­spect for their work can be a cause of burnout and rapid staff 
turnover.23

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  289
Practice Your Skills
You are a supervisor at a circulation desk at a busy public library. One of your employees 
has a bad attitude and seems negative about every­one she encounters. She never offers 
to help other ­people and is starting to be surly with library patrons. You know that she 
lives alone, has no hobbies or anything outside work. You need to find a way to remedy 
this situation; other­wise you feel her negativity ­will start affecting the other staff. Know­
ing what you have learned about burnout, do you think this could be her prob­lem? What 
can you do? Should you confront her? Take her aside and find out what is bothering her? 
Ask ­others who know her to give you their advice? Develop a strategy for a conversation, 
or series of conversations with this employee that ­will lead to a resolution. Make a bul­
let point list of items you would cover in that conversation.
Preventing burnout is impor­tant ­because it is often contagious. Burnt-­
out employees who take a negative attitude ­toward their jobs, customers, or 
colleagues are sure to have a negative effect on ­others. To keep burnout from 
spreading, man­ag­ers need to recognize the symptoms and intercede to pre­
vent it whenever pos­si­ble.
Vio­lence and Crime in the Workplace
Although vio­lence in libraries is rare, it is not unknown. ­There have been 
several recent cases of librarians being murdered on the job, assault and 
robbery of staff and patrons, and shooting incidents on college campuses.24 
Librarians have tried hard to make libraries accessible places, but this acces­
sibility has sometimes made ­people in libraries vulnerable. Most ­people per­
ceive libraries as safe places, so users are sometimes less vigilant than they 
should be. Library buildings, with their often empty stack areas and isolated 
work spaces, provide secluded spots for individuals attempting to prey on 
­people or their property. Some also assume that violators ­will be prosecuted 
in libraries less readily than elsewhere.
As library man­ag­ers become more aware of the possibility of workplace 
vio­lence, they are now attempting to lessen it. Numerous librarians have 
installed surveillance cameras to increase patron and employee safety and 
to deter vandalism. Many have instituted policies to lockdown the library in 
case of a crisis.25
Most libraries have preparedness programs for natu­ral disasters such 
as floods or hurricanes, and more and more have instituted such programs 
for incidents of vio­lence. All libraries should have emergency manuals, and 
all staff, including student staff should be trained in emergency mea­sures. 
Man­ag­ers should also have clear security policies to protect librarians and 
patrons. All man­ag­ers hope that they never need to use such a policy, but 
they always should be prepared just in case. See more information about 
writing an emergency plan in Chapter 5.
Overall, library directors are focusing more on the health and safety of 
their employees. Many encourage employees to participate in exercise, weight 
loss, or other wellness programs. At many organ­izations, employee assistance 
programs offer guidance to workers facing such personal prob­lems as alco­
holism or drug use. Library man­ag­ers are becoming more ­adept at helping 
ward off both physical and ­mental stress. Man­ag­ers consider it cost-­effective 

290  ­Huma n Resource
to invest in the health of employees, ­because healthier employees are more 
productive than ­those who are suffering from unaddressed physical or ­mental 
conditions. Making the library a safe and healthy workplace is a win-­win for 
employees and employers.
External Impacts on HR—­Legal Protections
All the subjects discussed so far relate to specific internal HR functions 
that are found in libraries of all types. Certain librarians, however, must also 
contend with two broader external forces that affect their HR work. ­These 
issues are (1) ­legal protections for employees and (2) ­unionization.
Federal and state regulations relating to HR have multiplied over the 
past de­cades, so that ­today, virtually ­every HR function from hiring to fir­
ing is affected by them. ­These regulations have provided workers with 
increased ­legal protections, especially in equal employment opportunity; the 
law protects workers from being fired for such reasons as age, gender, national 
origin, or disability. Nonetheless, in some areas employees still have very few 
rights. ­Unless an employee is covered by a collective-­bargaining contract or 
civil or state ser­vice rules, he or she is at risk for dismissal ­because of many 
states’ employment-­at-­will princi­ple,26 which permits ­either party in an 
employment contract to cancel it at ­will. Such workers have few ­legal reme­
dies to combat being fired or discharged. In fact, U.S. employee law gives 
­great power to employers in all areas, and ­unless employees have a ­union or 
other contract, they work at the ­will of their employers.
Another area in which workers have limited protection is speech. Although 
the right to ­free speech is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, man­ag­ers in the private sector can legally discipline workers 
who say something damaging about the corporation or its practices. With the 
increasing use of social media, man­ag­ers worry about the ever-­expanding 
opportunities for employees to express themselves publicly outside the work­
place. Employers fear that ­free expression by staff might allow them to reflect 
badly on the corporate image.27
The right to privacy is another area in which employees, especially ­those 
in the private sector, do not have clear protections. With the ascent of social 
media, privacy issues are a growing concern for workers. Employers may 
legally read their staff’s e-­mail, listen in on telephone conversations, install 
small video cameras anywhere, and search employees’ lockers and desks 
­unless the organ­ization has a policy prohibiting such ­things. The use of elec­
tronic surveillance is growing as more organ­izations monitor computer 
users by recording keystrokes and ­mistakes. This monitoring can be benefi­
cial, of course, if it prevents or discloses misconduct or if supervisors use it 
in training sessions to give constructive feedback to workers. But studies 
have also shown that employees who know they are being monitored are more 
likely to feel dissatisfaction, fatigue, and hostility.
Another challenging ­legal issue in the workplace is that of random drug 
testing. Although many employees feel that drug testing violates their pri­
vacy, in most states, employers of all types have the right to screen employ­
ees for drug and alcohol use. Most libraries do not test for drugs.
The rights of employees are better protected now than they ­were in the 
past, but ­there are still areas in which few protections exist. Although the 
employment-­at-­will rule allows employers to discharge workers for any cause 
(or none at all), most libraries are part of larger organ­izations that require 

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  291
progressive discipline if a man­ag­er wanted to fire an employee. The exception 
to this is an employee who is in a probationary period or one who commits 
theft or other serious be­hav­ior. Supervisors should strive, as much as pos­si­
ble, to show re­spect for employees’ privacy and dignity, even when they are 
not legally obligated to do so.
Equal Employment Opportunities
Many of the ­legal protections enjoyed by workers are intended to guar­
antee equal employment opportunity (EEO). EEO refers to the right of all 
­people to be hired and to advance in a job on the basis of merit or ability. In 
the United States, employment discrimination against any class of ­people is 
now prohibited by law.
Before the passage of EEO laws, employers could hire, promote, or fire 
whomever they wished. However, vari­ous civil rights rulings changed the 
entire field of HR management, so much so that ­people often forget how con­
ditions used to be. For example, see the job advertisements listed in ­table 12.1. 
­These advertisements ­were printed in Library Journal in 1959, before the 
advent of civil rights protections for job applicants. Employers ­were ­free to 
give preference to a specific gender or age in their advertisements and in their 
hiring.
­Today, ­women, racial minorities, older workers, and ­people with disabil­
ities have substantial employment rights ­under the law. The equal employ­
ment opportunity (EEO) laws have exerted a profound influence on the U.S. 
­labor scene. ­These equal employment opportunity laws affect many HR func­
tions, including hiring, interviewing, testing, training, promoting, apprais­
ing, disciplining, and compensating employees.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Other Impor­tant 
Federal Legislation
Although federal laws prohibiting discrimination against certain groups 
of employees go back more than a ­century to the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 
and 1871, the most power­ful impetus to EEO came with the passage of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of that act prohibits discrimination based 
on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual 
orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or ge­ne­tic informa­
tion in all employment practices, including hiring, firing, promotion, compen­
sation, and other conditions or privileges of employment. It is also illegal to 
discriminate against a person ­because the person complained about discrim­
ination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment 
discrimination investigation or lawsuit. The primary aim of this legislation 
was to make overt discrimination in all phases of employment actionable. 
Interpreted in the courts many times since its passage, the law holds that 
an employer’s policies and practices are discriminatory if they adversely 
affect any one of the groups protected by Title VII, even if the employer did 
not intend to discriminate. Exceptions may be made if the employer can dem­
onstrate that the discriminatory policies and practices are justified by “busi­
ness necessity.” Business necessity has been narrowly interpreted to mean 
that the employer must show overriding evidence that a discriminatory prac­
tice is essential to the safe and efficient operation of the firm. Once a plain­
tiff brings a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating adverse 
impact upon any protected group, the burden of proof falls on the organ­
ization to justify its employment policy or practice.
Title VII as amended by the Equal Opportunity Employment Act of 1972 
covers all private employers of 15 or more ­people, all private and public edu­
cational institutions, state and local governments, employment agencies, 
­labor ­unions, and apprenticeship and training programs. Thus, Title VII per­
tains to most libraries in the United States. Responsible for enforcing it is 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a five-­member 
in­de­pen­dent agency that is appointed for a five-­year term by the president of 
the United States with the advice and consent of Congress. The EEOC inves­
tigates discrimination complaints and develops ­legal guidelines pertaining 
to Title VII.28
Affirmative Action and Comparable Worth
Equal employment opportunity laws have made workplaces much more 
diverse than they ­were before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Nevertheless, ­there are still many unsettled areas in EEO. Two of ­these are 
affirmative action and comparable worth.
Affirmative action refers to a set of specific procedures designed to ensure 
that institutions employ an equitable share of ­women and minorities. Affir­
mative action was created in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson’s Executive 
Order 11246, which required government contractors to adopt a written plan 
to remedy the effects of past discrimination. Any organ­ization that holds a 
government contract of a certain size must have such a plan, and many other 
institutions have voluntarily produced such plans.
Despite what some ­people may believe, affirmative action does not require 
fixed quotas, preferential hiring, or the employment of unqualified ­people. 
Affirmative action does, however, require an organ­ization to determine ­whether 
­there are disproportionately few minorities and ­women working in par­tic­u­lar

­TABLE 12.2. Major U.S. Federal Legislation Relating to 
Equal Opportunity in the Workplace
Federal Law
Date
Provisions of Legislation
Equal Pay Act
1963
Requires all employers to provide equal pay to men and ­women who 
perform work that is similar in skill, effort, and responsibility, and 
that is performed ­under similar working conditions. The only permis­
sible wage disparity is disparity arising from a se­niority system, a 
merit system, a system that mea­sures earning by quantity or quality 
of production, or a differential based on any ­factor other than sex.
Civil Rights Act
1964
Title VII of this act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin in all employment practices, includ­
ing hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and other conditions or 
privileges of employment.
Age Discrimina­
tion Act
1967
Prohibits age discrimination against persons who have reached the 
age of 40 in hiring, discharge, retirement, pay, and conditions and 
hiring, discharge, retirement, pay, and conditions and privileges of 
employment decisions. The act also restricts mandatory retirement.
Occupational 
Health and Safety 
Act (OSHA)
1970
Establishes mandatory health and safety mea­sures in organ­izations.
Vocational 
Rehabilitation Act
1973
Prohibits discrimination based on physical or ­mental disability. Its 
provisions ­were strengthened in the ADA described below.
Consolidated 
Omnibus Bud­get 
Reconciliation Act 
(COBRA)
1985
Requires employers to offer health insurance coverage on a tempo­
rary basis to employees who have been terminated or laid off. The 
insurance is to be paid for by the employee and ordinarily is available 
for up to 18 months ­after the change in employment status.
Americans with 
Disabilities Act 
(ADA)
1990
Bars discrimination against individuals who have disabilities. A 
person is considered disabled if he or she has a physical or ­mental 
impairment that substantially limits one or more of life’s major 
activities; has a rec­ord of such an impairment; or is regarded as 
having such an impairment. An employer must not deny a job to a 
disabled person if the person is qualified and able to perform the 
essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommoda­
tion. If a disabled person is other­wise qualified but unable to perform 
an essential function without accommodation, the employer must 
make the accommodation, ­unless that would cause undue hardship.
Civil Rights Act
1991
Creates rights to compensatory and punitive damages, including 
the right to jury trial, for individuals who are the victims of inten­
tional discrimination as defined by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 and the ADA. ­There are limits for both the compensatory 
and punitive damages, except in cases of racial discrimination; 
­these caps are based not on the magnitude of the discrimination but 
on the size of the employer’s workforce.
­Family and 
Medical Leave Act 
(FMLA)
1993
Requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks unpaid, 
job-­protected leave to employees for ­family developments including 
childbirth, adoption, their own serious health prob­lems, or the 
health prob­lems of a close ­family member.

jobs. It also requires organ­izations to establish goals and timetables by which 
they ­will remedy any underutilization.
Affirmative action legislation has had a major impact in the past. Research 
has shown that affirmative action has “been effective in improving the employ­
ment status of ­women and minorities, and without such programs, pro­gress 
would have occurred at much slower rates, if at all.”29 Nonetheless, commit­
ment to affirmative action seems to be weakening at federal and state levels, 
and the policy’s ­future is unclear. Opponents of affirmative action have two 
primary objections to it. They argue ­either that it has worked so well that it 
is no longer needed, or that it is a means of reverse discrimination against 
­people not in the preferred classes, ostensibly favoring ­women and minorities 
at the expense of more qualified white males.30 Recent court decisions have 
narrowed the scope of affirmative action while still affirming its value. ­Because 
the workforce is more diverse and changing demographics show former minor­
ities becoming the majority in certain parts of the United States, affirmative 
action programs are likely to come ­under additional scrutiny.
Comparable Worth
The Equal Pay Act, passed in 1963, made it illegal to pay one gender less 
than the other for ­doing substantially the same work on jobs ­under similar 
working conditions requiring equivalent skills, effort, and responsibilities. 
For many reasons this act has not resulted in equal pay for ­women or minor­
ities.31 Comparable worth, an issue that is closely related to equal pay, began 
to be discussed in the 1980s. At the heart of this issue is the fact that many 
occupations in our society are segregated by gender; men are heavi­ly con­
centrated in certain occupations, and ­women in ­others. At the same time, 
­women who work are, on average, paid less than men who work. In 2016, the 
median earnings of ­women who worked full time ­were 83 ­percent of the earn­
ings of men who worked full time, but ­women in the category, “Education, 
Training and Library” ­were only paid 78.6 ­percent of the earnings of men in 
­those fields.32
Advocates say the concept of equal pay for equal work should be broad­
ened to include equal pay for comparable work. For example, a job in a pro­
fession dominated by ­women, such as librarianship, which requires a certain 
level of education and experience, should pay the same salary as a job in a 
profession dominated by men, such as engineering, if that job requires com­
parable (but not identical) education and work experience. Comparable worth 
is based not on jobs being the same, but on their being comparable, based on 
an evaluation of the intrinsic worth or difficulty of that job within that organ­
ization or community.
Instituting a national policy of comparable worth has two major obsta­
cles: the difficulty of establishing a means by which to mea­sure the worth of 
jobs, and the sizable increase in ­labor costs to employers. As a result, com­
parable worth remains elusive; perspectives on the topic differ widely, even 
among librarians. Recent judicial decisions indicate that courts ­will neither 
require employers to implement comparable worth policies nor find them 
liable of discrimination for setting salaries that are in line with market val­
ues. At the same time, nothing prohibits an employer from adopting compa­
rable worth standards. Employees in many fields, especially ­those employed 
by state or local governments, ­will continue to push for comparable worth com­
pensation. Professional organ­izations have been ­doing so as well. The Ameri­
can Library Association’s Allied Professional Association (ALA–­APA) considers 
comparable worth one of its primary areas of concern.33

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  295
Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment is a relatively new area of federal regulation and, 
according to the EEOC, it is now the fastest-­growing employee complaint. 
In 2016, the EEOC received 12,860 charges of sexual harassment; 16.6 ­percent 
­were filed by men. In that same year, the EEOC resolved 7,433 charges and 
recovered $40 million for the plaintiffs and other aggrieved individuals.34
Sexual harassment is considered a violation of Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. Sexual harassment can occur in a variety of circum­
stances, including but not limited to the following:
•	 The victim as well as the harasser may be a ­woman or a man; the 
victim does not have to be of the opposite sex.
•	 The harasser can be the victim’s supervisor, an agent of the employer, 
a supervisor in another area, a coworker, or a nonemployee.
•	 The victim does not have to be the person harassed but could be any­
one affected by the offensive conduct.
•	 Sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to or dis­
charge of the victim.
•	 The harasser’s conduct must be unwelcome.35
Sexual harassment has two types, quid pro quo and hostile work envi­
ronment. The quid pro quo type occurs when a person in authority demands 
sexual ­favors in exchange for some type of job-­related benefit, such as a pay 
raise or promotion. The other type of sexual harassment is the hostile work 
environment, in which employees are forced to work among be­hav­iors such 
as sexual jokes or teasing that they find offensive.
Sexual harassment is a violation of federal law, and, in most cases, employ­
ers are considered liable for the actions of supervisors. In addition, if employees 
are harassed by third parties such as customers and/or clients, the employer 
can be held liable. If, for example, a public ser­vices librarian was continually 
harassed by a par­tic­u­lar patron, and the employer knew of the harassment 
but took no corrective mea­sures, the employer could be held liable.36 Man­ag­
ers should take steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occur­
ring. They need to clearly communicate to employees that sexual harassment 
­will not be tolerated. In addition, they should provide harassment training 
to their employees, should establish a clear complaint or grievance pro­cess, 
and should take immediate action when an employee complains.
EEO issues are in flux, thanks to changing interpretations of the EEO 
laws, new regulatory agency rulings, and court decisions. Library man­ag­ers 
who deal with HR functions should remain abreast of ­these regulation changes 
and ensure their organ­izations abide by them. Despite the HR constraints that 
federal and state EEO laws have placed on employers, the laws have made 
U.S. workplaces more diversified and equitable. The aim of all EEO regula­
tion is to ensure that ­every person has an equal shot at any job for which he 
or she is qualified.
Unionization
Beginning in the 1970s, vari­ous white-­collar and professional groups 
accelerated their move ­toward ­unionization. A substantial number of public 
schoolteachers are ­unionized, as are a large number of nurses and college 

296  ­Huma n Resource
professors. Although ­there are no exact figures available for librarians, the 
most recent estimate is that approximately 34 ­percent work in ­unionized 
establishments.37 The Progressive Librarians Guild38 started a blog dedi­
cated to ­union workers in libraries in 2002.39
To some degree, U.S. workers have sought fair and equitable treatment 
and a voice in major workplace decisions since the colonial era. Nonetheless, 
the ­actual foundation of the U.S. ­labor movement was laid in 1935, with the 
passage of the National ­Labor Relations Act, popularly known as the Wag­
ner Act. This legislation, which gave employees the right to or­ga­nize ­unions 
and to bargain collectively with employers, sought to encourage ­unions and 
to restrain management from interfering with their growth. The Wagner Act 
also established the National ­Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to investigate 
violations and unfair ­labor practices, and to codify the rules, regulations, and 
procedures pertinent to the act.
Consequently, ­unions grew rapidly, continuing ­until the mid-1950s. How­
ever, the percentage of the total U.S. ­labor force that is ­unionized has declined 
since then, primarily ­because of the decrease in manufacturing jobs, but also 
­because of the efforts of many states to reduce ­unions for state employees.
To compensate for their dwindling number of blue-­collar members, many 
­unions initiated extensive organ­izing campaigns in the white-­collar sector, 
aimed particularly at public-­sector employees such as government workers 
and schoolteachers. Ever since the mid-1950s, white-­collar workers have out­
numbered blue-­collar workers, and the gap continues to widen as automa­
tion and foreign competition reduce the demand for factory workers.
According to the Bureau of ­Labor Statistics, the ­union membership 
rate—­the ­percent of wage and salary workers who ­were members of ­unions 
was 10.7 ­percent in 2016, down 0.4 percentage point from 2015. The number 
of wage and salary workers belonging to ­unions, at 14.6 million in 2016, 
declined by 240,000 from 2015. In 1983, the first year for which comparable 
­union data are available, the ­union membership rate was 20.1 ­percent, and 
­there ­were 17.7 million ­union workers.40 The report also offered ­these in­ter­
est­ing data:
•	 Workers in the public sector had a ­union membership rate (34.4 
­percent) more than five times higher than that of private-­sector work­
ers (6.4 ­percent).
•	 Workers in the category education, training, and library had the 
highest ­unionization rates (34.6 ­percent).41
The percentage of workers in ­labor ­unions varies from state to state 
as well. In 2010, New York had the highest rate of ­union membership at 
23.6 ­percent, whereas North Carolina had the lowest at 1.6 ­percent.42
Some white-­collar workers, particularly professionals, have felt ambiv­
alent about joining ­unions. Many prefer membership in a professional 
organ­ization as a way to advance the field and their own interests. Some 
professionals believe themselves to be more closely allied with management 
than with ­labor, or that professionals, with their higher status, do not need 
­unions. Nonetheless, ­unionization has become very common in the public 
sector, and librarians have ­little choice about ­unionizing when the library 
where they are employed is part of a larger bargaining unit, such as munici­
pal or university employees.
Employees feel particularly interested in ­unionizing when they are dissat­
isfied with their working conditions and perceive that they cannot individually 

Other Issues in ­Human Resource Management  297
change ­these conditions. They hope that collective bargaining by their ­union 
­will improve their salaries and benefits or working conditions. As many librar­
ians join or consider joining ­unions, HR and other man­ag­ers need to under­
stand the ­unionization pro­cess even if their own library is not currently 
­unionized.
To date, ­unionization in libraries has brought mixed results. On the plus 
side, ­unions have contributed to the formalization of HR policies and proce­
dures, improved communications, increased salaries and fringe benefits, and 
improved working conditions. Unions also serve to promote social justice 
issues.43 On the negative side, ­unions have caused substantially more paper­
work, contributed to the establishment of more rigid work rules, and often 
created an adversarial relationship between librarians and library man­ag­
ers. According to a study of ­unionization in academic libraries, although 
­unionized librarians in public institutions of higher education are generally 
better paid, they have worse working conditions, with higher student-­to-­
librarian ratios and fewer resources for collections.44
Unionization is a complex issue. However, ­because of its importance and 
pos­si­ble impact on the library profession, more research is needed to docu­
ment current conditions and implement ­future planning. In libraries, as else­
where, management and employees need to work together harmoniously. They 
must overcome the adversarial relationship that often results from union­
ization so that their organ­izations can function more effectively—­for the good 
of the library and its users.
Conclusion
The ­human resources function is impor­tant in libraries and information 
organ­izations. Laws governing employment issues evolve, and HR manage­
ment becomes even more vital. As this section has shown, HR tasks must be 
a priority for man­ag­ers who want their organ­ization to function efficiently 
and fulfill its mission.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Sidney Nevel is a new director of a small public library. The library is a private 
corporation run by seven trustees who have complete control over the library: 
they hire the director, set the bud­get, set policy, ­etc. One of the trustees, Sam 
Bark, often comes to Sidney’s desk or into her office to share a joke. ­These jokes 
are slightly off-­color and Sidney finds them offensive. Sam has her trapped. She 
tries to laugh along, just to get the guy out of her office. Sam is also a big supporter 
of the library both po­liti­cally and financially. He has donated funds to support 
programs for ­children that the regular bud­get could not support. Sidney feels 
in a bind, she ­doesn’t know what to do. Should she do something? Think about 
this situation and what you have read in this chapter and write up recommen­
dations for Sidney.
2.	You are a reference librarian in a medium-­sized library in a suburban commu­
nity. Your director has just asked you to participate in a committee that ­will 
develop a workplace safety manual for the entire library. Before the first meet­
ing, jot down some impor­tant points that you think should be in this manual.

Discussion Questions
1.	 If finding a mentor is impor­tant for ­career development, have you already found 
a mentor? A Library Science professor suggests that mentoring for librarians 
should begin in LIS schools. He writes, “Having a strong mentor during your 
first few years as a librarian can provide a safety net of advice, encouragement, 
and caution for a newly minted professional. Such a relationship would be even 
better if it began during LIS education.45 What do you think? If you are a stu­
dent in an LIS program, can you think of someone who might serve as your 
mentor? Do you already have a mentor? If you are a practicing librarian, would 
you be able to mentor an LIS student?
2.	Is librarianship a stressful profession? Have you experienced burnout in your 
­career? What techniques could you suggest to help someone before they get to 
the burnout stage?
3.	Do you think that librarians should be ­unionized? Have you had any experi­
ence with working in a ­union environment? Share your experiences and opin­
ions with ­others.
4.	Mary works as the head of the cata­loging department in an academic library in 
a good four-­year college. She has a master’s degree in LIS and supervises 10 
employees. Murray is the unit head of a section of the college’s facilities depart­
ment. He also has a master’s degree and supervises 10 employees. Mary’s sal­
ary is $60,000 and Murray’s salary is $80,000. ­People have wide views on the 
concept of comparable worth. Do you think that comparable worth is a goal that 
librarians should prioritize? Why or why not?
3.	Your friend’s boss is starting to drive her nuts. She is stressed with more and 
more work, she has big responsibilities at home, and she is trying to finish a 
master’s degree. Make a list of ­things you might suggest to help her alleviate 
her stress level.
4.	Your public library is currently conducting a search for a new ­children’s librar­
ian. You have been invited to attend lunch with the candidates during their 
interview day. During the first lunch, you hear a colleague ask the candidate if 
she is married. You know that this is not something that a perspective employer 
should ask at an employment interview, but you ­don’t say anything at the time. 
Instead, you decide to write a letter to your colleague reminding him that this 
is not a ­legal question. Draft that letter. Should you do anything ­else?

Section 5
Leading
One common definition of management is “getting ­things done through 
­people.” However, this is not easily accomplished; it takes skill to get ­people 
to perform well together to meet the goals and objectives of the organ­ization. 
To achieve this objective, man­ag­ers rely on the function of leading (sometimes 
also referred to as directing). Although both the leading and ­human resources 
functions involve interaction with an organ­ization’s employees, they are quite 
dif­fer­ent in that they focus on two distinct aspects of working with ­people. 
The ­human resources (HR) function, which was covered in the last section, 
involves tasks such as hiring, evaluating, and compensating workers. Lead­
ing, then, builds on the HR function by coordinating, guiding, directing, and 
motivating ­these workers, individually and in groups.
Leading is complex, and ­doing it well requires man­ag­ers to understand 
the ­human ele­ment in the organ­ization. Thus, this function draws heavi­ly 
from the behavioral sciences such as psy­chol­ogy and sociology, which pro­
vide insights into individuals and their workplace be­hav­iors. To be effective, 
man­ag­ers must know what rewards motivate ­people most effectively and 
what leadership approaches work best in a given situation. They also must 
understand the importance of communication styles. Since each worker is 
dif­fer­ent, leading can be complicated and time-­consuming, ­because to be 
most effective it often has to be customized to meet individual employees’ 
needs. Indeed, if a man­ag­er is not careful, the interpersonal aspects of lead­
ing can consume inordinate amounts of energy and time.
Section 5 pres­ents an overview of the managerial function of leading. 
First, some of the major research findings that relate to ­human be­hav­ior in 
the work environment ­will be examined, and then the three most impor­tant 
aspects of leading—­motivation, leadership, and communication—­will be dis­
cussed. This section also contains information about the ethics of leader­
ship, how leadership functions in a team-­based environment, and contingency 
management. The contingency management approach integrates the many 
theories of leading, helping man­ag­ers match their styles to the needs of par­
tic­u­lar groups of employees in specific work settings.
The first chapter in the section deals with the topic of motivation. It begins 
with a brief overview of ­human be­hav­ior in the workplace before moving on 

304  Leading
to the topic of motivation, which is one of the primary responsibilities in 
leading. The chapter ­will provide information about the many theories of 
motivation that man­ag­ers have used in both the past and more recently 
and examine how man­ag­ers choose the most appropriate ways to motivate 
employees.

Motivation in the Workplace
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the importance of the ­human ele­ment in organ­izations
•	 Know why motivating employees is both difficult and impor­tant
•	 Know the difference between content and pro­cess motivation theories and be able 
to discuss several examples of each type
•	 Be familiar with ways to match motivational approaches to employees’ needs
•	 Be able to discuss why the motivation methods of the past may no longer be ade­
quate for ­today’s workers
The managerial function of leading focuses on the ­human ele­ment of the 
organ­ization. In organ­izations, the ­human ele­ment is defined as the total con­
tributions that employees make to the pro­cesses or activities of the organ­
ization. Although technology is becoming increasingly impor­tant in almost 
all organ­izations, still man­ag­ers should never overlook the vital role played 
by an organ­ization’s employees. In fact, ­every part of an organ­ization is depen­
dent on the ­people who work ­there, and any successful man­ag­er needs to 
understand this ­human ele­ment. Many aspects of this ­human ele­ment may 
not be apparent at first glance, but they play an impor­tant role in making 
organ­izations successful. It would be a ­mistake for any man­ag­er to downplay 
or ignore them.
All employees are ­human, and they do not leave their ­human characteris­
tics ­behind when they enter the workplace. Employees’ attitudes, personalities, 

306  Leading
and perceptions undoubtedly affect their per­for­mance on the job. As Zaleznik 
has written, employees brings to the workplace “all the frailties and imper­
fections associated with the ­human condition,” and the “complexity in ­human 
nature leads man­ag­ers to spend their time smoothing over conflict, greasing 
the wheels of ­human interactions, and unconsciously avoiding aggression.”1 
Zaleznik urged man­ag­ers to maintain a balance between two, sometimes 
conflicting, orga­nizational functions that he terms the interpersonal and the 
real work, such as marketing and production. Man­ag­ers do a disser­vice to 
their organ­ization if they spend a disproportionate amount of time on the 
interpersonal aspects of management; yet at the same time, they must not 
neglect ­these aspects, ­because the ­human ele­ment is essential to an organ­
ization’s real work.
The ­Human Ele­ment in the Organ­ization
The managerial function of leading draws heavi­ly from the field of study 
known as orga­nizational be­hav­ior. As the name implies, orga­nizational 
be­hav­ior is the study of how ­people, ­whether individually or within groups, 
behave in orga­nizational settings. The behavioral and social sciences (such 
as psy­chol­ogy, sociology, anthropology, and po­liti­cal science) provide many 
theories of ­human be­hav­ior that offer useful insights for man­ag­ers in the 
workplace. However, given the enormous volume of research and conclusions 
that often seem contradictory, a man­ag­er seeking information on the best way 
to lead may well feel confused and frustrated. Of course, the research was 
never intended to provide one ­simple prescription for all man­ag­ers. Indeed, 
the current consensus is that ­there is no one best way to lead and no univer­
sal theory that is appropriate in all cases.
This scientific research provides both a framework that man­ag­ers can 
use to assess their dealings with ­people within the organ­ization, and a mech­
anism to suggest pos­si­ble improvements. The more man­ag­ers know about 
the research relating to motivation, leadership, and communication, the more 
they can incorporate ele­ments that ­will be useful to them.
Management on the Job: Play Time at the College 
of Western Idaho
Would you like to work in a library where you are able to play games as part of your job? 
At the College of Western Idaho, a recently established community college, at 3:00 p.m. 
almost ­every day, the library staff gathers in a common area to play games.2 ­These game 
breaks are not mandatory, but most employees play most days. The types of games they 
play vary—­board games, card games, and occasionally video games—­any type of game 
is permitted as long as it is collaborative and collegial. Does this all this game playing 
sound like too much fun and too much time wasting on the job? Kim Leeder, the library 
director at Western Idaho, would disagree. She thinks that ­people work better and are 
more motivated when their work is fun. “Fun makes ­people happy, and happy ­people are 
more productive,” she says. According to Leeder, one of the biggest challenges man­ag­ers

Sometimes ­people think that “leading” is done only by upper-­level man­
ag­ers, but actually, the function is impor­tant at many dif­fer­ent levels. As dis­
cussed in chapter 1, typical organ­izations (such as libraries) generally have 
three levels of management:
1.	 Top management is responsible for the overall functioning of the 
entire organ­ization. In libraries, top management usually consists 
of the director as well as the assistant and associate directors.
2.	 ­Middle management oversees specific subunits or functions 
within the organ­ization. In libraries and information centers, 
department heads play the role of ­middle man­ag­ers.
3.	 First-­line man­ag­ers are ­those at the lowest level of the man­
agement hierarchy. ­These man­ag­ers direct work units and individ­
ual employees and, thus, are most likely to have direct day-­to-­day 
contact with employees. As a result, they are responsible for a large 
part of the function of leading within an organ­ization.
Although as discussed in section 3, this traditional tripartite manage­
ment structure is being modified by many organ­izations, and management 
layers may be less distinct in team-­based structures, even the flattest organ­
izations have man­ag­ers who need to practice the components of leading 
each day. Moreover, man­ag­ers at all levels should know the techniques of 
good leading, so that they can create a climate in which ­people work together 
smoothly to fulfill the organ­ization’s goals.
Leading is difficult ­because its focus is on ­human be­hav­ior that arises 
from ­people’s deep-­seated needs and values, and ­human be­hav­ior is always 
unpredictable. ­Because ­humans vary in so many dif­fer­ent dimensions, ­there 
is no one proven formula for dealing effectively with them. ­Humans are much 
more complex than machines. Dif­fer­ent ­people have dif­fer­ent needs, dif­fer­
ent aspirations, and dif­fer­ent personalities. When placed in the same situa­
tion, dif­fer­ent ­people ­will react in dif­fer­ent ways. Man­ag­ers have to learn to 
interact with employees on an individual basis. Adopting one across-­the-­
board, standard approach to interacting with all staff is never successful.
Fi­nally, the function is also complicated ­because most organ­izations 
and man­ag­ers subscribe to the concept of ­human dignity, a belief rooted in 
philosophy and ethics, which requires that employees need to be treated dif­
ferently from other ele­ments of the organ­ization. Employees should not be 
used only as economic tools but need to be treated with re­spect, regardless 
of the level or type of positions they hold.5 In a work setting, ­human dignity 
demands that employees are listened to and taken seriously what­ever their 
position.6
fluid, consensus-­based shared leadership model. Our ability to make decisions together 
is based on our ability to agree and disagree constructively, and that, I argue, comes 
from playing and having fun together.”4
Would you like to work in an organ­ization where you played games as part of your 
job? Do you agree with Leeder that employees are happier and more productive when they 
have fun with one another? Are you familiar with any other examples of organ­izations 
that have fun work environments? If you ­were a man­ag­er and wanted to establish a “play 
culture” in your organ­ization, what steps would you take to make such a change?

308  Leading
To a large extent, the ­human dimension of any organ­ization is ­shaped 
by managerial actions. Man­ag­ers have a tremendous impact on the growth 
and development of individual employees. Just as in Pygmalion, Henry Hig­
gins transformed the flower girl into the society lady by treating her as if 
she ­were a lady, man­ag­ers have the potential to transform their employees.8 
If a man­ag­er has high expectations and treats individual employees as if they 
are responsible, capable, and committed to the organ­ization’s goals, typically 
an employee lives up to that expectation. On the other hand, if a man­ag­er 
has low expectations, he or she ­will be more likely to oversee the worker 
closely; to keep the worker from ­doing much in­de­pen­dent work; and, if mis­
takes are made, to blame the worker. The man­ag­er with low expectations is 
setting the worker up to fail.9
Sometimes man­ag­ers who have been promoted to managerial positions 
­because of their technical skills find it hard to adjust to the social ele­ment 
that goes with being a man­ag­er. All man­ag­ers need to be “­people” persons 
­because the ­human side of the organ­ization is a key ele­ment in the success 
of any organ­ization. Man­ag­ers who are skillful working with the ­human ele­
ment of an organ­ization ­will have employees who ­will be loyal, supportive, 
and more productive. Research has shown that employees seek a workplace 
where they can have personal connections and where their supervisor seems 
to care about them as ­people. An employee who believes that she is “just a 
number, just another “full-­time equivalent” or “FTE,” ­will not go out of her 
way to sacrifice for the com­pany”.10
Henry Ford, the automobile pioneer, is reported to have once asked in 
exasperation, “Why, when I only want to hire a pair of hands, do I get a ­whole 
person?” Even if they do not want the ­whole person, man­ag­ers at all levels 
­will have to deal with the ­whole employee. ­Those man­ag­ers who are able to

“We make demands on man­ag­ers that are nearly impossible to meet. For 
starters, we ask them to acquire a long list of more or less traditional manage­
ment skills in finance, cost control, resource allocation, product development, 
marketing, manufacturing, technology, and a dozen other areas. We also 
demand that they master the management arts—­strategy, persuasion, negotia­
tion, writing, speaking, listening. In addition, we ask them to assume responsi­
bility for orga­nizational success, make a ­great deal of money, and share it 
generously. We also require them to demonstrate the qualities that define 
leadership, integrity, and character—­things like vision, fortitude, passion, 
sensitivity, commitment, insight, intelligence, ethical standards, charisma, 
luck, courage, tenacity, even from time to time humility. Fi­nally, we insist that 
they should be our friends, mentors, or guardians, perpetually alert to our best 
interests. Practicing this common profession adequately, in other words, 
requires ­people to display on an everyday basis the combined skills of St. Peter, 
Peter the ­Great, and the ­Great Houdini. No won­der most man­ag­ers seem to 
underperform.”7
As Thomas Teal points out, we do expect a lot from our man­ag­ers. Do you think 
we demand too much? What can man­ag­ers do to live up to the expectations of their 
employees?

do it successfully are able to unleash a power­ful force contributing to the suc­
cess of the enterprise.
Emotional Intelligence
­Today, we realize that truly effective man­ag­ers have to have more than 
technical skills; they also need to have social skills that allow them to lead 
the ­human side of the organ­ization successfully. It was Daniel Goleman who 
first pop­u­lar­ized the term emotional intelligence (EQ) with the 1995 publi­
cation of his book of the same name.11 In the intervening years, the concept 
of EQ has become an increasingly popu­lar way to think about an individu­
al’s innate potential to identify and understand emotions. The interest in EQ 
reflects the understanding that IQ or conventional intelligence is too nar­
row a mea­sure ­because it ignores impor­tant behavioral characteristics that 
also contribute to success. Some individuals ­will never be good man­ag­ers 
even though they are academically very brilliant, ­because they lack essen­
tial social and interpersonal skills. Man­ag­ers, ­because so much of their 
success depends on their ability to work with ­others, need to develop their 
emotional intelligence. According to Goleman, EQ has five domains:
•	 Self-­awareness or knowing your emotions
•	 Self-­regulation or managing your own emotions
•	 Motivation or a passion to work for reasons that go beyond money or 
status
•	 Empathy or recognizing and understanding other ­people’s emotions
•	 Social skill or proficiency in managing relationships.12
In the past, top man­ag­ers in organ­izations sometimes promoted highly 
intelligent, skilled individuals who seemed to have all the technical skills 
necessary to do the job into management positions only to have them fail. 
Now administrators in organ­izations of all types realize the importance of 
emotional or social intelligence in the workplace and are screening for ­those 
qualities in ­people being considered for management. As Goleman states, “It’s 
not that IQ and technical skills are irrelevant. They do ­matter, but mainly 
as ‘threshold capabilities’; that is, they are the entry-­level requirements for 
executive positions. But . . . ​emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of lead­
ership. Without it, a person . . . ​­won’t make a ­great leader.”13
When choosing man­ag­ers, administrators in organ­izations still are 
looking for ­people with technical expertise, but increasingly skills such as 
empathy, stress management, and po­liti­cal and social acumen are being con­
sidered essential abilities that allow man­ag­ers to successfully deal with the 
­human side of the organ­ization.

Daniel Goleman and his colleagues have developed an assessment tool, the Emotional 
and Social Competency Inventory, to mea­sure an individual’s emotional intelligence. 
The inventory is an evaluation instrument designed to be completed by an individual’s

Motivation
Motivation affects both employee per­for­mance and orga­nizational effec­
tiveness. Man­ag­ers motivate their workers by establishing an environment 
that induces them to work ­toward furthering the organ­ization’s goals. Many 
questions about an employee’s be­hav­ior can be best answered by examining 
his or her motivation. In ­every organ­ization, ­there are some employees who 
boss, peers, direct reports, clients, and sometime even ­family members. The seven quali­
ties mea­sured and some of the questions used to assess them are:
1.	 Empathy
a.	Do you understand what motivates other ­people, even ­those from dif­fer­ent 
backgrounds?
b.	 Are you sensitive to ­others’ needs?
2.	Attunement
a.	Do you listen attentively and think about how ­others feel?
b.	 Are you attuned to ­others’ moods?
3.	Orga­nizational Awareness
a.	Do you appreciate the culture and values of the group or organ­ization?
b.	 Do you understand social networks and know their unspoken norms?
4.	Influence
a.	Do you persuade ­others by engaging them in discussion and appealing to 
their self-­interests?
b.	 Do you get support from key ­people?
5.	Developing ­Others
a.	Do you coach and mentor ­others with compassion and personally invest time 
and energy in mentoring?
b.	 Do you provide feedback that ­people find helpful for their professional 
development?
6.	Inspiration
a.	Do you articulate a compelling vision, build group pride, and foster a posi­
tive emotional tone?
b.	 Do you lead by bringing out the best in ­people?
7.	 Teamwork
a.	Do you solicit input from every­one on the team?
b.	Do you support all team members and encourage cooperation?14
Use ­these mea­sures to think about your own EQ. Although the scale was designed 
to be used in the workplace, the qualities it attempts to mea­sure are applicable to all 
­people. If you think your EQ may be low, how could it be improved?

Practice Your Skills
You have just accepted a position as the head of the school library (SL) at Hillside Ele­
mentary School. Hillside is a fairly large school, with an enrollment of 800 students in 
kindergarten through sixth grade. The only employees in the SL are you and Mrs. Smith, 
a clerical aide who has worked in the library for almost 10 years. You have been told 
that the library relies heavi­ly on parent volunteers to provide ser­vice to the students, 
and you realize that managing ­these volunteers ­will be an impor­tant part of your job. 
From a discussion with the previous head of the SL, you learn that many of the volun­
teers seem to be very dispirited and burned out, and that fewer of them are actually 
showing up for their assigned work. In addition, ­there are 20 ­percent fewer volunteers 
signed up to help than ­there ­were last year. You are getting worried ­because you know 
the SL relies on ­these volunteers. You realize you ­will need to attract good volunteers 
and keep them satisfied, but you are puzzled about how to do it.
How can you motivate volunteers who receive no monetary reward for the work they 
do? How do you get busy ­people interested in providing needed ser­vices for their chil­
dren’s school?
work very hard and ­others who do as ­little as pos­si­ble; some employees show 
up on time for work ­every day and work late when necessary, while ­others 
are frequently late and sometimes fail to come to work at all. It is often said 
that the first group of employees is motivated and the second is not. How­
ever, what ­causes some workers to feel motivated while ­others do not? This 
question has long puzzled man­ag­ers.
Motivation can be thought of as the willingness to expend energy to 
achieve a goal or a reward. Thus, motivation governs individuals’ choices 
among voluntary activities. Motivation at work has been defined as “the sum 
of the pro­cesses that influence the arousal, direction, and maintenance of 
be­hav­iors relevant to work settings.”15
Research has shown that most ­people do not work to the fullest extent 
of their capabilities and that most jobs do not require them to do so. In some 
of the earliest research on motivation, William James of Harvard Univer­
sity discovered that hourly workers who worked at 20 to 30 ­percent of their 
ability performed well enough to keep their jobs. He also found highly moti­
vated workers who performed at 80 to 90 ­percent of their ability.16 A more 
recent study, which surveyed more than 80,000 full-­ and part-­time workers 
during 2015, showed that just 32 ­percent of employees are actively commit­
ted to ­doing a good job. Approximately half of ­today’s employees are merely 
putting in their time, while the remaining 17 ­percent are acting out their 
discontent in counterproductive ways such as taking excessive sick days, neg­
atively influencing their coworkers, and providing poor ser­vice.17
Many, if not most, ­people do not work up to their full potential. The gap 
between the engaged workers who work hard at their jobs and ­those who do 
not is the area that can be affected by motivation. ­Because any organ­ization’s 
success depends on its employees’ per­for­mance, man­ag­ers must concern 
themselves with motivating their workers. The Gallup organ­ization, which 
carried out the second survey discussed above, estimated that the completely 
disengaged 17 ­percent of the workforce costs the U.S. economy around half 
a trillion dollars each year.18

Talk About It
Amy Crump, library director at the Homewood Public Library in Illinois, recently wrote 
that she finds the notion that good man­ag­ers are able to discover what motivates each 
individual employee a difficult one. Crump states, “I have always found this concept a 
challenging one to make a real­ity when dealing with a staff of more than two ­people. 
The first prob­lem is logistics—­how do you find the necessary time to understand what 
motivates each individual employee? The next prob­lem is ­whether said employee feels 
comfortable enough with their man­ag­er to truly reveal what their motivation is.”19
It is difficult for man­ag­ers to learn what motivates employees, especially if they are 
working with a large staff. Do you have any suggestions for man­ag­ers looking for the 
best way to motivate employees? If you presently have a job, do you think your supervi­
sor knows what motivates you?
What motivates ­people varies from individual to individual and even 
within the same person at dif­fer­ent times. In most cases, however, motiva­
tion depends on a combination of internal and external forces. Each ­human 
being’s psychological makeup is complex, thus motivating individuals is com­
plicated and multifaceted. In general, the feeling of motivation is related to 
vari­ous drives, needs, and wishes. Individuals may recognize some of their 
needs and take care of them, while at the same time other needs that are 
not as apparent may be working subconsciously. Motivation occurs in many 
settings and is always a sequential pro­cess. For instance, in a work setting, 
motivation occurs when an employee puts forth an effort that results in the 
organ­ization achieving its goals and culminates in the employer rewarding 
the employee in some way.
The numerous theories and models that aim to explain ­human motiva­
tion fall into two major groups: the content models and the pro­cess theories. 
Content models try to pinpoint, describe, and address workers’ wants and 
needs. According to ­these theories, workers’ needs are tools that man­ag­ers 
can use to motivate them. Pro­cess theories, meanwhile, focus on ways man­
ag­ers can use their knowledge of workers’ needs and desires to motivate 
be­hav­ior.
Content Models
­Because each worker is motivated by a unique set of needs and desires, 
a number of motivational theories and models attempt to identify what 
­these needs and desires are likely to be. All such theories assume that indi­
viduals possess preexisting needs and that, although ­these needs are com­
plex, man­ag­ers can motivate employees by addressing them. The worker 
and the man­ag­er are related in a synergistic way; the worker has his or her 
needs fulfilled, and the man­ag­er obtains the necessary productivity from 
him or her.
Figure 13.1 illustrates a basic model of motivation. An individual has a 
need, an internal state that makes a certain outcome appear attractive. This 
need creates a tension that stimulates efforts within that person. The ten­
sion leads to efforts to perform, which results in a reward that satisfies the 
need. Then new needs ­will arise that ­will have to be satisfied. For example, 

Motivation in the Workplace  313
Marianne has just graduated from her LIS program and needs to get a job. 
She is stimulated to search for openings and apply. When a job offer is 
extended, her effort is rewarded, and her need is satisfied.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
Psychologist Abraham Maslow proposed one of the earliest and best 
known of the content theories of motivation in the 1940s. He postulated that 
all individuals have needs and that ­these needs can be ranked in one uni­
versal hierarchy. Needs near the bottom of the hierarchy must be satisfied 
before an individual can set about satisfying higher-­level needs. As his or 
her needs are satisfied, they cease to act as motivating ­factors ­until they 
recur. Consequently, only unsatisfied needs serve as effective motivators. 
Maslow identified five levels of needs, which are illustrated in figure 13.2.
1.	 Physiological. The fundamental needs of a ­human are food, ­water, 
shelter, sleep, and other bodily requirements that are essential to 
­human survival. ­Until ­these needs have been met, higher-­level 
needs ­will provide ­little motivation.
2.	 Safety and security. At this level, a person addresses fears of 
physical danger and of being deprived of basic physiological needs.
3.	 Social or affiliation. ­After the first two levels of need have been 
satisfied, an individual feels the need to belong, to love and be loved, 
and to participate in activities that create a sense of togetherness.
4.	 Esteem. Once their social needs have been met, ­people seek to be 
more than just a member of a group. Individuals want to be held in 
esteem, both by themselves and by ­others. Satisfying this subset of 
needs results in feelings of power, self-­confidence, and prestige.
5.	 Self-­actualization. At the highest level, the individual achieves 
self-­actualization, which means maximizing one’s potential to 
become every­thing that one is capable of becoming.20
This hierarchy of needs concept can help man­ag­ers understand what 
motivates workers. If basic physiological needs are not met—if a person does 
not have sufficient food, ­water, clothing, and shelter—­then none of the higher-­
level needs ­will seem pressing enough to act as a motivator. In most cases, 
­these physiological needs can be satisfied when an individual has enough 
FIGURE 13.1. A ­Simple Model of Motivation

314  Leading
money. Thus money, not in itself but ­because of what it ­will purchase, is a 
power­ful motivator. In an affluent society like the United States, most ­people’s 
physiological needs are fulfilled, so a man­ag­er ­will derive ­little success from 
using ­these needs as motivators.
With physiological needs met, fulfilling one’s security or safety needs 
becomes paramount. Some of ­these needs are clear, such as the need to avoid 
physical harm, accidents, or attacks. ­Today, most organ­izations provide phys­
ically safe workplaces. At the same time, however, the need for security extends 
beyond the pres­ent and into the ­future. Man­ag­ers can allay some concerns 
about the ­future by providing benefits, such as health insurance, and retire­
ment funding. The desire for job security is a strong motivator for most 
workers, especially when unemployment is high and jobs are scarce.
­After physiological and safety needs have been fulfilled, a person’s social 
needs come to the fore. ­Humans are social animals; they want to interact 
with ­others and be affiliated with a group. For example, ­humans create the 
informal organ­izations that Elton Mayo describes in the Hawthorne studies 
(discussed in chapter 2) in order to fulfill their need to socialize and belong 
to a group.
At the next level, esteem needs include both self-­esteem and the esteem 
of ­others. Not only do workers want their work to be valued by their superi­
ors and their peers, but they themselves also need to derive self-­esteem and 
satisfaction from it. Some employees stay in low-­paying jobs for the sake of 
this self-­satisfaction. Additional esteem needs include the desire for recog­
nition, prestige, and power and the competitive urge to outdo ­others. Rarely 
completely fulfilled, esteem needs can be a potent and reliable source of 
motivation.
The topmost layer of need, according to Maslow, is self-­actualization: the 
need to maximize one’s potential. This level is the most complex, and usu­
ally goes beyond the bound­aries of everyday life. It requires individuals to 
have an almost religious fervor to fulfill their ­human potential.21 As a result, 
it is rare for someone to completely satisfy this need.
FIGURE 13.2. Maslow’s Hierarchy of ­Human Needs

Motivation in the Workplace  315
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs exist in all dimensions of a person’s life and 
it can easily be adapted to the workplace. The needs of employees are more 
specific than the general needs Maslow first described, but they are closely 
related. By helping employees meet impor­tant needs at work, man­ag­ers can 
create a highly motivated and more productive workforce. An application of 
Maslow’s Hierarchy in the workplace can be seen in figure 13.3
Some thinkers have criticized Maslow’s hierarchy as simplistic and arti­
ficial. ­Because ­every person is dif­fer­ent, many individuals do not pursue needs 
in the order postulated by Maslow, especially at the higher levels. In addition, 
­these needs often seem to overlap and combine. Furthermore, ­because it was 
based on U.S. culture, Maslow’s theory is limited in its applicability to other 
cultures. Most Western countries have similar cultures, but countries with 
non-­Western value systems might have dif­fer­ent hierarchies. Most of the 
models of motivation discussed in this chapter are, like Maslow’s, derived from 
U.S. culture; although they may apply in other Western cultures, ­these mod­
els are not intended to be universal.
FIGURE 13.3. Application of Maslow’s Hierarchy in the Workplace

316  Leading
Despite its flaws and limitations, Maslow’s theory has been popu­lar with 
man­ag­ers ­because it provides a conceptual guide for motivating employees. 
By identifying an employee’s current position within the hierarchy, the man­
ag­er can determine which motivator would most effectively encourage the 
employee to improve his or her per­for­mance. The hierarchy reminds man­ag­
ers that unfulfilled needs are more motivational than fulfilled needs, and 
that all needs can never be satisfied at once, ­because a person who satisfies 
one need ­will then try to satisfy another.
Herzberg’s Two-­Factor Theory of Motivation
In the late 1950s, Frederick Herzberg and his research associates built 
upon and modified Maslow’s ideas. Herzberg formulated a theory of motivation 
that focused specifically on employees in a work environment.22 Figure 13.4 
compares the two theories.
FIGURE 13.4. Comparison of Maslow’s and Herzberg’s Motivation Theories

Motivation in the Workplace  317
Herzberg and his associates gathered information about job ele­ments 
that made employees feel happy and satisfied and ­those that made employ­
ees feel dissatisfied. By analyzing this data, the researchers discovered that 
certain ­factors helped employees feel good about their jobs; Herzberg called 
­these ­factors motivators. Motivators tend to be closely related to the content 
of the job itself. Examples include:
•	 Achievement
•	 Recognition of the work by supervisors, peers, customers, or 
subordinates
•	 The work itself, particularly aspects that give the worker personal 
satisfaction
•	 Responsibility, such as working without supervision and being 
responsible for one’s own efforts
•	 Advancement.
­Because ­these ­factors lead to job satisfaction, man­ag­ers can use them 
to elicit superior per­for­mance. Another group of ­factors, which Herzberg 
labeled hygiene or maintenance ­factors, pertains primarily to the context in 
which a job is performed. ­These hygiene or maintenance ­factors include:
•	 Salary
•	 Job security
•	 Status
•	 Working conditions
•	 Quality of supervision
•	 Com­pany policy and administration
•	 Interpersonal relationships.
­These ­factors neither create job satisfaction nor serve as motivators. If 
­these ­factors are inadequate, however, dissatisfaction ­will arise.
Motivators and hygiene ­factors are relatively in­de­pen­dent of each other, 
with each set affecting employee be­hav­ior in dif­fer­ent ways. When ­people are 
satisfied with their jobs, the satisfaction tends to be connected to the work 
itself. When they are dissatisfied, they are usually unhappy with the working 
environment. Put another way, the ­factors that motivate workers are intrin­
sic to the job, while the ­factors that cause dissatisfaction are extrinsic to it.
Subsequent research pertaining to Herzberg’s model has been inconclu­
sive. Nevertheless, man­ag­ers still consider the two-­factor motivational the­
ory relevant. The theory holds that hygiene ­factors must be satisfied ­because 
they provide a foundation on which to build. Employees who are unhappy 
about salary, status, or working conditions ­will be discontented in their jobs. 
However, hygiene ­factors alone are not enough. Man­ag­ers who want employ­
ees to be energetic and dedicated must provide motivators; that is, they must 
ensure that jobs are in­ter­est­ing and challenging to employees, emphasizing 
achievement, recognition, growth, and the substance of the work itself.
Herzberg argued that job enrichment is among the most effective meth­
ods of motivating employees.23 However, he cautioned against “horizontal 
job loading,” or merely giving the worker additional meaningless tasks. In

a library, allowing a shelver to shelve both books and periodicals is unlikely 
to improve motivation. True job enrichment calls for “vertical job loading,” 
which both makes a job more challenging and allows the worker more respon­
sibility. An enriched job calls for the employee to draw on more of his or her 
talents and provides more freedom in decision-­making. Herzberg’s research 
shows that job enrichment leads to better-­motivated and more productive 
employees and continues to influence how jobs are designed and how man­
ag­ers perceive the relationship between a worker’s job and his or her job 
satisfaction.
McClelland’s Need Theory
David McClelland’s work offers us a dif­fer­ent perspective on what moti­
vates workers. McClelland proposed that ­there are three major categories of 
needs among workers:
•	 The need for achievement (nAch) is the desire to excel in relation 
to a set of standards. It is the drive to succeed.
•	 The need for power (nPow) is the desire to be influential and have 
an impact on an organ­ization.
•	 The need for affiliation (nAff) is the desire for close personal 
relationships.
Workers with a high need for achievement want to succeed and advance. 
They seek situations in which they can assume responsibility; to them, accom­
plishment is impor­tant for its own sake. Workers with a high need for power 
want to influence ­people and the organ­ization as a ­whole. They want to be in 
charge. Workers with a high need for affiliation have a drive to engage ­people 
socially and to have close personal relationships. They prefer cooperative sit­
uations to competitive ones.
McClelland used a projective test, the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), 
in his research. Each subject was shown a picture and asked to write a story 
about it. For instance, a picture might show a boy at a desk with a book. A sub­
ject who is low in nAch might write a story about the boy daydreaming, 
whereas someone high in nAch would write that the boy was studying hard 
to do well and was worried about an upcoming test. In addition to the TAT, 
McClelland and his associates also used questionnaires that asked about such 
subjects as ­career preferences, the role of luck in outcomes, and the like.24
McClelland’s theory differed from earlier ones in that he thought ­these 
three needs ­were learned. “Motivation is inculcated in ­children through the 
stories and role models presented to them as ­things admired in their soci­
ety. As adults, they seek to emulate the heroes and values of their childhood 
lessons.”25 However, McClelland also believed that adults can change, and 
some of his ­later work deals with developing greater nAch, especially in work­
ers outside the United States.26
A man­ag­er who subscribes to McClelland’s theory of motivation tries to 
match vari­ous facets of the job to the needs of the jobholder. Like many other 
theories, McClelland’s approach stems from the belief that a worker ­will be 
most successful when matched with a job that fulfills his or her needs. For 
instance, an employee with a high nAch should do challenging work that also 
encourages personal responsibility.

Pro­cess Models
In contrast to content models of motivation, which try to identify spe­
cific needs or values that spur the desire to work, pro­cess models focus on 
the psychological and behavioral under­pinnings of motivation. The basic 
assumption under­lying ­these models is that “internal cognitive states and 
situational variables interact in the motivational pro­cess. The individual 
is an active ­factor, selecting be­hav­iors based on his or her needs and expec­
tations about what kind of be­hav­ior ­will lead to a desired reward.”28 Four of 
the best-­known pro­cess models of motivation are the equity theory, the 
expectancy theory, the behavioral modification theory, and the goal-­setting 
theory.
Adams’s Equity Theory
John Stacey Adams, a behavioral psychologist, developed the equity the­
ory of job motivation. This theory focuses on the balance between the inputs 
and the outputs of a given employee’s position, compared to the input/output 
balance of other employees’ positions. (The other positions that employees use 
for comparison may be within the same organ­ization or a dif­fer­ent one.) The 
Equity Theory is illustrated in figure 13.5.
As can be seen in the model, the equity theory of motivation is based on 
the comparisons an employee makes between his or her position and that of 
­others; an employee compares the perceived effort exerted (inputs) and the 
resulting rewards (outputs) and then tries to achieve equity between them. 
Inputs include such considerations as the number of hours worked, the 
amount of effort expended on the job, the tasks involved, and the ability or 
educational level required. Outputs can be thought of as rewards: the amount 
of pay earned, vacation time, job security, recognition, and praise. Within this 
model, each employee compares the inputs and outputs of his or her par­tic­
u­lar position to ­those of similar positions; employees who see themselves as 
working harder than ­others for less reward ­will be motivated to reduce the 
perceived inequity. For example, if employee A compares himself to employee 
B and concludes that the input/output ratios are inequitable, employee A may 
begin to expend less effort on his work.
Talk About It
David  C. McClelland once wrote, “Most ­people in this world, psychologically, can be 
divided into two broad groups. ­There is that minority which is challenged by opportu­
nity and willing to work hard to achieve something, and the majority, which ­really does 
not care all that much. . . . ​Psychologists have tried to penetrate the mystery of this 
curious dichotomy. Is the need to achieve (or the absence of it) an accident, is it hereditary, 
or is it the result of environment? Is it a single, isolatable ­human motive or a combina­
tion of motives—­the desire to accumulate wealth, power fame? Most impor­tant of all, is 
­there some technique that could give this ­will to achieve to ­people, even ­whole socie­ties, 
who do not now have it?27
McClelland poses a hard question ­here. Do you have any ideas about what makes 
some ­people so much more motivated than ­others? Do you have any suggestions about 
how to motivate the many individuals who are content to do as ­little as pos­si­ble? Can 
you think of any way to motivate workers in groups who ­aren’t ­doing their fair share?

320  Leading
Alternatively, employee A might ask for a raise (an increased reward), 
or he might try to get employee B to work harder. If inequity remains, employee 
A might leave the organ­ization altogether. Employees who feel underpaid 
­will usually aim to redress the inequity by working less, while ­those who feel 
overpaid ­will typically try to balance inputs and outputs by working harder. 
In short, this theory emphasizes the importance of a reward system that 
employees perceive to be fair, and calls for man­ag­ers to try to maintain an 
equitable reward system, making sure that employees understand the basis 
for apportioning rewards such as pay or promotions.29
Vroom’s Expectancy Theory
Other researchers have developed “expectancy theories” of motivation.30 
More complex than the content theories, ­these models assume that individ­
uals act so as to maximize desirable results and minimize undesirable ones. 
Among the best known of ­these theories is that of Victor Vroom, who stud­
ied how motivation takes place in relation to an individual’s needs and objec­
tives.31 Vroom’s theory focuses on the pro­cess that an individual goes through 
in deciding ­whether to exert the effort to attempt a par­tic­u­lar goal.
Vroom thought that ­people are motivated to work ­toward a goal if they 
believe the goal is worthwhile, and if they perceive that their efforts ­will con­
tribute to the achievement of that goal. His expectancy model is composed of 
three variables:
•	 Valence is the extent to which a person desires a certain outcome 
or goal.
•	 Expectancy is the perceived probability that an outcome ­will lead 
to a desired result, known as the first-­level outcome.
•	 Instrumentality is the degree to which an individual believes that 
a first-­level outcome relates to a second-­level outcome, which is defined 
as the fulfillment of some ­human need, such as companionship, 
esteem, or accomplishment.
FIGURE 13.5. The Equity Theory of Motivation

Motivation in the Workplace  321
The force of motivation in an employee can be calculated using the fol­
lowing formula:
Motivation = Valence × Expectancy × Instrumentality.
Vroom’s formula is a multiplicative one; if the value of any ­factor equals zero, 
so does the motivational force.
As an illustration of this theory, consider Mary Smith, a worker who 
wants to be promoted. Mary thinks that the best way to get that promotion 
would be to improve her job per­for­mance. The motivation to improve job per­
for­mance would be a product of the intensity of the desire for promotion 
(valence) multiplied by Mary’s perception of how likely it is that working harder 
can improve job per­for­mance (expectancy) multiplied by her perception of 
FIGURE 13.6. Vroom’s Expectancy Theory

322  Leading
how likely it is that improved job per­for­mance ­will lead to a promotion (instru­
mentality). In this example, the first-­level outcome is better job per­for­mance 
and the second-­level outcome is promotion. ­Because of the multiplicative 
nature of the formula, if Mary feels that promotion is out of reach, even with 
improved job per­for­mance, her motivation to improve her per­for­mance would 
drop to zero. Likewise, if Mary felt that, despite her efforts, she could not 
improve her job per­for­mance, again her motivation would dis­appear. Vroom’s 
theory is illustrated in figure 13.6.
Vroom’s theory highlights how ­people’s goals influence their efforts. A 
person’s be­hav­ior is a function of (1) the belief that this be­hav­ior ­will help 
him or her achieve a par­tic­u­lar goal and (2) the desire to achieve that goal. 
In recognizing the importance of vari­ous individual needs and motivations, 
Vroom’s theory indicates that motivation is highly individualized; conse­
quently, a man­ag­er who wants to motivate employees should try to learn each 
one’s special concerns and preferences. The man­ag­er must also clarify to 
employees the connections between per­for­mance and reward.
This theory also highlights certain problematic managerial situations. For 
example, if an organ­ization awards pay raises based on a merit system, yet is 
unable or unwilling to reward ­every highly rated worker, all workers ­will be 
less motivated to perform better in ­future. The employer’s failure to deliver 
on the promised merit award erodes workers’ trust in the organ­ization.
­Because Vroom’s theory emphasizes the individual, it is more difficult 
to apply than the general theories of motivation posited by Maslow and Her­
zberg. However, Vroom’s theory avoids some of the content theories’ more sim­
plistic aspects, while also accounting more adequately for employees’ diverse 
motivational needs. Extensive scholarly research on this model bears out the 
premise that ­people tend to work hard when they believe it ­will ­either lead 
to desirable outcomes or avoid undesirable ones.

Hank works in the systems department of a large academic library. He has been told by 
his man­ag­er several times in the last few years that good per­for­mance ­will result in a 
promotion. Although Hank’s evaluations have been consistently good, he has not been 
promoted. Now the head of the systems department has asked him to take responsibil­
ity for a special proj­ect and has promised him a promotion if this proj­ect is successful. 
The man­ag­er has asked Hank to come in to discuss more about the upcoming proj­ect 
and Hank’s responsibilities in it.
Find a partner and role-­play the interview between Hank and his supervisor. What 
should Hank say? Is ­there anything he might say or do to get the promotion he wants so 
badly? If you ­were Hank, how likely would you be to take on this new responsibility?
Be­hav­ior Modification
The work of B. F. Skinner, one of the leading proponents of the behavior­
istic school of psy­chol­ogy, provides man­ag­ers with yet another pro­cess model 
of motivation. However, unlike the other motivational theories discussed, 
be­hav­ior modification is based on observed actions, not on individual attitudes, 
desires, or emotions. Skinner emphasizes operant be­hav­ior, be­hav­ior that 
has been ­shaped and modified—­that is, controlled—by its past consequences. 

Motivation in the Workplace  323
He posits that individuals act in certain ways ­because ­those be­hav­iors have 
been reinforced in the past. Reinforcement is defined as a consequence that 
follows a response and that therefore makes a person more likely to respond 
the same way in the ­future. Reinforcements can be tangible (e.g., money or 
food) or intangible (e.g., praise or attention). According to Skinner, be­hav­ior 
is modified via positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, no reinforce­
ment, and punishment.32
•	 Positive reinforcement is the most effective long-­range strat­
egy for motivating individuals, according to Skinner, and consists of 
rewarding a be­hav­ior that the motivator wishes to encourage. Posi­
tive reinforcement seeks to highlight this be­hav­ior and make it more 
likely to occur in the ­future. Man­ag­ers can offer a wide range of posi­
tive reinforcements, including pay increases, promotions, and praise.
•	 Negative reinforcement, by contrast, is what happens when a 
be­hav­ior or act is encouraged by the termination or withdrawal of 
something unpleasant. For instance, if a supervisor criticizes a worker 
for coming to work late, the worker’s desire to eliminate this criti­
cism may goad him or her to arrive on time.
•	 No reinforcement leads to the extinction of a be­hav­ior. Skinner’s 
model posits that when a be­hav­ior is not reinforced in one way or 
another, it ­will decrease in frequency and then stop. For example, if 
a man­ag­er neither praises nor criticizes the worker who yells across 
the room to get his attention, that unwanted be­hav­ior is not being 
reinforced and should eventually cease.
•	 Punishment is an unpleasant event that follows unwanted be­hav­
ior and is used to discourage that be­hav­ior. Among the punishments 
man­ag­ers can inflict are demotion and firing.
Critics of Skinner’s work say it treats ­humans as passive objects while 
denying the existence of individuals’ ­free ­will. Also problematic is the diffi­
culty of applying be­hav­ior modification princi­ples in the workplace, rather than 
in a controlled laboratory setting. In the lab, scientists working with rats can 
deprive them of food to ensure they are hungry, and then provide food imme­
diately ­after the desired be­hav­ior occurs. This way they can be certain that 
no uncontrolled variable has influenced the rats’ be­hav­ior. Although the work­
place provides many opportunities for man­ag­ers to try be­hav­ior modification 
on employees, uncontrolled variables are certain to intrude in that environ­
ment. Nevertheless, some man­ag­ers are successfully using be­hav­ior modifica­
tion to motivate employees.33 Be­hav­ior modification techniques are frequently 
used to improve safety practices within manufacturing companies and as a 
part of achieving specific behavioral outcomes, such as smoking cessation or 
weight loss in employee health care programs. Recently, many organ­izations 
have started giving employees activity trackers such as Fitbits to motivate 
them to adopt healthier more productive lifestyles. Organ­izations have used 
both positive reinforcements (such as additional vacation days) and punish­
ments (such as higher insurance premiums for employees who do not par­
ticipate) to get employees to participate in health screening and wellness 
programs.34
Be­hav­ior modification is difficult to institute systematically and thor­
oughly, but it does provide man­ag­ers with some applicable princi­ples. Super­
visors should ensure that employees who are performing well get positive

We achieve more when we establish goals ­because goals allow us to focus our efforts and 
know when we have achieved our objectives. However, vague, ambiguous goals are not 
helpful. The exhortation to “do your best” does not provide the specificity needed to know 
if an objective has been met. Instead, experts recommend that we establish SMART 
goals. SMART is a mnemonic acronym, which provides a guide to setting effective goals. 
SMART goals allow you to transform vague aspirations into concrete plans. SMART 
goals are goals that are:
•	 Specific. The goal should clearly define what you want to do.
•	 Measurable. The goal should provide some method to allow you to determine 
­whether the goal has been achieved.
•	 Achievable. The best goals should challenge you a bit but they should also be 
realistic.
•	 Relevant. The goal should be relevant to what you are trying to achieve.
•	 Time based. Goals should establish a time frame in which you expect to achieve 
the objective.
A goal that meets the SMART criteria would be, “By next Friday, finish all the 
research for the term paper due three weeks from now.” Think about something you want 
to achieve in the near ­future. Then set yourself a SMART goal to help you accomplish this. 
Why do you think ­people are more likely to meet their objectives if they use SMART 
goals?
reinforcement, bearing in mind that positive reinforcement modifies be­hav­
ior more effectively than ­either negative reinforcement or punishment. For 
example, employees who are punished for talking on the job learn to remain 
­silent when supervisors are around but may still talk in their absence. In 
addition, punished employees are likely to feel resentful and ­will likely act 
out such feelings in unproductive ways, possibly thwarting the supervisors’ 
goals.
Be­hav­ior modification works best when a job has specific variables that 
can be identified and reinforced. Some library clerical jobs fall into this cat­
egory. For instance, staffers’ error rate could be subject to be­hav­ior modifi­
cation techniques; a man­ag­er could reward employees who complete tasks 
without making errors. However, jobs that are more complex are less condu­
cive to be­hav­ior modification. Much of the work done by librarians is intel­
lectual, which makes it difficult to identify, mea­sure, and reinforce many of 
the be­hav­iors in question.
Goal-­Setting Theory
The goal-­setting theory, first propounded by Edwin Locke, states that 
specific goals improve per­for­mance, and that difficult goals, when accepted 
by employees, lead to higher per­for­mance levels than do easier goals.35 If 
employees believe that they cannot attain a goal, they ­will feel dissatisfied; 
however, they ­will work harder if they think that the goal is attainable. Of 
the more than 500 studies done in at least eight countries examining goal 

Motivation in the Workplace  325
setting in organ­izations, about 90 ­percent have shown results that support 
this theory.36 Locke and Latham outlined five characteristics that are asso­
ciated with successful goal setting.37
1.	 Clarity. When goals are clear and specific, they identify exactly 
what has to be done, when it should be done, and what be­hav­iors ­will 
be rewarded. The more specific the goal, the more motivating it is.
2.	 Challenge. When goals are challenging, employees work harder to 
achieve them. Workers are more motivated by goals that require 
some effort but at the same time are attainable. For ­people to feel 
committed to a goal, they must be convinced that the goal is impor­
tant, and that it is entirely or partially reachable.
3.	 Commitment. A goal must be understood and agreed upon to be 
effective. Workers should be provided with information about the 
purpose and the rationale of any goal.
4.	 Feedback. ­There must be feedback to allow ­people to determine if 
they are meeting the goal. Without feedback, workers ­will not be able 
to judge if they are making sufficient pro­gress ­towards attainment 
of a goal. Feedback also promotes continued commitment to a goal.
5.	 Task Complexity. Large, complex goals should be broken down 
into smaller subgoals to keep workers motivated. When goals or 
work assignments are complex, workers must be given sufficient 
time to complete the task.38
Goal setting helps direct employee action ­toward the values of the organ­
ization. Setting difficult yet achievable goals (sometimes called stretch goals) 
shows employees what they should be aiming to achieve. Imagine that you 
are an original cata­loger in a large library. Would you feel greater motiva­
tion if you are told to do the best you can or that you are expected to cata­log 
12 English-­language books a day? Having a definite, concrete goal informs an 
employee of the employer’s expectations and gives that employee an objective 
to focus on. Achieving a set goal feels very satisfying as it fulfills both the 
need for self-­esteem and the need for achievement. This feeling often stim­
ulates an employee to try to do even more the next time. To implement goal 
setting successfully, all of the ele­ments illustrated in figure 13.7 must be 
included.
How Should Man­ag­ers Motivate Employees?
Motivation is a complex ­factor, and man­ag­ers face a wide array of 
approaches for promoting commitment to jobs within an organ­ization. As 
Locke states:
The issue of how to understand and influence ­human motivation 
has proven to be one of the most recalcitrant prob­lems in ­human 
psy­chol­ogy. The fundamental reasons for this are that motivation 
at root comes from within the individual and is most directly 
controlled by the individual. Since motivation is “inside” the 
person, it cannot be observed directly, and since individuals 
possess freedom of choice . . . ​­people cannot be controlled 
directly from the outside.39

326  Leading
All library man­ag­ers face the challenge of how to motivate their employ­
ees, who often are very diverse. They vary in types of jobs held, in the amount 
of responsibility they are given, in age, and in status. It is clear that one 
approach to motivation ­will not be sufficient. What might motivate a student 
worker in the library is prob­ably dif­fer­ent from what motivates a se­nior pro­
fessional. To further complicate ­things, some libraries depend on volunteers 
to help provide ser­vices; how do you motivate someone who is not being paid, 
since that individual is obviously not ­doing the job for money? Even for paid 
employees, money is often not the only or best motivator. A recent survey found 
that recognition was the top ­factor in motivating employees to work harder.40 
Employees can be recognized in many ways that do not require much money 
including certificates of appreciation, special “employee of the month” park­
ing spaces, and vari­ous small gifts.
Organ­izations have been transformed over the past few years as they 
have moved away from command and control hierarchies to flatter more par­
ticipative structures. In a similar way, most employees in knowledge organ­
izations have moved away from ­doing repetitive tasks to working on jobs 
where they are required to exercise judgment and creativity. It is not sur­
prising that recently ­there have been many calls to reexamine the way man­
ag­ers motivate workers, especially ­those who are performing non-­routine 
tasks. For example, Daniel H. Pink in his book, Drive, contends that most of 
the methods used to motivate ­today’s worker are out-­of-­date. “Carrots and 
sticks are so last ­century,” says Pink.41 He believes that for 21st ­century work­
ers the biggest motivation is inherent satisfaction in the work itself. (How­
ever, this is not as new as it may sound—it is very similar to Hertzberg’s finding 
about hygiene ­factors and satisfiers discussed earlier in the chapter.) Pink 
argues that man­ag­ers need to implement new systems that focus on autonomy, 
mastery, and purpose. He states that for workers in creative jobs, rewards 
and punishments have a limiting effect. Instead Pink suggests that the secret 
to increase workplace per­for­mance is to permit workers to have the ability 
FIGURE 13.7. Ele­ments of Effective Goal Setting

Motivation in the Workplace  327
to direct their own lives, to become better at ­things that ­matter to them, and 
to do something meaningful for themselves and the world.42
Conclusion
Undoubtedly, new theories of motivation ­will continue to develop to 
accompany the changes occurring in ­today’s organ­izations. It is foolish to 
think that what would have motivated someone working on a 19th ­century 
assembly line would be equally effective in motivating a 21st ­century knowl­
edge worker. Sometime man­ag­ers feel overwhelmed by the number of options 
they have available to deal with employees. ­There is a vast body of research 
available on motivation; but ­there are common ele­ments under­lying much of 
it. Raymond Katzell and Donna Thompson have endeavored to summarize 
the research on motivation in the form of ­these seven imperatives:
1.	 Ensure that workers’ motives and values are appropriate for the 
jobs in which they are placed
2.	 Make jobs attractive to and consistent with workers’ motives and 
values
3.	 Define work goals that are clear, challenging, attractive, and 
attainable
4.	 Provide workers with the personal and material resources they 
require in order to succeed
5.	 Create a supportive social environment
6.	 Reinforce good per­for­mance
7.	 Harmonize all of ­these ele­ments into one consistent sociotechnical 
system.43
To carry out all of the seven imperatives is a daunting task, but one that 
man­ag­ers must attempt. Unfortunately, no one motivational style assures 
success. Instead man­ag­ers must develop individual approaches based on 
their own personality, managerial philosophy, and knowledge of their work­
ers. An effective man­ag­er aligns tasks with the worker’s reasons for work­
ing and offers inducements related to ­those reasons. This results in a system 
of inducements, rather than a single inducement for all workers. Such a sys­
tem should provide workers with what­ever inducements best motivate them; 
although some inducements may have to be negative, the majority should be 
positive.
To recap, a sound motivational system should draw from princi­ples based 
on motivation research, on the organ­ization’s own policies, and on the man­
ag­er’s philosophy of ­human needs. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs illustrates 
the range of needs, from basic life requirements to social, ego, and creative 
needs. Herzberg’s studies provide information about the need for recognition, 
achievement, advancement, and responsibility. McClelland’s work shows that 
each individual has unique learned needs that affect the way that person 
approaches work. Vroom’s research demonstrates how impor­tant it is to con­
sider each individual’s aspirations and to ­couple per­for­mance to reward. 
Skinner’s work makes evident the value of positive reinforcement for elicit­
ing desirable be­hav­ior. Locke’s goal-­setting theory shows how the setting of 
goals can help employees perform better.

328  Leading
Overall, orga­nizational policies should be structured to enable and 
encourage good work. High productivity reflects the quality of employee moti­
vation. Ideally, an organ­ization’s goals and objectives ­will motivate an employee 
to want to contribute. Certainly, this is the case in libraries. ­Great success 
in achieving goals creates a positive image of the organ­ization, which then 
makes the worker proud to be affiliated with the organ­ization and motivates 
him or her to work hard and promote its success.
Any plan for motivating employees depends on man­ag­ers. Man­ag­ers’ 
knowledge of employee needs and desires, the professional environment that 
fosters the capacity for work, the quality of training that capable employees 
receive, and the pride ­these employees have in their organ­ization establish 
the basis of the motivational system. The man­ag­er must then exercise sound 
judgment to make the system work
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Imagine that you are the supervisor of a 12-­person copy-­cataloging department 
in a very large public library. Sidney Brown, one of your employees, has just 
had his position reclassified, resulting in more pay. ­Because Sidney has long been 
working at a higher level than his pres­ent job classification, you are delighted 
that this reclassification, which you have been trying to achieve for months, 
has fi­nally been approved. However, when word of the reclassification becomes 
public, you are surprised to learn that several of Sidney’s coworkers are very 
unhappy. Several complain to you that they have the same level of responsibil­
ity in their work that Sidney does, but have not been promoted. They think you 
have treated them unfairly by pushing to have Sidney’s position reclassified.
What would you do in a case like this? Is ­there any way for a man­ag­er to 
achieve “perfect” equity in rewarding employees?
2.	The search committee at Lettimore State University library has been working 
hard. The committee has reviewed a number of candidates for the position of 
library director and brought four finalists to campus for in-­person interviews. 
­After a ­great deal of deliberation, the committee has narrowed the choice down 
to two candidates. Both have outstanding credentials and both are serving as 
associate directors at academic libraries of a comparable size to the one at Let­
timore. The two candidates, however, have very dif­fer­ent personalities. Candidate 
A is very task-­oriented, intense, and businesslike. He is said to be a perfection­
ist who continually pushes his staff to a higher standard. His tone is rather 
combative and his demeanor serious. Candidate B is also known for his high 
expectations of his staff but he is more approachable and casual. He smiles 
frequently, has a welcoming demeanor, and ­people tend to relax when they are 
around him.
If you ­were the Provost in charge of making the final decision about ­whether 
to hire Candidate A or Candidate B, which would you choose and why? How 
much does a man­ag­er’s personality relate to success on the job?
3.	When Kathy O’Connell was promoted to head of reference she was thrilled. She 
had worked in the Smithfield Public Library for 10 years. She considered it her 
home away from home and her coworkers as an extension of her own ­family. 
Kathy was always the person in the library who or­ga­nized the potluck dinners, 
the holiday parties, and the cele­brations for birthdays. She enjoyed making her 
fellow workers happy and was always willing to help with any prob­lems. She was 

Motivation in the Workplace  329
also very skilled at the reference desk and was excellent working with patrons 
and materials. She thought becoming head of reference would be easy. She knew 
the ­people and she knew the procedures. A few months ­after she assumed the 
position, the library director asked her why she ­hadn’t begun a disciplinary pro­
cess with Molly Nolan, one of the reference clerical staff who had been getting 
into work late on a fairly regular basis. Some of the other reference staff had 
complained to the director that Kathy was ignoring the prob­lem of Molly’s fre­
quent tardiness, and so the director told Kathy she expected her to address the 
prob­lem immediately. Kathy reluctantly scheduled an appointment to talk with 
Molly on the next day. She dreaded the prospect of having to discipline Molly. 
She had worked with her for years and ­didn’t want to hurt her feelings. However, 
she knew if she ­didn’t discipline Molly, the director would be displeased. That 
night Kathy slept very ­little; she was very worried about what tomorrow would 
bring. When she awoke in the morning, she was covered with a rash and felt 
sick to her stomach. She had to call in and cancel the appointment she had 
with Molly.
Using McClelland’s Theory, discuss ­whether you think Kathy made a good 
choice in accepting the position of head of reference? What would you advise her 
to do now?
4.	Especially in times of tight bud­gets, many library man­ag­ers are looking for 
nonmonetary ways to reward employees. One of the best is completely ­free: 
always say “thank you” when staff put in extra effort on the job. Many libraries 
have instituted employee recognition programs to reward outstanding employ­
ees. John Lubans divides ­these into three categories:
•	 Individual and tangible. ­These include rewards such as cash bonuses, 
parking places, paid days off, and vari­ous types of small gifts.
•	 Individual and intangible. ­These rewards include ­things such as a men­
tion in library newsletter or a certificate of appreciation.
•	 Organization-­wide. The rewards are for all employees and include rewards 
such as staff picnics or dinners where longevity is recognized.44
Try thinking of some other nonmonetary ways to thank employees. Which 
types of nonmonetary awards do you think work best in motivating employees?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Joan Giesecke, the former dean of libraries at the University of Nebraska-­Lincoln, 
posed the following questions: “Managing professionals can pres­ent a true 
dilemma for ­today’s man­ag­ers. How do you manage, in the traditional sense, 
professionals or other man­ag­ers who expect to have the authority and freedom 
to do their jobs? They are trained as experts in their fields. Why would they 
want you to manage them? Why would you think you could or should manage 
them?”45
What are some of the challenges faced by ­today’s library man­ag­ers? How 
can man­ag­ers rise to the challenge posed by Giesecke?

2.	“Some man­ag­ers always treat their subordinates in a way that leads to superior 
per­for­mance. But most man­ag­ers . . . ​unintentionally treat their subordinates 
in a way that leads to lower per­for­mance than they are capable of achieving. 
The way man­ag­ers treat their subordinates is subtly influenced by what they 
expect of them. If man­ag­ers’ expectations are high, productivity is likely to be 
excellent. If their expectations are low, productivity is likely to be poor. It is as 
though ­there ­were a law that caused a subordinate’s per­for­mance to rise or fall 
to meet his man­ag­er’s expectations.”46
Livingston wrote about the impact of a man­ag­er’s self-­fulfilling prophecy 
on employee per­for­mance. Why do you think that the per­for­mance of subordi­
nates is affected by the way their supervisors treat them? Would you work hard 
if your boss seemed to think that you ­were incapable of ­doing a good job?
3.	According to Frederick Herzberg, “If I kick my dog (from the front or the back), 
he ­will move. And when I want him to move again, what must I do? I must kick 
him again. Similarly, I can charge a person’s battery, and then recharge it, and 
recharge it again. But it is only when one has a generator of one’s own that we 
can talk about motivation. One then needs no outside stimulation. One wants 
to do it.”47
How can man­ag­ers move away from the old system of sticks and carrots as 
motivators? How can they help employees become self-­motivated?
4.	The work done by student employees is very impor­tant, especially in academic 
libraries and some public libraries. Library man­ag­ers often want to retain ­these 
employees for more than one semester ­because an experienced student worker 
performs better than a newly hired one. Lorelei Sterling points out that aca­
demic library jobs are often attractive to students ­because they are on campus 
and often offer flexible schedules. In addition, students are motivated by a vari­
ety of ­factors including food, contests, and celebratory events, but not surpris­
ingly, student workers, like all workers, seem to be motivated by allowing them 
to work autonomously as much as pos­si­ble, especially in terms of developing 
procedures for ­doing their jobs.48
Why does autonomy motivate workers? Can you think of ways that student 
library jobs could be redesigned to allow the students to work more autono­
mously? If you ­were working in a library job as a student, which would motivate 
you more: autonomy or some of the other ­factors mentioned such as food and 
contests?

Orga­nizational Leadership
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the importance of leadership in all types and all levels of 
organ­izations
•	 Know the major differences between leaders and man­ag­ers
•	 Be familiar with the basic ele­ments of the most impor­tant theories of leadership
•	 Understand what toxic leadership is and how organ­izations can avoid this type 
of leader
•	 Be able to discuss why the notion of the “heroic” leader has lost ­favor in con­
temporary organ­izations
Throughout history, ­people have sought to identify what makes a good leader. 
They sought the answers to many questions: Are the same leadership skills 
appropriate in all organ­izations? What is the difference between a man­ag­er 
and a leader? How do good leaders act? How do they invest their time? How 
can a good match between an individual leader and the organ­ization she or 
he is leading be assured? Can leadership be taught?
­People have been talking about leadership since the time of Plato, but 
­there is still ­little agreement about many of the aspects of the topic.1 ­There 
is, however, widespread agreement that ­there is a lack of effective leadership 
in many modern organ­izations. A recent survey of executives from across the 
world identified the “need for leaders at all levels” as the highest priority 
issue, with 89 ­percent rating it “very impor­tant” or “impor­tant.”2 Leading is 
undoubtedly one of the most impor­tant functions carried out by man­ag­ers. 

334  Leading
In this chapter, the topic of leadership ­will be examined from a managerial 
perspective with a specific focus on leaders within organ­izations. The chap­
ter ­will include an examination of what leadership is, what leaders do, and 
the vari­ous theories of leadership that have been developed by scholars in the 
past and at pres­ent. The chapter ends with suggestions about the best ways 
to prepare employees to assume leadership roles both in their pres­ent jobs 
and in ­those they ­will hold in the ­future.
Management on the Job: Susan Nutter, North Carolina 
State University Library
Susan Nutter, vice provost and director of libraries at North Carolina State University 
in Raleigh, is recognized as an innovative and visionary leader in academic librarianship. 
When Nutter was appointed as NCSU library director in 1987, the library was described 
by one se­nior professor as an “embarrassment” to the university. ­Under Nutter’s leader­
ship the NCSU libraries have been transformed and become not only a model for the 
NCSU campus but for the entire profession. Nutter’s leadership ability has been recog­
nized widely: she was named Library Journal’s Librarian of the Year in 2005 and ACRL 
Academic/Research Librarian of the Year in 2016. The NCSU Libraries also received 
the first ACRL Excellence in Academic Libraries Award in the university library cate­
gory in 2000.
During her over 30 years at NCSU, Nutter has served as “a visionary, outwardly 
focused leader committed to demonstrating and heightening the value of the library in 
higher education.” She has raised the profile of the library on campus by integrating 
“innovative library ser­vices into the fabric of the university’s academic and research 
agendas.”3 One of the most telling indications of her influence on campus occurred years 
ago when NCSU was facing state bud­get cutbacks. During that year, the NCSU faculty 
members voted to forgo their personal salary increases and have that money given to 
support the library instead.4
In Nutter’s opinion, the most impor­tant ­factor in building a library is its staff, 
which she categorizes as the library’s “primary asset.” At NCSU, the library invests in 
its staff. That means rigorous searches, providing moving and relocation allowances, and 
reallocating funding to pay higher salaries. Nutter seeks staff members who are self-­
motivated, have passion, possess good interpersonal skills, and who are willing to tell the 
truth, argue, fight it out, and then “defend decisions together when the decisions have 
been made.” Then she relies on that staff. She is proud that most of the library decision 
making comes from them. “I ­don’t have to delegate it,” she says. “I ­don’t even have to worry 
about it. They are good.”5 Nutter is known for her keen eye for talent and her devotion 
to developing new leaders for the library profession. In 1999, she inaugurated the NCSU 
Fellows program, which brings a cadre of recent library and information science (LIS) 
gradu­ates to the NCSU library for two-­year appointments. Many of the former Fellows 
have now risen to leadership positions in the library profession.
Her latest endeavor has been the new Hunt Library, which since its opening in 2013 
has provided innovative ser­vices, technologies, and use of space in a building that ­doesn’t 
look like a library at all, but is “all glass and metal facades, sweeping around to create 
a massive asymmetrical polygon.”6 This library has won numerous awards for sustain­
ability, innovation, and architecture, and serves as a reflection of Nutter’s longstanding 
conviction that “it is the priorities and practices of the university that must shape the 
spaces and offerings of the library.”7
Susan Nutter has demonstrated successful and innovative leadership skills; as a 
result, she has been a “major ­factor in changing the public perception of the modern

What Is Leadership?
Leadership is impor­tant in all organ­izations, but leadership is a topic 
that is often perplexing, sparking numerous debates about what leadership 
is and what leaders actually do. An abundance of lit­er­a­ture has been writ­
ten on the topic. Writers in vari­ous fields have churned out countless books 
and articles. A quick search of Amazon (in April 2017) for books on leader­
ship produced 191,560 titles. The amount of advice available on successful 
leadership is overwhelming.
The definitions of the term “leadership” are not much clearer. James 
McGregor Burns, a highly respected leadership expert, once wrote, “Lead­
ership is one of the most observed and least understood phenomena on earth.”9 
­Because the term “leadership” is used in many dif­fer­ent contexts, it defies 
easy analy­sis. The definitions found in books and articles on leadership often 
conflict, but most agree that leadership is the ability to inspire confidence and 
support among followers, thereby enabling a group to reach its goals. Regard­
less of the exact definition, the concepts of “influence,” “vision,” “mission,” 
and “goals” almost always play a part. An effective leader influences ­others to 
move in a desired direction and, thus, determines the extent to which the 
organ­ization and ­those who work ­there reach their goals. Leadership trans­
forms orga­nizational potential into real­ity.
Although the definitions of leadership vary widely, most definitions of 
orga­nizational leadership focus upon a leader’s ability to influence ­others 
­towards achieving the organ­ization’s goals. In organ­izations, leadership has 
nothing to do with titles, se­niority, or place in the hierarchy but with influ­
ence and the ability to get ­things done. Kruse has captured this concept well 
in his definition of leadership as a “pro­cess of social influence, which maxi­
mizes the efforts of ­others, ­towards the achievement of a goal.”10
Man­ag­ers and Leaders
­Because all organ­izations require leadership, the terms man­ag­er and 
leader are closely related, but they are not the same. Since leading is one of 
the key managerial functions, ideally all man­ag­ers would be leaders but some 
are not. A helpful distinction between the two identifies where the power to 
lead comes from; man­ag­ers derive it from their positions, while leaders often 
command it based on their personal attributes. Leaders draw on an ability 
to influence ­others that does not have to be associated with a specific posi­
tion. For instance, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the most compelling and effec­
tive civil rights leader in the United States during the 20th ­century, was a 
visionary leader who had a dream that became the dream of many ­others. 
His strong beliefs in civil rights and nonviolence inspired millions to work 
for a more equitable society. Dr. King was a leader whose power to influence 
and inspire ­others derived not from a position he held but from who he 
was. In addition to where they draw their power to influence, ­there are other 
library.”8 What has she done that you find most impressive? Read the rest of this chap­
ter, then reread this section and discuss which of the theories of leadership seem to 
describe Susan Nutter best.

Talk About It
Stephen Covey states, “Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; 
leadership determines ­whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.”11 Man­ag­
ers and leaders are dif­fer­ent. Do you think that an effective man­ag­er might be a poor 
leader? How could an effective leader be a poor man­ag­er? If you had a choice, would you 
rather work for the effective manager/poor leader boss or the effective leader/poor man­
ag­er boss? What would be the advantages of each type?
distinctions commonly made between man­ag­ers and leaders. Some of ­these 
differences may be seen in figure 14.1.
In organ­izations, the roles of man­ag­ers and leaders often overlap. In all 
organ­izations, it is best when man­ag­ers are also leaders, ­because experience 
shows that what sets successful organ­izations apart from less successful ones 
is dynamic and effective leadership. For this reason, both man­ag­ers and 
organ­ization theorists have long explored ways to encourage and develop 
leadership.
FIGURE 14.1. Some Differences between Man­ag­ers and Leaders
Leadership Qualities
No one model provides all the qualities of a successful leader, in part 
­because leaders differ in vari­ous cultures and historical periods. Despite this 

Orga­nizational Leadership  337
variability, though, most experts agree that a leader must fulfill two major 
roles. First, a leader must exercise power. Second, the leader must—­through 
actions, appearance, and articulated values—­pres­ent a vision that ­others 
­will want to bring to fruition.12
Exercising Power
The first leadership role, exercising power, resembles in many ways the 
role of a good man­ag­er. Good leaders exercise power wisely and efficiently, 
in a temperate and fair manner. They must set objectives and see that they 
are carried out, and must make good decisions.
Presenting a Vision
The aspect of leadership that is called “vision” involves presenting an 
image or a strategy that ­others ­will want to adopt. ­Because this is in itself a 
difficult undertaking, many leaders often appear to lack vision. A leader must 
pres­ent a vision so that an organ­ization does not drift aimlessly, but that is 
not enough. The followers must accept the leader’s vision and adopt it as their 
own; they must be energized so that they can bring the vision to life.13 When 
an effective leader is at the helm, the goals of the leader and the followers 
are enmeshed and congruent.
When discussing leadership, ­people sometimes forget the importance of 
followers. A leader cannot be a leader without followers. Garry ­Wills has 
stated that three ele­ments are necessary for effective leadership: leaders, fol­
lowers, and a shared goal. He defines a leader as “one who mobilizes ­others 
­towards a goal shared by leaders and followers.”14
One common reason that leaders fail is that they have not been able to 
create a vision that ­others ­will share. Sometimes recently hired top-­level 
man­ag­ers bring with them a predetermined vision that they want to see ful­
filled, and they begin to institute major changes before their vision has been 
accepted by the other employees. ­These individuals usually fail ­because they 
did not sell the vision to ­those who had to implement it.
Getting ­others to buy into the vision may be a leader’s hardest task. As 
the ­great Chinese phi­los­o­pher, Lao-­Tzu, said over 2,500 years ago, the “leader 
is best when ­people barely know he exists . . . ​When his work is done, his aim 
fulfilled, they ­will say, we did this ourselves.”15 The leader’s vision has been 
so thoroughly absorbed by the followers that they believe it was theirs all 
along.
Practice Your Skills
For the third time in five years the library at Longleaf College is searching for a new 
director. Edward Ravenal served as director of the library for 27 years ­until his retire­
ment five years ago. Since then, ­there has been no consistency in leadership at the Long­
leaf College library. Each search pro­cess brought in a promising replacement, but once 
the new director began work, library employees began to complain about the changes 
being made and the new director’s management style. The first new director lasted two 
years, and then accepted another position. His replacement came in with many innovative 

338  Leading
Toxic Leadership
Although most research on leadership focuses on good leaders, many of 
the traits that help a person become a leader can be used ­either construc­
tively or destructively. Some bad leaders are merely in­effec­tive or incompe­
tent, but ­others go beyond incompetence and practice destructive leadership. 
­These individuals often have sought leadership roles not for the sake of bet­
tering an organ­ization but for the sake of achieving their own objectives, such 
as personal power. Kellerman characterizes ­these individuals as “toxic” 
leaders—­those who are destructive to their employees, their organ­izations, 
and even to their nations.16 For example, Adolf Hitler and Enron’s Jeffrey 
Skilling ­were toxic leaders, although in very dif­fer­ent ways. Kellerman points 
out that managerial lit­er­a­ture often tries to accentuate the positive by dis­
cussing only good leadership and ignoring bad leadership. This approach, she 
argues, is analogous to a medical school that claimed to teach health while 
ignoring disease.17
Lipman-­Blumen has also described the harm that toxic leaders create. 
She defines toxic leaders as individuals who, by virtue of their destructive 
be­hav­iors and their dysfunctional personal characteristics, inflict serious and 
enduring harm on their followers and their organ­izations.18 Padilla et al. 
state that that for toxic leaders to thrive a “toxic triangle” (see figure 14.2) 
consisting of the interactions of three ­factors: destructive leaders, suscepti­
ble followers, and conducive environments must exist.19
Studies have shown that toxic leaders have some or all of ­these follow­
ing characteristics:
•	 Lack of integrity, such as ­those who mislead followers through delib­
erate lies
•	 Insatiable ambition that ­causes them to put their own power and 
glory above their followers’ well-­being
•	 Enormous egos that blind them to the shortcomings of their own 
character
•	 Arrogance that prevents acknowledging their ­mistakes and leads 
them to blame ­others
•	 Threats or punishments for ­those who fail to comply with ­orders or 
question actions
•	 Amorality that results in an inability to tell right from wrong
ideas for change but was forced to retire ­after 18 months due to ill health brought on by 
stress, and an interim director is now in charge of the library. As the search committee 
begins the search for yet another library director, it is trying to understand what has 
gone wrong with the previous searches.
Imagine that you have been hired as a con­sul­tant by Longleaf to help with this lat­
est search. What advice might you give about why the previous searches have not been 
successful? What do you think might have caused the newly hired directors to fail? Is 
the fault in the organ­ization or in the individuals who ­were selected? Why do you think 
it is it so hard to find successful leaders?

Orga­nizational Leadership  339
•	 Disregard for the cost of their actions to ­others and to themselves
•	 Cowardice that leads to an avoidance of difficult choices
•	 Toxic leaders play to the basest fears and needs of the followers.20
Destructive or toxic leaders are able to exist ­because they have follow­
ers who remain loyal, enabling them to keep their leadership positions. Toxic 
leaders are typically skillful in their ability to manipulate ­others to further 
their own advancement. In seeking to explain the rise of toxic leaders, 
Lipman-­Blumen posits that ­there has and still is a tendency among many 
­people to seek authoritative, even dominating characteristics in leaders 
­because of their own personal psychosocial needs.
However, employees in the workplace are often unwilling followers. If 
they work for a “toxic” supervisor, they do not have a ­great deal of recourse 
if they do not choose to follow. They fear losing their jobs or being subject to 
disciplinary procedures if they resist. Anyone who has ever worked for a toxic 
man­ag­er knows how managerial be­hav­iors such as bullying, rudeness, and 
general incivility to employees can poison a workplace. However, ­these man­
ag­ers often keep their jobs ­because they show another side of their personal­
ity to their supervisors. It is impor­tant for upper level man­ag­ers to take steps 
to identify and contain any toxic man­ag­ers within an organ­ization. Toxic 
leadership on all levels needs to be eradicated.

Talk About It
­People have dif­fer­ent ideas about which characteristics correlate with leadership. List 
five characteristics that you think most leaders possess, and then have a colleague or 
classmate make the same list. How many of the traits ­were on both lists?
Early Approaches to the Study of Leadership
By influencing ­others to move in a desired direction, an effective leader 
helps both the organ­ization and its individual employees to reach their goals. 
Unfortunately, effective leadership often seems to be in short supply. ­These 
­factors have drawn man­ag­ers and organ­ization theorists to the question of 
how to encourage and develop leadership. To investigate leadership, many 
studies have examined the habits of high-­level man­ag­ers, in the belief that 
man­ag­ers and leaders share many responsibilities and attributes. Some of 
the most impor­tant studies are discussed below.
Trait Approach to the Study of Leadership
Prior to World War II, most of the research on the subject of leadership 
sought to identify the personal traits associated with leaders. Such studies 
­were based on the premise that leaders are born, not made, and only ­people 
born with ­these par­tic­u­lar traits could be leaders. Once the traits ­were identi­
fied, investigators assumed, leadership se­lection would be a ­matter of finding 
­people with ­these special physical, intellectual, and personality characteris­
tics, and training them for leadership simply by developing ­those traits.
Numerous studies identified traits that ­were said to be associated with 
leadership, such as energy, aggressiveness, per­sis­tence, initiative, appearance, 
and height.22 However, summaries of this research demonstrate one main 
shortcoming: almost ­every study identified a dif­fer­ent set of traits. In one sum­
mary of more than 100 studies, overlap was so rare that only 5 ­percent of the 
traits appeared in four or more studies.23 Eugene Jennings concluded, “Fifty 
years of study have failed to produce one personality trait or set of qualities 
that can be used to discriminate between leaders and non-­leaders.”24 Although 
certain traits such an intelligence and social participation are weakly asso­
ciated with leadership, ­these studies have shown that ­there is no such ­thing 
as a leader type. The skills, abilities, and personalities of successful leaders 
vary widely.
Talk About It
Ann Prentice, in her recent book, Leadership for the 21st ­Century, wrote, “It has been said 
that one can understand leadership better from the perspective of the follower rather 
than from the perspective of the leader.” Prentice says that a follower has the advantage 
of being able to observe the impact of the leader’s actions both on ­others within an organ­
ization and on ­those in the outside world.21
Why does a follower’s perspective provide a better framework for understanding 
leadership? If you ­were in leadership position, can you think of ways that you might be 
able to tap into the perspective of your followers?

Behavioral Approach to the Study of Leadership
­After trait studies fell out of ­favor in the 1950s, researchers took an 
interest in how leaders behave. No longer seeking a single configuration of 
leadership characteristics, investigators focused on leadership style and be­hav­
ior: what leaders do, what they emphasize, and how they relate to subordi­
nates. The three most impor­tant groups of behavioral studies are described 
below.
University of Iowa Studies
Beginning in the late 1930s, Kurt Lewin and his associates at the Uni­
versity of Iowa performed some of the first behavioral research. They used 
controlled experiments to examine three types of leadership styles:
•	 Autocratic: a leader who centralizes decisions and makes decisions 
autonomously
•	 Demo­cratic: a leader who allows subordinates to participate in deci­
sion making and delegates authority
•	 Laissez-­faire: a leader who gives the group complete freedom in 
decision making.25
­These experiments demonstrated that demo­cratic groups featured more 
originality, friendliness, and group cohesion, while laissez-­faire and auto­
cratic groups had more hostility, aggression, and discontent.26
Ohio State Studies
Other studies, conducted at Ohio State University in the late 1940s and 
early 1950s, identified two relatively in­de­pen­dent dimensions on which lead­
ers differ:
•	 Consideration refers to the extent to which a leader establishes 
mutual trust, friendship, re­spect, and warmth in his or her relation­
ship with subordinates.
•	 Initiating structure refers to the leader’s be­hav­ior in organ­izing, 
defining goals, emphasizing deadlines, and setting direction.
Consideration scores and initiating structure scores are in­de­pen­dent of 
each other. They do not represent opposite ends of a continuum, so a high score 
on one does not necessitate a low score on the other. A leader could be high 
in both consideration and initiating structure.27
University of Michigan Studies
At about the same time as the Ohio State studies, researchers at the Uni­
versity of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research began to conduct similar 
studies seeking to identify man­ag­ers’ supervisory styles and assess how ­those 
styles affected employee productivity.28 The researchers identified three types 
of man­ag­ers.
•	 Predominantly production-­centered man­ag­ers felt full respon­
sibility for getting the work done; departmental employees ­were to 
do only what the man­ag­er told them to do.
•	 Predominantly employee-­centered man­ag­ers recognized that the 
subordinates did the work and, therefore, should have a major voice 
in determining how it was done. Employee-­centered man­ag­ers thought 

342  Leading
that coordinating and maintaining a harmonious environment was 
the supervisor’s main responsibility.
•	 Man­ag­ers with mixed patterns emphasized both production and 
employees.
The results surprised the researchers. Although traditional manage­
ment thinking posited that permissive management led to employee laxity 
and carelessness, departments with employee-­centered man­ag­ers produced 
more than ­those with production-­centered man­ag­ers. The Michigan research­
ers drew a conclusion that was radical at the time: that many workers like 
their jobs, want to be productive, and would be productive if given a share of 
control over their jobs.
Styles of Leadership
Beginning in the 1960s, the next trend in the study of leadership was 
creating typologies with which to assess a leader’s style. The proponents of 
­these typologies derived their categories from the findings of the leadership 
behavioral studies. The style theorists believed that, of the many pos­si­ble 
leadership be­hav­iors, some ­were better than ­others. Among the most influen­
tial style theories are Rensis Likert’s Systems of Management, the Leadership 
Grid developed by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton, and the Transactional/
Transformational leadership model introduced by James McGregor Burns.
Likert’s Systems of Management
Rensis Likert, in his 1961 book New Patterns of Management, built on 
the behavioral research done at the University of Michigan Institute for 
Social Research.29 Likert’s model (illustrated in figure 14.3) describes four 
prevailing ways that man­ag­ers lead within organ­izations. ­These styles can 
be depicted on a continuum ranging from System 1 (exploitative-­authoritative) 
to System 4 (participative).
•	 System 1 management is exploitative-­authoritative. Within 
this system, management has no trust or confidence in subordinates. 
Man­ag­ers are, therefore, autocratic, with ­people at the top levels of 
the organ­ization making almost all decisions and issuing almost all 
communications. Subordinates are motivated by fear and punish­
ment and are subservient to management.
•	 System 2 management is benevolent-­authoritative. Manage­
ment expects employees to be loyal, compliant, and subservient, and 
adopts a paternalistic manner ­toward them. This system permits 
FIGURE 14.3. Likert’s Four Systems of Leadership

Orga­nizational Leadership  343
more upward communication than System 1 does, but top manage­
ment still maintains tight control.
•	 System 3 is consultative. Management trusts subordinates 
substantially but not totally. Top management still makes most of 
the major decisions while often soliciting ideas from subordinates. 
Although top management still primarily retains control, some aspects 
of the control pro­cess are delegated downward. Communication flows 
steadily upward and downward in the hierarchy.
•	 System 4 is participative. Management trust subordinates com­
pletely. Many of the decisions are made by the group, at all levels of 
the organ­ization. Communication flows up and down the hierarchy 
as well as horizontally among peers. Employees’ participation in the 
decision-­making pro­cess makes them strongly motivated to achieve 
the organ­ization’s goals and objectives.30
In short, System 1 is a highly structured and authoritarian system of 
management. System 4 is a participative system based on trust and team­
work. Systems 2 and 3 lie between the two extremes. Based on his observa­
tions, Likert concluded that the System 4 style of management is most 
effective. Although, in the short run, System 1 may improve an organ­ization’s 
productivity, eventually production ­will taper off. Meanwhile, System 1’s neg­
ative effects on employees more than offset any short-­term productivity gains. 
Man­ag­ers in ­today’s organ­izations who have ­adopted such innovations as 
self-­directed work teams are moving ­toward System 4. However, even though 
more organ­izations are using ele­ments of System 4, the true System 4 organ­
ization is still rare.
The Leadership Grid
The Leadership Grid (first termed the Management Grid) was developed 
by Robert R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton.31 This grid combines two primary 
concerns of the organ­ization: concern for production and concern for ­people. 
(As used ­here, the term production “covers what­ever it is that organ­izations 
engage ­people to accomplish.”32)
Man­ag­ers most concerned about productivity focus almost exclusively on 
the tasks that have to be accomplished; ­those who are concerned about ­people 
are more interested in the ­human relations aspects. ­These two concerns and 
the range of interactions between them are illustrated in figure 14.4. Con­
cern for production is represented on the horizontal axis, and concern for 
­people is represented on the vertical axis. Each rating is based on a nine-­point 
scale, with a 1 indicating minimum concern and a 9 maximum concern. A 
man­ag­er rated 9 on the horizontal axis has maximum concern for production; 
a man­ag­er rated 9 on the vertical axis has maximum concern for ­people.
Based on the grid, Blake and Mouton describe five leadership styles.
•	 A rating of 1,1 is considered impoverished leadership. The leader 
exerts minimal effort to accomplish the required work and is uncon­
cerned about employees. A man­ag­er with this rating, by essentially 
­doing nothing for ­either ­people or production, has abdicated leader­
ship responsibility.
•	 A rating of 1,9 is called “country club leadership.” The leader’s 
thoughtful attention to satisfying relationships leads to a comfortable, 
friendly atmosphere and work tempo. Production is of no concern.

344  Leading
•	 A rating of 9,1 is considered authoritarian leadership. Leaders 
with this rating are autocratic taskmasters. They arrange work con­
ditions so that ­human concerns interfere as ­little as pos­si­ble with 
operational efficiency.
•	 A rating of 5,5 is middle-­of-­the-­road leadership. Man­ag­ers 
achieve adequate orga­nizational per­for­mance by balancing produc­
tion needs with satisfactory worker morale. Such leaders deal mod­
erately well with both ­people and production, but do not stand out in 
­either capacity.
•	 Fi­nally, a rating of 9,9 is team leadership. Committed workers 
accomplish their tasks; their interdependence, resulting from a com­
mon stake in the organ­ization’s purpose, fosters relationships of 
trust and re­spect. According to this theory, leaders with a 9,9 rating 
stand out in their concern for both ­people and production.33
­Because the Leadership Grid helps identify and classify leadership 
styles, observers often use it as a theoretical framework for understanding 
be­hav­ior within organ­izations. The grid also helps man­ag­ers at any level to 
assess their degree of concern for ­people and for productivity.
FIGURE 14.4. The Leadership Grid

Orga­nizational Leadership  345
Transformational/Transactional Leadership
James McGregor Burns was the first person to pop­u­lar­ize the terms 
transactional and transformational as descriptions of leadership styles.34 
Transactional leaders perceive their job per­for­mance as a series of trans­
actions with subordinates, in which rewards are exchanged for ser­vices 
rendered or punishments for inadequate per­for­mance. By contrast, trans­
formational leaders persuade subordinates to transform their own self-­
interest into the interest of the larger group, thereby bringing out the best 
in their subordinates.
The distinction between ­these two types of leaders is reminiscent of the 
purported difference between man­ag­ers and leaders discussed earlier in the 
chapter. Transactional leaders are more like traditional man­ag­ers, ensuring 
that the job is done, whereas the transformational leader rises above merely 
getting the job accomplished to inspiring subordinates to achieve ­great ­things. 
Another researcher noted that transformational leaders work “to make their 
interactions with subordinates positive for every­one involved. More specifi­
cally, [they] encourage participation, share power and information, enhance 
other ­people’s self-­worth, and get ­others excited about their work.”35
It is now recognized that ­these two modes of leadership are not in oppo­
sition to each other.36 Instead, transformational leadership often builds upon 
transactional leadership. Of the two, transformational leadership usually 
improves an organ­ization more than transactional leadership, but like ­every 
other model of leadership, it cannot be the solution to ­every prob­lem.37 Analy­sis 
has shown that transformational leadership alone does not always produce 
better results. Other ­factors such as orga­nizational culture, structure, and 
employee receptiveness influence how effective a transformational leader 
can be.38
Situational or Contingency 
Models of Leadership
Likert’s Systems, the Leadership Grid, and the Transformation/Trans­
actional model all imply that one leadership style is preferred. However, most 
theorists have rejected the idea that ­there is one best way to lead, observing 
that earlier thinkers rarely identified consistent relationships between pat­
terns of leadership be­hav­ior and group per­for­mance. ­These contingency or 
situational theorists, therefore, argue that no single type of leader is ideal 
in all circumstances; instead, vari­ous leadership styles may be appropriate 
in vari­ous situations. Employee-­centered leadership may be best ­under some 
circumstances, and production-­centered leadership may be best ­under ­others. 
Contingency theorists believe the task of a leader is to use what­ever style is 
most appropriate for any given situation.
Practice Your Skills
Think of a leader or man­ag­er you know. Where would you put him or her on the Mana­
gerial Grid (figure 14.4)? Do you think that man­ag­er’s style is a good fit for the organ­
ization where she or he works?

346  Leading
Fiedler’s Leadership Contingency Model
One of the best-­known contingency theories, Fred Fiedler’s model, pos­
its that a leader can base assessments of any par­tic­u­lar situation on three 
variables:
•	 Leader-­member relations: the degree to which group members 
like and trust a leader and are therefore willing to follow him or her
•	 Task structure: the clarity and structure of all ele­ments of the 
tasks to be performed, and
•	 Power position: the amount of power and authority that is associ­
ated with the leader’s position.
Fiedler produced and studied eight combinations of ­these three variables. 
(See figure 14.5.) He then attempted to discern the most effective leadership 
style for his eight situations. Fiedler found that the most favorable situa­
tion for a leader would be good relations with followers, a highly structured 
task, and a strong power position; least favorable would be poor relations 
with followers, unstructured tasks, and a weak power position. His theory 
holds that the task-­oriented leader is most effective in more extreme circum­
stances. When a leader finds a situation most favorable or least favorable, the 
production-­oriented style is most effective. When conditions are moderate, 
­whether favorable or unfavorable, the ­human relations, or employee-­oriented, 
style works best.
Fiedler’s research helps man­ag­ers by improving their understanding of 
how the situational variables for leadership relate to one another. A leader’s 
FIGURE 14.5. Fiedler’s Contingency Model Relating Style of Leadership 
to Situational Variables

Orga­nizational Leadership  347
effectiveness depends as much on the orga­nizational variables as on the lead­
er’s own attributes.
Path-­Goal Theory of Leadership
Another contingency theory of leadership, the path-­goal theory, was 
originally developed by Robert House. It focuses on the situation and the 
leader’s be­hav­ior instead of the personality traits of the leader.39 Fiedler’s 
concept assumes that leaders cannot change their be­hav­ior, while in the path-­
goal model, leaders can adopt dif­fer­ent leadership goals depending on the 
situation.
According to the path-­goal theory, effective leaders clarify the path to 
help followers achieve work goals, and they ease the journey along the path by 
­handling any obstacles. House wrote that a leader’s role is to increase “per­
sonal pay-­offs to subordinates for work-­goal attainment and make the path to 
­these pay-­offs easier to travel by clarifying it, reducing road blocks and pit­
falls, and increasing the opportunities for personal satisfaction en route.”40 
This theory suggests that man­ag­ers have three ways to motivate workers: 
(1) by offering rewards for reaching per­for­mance goals, (2) by making the 
paths ­toward ­these goals clear, and (3) by removing obstacles to per­for­mance.
House identified four types of leadership be­hav­ior:
•	 Directive leadership: a leader gives specific advice to the group 
and establishes clear rules and structure.
•	 Supportive leadership: a leader considers the needs and well-­being 
of subordinates.
•	 Participative leadership: a leader shares information, power, and 
influence. Subordinates take part in the decision-­making.
•	 Achievement-­oriented leadership: a leader sets challenging goals 
and encourages high per­for­mance. Achievement-­oriented leaders 
show high confidence in subordinates and help group members learn 
to achieve high goals.
A leader may use any of ­these four be­hav­iors for any given situation. 
The two most impor­tant situational contingencies in this theory are: (1) the 
personal characteristics of the workers, such as their experience, ability, 
motivation, needs, and locus of control; and (2) the environmental ­factors, 
including the nature of the work to be done, the formal authority system, and 
the work group itself.
The leader must take into account both the environment and the char­
acteristics of the followers. For instance, a new employee in an uncertain envi­
ronment might need directive leadership, whereas an established employee 
performing a familiar task would be better off with supportive leadership. As 
can be seen in figure 14.6, dif­fer­ent situations call for dif­fer­ent types of leader­
ship be­hav­ior.
The path-­goal theory is somewhat complex, but it is one of the most 
respected theories of leadership ­today. Further research undertaken to vali­
date the theory’s conclusions has generally supported its under­lying logic.41 
It intuitively makes sense that an employee’s per­for­mance and satisfac­
tion are likely to be positively affected when a leader can adopt dif­fer­ent 
approaches to compensate for variations in the employee or the work setting.

Leadership in the 21st ­Century
What leadership style is most appropriate for the 21st ­century? Some 
experts believe we are entering a post-­heroic period of leadership, abandon­
ing the past notion that leaders must be viewed as heroes. James McGregor 
Burns wrote a ­great deal about heroic leadership, which he described as a 
relationship in which followers put ­great faith in the leaders’ ability to over­
come crises and prob­lems.42 Followers believe the leader has all the answers 
and, thus, obey his or her directives. Peter Senge described the heroic leader 
as follows: “Especially in the West, leaders are heroes—­great men (and occa­
sionally ­women) who rise to the fore in times of crises . . . ​At its heart, the 
traditional view of leadership is based on assumptions of ­people’s powerless­
ness, their lack of personal vision, and inability to master the forces of change, 
deficits which can be remedied only by a few ­great leaders.”43 This style of 
leadership consists of power­ful leaders and somewhat powerless followers.
More recently, ­there is a growing belief that forcing leaders to play the 
role of “hero” is detrimental not only to a leader but also to ­those who are 
being led. ­Because extraordinary pressures are placed on ­these heroic lead­
ers, many feel that they have to be perfect and therefore cannot acknowledge 
­mistakes or the negative effects of their actions. At the same time, this style 
of leadership renders followers overly dependent and disempowered. Thus, 
the heroic leadership style does not address the needs of ­today’s flatter, more 
participative organ­izations.
Since the mid-1990s, the new concept of “post-­heroic” leadership has 
emerged. This leadership mode stresses the importance of shared power.44 
One of its most impor­tant proponents is Jim Collins, who introduced the 
notion of “Level Five” leadership. (See figure 14.7.) Collins and a team of his 
FIGURE 14.6. Situations and Preferred Leader Be­hav­ior According to the 
Path-­Goal Theory

Orga­nizational Leadership  349
research associates formulated the concept ­after they studied 11 companies 
that made the leap from “good” to “­great.”45 The researchers found one com­
monality in all ­these highly successful companies: At the time of its transi­
tion from good to ­great, each com­pany was being run by a Level Five leader.
Collins defines a Level Five leader as an executive with a paradoxical 
blend of personal humility and professional ­will. Although Level Five lead­
ers are very ambitious, they focus their ego needs not on themselves but on 
their organ­izations. They are neither weak nor vacillating but combine their 
re­spect for ­people with a power­ful commitment to achieve results. Their lack 
of personal egotism combines with a strong ­will to do the right ­thing for the 
organ­ization at all costs. This type of leader, according to Collins, brings out 
the best in subordinates.
Within Collins’s Hierarchy of Leadership, lower-­level workers can con­
tribute and be successful, but the most accomplished leaders have reached 
the top level. This post-­heroic vision of leadership differs from past ideas but 
dovetails well with the pattern of distributed leadership ­adopted by many 
FIGURE 14.7. The Five Levels of Leadership

350  Leading
organ­izations nowadays. This leadership style requires “many of the attri­
butes that have always distinguished the best leaders—­intelligence, commit­
ment, energy, courage of conviction, integrity. But ­here’s the big difference: 
It expects ­those qualities of just about every­one in the organ­ization.”46
Deborah Ancona and a group of researchers from the Sloan School of 
Management at the Mas­sa­chu­setts Institute of Technology also advocate 
moving away from the myth of a leader as “the flawless person at the top who’s 
got it all figured out. In fact, the sooner leaders stop trying to be all ­things to 
all ­people, the better off their organ­izations ­will be. In ­today’s world, the exec­
utive’s job is no longer to command and control but to cultivate and coordinate 
the actions of ­others at all levels of the organ­ization.”47 ­These researchers 
praise the leaders who see themselves as “incomplete,” having both strengths 
and weaknesses and relying on ­others ­because they realize that leadership 
exists throughout the organ­ization. They also point out the heavy burdens 
carried by leaders who are trapped in the myth of being the person at the top 
without flaws. In their words, it is time to recognize that “the most talented 
leaders require the input and leadership of ­others, constructively solicited 
and creatively applied. It’s time to celebrate the incomplete—­that is, the 
­human—­leader.”48
As organ­izations become less hierarchical and more collaborative, it is 
becoming widely accepted that leadership has to be distributed throughout 
the organ­ization. No one “heroic” leader can possess all the skills and infor­
mation needed to make all the decisions. The transition from the trait and 
behavioral theories to more modern ones reflect the changes in both society 
and organ­izations; views about leadership have changed as organ­izations 
and the environments in which they function have also changed. Most of 
­today’s organ­izations and their leaders are attempting to cope with more cha­
otic and fluid environments and dif­fer­ent styles of leadership are called for 
than ­those that ­were needed in the past.
At pres­ent ­there is a ­great deal of interest in distributed and participa­
tive leadership.49 A 2009 study by Avolio, Walumba, and Weber summarizes 
several relatively new leadership models that appear to be effective in ­today’s 
workplace.50 The Au­then­tic leader has four distinct characteristics: Self 
Awareness (knowing your own strengths, weaknesses, values), Relational 
Transparency (being genuine and truthful in dealing with ­others), Balanced 
Pro­cessing (seeks ­others viewpoints and weighs evidence fairly), and Inter­
nalized Moral Perspective (being guided by internal moral princi­ples and a 
concern for ethics and fairness).51 Au­then­tic leadership is built upon a per­
son’s character not their style. Another new model of leadership that is being 
touted is Charismatic leadership. The Charismatic leader is closely related 
to the transformational leader described earlier. The Charismatic leader 
raises followers’ aspirations and motivates followers to work for the greater 
good of an organ­ization or society.52 Shared Leadership describes a dynamic, 
interactive pro­cess that “overlaps with relational and complexity leadership, 
and differs from more traditional, hierarchical, or vertical models of leader­
ship.”53 Shared leadership is a complex notion that involves maximizing the 
talents of all employees and giving them a chance to assume leadership posi­
tions in their areas of expertise. Avolio, Walumba, and Weber describe sev­
eral other models such as Complexity Leadership, Leader-­Member Exchange, 
and E-­Leadership, which involves leading ­people in virtual teams. It is evi­
dent that ­there is no uniform theory that can be used to explain leadership. 
Other new theories about leadership ­will continue to arise, both ­because of 
continued environmental change and ­because the topic continues to be of 
vital importance to man­ag­ers in libraries and elsewhere.

Talk About It
The members of the millennial generation, ­those individuals born between the late 1970s 
and about 2004, are beginning to assume leadership positions.56 Research about this 
generation has found that millennials are consistently described as collaborative. The 
members of this generation do not seem to be attracted to the money or recognition asso­
ciated with leadership positions, but want to be leaders so they can inspire ­others and 
make a difference. They view organ­izations much less hierarchically than previous 
generations. A recent survey of millennials found that almost half want to be leaders 
­because of a desire to empower ­others; only 10 ­percent care about legacy, and only 
5 ­percent would take a leadership position for the money. Concern about a lack of work-­life 
balance is the major reservation millennials have about accepting leadership positions.57
What kind of leaders do you think members of the Millennial Generation ­will be? 
­Will their characteristics be beneficial or harmful to organ­izations? Do you think that 
generational clashes are inevitable as Millennials begin to assume leadership positions 
in a multigenerational workforce?
Avolio, Walumba, and Weber state at the beginning of their review “Look­
ing back over the past 100 years, we cannot imagine a more opportune time 
for the field of leadership studies. Never before has so much attention been 
paid to leadership, and the fundamental question we must ask is, what do we 
know and what should we know about leaders and leadership?”54 Although 
the study of leadership has made pro­gress in removing some of the mysteries 
associated with the topic, ­there is no doubt that more research needs to be 
done in this area. Organ­izations of the ­future ­will continue to face changes 
and leaders ­will need to be increasingly able to work not in hierarchical but 
networked structures. The most recent research indicates that the chal­
lenges facing leaders ­today are beyond anyone’s individual capacity thus 
skills such as collaboration, flexibility, innovation, maintaining relationships, 
and working across bound­aries ­will be to be extremely useful for leaders in 
the ­future.55
The Leadership Challenge
As we have seen, theories on what makes a leader successful are plenti­
ful. None of them completely explains leadership, but taken together they do 
help illuminate many of the variables involved.
Man­ag­ers find it more difficult to succeed in leadership roles ­today than 
in the past, when ­people ­were far less likely to question a leader’s authority. 
A leader ­today must try to inspire confidence and trust in followers who may 
well feel some distrust of authority in general.
The analy­sis of leadership style is a complex topic, and much of the 
research thus far has been short-­term and scattered. Situational theories, 
such as Fiedler’s Contingency Model and House’s path-­goal theory seem to 
work best in dealing with real-­life situations. In stating ­there is no single 
“right” way to lead, situational theories force man­ag­ers to decide on the leader­
ship style that is most appropriate to the situation and the followers’ needs. 
However, this can be a challenge ­because ­these ­factors are often in flux. Mean­
while, if post-­heroic theorists are correct about 21st ­century orga­nizational 
needs, it behooves man­ag­ers to encourage and develop leadership through­
out their organ­izations.

352  Leading
Developing Leadership
Successful leaders quickly learn that no one can lead alone. By defini­
tion, leaders have followers, and rarely can they manage ­those followers just 
by issuing a stream of unilateral directives. Indeed, leadership almost always 
involves cooperation and collaboration.59 As Peter Senge wrote, “In the knowl­
edge era, we ­will fi­nally have to surrender the myth of leaders as isolated 
heroes commanding their organ­izations from on high. Leadership in the 
­future ­will be distributed among diverse individuals and teams who share 
responsibility for creating the organ­ization’s ­future.”60
In short, for con­temporary organ­izations to function effectively, leader­
ship has to exist throughout the organ­ization, ­because “interdependent teams 
at dif­fer­ent levels need leaders.”61 Therefore, man­ag­ers must nurture and 
develop leadership skills in many employees. Individuals such as the library 
director might play an ongoing leadership role while ­others assume leader­
ship responsibility for specific activities or proj­ects.
­Today most theorists believe that leadership is an acquired competency. 
Leadership may come more naturally to some than ­others, but leadership 
skills can be developed in the majority of ­people. Moreover, leadership com­
petence results from many ­factors, including chance. As the old saying goes, 
being in the right place at the right time often reveals a person’s leadership 
capabilities.
As society and institutions become more complex, more individuals must 
have the opportunity to learn leadership skills. Most modern organ­izations 
employ leaders at all levels of the hierarchy; to see only the person at the top 
as a leader is to adopt an artificially constrained view of leadership. Obvi­
ously, every­one cannot lead at all times; an organ­ization needs followers, too. 
Nevertheless, vari­ous ­people within an organ­ization can exercise leadership 
in dif­fer­ent ways and at dif­fer­ent times. As more and more employees at all 
levels participate in management, they also provide leadership within the 
organ­ization.
How can leaders be developed? What can be done to ensure that brand-­
new librarians entering the field are being prepared to enter the leadership 
pipeline? How can man­ag­ers enable library workers who aspire to more 
responsibility to move into leadership positions?
Talk About It
A recent overview of leadership included the following statement:
It’s no longer the time for the heroic leader—­the leader who walks in and takes 
up the space in the room. The job of ­today’s leader is to create space for other 
­people—­a space in which ­people can generate new and dif­fer­ent ideas; a space 
where seemingly disparate departments and ­people in the organ­ization come 
together and have a meaningful conversation; a space in which ­people can be 
more effective, more agile and more prepared to respond to complex challenges.58
What skills are needed to be able to create space for ­others? How do ­these skills 
differ from the skills needed by the heroic leader? Do you agree that ­today’s organ­izations 
need this new type of leader?

Orga­nizational Leadership  353
Practice Your Skills
Do you want to be a leader? Many ­people have ­little ambition to lead but may find that 
they are asked to serve in leadership positions in their organ­izations. This chapter has 
discussed the skills needed by good leaders. Imagine that you are able to design the best 
preparation to ready yourself to assume a leadership role. Think about your own attri­
butes. What do you think are your strengths? Your weaknesses? What type of preparation 
do you think would be most helpful in preparing you to assume a new, more responsible 
leadership role in your organ­ization?
Leadership development consists of three intertwined components: skills 
to be learned, basic aptitude, and the ­will to lead. Although many leadership 
skills can be taught, dif­fer­ent ­people ­will learn and apply them with varying 
rates of success. Knowing the array of pos­si­ble leadership be­hav­iors is impor­
tant as well. Most ­people can develop their aptitude for leadership, but ­there 
­will always be some who ­will not or cannot lead. Furthermore, ­those who have 
the aptitude and ­will to lead need not only to learn the skills of leadership 
but also to practice them.
Thus, like so much ­else, leadership development requires a mix of the­
ory and practice. It is not easy to transmit leadership skills, ­because true 
leadership cannot be taught in a course or learned in a leadership institu­
tion such as ­those sponsored by many library organ­izations.62 Understand­
ing the requirements of leadership provides a start, but that alone ­will not 
transform a person into a leader.
Many LIS programs teach courses in leadership. Such courses can 
impart research findings about leadership and the skills of leaders, but they 
rarely allow the participants to practice leadership within a real organ­
ization. Fortunately, however, LIS schools’ student organ­izations, community 
ser­vice proj­ects, and internship programs provide opportunities to practice 
and demonstrate leadership.
For most ­people, the chance to develop their leadership talents begins 
in the work setting. ­There are programs in place in numerous libraries to 
help new prac­ti­tion­ers. Many such programs set out to provide additional 
management training, but ­because of the close connection between manage­
ment and leadership in libraries, they end up delivering leadership training 
as a by-­product. Beginning leaders all learn by ­doing; ­people learning to 
manage or to lead ­will make ­mistakes, but that is one way of learning. Per­
haps the most impor­tant lesson failure teaches is that nobody is always right 
and every­one makes ­mistakes. Someone who has never made a ­mistake has 
never taken a risk or undertaken significant orga­nizational changes.
One of the best ways to learn about leadership is from other leaders. 
­People aspiring to leadership positions can learn a ­great deal simply by 
observing more experienced leaders. One quality seen in many accomplished 
leaders is the desire to mentor and pass along their leadership experience; 
many organ­izations, including libraries, have mentoring programs in place. 
Mentoring helps leaders at vari­ous ­career stages, ranging from beginners 
to ­those about to retire; in fact, it is very common for a leader to be both a 
mentor and a protégé at the same time.
As chapter 17 ­will discuss, teams are being used in many libraries to 
accomplish vari­ous missions. Often being a part of a team is one of the first 

354  Leading
opportunities for an entry-­level librarian to act as a leader. Other ways to 
gain leadership experience include chairing committees and working within 
professional organ­izations.
Success in leadership in ­these contexts often encourages a newcomer to 
work to achieve more. In fact, ­people who had never considered themselves 
leaders often find they have a knack for it and aim to practice leadership at 
an even higher level. To give prospective leaders a feel for the entire organ­
ization, some libraries have used cross training and job rotation as a form of 
leadership development. ­Others have placed lower-­level man­ag­ers in interim 
department head or associate director positions to let them get experience 
in a leadership position. ­Those inclined ­toward leadership often use such 
positions as springboards into permanent leadership roles.
Outside the workplace, a number of leadership institutes exist to help 
prospective leaders acquire the necessary skills for leadership. ­These insti­
tutes, sponsored by vari­ous library organ­izations, vary in nature but have 
some common characteristics. Usually the ­people participating have worked 
in the profession for several years and have been identified as having lead­
ership potential. Often the instruction takes place at weeklong events held 
in residential settings, usually mixing an academic introduction to leadership 
topics with exercises designed to help participants learn about themselves 
and their leadership potential. This type of leadership institute has been 
very popu­lar in librarianship and many other fields. Related to freestand­
ing leadership institutions are the leadership courses taught in schools of 
business or public administration that many librarians take as continuing 
education.
Diversity is discussed at greater length in the ­Human Resources sec­
tion of this book, but it must also be considered in the context of leadership. 
Librarianship, as a profession, is strengthened by having staff from diverse 
backgrounds, and it is just as impor­tant that leaders in the professions should 
be also be diverse. Librarians from underrepresented groups should have 
opportunities for mentoring and leadership training to prepare them for lead­
ership positions. Although the American Library Association and several 
other library associations have instituted special programs for underrepre­
sented groups, not many of ­these programs focus primarily on leadership.63
Although ­women have made ­great strides in assuming leadership posi­
tions within libraries, ­there are often subtle biases that work against ­women 
being chosen for top positions, even in a profession such as librarianship. In the 
same way that leadership training is beneficial to underrepresented groups, 
it also can help ­women advance into more se­nior leadership positions.64
All of ­these options help ­people learn skills for leadership; perhaps more 
impor­tant, they help ­people discover ­whether they ­really want to lead. ­People 
who know and follow their own convictions make the best leaders. Individu­
als who are considering leadership should always consider ­whether their 
skills and personal characteristics ­will allow them to be successful leaders 
in their institutions. For instance, they should assess their own fortitude. Are 
they willing to act on their princi­ples despite re­sis­tance and questioning?
Anyone who wants to learn leadership skills should be taught them, and 
librarians at all levels should be encouraged to reflect and determine ­whether 
leadership is a role that they want to play. Not all ­people ­will want to transi­
tion from an entry-­level library employee to a managerial position to a leader, 
but as library hierarchies become flatter and more decentralized, more and 
more leaders ­will be necessary. The diverse variety of leadership styles means 
individuals with their own par­tic­u­lar strengths can take dif­fer­ent routes to 

Orga­nizational Leadership  355
leadership. ­Today’s library man­ag­ers should be prepared to support and help 
their employees as they move ­toward providing leadership for the libraries 
of the ­future.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	Kellerman has developed a classification scheme for categorizing bad leaders 
with a typology ranging from merely incompetent to truly evil. Her classifica­
tion is summarized below:
•	 Incompetent: lacks the skill or the ­will to sustain leadership
•	 Rigid: remains stiff, unyielding, and unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new 
information, or changing times
•	 Intemperate: lacks self-­control
•	 Callous: acts uncaring or unkind; ignores or discounts the needs of the rest 
of the organ­ization, especially subordinates
•	 Corrupt: lies, cheats, or steals, putting self-­interest above the public interest
•	 Insular: disregards or minimizes the health and welfare of ­those outside 
their inner circle
•	 Evil: commits atrocities that inflict severe physical or psychological pain on 
­others.65
Can you think of ­people in leadership roles who fall into any of ­these cate­
gories? What happens in organ­izations if bad leadership is allowed to persist?
2.	For the past two years, you have worked for Ronald. If ­there is anything that is 
guaranteed to put Ronald in an unpleasant mood it is when he senses, rightly 
or wrongly, that one of his employees is about to make a suggestion or a request 
of some sort. No ­matter how ­gently worded and tactfully presented, a suggestion 
is interpreted as a criticism and a request as a complaint. Ronald is so touchy 
and quick-­tempered that all of his direct reports take an im­mense amount of 
trou­ble to make themselves agreeable. In discussions with him (which they sel­
dom initiate) all of his subordinates always proceeded with caution in order to 
avoid giving the impression that they are finding fault with him or any of his 
procedures or decisions. It is easy to tell when he is about to explode. A hard and 
unyielding look comes into his eyes, the lines of his mouth become firm and 
determined, the veins of his ­temples stand out, and his face flushes an angry red. 
Then he starts screaming and cursing. All his employees know that if you chal­
lenge Ronald, you do so at your own peril.
You have just discovered a serious error in a new office procedure that was 
instituted by Ronald last week in an attempt to increase efficiency. However, if 
the ­mistake in this procedure is not corrected, it ­will cause repercussions 
down the line and your ­whole department ­will be held accountable for the results. 
What would you do? If you decide to confront Ronald, how ­will you do it? Do 
employees have any recourse when they have a boss such as Ronald?
3.	You are still Ronald’s employee (sorry, I ­can’t give you a better boss right now). 
Imagine that you have deci­ded to talk to Ronald about the flaws in the new pro­
cedure he implemented. Find a classmate or colleague and role-­play the situation. 

356  Leading
First assume one role and then switch roles. How did it feel to confront Ronald? 
How did it feel to play the role of Ronald?
4.	 In 1923, H. Gordon Selfridge, founder of one of the largest department stores in 
London, said this about the differences between man­ag­ers (bosses) and leaders:
•	 The boss drives ­people; the leader coaches them.
•	 The boss depends on authority; the leader on good ­will.
•	 The boss inspires fear; the leader inspires enthusiasm.
•	 The boss says I; the leader says WE.
•	 The boss fixes the blame for the breakdown; the leader fixes the breakdown.
•	 The boss says, GO; the leader says, Let’s GO!66
Do you agree with Selfridge’s almost 100-­year-­old distinctions between 
man­ag­ers and leaders? Are ­there any you would change or add?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus, two well-­known scholars of leadership, once 
wrote, “Man­ag­ers are ­people who do ­things right and leaders are ­people who 
do the right ­thing.”67 What is the difference between ­doing ­things right and ­doing 
the right ­thing? Do you agree that man­ag­ers do ­things right and leaders do the 
right ­thing? Do you know any leaders who do ­things right and also do the right 
­thing?
2.	Discuss some of the changes in society and organ­izations that have led to the 
demise of the myth of the leader as an isolated hero in complete control of an 
organ­ization. What are the advantages of shared leadership to both leaders 
and organ­izations? Do you agree or disagree with Jim Collins that humility is 
an impor­tant trait in a leader?
3.	According to Nigel Nicolson, leaders come to power through both internal and 
external se­lection. He writes:
The internal is self-­selection, the force that induces some to seek and 
­others to avoid leadership. Even when one is handed a leadership 
position on a plate, one’s inner self has to acquiesce, especially around 
three attributes. Are you ready to take on the risks and responsibility 
(drive)? Do you believe you have the skills to take on the challenge and 
succeed (ability)? Can you withstand the demands on your energies 
(constitution)? Many ­people have succumbed to the lure of the rewards or 
the encouragement of ­others and have become bad leaders, when they 
would have done better to heed their inner doubts.68
What attributes allow a person to become a good leader? Do you agree with 
Nicolson that ­people should forego leadership roles if they have inner doubts?

4.	Situational models of leadership posit that dif­fer­ent situations call for dif­fer­ent 
types of leaders. The experiences of Winston Churchill provide an in­ter­est­ing 
example of this idea. Although Churchill is usually ranked among the greatest 
leaders of modern times, it is sometimes forgotten that his leadership skills ­were 
not always valued. Before World War II, Churchill and his opinions ­were mar­
ginalized and rejected by his colleagues. With the start of the war, his oratori­
cal skills and decisiveness ­were exploited to ­great effect and he was regarded 
as a heroic leader. Then, in 1945, not long ­after the war ended, Churchill and 
his party ­were defeated ­because he was not considered to be the best choice to 
lead Britain during peacetime.69
The dif­fer­ent reactions to Churchill’s leadership style illustrate that lead­
ership must be matched to a specific set of circumstances; it is not a phenome­
non that exists in­de­pen­dent of its social context. Why do you think that preferred 
styles of leadership vary over time and circumstance?

Professional Ethics
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand what is meant by ethical be­hav­ior and its importance in ­today’s 
organ­izations
•	 Be familiar with the most common ethical violations found in libraries
•	 Be able to discuss three impor­tant tools that are helpful in analyzing ethical 
dilemmas
•	 Know three normative frameworks that can be used for making ethical decisions
•	 Be able to identify some conflicts of interest that may occur in an LIS workplace
•	 Recognize the importance of man­ag­ers in influencing an organ­ization’s ethical 
culture
Ethics is an impor­tant ele­ment in the management of all types of organ­
izations. Man­ag­ers ­will encounter many situations in the course of their work 
where they have to determine the right or ethical way to ­handle a problematic 
situation. In the past, many administrators in organ­izations just assumed 
that all man­ag­ers and employees would behave ethically; however, that 
assumption has been severely tested over the past few de­cades. Now, it often 
seems that a major new ethical scandal comes along ­every few months. From 
Enron in the early 2000s to Wells Fargo in 2016, ­these recurring scandals 
have caused ­people to lose faith in the integrity of the corporate world. In 
addition, distrust of be­hav­ior in the public sector is also growing.

Management in Practice: Delray Beach 
Public Library
The American Library Association (ALA)’s Code of Ethics states, “We protect each 
library user’s right to privacy and confidentiality with re­spect to information sought 
or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.”2 ­After the 9/11 
attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a reference librarian at the Delray 
Beach Public Library in Florida recognized some of the photo­graphs published in the 
Miami Herald of the suspected hijackers. She realized that three of the suspects had 
used the computers in the Delray Beach library and immediately called the police. ­After 
her telephone call, the police in Delray Beach then notified FBI agents who obtained a 
court order and seized the two computers the suspects ­were thought to have used in 
an attempt to retrieve the e-­mail the hijackers had sent and received.
The librarian said that although she was aware of the ALA Code of Ethics she did 
not regret calling in the police and reporting what she had seen. “­People ­were murdered,” 
she said, “and ­people have a right to know that terrorists ­were ­here in our library using 
our public facilities.”3 However, her decision was a topic of considerable debate in the 
library profession with many librarians seeing a definite conflict between the commit­
ment of librarians to keep patron information confidential and the desire of a citizen to 
report persons considered dangerous to national security.
Most librarians would find it very difficult to have to choose between ­either protect­
ing patron confidentiality or violating that confidentiality by notifying law enforcement 
officers in a case like this one. Luckily, although librarians frequently have to make 
ethical judgements, they rarely have to make such a difficult choice as the one that con­
fronted this librarian. If you faced a similar situation what would you do?
Many citizens now believe that politicians and government officials use 
their power in unethical ways. For example, in a recent Pew Research Cen­
ter poll, just 19 ­percent of the respondents said they can trust the federal 
government in Washington to do what is right almost always or most of the 
time. In contrast, in an earlier version of the poll done in 1958, 73 ­percent of 
Americans expressed trust in their government.1 Man­ag­ers, not only in the 
for-­profit sector but in non-­profits such as libraries, are increasingly interested 
in how to maintain trust in their organ­izations. This chapter ­will pres­ent an 
introduction to the topic of ethics, focusing primarily on ethics in the work­
place. It ­will examine common ethical issues that are encountered by library 
man­ag­ers and ­will provide information about how to foster ethical working 
environments in libraries.
Ethics in Modern Organ­izations
­Every day individuals must make decisions and then act according to 
their beliefs about what they consider to be right or wrong. Ethics helps 
answer the question, “What should I do?” Ethics is a subfield of philosophy 
and is concerned with the princi­ples and values that govern the be­hav­iors of 
an individual or a group in terms of what is right and what is wrong. When­
ever decisions need to be made, it is impor­tant to reflect on the ethical aspects 
of the choice as part of the pro­cess. Individuals face ethical issues both inside 
and outside of the workplace. In this book, the discussion of ethics ­will be 
focused primarily on managerial and professional ethics, which are the types 
of ethical princi­ples and prob­lems that arise in a work environment. This 

Professional Ethics  363
type of ethics deals with issues regarding the ethical rights and responsi­
bilities that exist within the confines of an organ­ization and relate to the 
organ­ization’s man­ag­ers, employees, customers, government, suppliers, and 
other stakeholders.
Ethical prob­lems are inevitable in any type of organ­ization; library man­
ag­ers need to know about ethics and how to apply ethical princi­ples to the 
decisions that confront them in the organ­izations they are managing. A chap­
ter on ethics logically follows a chapter on leadership, ­because research has 
shown that the leaders in any type of organ­ization set the ethical tone of that 
organ­ization. The key to getting employees to act ethically starts at the top.4 
Research has also shown that organ­izations with leaders who exhibit ethical 
be­hav­ior surpass their competitors in overall per­for­mance.5
One British study found that when employees ­were asked to rate 20 quali­
ties they would want a man­ag­er to have, honesty was the top-­rated attribute.6 
Carroll and Buchholtz report, “The be­hav­ior of superiors was ranked as the 
number one influence on unethical be­hav­ior.”7 Many other researchers have 
found that the best single predictor of how employees ­handle ethical dilemmas 
is the perceived values of top management. If the top man­ag­ers in an organ­
ization routinely engage in questionable ethical princi­ples, such as inflating 
expense accounts, taking supplies home for personal use, or revealing mate­
rial that should be kept confidential, then ­others in the organ­ization ­will con­
sider ­those acceptable ways of behaving. It is impor­tant for top man­ag­ers in 
any organ­ization to be clear about their ethical expectations for their employ­
ees. They provide guidance for the rest of the organ­ization’s employees in what 
is expected ethically. Man­ag­ers also need to realize that it is the leaders of 
the organ­ization who most commonly serve as role models. When lower-­level 
employees observe their bosses behaving unethically, they often do the same.
Defining Ethics
The ­whole idea of ethics can be a bit confusing, and many ­people find it 
difficult to precisely define what they mean when they use the term ethics. 
Ethics is often confused with morality, but although the terms ethics and 
morality are often used interchangeably, they are closely related but not iden­
tical. Morals are the beliefs of individuals or groups as to what is right or 
wrong, whereas ethics refers to the overarching rationales or princi­ples that 
guide the individual or group in making decisions about what is right or wrong. 
Morals vary among dif­fer­ent ­people and dif­fer­ent groups in the same culture: 
they typically vary greatly from one culture to another and from one time 
period to another. For instance, the way modern ­couples interact before mar­
riage is very dif­fer­ent from the type of courtship found in a Jane Austen novel. 
In the modern world, the amount of modesty considered appropriate for 
­women in regard to their clothing varies greatly from one culture to another.
Ethics is not concerned with specific moral rules followed in certain cul­
tures at certain times, but with under­lying general princi­ples, which are 
derived from theories of what is right and wrong, that help establish ­whether 
an action is ethical or not. ­There are many examples that could be used to 
illustrate actions that would be considered immoral for certain individuals 
or groups but are not unethical. For instance, some ­people feel that drink­
ing alcoholic beverages is wrong. However, abstinence from alcohol is an indi­
vidual moral belief or value that does not mean that drinking alcohol itself 
is unethical.
Ethics underpins morality in that it seeks to establish how individuals 
should act in certain situations. How should one think about an issue when 

364  Leading
unsure of what action should be taken? What questions should one ask? What 
­factors should be considered? Although morals can and do vary, ethics are 
universal standards that prescribe what ­humans should do based on well-­
considered philosophical standards. Morality governs private actions but 
ethics applies to every­one.
­There are other distinctions that need to be made when discussing eth­
ics, and ­these distinctions can be clarified by envisioning all ­human be­hav­
iors falling on a continuum from ­those that are freely chosen to ­those that 
are mandated by law (see figure 15.1). As you move from left to right on the 
continuum, the amount of external control on individual or orga­nizational 
be­hav­ior increases. The first category is ­free choice. The be­hav­iors that fall 
in this category are ­those that are ­free for ­people or groups to choose. For 
example, you choose what you want to eat for breakfast. Choices in this cat­
egory are freely chosen by individuals or organ­izations. Some be­hav­iors that 
in the past would have been illegal have now moved into this category. For 
example, interracial marriage was once illegal in the United States; now the 
race of someone’s marriage partner is a ­free choice. In a similar way, the laws 
against same sex marriage have recently been rewritten in many places across 
the world, and where the law has been changed, the gender of one’s marriage 
partner is now also governed by ­free choice.
Be­hav­ior that is governed by ethics falls in the ­middle of the continuum. 
This type of be­hav­ior is governed by standards of conduct that are based on 
shared values and princi­ples. ­There are no laws that require an individual 
to behave in an ethical fashion, yet ­people give up their freedom of choice to do 
so. Lying to colleagues or breaking promises are not typically illegal actions, 
but ­people who follow ethical princi­ples do not engage in such be­hav­ior.
Be­hav­ior that is governed by law is more tightly controlled. Although 
ethics and law are both guidelines about how to act, laws tell ­people and 
organ­izations what they can and cannot do, and ­these standards are enforce­
able in courts. If you break a law, you ­will be punished. Violating an ethical 
princi­ple does not lead to ­legal punishment. Ethical be­hav­ior is governed by 
shared princi­ples and values about conduct. ­These are not codified laws that 
regulate conduct, but instead are norms and standards that are unenforce­
able in a court.
Laws often are more concerned with creating rules that stabilize socie­
ties than promoting social ideals. It is incorrect to assume that if something 
is ­legal, it is also ethical. Laws can sometimes be corrupted by unethical 
regimes or certain laws can be created to serve the narrow interests of a 
power elite. Ethics often require a higher standard than laws, and although

Talk About It
Think of three examples of be­hav­ior that fall into each of the categories in Figure 15.1. 
If pos­si­ble, work with a group and discuss your examples. Have any of the be­hav­iors 
you listed moved from one category to another? Did you have difficulty in deciding what 
category to place some of the be­hav­iors? Have your actions in performing any of ­these 
be­hav­iors been influenced by the category in which it falls?
what is ethical is usually ­legal, in some cases, ethics conflict with law. Capi­
tal punishment is ­legal in 31 states in the United States, but many citizens 
think that the death penalty is unethical even where it is ­legal. Some physi­
cians have broken the law by prescribing marijuana to ­dying patients to ease 
pain. For them, the ethical requirement of lessening suffering is a more 
impor­tant concern than laws regarding use of illegal drugs.
Ethics are based on general princi­ples usually considered to be univer­
sal, but what is considered ethical be­hav­ior can change over time. At one 
time, owning slaves was not only ­legal but was considered ethical by most 
­people in most socie­ties. Now slavery has been abolished as an abhorrent 
practice almost everywhere. In addition, ethics are affected by societal and 
cultural norms. Practices that are considered ethical in some countries would 
not be considered ethical in ­others. For instance, polygamy is recognized as 
ethical in a few places but not in most. Child ­labor is still common in many 
developing countries, but it would be considered unethical (as well as ille­
gal) to employ ­children in factories in most of the world.
­TABLE 15.1. Some Definitions Related to Ethics
Ethics: The rules or standards governing the conduct of a person or the members 
of a profession.
Morals: Rules or habits of conduct, especially of sexual conduct, with reference 
to standards of right and wrong.
Laws: The body of rules and princi­ples governing the affairs of a community and 
enforced by a po­liti­cal authority; a ­legal system

Houghton Mifflin, 2011).
­Because ethical standards are not codified like laws and are not com­
pletely uniform across time and place, it is often difficult to decide what action 
should be taken when an ethical decision needs to be made. Often individu­
als must make decisions based on their judgments rather than on indisput­
able facts. Many times, ­there seems to be no one right ethical solution; instead 
­there are many alternative choices, none of which is perfect. ­These situations 
are referred to as ethical dilemmas. One common example often used to illus­
trate an ethical dilemma concerns stealing. Stealing is usually considered 
to be unethical, but would stealing be justified if stealing food ­were the only 
way to feed a ­family? Which is of higher value: personal property or feeding 
one’s ­family?
In organ­izations, employees are faced with similar ethical dilemmas. For 
example, imagine you supervise a single ­mother with four ­children who is often 
absent from work. You have given her warnings, but she continues to be absent

Below are some ethical prob­lems that might be encountered in a library setting. Imagine 
that you had to make the decision in each of ­these cases. What would you do and why?
A recent MLIS gradu­ate has been offered a job in an information center in a bank 
that has been accused of discrimination in approving mortgages and other financial ser­
vices to residents living in low-­income neighborhoods. This practice conflicts with her 
personal values, and she won­ders if she could be happy working in that organ­ization.
The director of a small academic library has been invited for an all-­expenses-­paid 
visit to a vendor’s corporate headquarters. He knows he would gain valuable informa­
tion about the vendor’s products but fears that the trip might influence his ­future 
purchasing decisions.
A high school principal has asked the school librarian to provide her with a list of 
­every book a par­tic­u­lar student had checked out. The librarian knew the boy had read 
books about drugs, explosives, and weapons, and was afraid that the principal would 
provide the information to police.
An employee in a special library is concerned that the software on his computer is 
illegal. He knows that his supervisor, in an attempt to keep costs ­under control, did not 
purchase enough site licenses for the department.
A female colleague seeks your advice. She has just applied for a job at a new library 
and the job would mean not only a promotion but also a significant pay increase. She 
has been invited for an onsite interview. However, she is three months pregnant and 
would be about to give birth just before the new job began. She wants to know if you 
think she ­ought to reveal her pregnancy at the job interview.
about one day a week, usually ­because one (or more) of her ­children is ill. You 
know she is the only source of support for her ­family. Are you justified in 
dismissing her for excessive absenteeism? Man­ag­ers often experience situa­
tions in which their professional responsibilities come into conflict with their 
personal values. Many times, ­there is no clear-­cut right or wrong decision. 
Knowing about ethics helps in solving ­these situations.
The Importance of Ethics
Although some individuals consider ethics in the workplace to be a frill 
or an add-on, ethics is an integral part of good business. ­Those organ­izations 
that exploit the ­labor force, take advantage of customers, or deny product 
defects almost always ultimately incur huge costs that hurt the organ­ization. 
For example, Volks­wagen had built a reputation as a “green” com­pany and 
many consumers bought Volks­wagen cars ­because they felt it was an envi­
ronmentally responsible choice. ­After it was revealed in 2015 that Volks­
wagen had installed software designed to cover up diesel emissions in 11 
million of its automobiles worldwide, the com­pany’s reputation was severely 
damaged and the resulting fines from the emission test cheating could reach 
$15 billion dollars in the United States alone.8 Volks­wagen also lost many 
previously loyal customers who felt they had been betrayed by the com­pany.
Although ­there are many examples of organ­izations that have acted in 
an unethical fashion, ­there are many more examples of organ­izations that 
are increasing their stress on ethics and corporate social responsibility. Cor­
porate social responsibility (CSR) refers to business practices that con­
tribute to social and environmental benefits. For instance, Disney provides 
millions of dollars in conservation grants, Microsoft partners with a nonprofit

Many consumers say they would be willing to pay more for products produced in an 
ethical and environmentally responsible way. However, ­those products usually cost more 
to produce and are typically more expensive for consumers to purchase. Think about your­
self. Imagine that you buy one or two cups of coffee each day. If you had a choice between 
a $4 cup of coffee from beans that ­were organically grown and fair trade certified (which 
means that the harvesters worked ­under humane conditions and ­were paid fairly) or a 
$1.50 cup of a non-­brand name, conventionally grown coffee which would you choose? 
What ­factors would influence your choice? How might a prospective buyer’s economic 
status govern such choices?
to create IT apprenticeships in ­Kenya, and Mattel is committed to using sus­
tainably sourced materials in its products and packaging.9 Many libraries 
have also committed to CSR and are committed to environmentally respon­
sible practices such as reducing energy use, increasing recycling and the use 
of sustainable materials, to social justice issues such as diversity and ser­
vice to underserved populations, and to responsible/sustainable procurement 
practices. Increasingly con­temporary organ­izations are convinced of the 
importance of ethics and are finding new ways to put ethics in practice. ­These 
organ­izations are thinking not only of the economic “bottom line” but of the 
“­triple bottom line,” which encompasses the economic, environmental, and 
social impact of orga­nizational actions.10
Organ­izations that strive to build and maintain ethical workplace cul­
tures are more financially successful and have more productive and moti­
vated employees.11 On the other hand, organ­izations that have a culture 
where unethical be­hav­ior is tolerated or even encouraged, typically have 
higher turnover, lower productivity and profitably, and a diminished reputa­
tion. It is advantageous for organ­izations to strive to build and maintain eth­
ical workplace cultures ­because ­those workplaces are more financially 
successful and have more productive and motivated employees.12
However, an organ­ization may be committed to ethical practices and still 
have individual employees who act in opposition to the orga­nizational norms. 
All employees bring their individual ethical values to an organ­ization. ­These 
values have been ­shaped in an individual’s early years by parents, relatives, 
teachers, and culture, and they represent an individual’s basic convictions 
about what is right and what is wrong. ­Because ­these values usually differ 
from person to person, any one organ­ization can have individuals with widely 
varying ethical values working in it. Each employee is then exposed to the 
norms of the organ­ization. Ideally, ­these norms would conform to the indi­
vidual’s values, but sometimes they do not. Fi­nally, the be­hav­ior of individu­
als in the workplace is affected by external ­factors such as the norms of 
society or laws and regulations. ­These three sets of ­factors influencing ethi­
cal be­hav­ior can be seen in figure 15.2.
Even though the ethical be­hav­ior of individuals is influenced by many 
external ­factors, research has shown that an organ­ization’s ethical norms 
do have a strong influence on how employees act within that organ­ization. 
Linda Trevino and Michael Brown state that much unethical conduct is the 
result of “neglectful leadership and orga­nizational cultures that send mixed 
messages about what is impor­tant and what is expected.”13 Unethical actions 
within an organ­ization “involve the tacit, if not explicit, cooperation of ­others 

368  Leading
and reflect the values, attitudes, beliefs, language, and behavioral patterns 
that define an organ­ization’s operating culture. An ethical environment is one 
that makes it easy to do the right ­thing and difficult to do the wrong ­thing.”14 
Ethics, then, is as much an orga­nizational as a personal issue. Thus, it is the 
responsibility of man­ag­ers to provide leadership in ethics, ­because ­those 
who fail ­will create an environment that is open to unethical practices and 
procedures.
Some companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, have been known for 
de­cades as organ­izations that pride themselves on integrity and ethical 
be­hav­ior. Robert Wood Johnson, one of the early presidents of Johnson & John­
son, developed a credo for the organ­ization in the 1940s, and this ­simple 
one-­page document has guided the actions of the employees of Johnson & 
Johnson since that date. The credo clearly states the organ­ization’s respon­
sibilities to four separate sets of stakeholders in the com­pany—­customers, 
employees, communities, and stockholders—­and emphasizes that the organ­
ization puts its responsibility to customers before profits.15
­There is a ­great deal of evidence that supports the idea that ethical 
organ­izations are more successful. The corporate scandals that occurred in 
organ­izations such as Enron and Wells Fargo not only brought adverse pub­
licity to the organ­izations but also caused ­great damage to the ­people who 
worked in ­these organ­izations or who had relied upon them for ser­vice. ­These 
cases have resulted in a new wave of corporate reform efforts, primarily the 
Sarbanes-­Oxley Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2002 and the Dodd-­
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010, 
designed to make accounting practices more transparent and to protect 
investors. Although no library has had an ethical scandal as im­mense as 
­those at Wells Fargo, Enron, or Volks­wagen, given the frequent occurrence 
of unethical and illegal be­hav­ior in highly respected organ­izations, it is crit­
ical to understand and to promote ethical conduct in all types of organ­
izations, including libraries.
The Ethical Information Professional
We turn now from discussing ethics in general to focusing on ethics in 
library and information science. Library and Information Science (LIS) 
FIGURE 15.2. ­Factors Influencing Ethical Be­hav­ior

Professional Ethics  369
professionals, in common with other practicing professionals such as doctors 
and ­lawyers, have specific ethical issues that need to be confronted. As a result, 
subfields of ethics, such as biomedical and ­legal ethics, that are particularly 
relevant to the needs of certain professions, have developed. One subfield of 
ethics that relates directly to librarians and information specialists is that 
of information ethics. Information ethics is the “branch of ethics that focuses 
on the relationship between the creation, organ­ization, dissemination, and 
use of information and the ethical and moral codes governing ­human conduct 
in society.”16 Information ethics is concerned about issues such as the rela­
tionship between information and the good of society and the relationship 
between information providers and the consumers of information. Informa­
tion ethics also covers other areas such as access to information, intellectual 
freedom, plagiarism, copyright, and digital divide issues. Information ethics 
has become more impor­tant as ethical issues have been intensified by the 
increasing use of information technology in LIS. The prevalence of digital 
materials, electronic rec­ords, and the Internet has posed new prob­lems relat­
ing to the ethical understanding of such issues as privacy, censorship, and 
intellectual property.
Libraries face ethical issues ­every day, and, as Jean Preer states, “Our 
need for ethical awareness has grown as the practice of librarianship has 
become more professional, our roles and ser­vices more complex, and infor­
mation technologies faster and more pervasive.”17 Although many of the prob­
lems relating to ethics that are confronted in libraries are similar to ­those 
in other orga­nizational settings, each type of organ­ization encounters some 
prob­lems that are unique to that type of setting, and the context must be 
considered. Martha Smith developed a helpful model of the conflicting loyal­
ties that are often experienced by information professionals.18 This model can 
be seen in figure 15.3. The multiple loyalties of information professionals 
include loyalties to:
•	 Self: includes personal integrity, job security, and personal 
responsibilities
•	 Clients or patrons: includes privacy of information, freedom of 
access, serving patron needs
•	 Profession: includes professional standards of ser­vice and the 
responsibility to raise the public knowledge of issues identified by 
the profession
•	 Employing institution: includes loyalty to employer, upholding the 
goals and priorities of the institution, and working for its good.19
Ideally, ­these four loyalties would function together, but sometimes ­there 
is conflict among the loyalties, and then a professional has to negotiate among 
conflicting claims. Smith provides the following example. Imagine a situa­
tion in which a library director is asked by city officials to monitor circula­
tion rec­ords to aid in the investigation of the illegal manufacturing of drugs. 
Which loyalty ­will have priority? Loyalty to the patron and to the profession 
would likely cause her to refuse. However, loyalty to the employing institu­
tion or to self might cause her to comply.20
Smith’s model demonstrates the complexity that is involved in making 
ethical professional decisions and can be a useful tool when man­ag­ers in 
libraries need to reason through a multifaceted situation that ­causes conflict 
between personal, professional, and institutional loyalties. When man­ag­ers 

370  Leading
confront difficult decisions, they should first think of the alternative solu­
tions or actions that might be taken and then review them in light of the four 
loyalties discussed previously to see if their decision is being unduly influ­
enced in any way.
Problematic Ethical Situations
All man­ag­ers confront many dif­fer­ent types of ethical prob­lems on the 
job. Problematic ethical situations or ethical dilemmas often consist of a con­
flict between the needs of a part and the needs of the ­whole. ­These may be the 
conflicts between the needs of an individual employee and the organ­ization 
as a ­whole or between the needs of an organ­ization and society as a ­whole. In 
the for-­profit world, a ­great deal of the unethical be­hav­ior that has occurred 
has been a result of trying to maximize profits at any cost, including engag­
ing in unethical or illegal activities. ­Because most libraries are not-­for-­profit 
organ­izations, library staff members do not usually face the prob­lem of trying 
to balance ethical be­hav­ior with increasing profits to stockholders or ­owners.
However, as mentioned earlier, ­there are many ethical issues that con­
front librarians ­because of the nature of their profession. Issues such as access 
to information, privacy, intellectual property rights, censorship, and intel­
lectual freedom are of considerable concern to LIS professionals. Although 
the ethical issues mentioned above are core to what all librarians do, this 
chapter ­will focus primarily on some of the specific ethical issues faced by 
LIS man­ag­ers. Decisions on ­these issues often involve ­human resources, use 
of orga­nizational resources, and competition. Ruben and Froehlich provide a 
number of areas of ethical tension encountered by LIS man­ag­ers including:
FIGURE 15.3. Multiple Loyalties of Information Professionals

Professional Ethics  371
•	 Violating the privacy of individuals, for example, monitoring employee 
e-­mails or use of the Internet
•	 Being motivated by personal likes, dislikes, anger, and desire for ret­
ribution when making decisions
•	 Being motivated by personal gain
•	 Acting in a discriminatory manner
•	 Making deceptive statements, providing distorted or false informa­
tion, or acting deceptively
•	 Purposefully withholding information.21
Tooey and Arnold recently surveyed a number of academic health sci­
ences library directors. One hundred ­percent of the directors stated that eth­
ics ­were impor­tant in their position as a director. ­These directors reported 
that they most often encountered prob­lems in the areas of vendor relations 
(30 ­percent), personnel issues (30 ­percent), licensed resources (15 ­percent), 
and other (15 ­percent).22
Not surprisingly, many of the ethical issues confronting library man­ag­
ers are centered in the ­human resources area of management. Ethical dilem­
mas ­there often arise from the need for confidentiality of personnel rec­ords 
and conflict between the rights of the individual and the rights of the insti­
tution. Some of the ethical issues relating to ­human resources and staffing 
in terms of affirmative action/equal opportunity, employee privacy, and elec­
tronic monitoring ­were discussed in previous chapters in this book.
Another common type of ethical dilemma often found in a professional 
situation is that of individual conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists 
when the man­ag­er who has to make a job-­related decision has an outside 
interest in the outcome that may influence the objectivity of the decision mak­
ing. For instance, a man­ag­er who is in the pro­cess of making a decision about 
some expensive system for the library might have invitations from vendors 
for a ­free trip to visit their headquarters. Librarians who are in charge of 
major materials purchases often have the opportunity to be wined and dined 
by vendors at conferences. As a result, some libraries have policies against 
accepting any vendor invitations to avoid any suggestion that a vendor se­lection 
decision might be influenced by accepting a certain vendor’s hospitality. 
Another example of using a management position for personal advantage 
would be a library man­ag­er who decides to contract with a private consulting 
firm partially owned by that librarian’s spouse or who routinely pads travel 
reimbursement reports. Still another example of a conflict of interest would 
arise if a man­ag­er spent so much time on an outside consulting job that the 
regular job was neglected. Usually ­these conflict of interest cases provide 
some sort of financial advantages for the unethical man­ag­er, but sometimes 
the advantages may be personal, for instance, when a man­ag­er hires the 
daughter of a friend as a summer intern rather than ­doing an objective job 
search to fill that position, or when a man­ag­er gives an employee who is also 
a personal friend a good per­for­mance review when that employee did not 
deserve it. Still another example is a man­ag­er struggling with how truthful 
to be in references for current/former employees. As you can see, LIS man­
ag­ers often are confronted with ethical decisions and deciding what is the 
ethical ­thing do is not always clear-­cut or easy.

Tools for Ethical Decision Making
When man­ag­ers or employees are confronted with an ethical dilemma, 
what should they do? How should they think through the issue, and what 
­factors should they consider? Obviously, an impor­tant first step in analyz­
ing any ethical issue is to gather all the information that is available. Some­
times individuals make wrong decisions ­because they are not aware of all of 
the facts concerning the case. But getting the facts is not enough. Facts give 
us information about a decision, but they do not tell us what should be done. 
­There are a number of tools that can be used to assist with ethical decision-­
making and this section ­will discuss some of the approaches that can be used 
to clarify the pro­cess of ethical decision-­making. ­These tools include: norma­
tive ethical frameworks, question-­based frameworks, and ethics codes and 
policies.
Normative Ethical Frameworks
Phi­los­o­phers have developed a number of dif­fer­ent approaches to deal­
ing with ethical issues, including the use of a variety of normative ethical 
frameworks that can be used for evaluating be­hav­ior. The frameworks can 
be seen in figure 15.4. Each of ­these frameworks are complex but, in brief, 
the princi­ples of the most common frameworks are:
•	 Utilitarianism: This approach has its roots in the work of two 19th 
century British phi­los­o­phers, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart 
Mills, who advocated that ethical actions are ­those that produce the 
greatest good for the greatest number of ­people. To use this frame­
work, first, all the pos­si­ble courses of actions are identified, and then 
the action is chosen that ­will produce the greatest benefits and the 
least harm. For instance, a man­ag­er might decide to ban all smoking 
in the workplace ­because more employees ­will benefit from this policy 
than ­will be hurt by it.
•	 Individual rights: This framework draws heavi­ly on the work of 
the 18th ­century phi­los­o­pher, Immanuel Kant, who believed that what 
made ­humans dif­fer­ent from other living ­things was their dignity; 
this dignity derives from the fact that ­humans are rational. As a 
result, ­humans possess inalienable rights, such as rights to privacy, 
freedom of speech, and due pro­cess. ­These are rights that should not 
be abridged. To use this framework one must question if an action 
re­spects the rights of all concerned. The man­ag­er might make the 
decision not to look in employees’ lockers or monitor their e-­mails 
Practice Your Skills
Think of a library or another organ­ization with which you are familiar. Can you think 
of any ethical issues you would expect man­ag­ers in that organ­ization to confront? Then, 
if pos­si­ble, interview a man­ag­er, and ask that man­ag­er about the ethical issues that he 
or she must deal with in the job and what type of resources the organ­ization provides

­because they consider ­those actions violations of employees’ privacy 
rights.
•	 Social justice: The social justice or fairness approach is derived 
from the teachings of the Greek phi­los­o­pher, Aristotle. This approach 
holds that decisions must be based on standards that involve the fair 
treatment of all. The relevant questions to be asked when applying 
this framework are: How fair is an action? Does it treat all in the 
same manner? Is ­there any favoritism or discrimination? This frame­
work would ensure that ­there would be no discrimination among 
employees on such ­factors as race, religion, or gender. If ­there ­were 
two employees, one a male and one a female, ­doing the same job, the 
man­ag­er would compensate both workers equally.
­These ethical frameworks give man­ag­ers a context to use in considering 
ethical prob­lems and a means of identifying the most impor­tant ethical con­
siderations, but they often do not provide clear-­cut solutions. Instead, some­
times they provide dif­fer­ent, often contradictory, answers to the prob­lem.

374  Leading
For instance, in 2000. the North Carolina Museum of Art had to make 
a difficult choice about a piece of art that the museum had bought to be part 
of its permanent collection. ­After its purchase, this painting was found to 
have been stolen by the Nazis during World War II. The descendants of its 
original owner asked the museum to return the painting.23 It could be argued 
using the utilitarian framework that the greatest good would be produced 
by leaving it in the museum where many visitors could see it on display. How­
ever, other arguments could be mounted using the other two frameworks. In 
this par­tic­u­lar instance, a compromise was reached. The museum paid com­
pensation to the own­er’s descendants for the artwork, and it remained in the 
museum. Unfortunately, some ethical situations often have no real right or 
wrong answers, and compromises have to be made. The frameworks give 
man­ag­ers a way of viewing ethical dilemmas and putting them in a broader 
perspective.
Question-­Based Frameworks for Ethical Decision Making
Experts provide other frameworks, including a list of questions that indi­
viduals can use to assess ­whether they are confronting any problematic sit­
uation in an ethical way. For instance, questions such as the ones in ­table 15.2 
provide guidance to an individual trying to reach an ethical decision. Some 
companies provide such frameworks to help their employees think through 
problematic situations. For instance, Pricewater­house Cooper’s framework can 
be seen at http://­www.pwc​.­com​/­gx​/­en​/­about​/­ethics​-­business​-­conduct​/­ethical​
-­decision​-­making​-­framework​.­html. Other man­ag­ers use very ­simple guide­
lines provided by asking such questions as: “Would you be proud to tell your 
parents or grandparents about the decision you have made?, “Are you able to 
sleep well at night?”, and “How would you feel if interviewers from your local 
tele­vi­sion station showed up with cameras to ask about your actions?” Ques­
tions like ­these may help focus an individual’s response to a perplexing prob­
lem. But, as mentioned earlier, ethical dilemmas are not easy; sometimes 
­there are no readily apparent correct answers, or ­there is more than one 
approach that might be taken.
Codes of Ethics
A code of ethics is another tool that can be helpful in ethical decision 
making. Many corporate organ­izations have codes of ethics designed to guide 
individuals within the organ­ization in acting ethically. In addition to indi­
vidual codes in specific organ­izations, many professional organ­izations have 
developed codes of ethics designed to guide individual conduct within a pro­
fession. Many large corporations in the United States and internationally 
have developed their own codes of ethics. For instance, Google elaborates on 
its famous “­Don’t be evil,” in its code of conduct.24 Amazon,25 General Motors,26 
and many other organ­izations have their codes of ethics posted on their Web 
sites.
Fewer libraries have developed their own individual codes of ethics. 
Although it has been recommended that libraries should provide codes of eth­
ics for their employees, on the ­whole, most libraries have not developed their 
own code, although some libraries do have specific policies dealing with top­
ics such as vendor relationships. Instead, most librarians have subscribed 
to a professional code of ethics.27 For example, ALA has a code of ethics that 
can be seen in figure 15.5. The Medical Library Association also has developed 
its own code of ethics for health sciences librarians.28 The Special Libraries 

Professional Ethics  375
Association29 and the Society of American Archivists30 are among the many 
other LIS organ­izations with statements of ethics posted on their Web sites. 
In a similar fashion, national libraries or librarians’ associations around 
the world have developed professional codes of ethics. A large number of such 
professional codes can be seen at the International Federation of Library 
Associations and Institutions’ Web site.31 It is in­ter­est­ing to compare and 
contrast the ele­ments found in each of ­these professional codes and to see 
how each group’s code varies in some aspects from the ­others.
Almost all of ­these codes, however, focus on the key values of librarian­
ship and on librarians’ roles as information specialists and ser­vice provid­
ers.32 Gorman writes that the primary values of the LIS profession are ser­vice 
and stewardship of the ­human rec­ord, and that intellectual freedom, liter­
acy, reading, life-­long learning, equity of access, privacy, democracy, and a 
commitment to the greater good are values that are central to the work of 
librarians.33 Most of the library codes reflect ­these values, and they stress 
issues such as confidentiality, personal neutrality, privacy, quality, and equity 
of access. As a result, ­these codes often provide the most guidance on ethical 
be­hav­ior ­towards patrons and provide less assistance in confronting perplex­
ing ethical decisions that deal with internal decisions faced by man­ag­ers. 
For ­these types of decisions, an orga­nizational code or policy of ethics would 
be more helpful. Some libraries have such codes that provide more practical 
advice to deal with ethical prob­lems that may arise.34 Although many librar­
ies are covered by their parent organ­ization’s Code of Ethics, it would be 
helpful to library man­ag­ers and their employees if more libraries developed 
their own specific codes of ethics.
The value of both orga­nizational and professional codes of ethics depends 
on how they are used. If the importance of a par­tic­u­lar code is taught to all

Code of Ethics of the American Library Association
As members of the American Library Association, we recognize the 
importance of codifying and making known to the profession and to the 
general public the ethical princi­ples that guide the work of librarians, 
other professionals providing information ser­vices, library trustees, and 
library staffs.
Ethical dilemmas occur when values are in conflict. The American 
Library Association Code of Ethics states the values to which we are com­
mitted and embodies the ethical responsibilities of the profession in this 
changing information environment.
We significantly influence or control the se­lection, organ­ization, pres­
ervation, and dissemination of information. In a po­liti­cal system grounded 
in an informed citizenry, we are members of a profession explic­itly commit­
ted to intellectual freedom and the freedom of access to information. We 
have a special obligation to ensure the ­free flow of information and ideas to 
pres­ent and ­future generations.
The princi­ples of this Code are expressed in broad statements to guide 
ethical decision making. ­These statements provide a framework; they can­
not and do not dictate conduct to cover par­tic­u­lar situations.
1.	 We provide the highest level of ser­vice to all library users through 
appropriate and usefully or­ga­nized resources; equitable ser­vice 
policies; equitable access; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous 
responses to all requests.
2.	 We uphold the princi­ples of intellectual freedom and resist all 
efforts to censor library resources.
3.	 We protect each library user’s right to privacy and confidentiality 
with re­spect to information sought or received and resources con­
sulted, borrowed, acquired, or transmitted.
4.	 We recognize and re­spect intellectual property rights.
5.	 We treat co-­workers and other colleagues with re­spect, fairnesss, 
and good faith and advocate conditions of employment that safe­
guard the rights and welfare of all employees of our institutions.
6.	 We do not advance private interests at the expense of library users, 
colleagues, or our employing institutions.
7.	 We distinguish between our personal convictions and professional 
duties and do not allow our personal beliefs to interfere with fair 
repre­sen­ta­tion of the aims of our institutions or the provision of 
access to their information resources.
8.	 We strive for excellence in the profession by maintaining and 
enhancing our own knowledge and skills, by encouraging the pro­
fessional development of co-­workers, and by fostering the aspira­
tions of potential members of the profession.

Professional Ethics  377
Ethics Training
Man­ag­ers must realize that all of the ethical frameworks, codes, and 
question-­asking approaches described previously are useless ­unless they are 
communicated to employees and employees are taught to use them. Although 
at some level it might seem that instilling ethical be­hav­ior in an organ­ization 
should just be a ­matter of teaching employees the importance of good be­hav­
ior, research has shown that making ethical decisions requires more than 
just the ­will to do so. Many individuals overestimate their ability to make 
ethical decisions and are not fully aware of their own biases and how ­those 
might influence their choices when confronting an ethical dilemma. Thus, 
individuals often may not realize that they are behaving in an unethical 
fashion.37
employees, if top man­ag­ers affirm such codes, and if individuals who go 
against the code are punished, codes can be impor­tant in shaping be­hav­ior. 
If such a code is used only as win­dow dressing, it ­will be in­effec­tive in pro­
viding a guide to ethical be­hav­ior. The Enron Corporation, which was involved 
in one of the most egregious ethics scandals of this ­century, had a 64-­page 
code of ethics that was distributed to all employees, but obviously, the code 
was ignored by many of the man­ag­ers in the com­pany.
Talk About It
Having an orga­nizational code of ethics is not enough to prevent unethical be­hav­ior. In 
September 2016, Wells Fargo, a large U.S. bank, agreed to pay $190 million in settlements 
­because it was discovered that thousands of the bank’s employees had set up over 2 million 
deposit, credit card, and debit accounts using customers’ credentials but without ­these 
customers’ knowledge. ­These actions are not only unethical but illegal ­because they vio­
late the Dodd-­Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Wells Fargo not 
only had a code of ethics, it had a 37-­page brochure that devoted many pages to discuss­
ing trust and explaining at length how Wells Fargo put its customers first. “We strive 
to be recognized by our stakeholders as setting the standard among the world’s ­great 
companies for integrity and principled per­for­mance. This is more than just ­doing the 
right ­thing. We also have to do it in the right way.”35
Codes of ethics can help in creating an ethical environment, but if the orga­nizational 
culture does not reward ethical be­hav­ior, it ­will not occur. At Well Fargo, the organ­
ization created an incentive structure that rewarded and, in fact, almost forced, employ­
ees to behave inappropriately. Beginning in 2008, the bank began to institute a series 
of stretch goals and sales quotas that ­were virtually impossible for employees to reach. 
The employees ­were operating ­under a reward system that left them in the “untenable 
position of only being able to meet their sales quotas through unethical, unfair, illegal, 
and fraudulent means.”36 Wells Fargo despite its written commitment to trust and ­doing 
­things right created a culture that resulted in a large number of employees engaging in 
unethical be­hav­ior.
Imagine that you ­were an employee of Wells Fargo and ­were faced with the choice 
of ­either setting up fraudulent bank accounts and meeting your sales quota or behaving 
ethically and not meeting the quota and possibly being fired. How would you behave? 
Would ­there have been a way for employees to force a change in the way they ­were evalu­
ated and compensated?

378  Leading
Bazerman and Tenbrunzel describe a condition they term “ethical fading,” 
when we “end up engaging in or condoning be­hav­ior that we would condemn 
if we ­were consciously aware of it.” They note that “much unethical conduct 
that goes on, ­whether in social life or work life, happens ­because ­people are 
unconsciously fooling themselves. They overlook transgressions—­bending a 
rule to help a colleague, overlooking information that might damage the rep­
utation of a client—­because it is in their interest to do so.”38
As was mentioned earlier, individuals have their own set of ethical guide­
lines, and ­these guidelines can differ a ­great deal even among employees 
who are largely homogeneous. As organ­izations employ a greater diversity 
of employees, it is impor­tant to remember that dif­fer­ent cultures often have 
dif­fer­ent beliefs about what is acceptable ethical be­hav­ior, and it can never 
be assumed that an employee understands the ethical expectations of an 
organ­ization without training. Man­ag­ers in a number of institutions in the 
private sector have instituted ethics training programs to inform employees 
about the ethical standards expected within the organ­ization on topics vary­
ing from sexual harassment to insider stock trading. Although trying to 
teach ­people to behave ethically is not an easy ­thing to do, ethics training 
can be useful ­because it reinforces the organ­ization’s standards and reminds 
employees of the importance of ethical be­hav­ior.
Practice Your Skills
If you are presently working or have had a job in the past, ­were you provided with any 
training in ethics? Do you think that the training you received was adequate to prepare 
you deal with ethical decisions that needed to be made? Did you encounter ethical issues 
in your job? ­Were you aware of any ethical prob­lems in the organ­ization?
Guidelines for Man­ag­ers to 
Promote Ethical Be­hav­ior
Ethics are crucial to ­every organ­ization, but as Trevino and Brown 
stated, “Ethics ­isn’t easy.” Unethical conduct has been with us throughout 
history, but ­today ­there are more gray areas and more opportunities for 
­people to engage in unethical be­hav­ior. ­These authors provide a set of guide­
lines for improving ethics management in any type of organ­ization:
•	 Understand the existing ethical culture: Tools such as anony­
mous surveys and focus groups can help a man­ag­er find out what 
employees ­really think about the ethical climate of the organ­ization. 
Do employees feel that ­people who act ethically are rewarded and 
­those who do not are punished? What do employees think they need to 
do to succeed? Communicate the importance of ethics. Man­ag­ers need 
to be sure that they send clear and consistent messages and remember 
it is not enough to merely tell ­people to do the right ­thing. Employees 
need to be educated about the types of ethical issues that may arise 
and how to apply ethical values when decisions are being made.
•	 Focus on the reward system: Man­ag­ers should be certain that 
ethical be­hav­ior is rewarded, not punished. Be sure that employees 
realize that getting ahead no ­matter how you do it is not tolerated.

Professional Ethics  379
•	 Promote ethical leadership: The top man­ag­ers in a firm must 
demonstrate ethical be­hav­ior themselves if they want to encourage 
it in ­those who are below them. Ethical orga­nizational cultures go 
hand in hand with ethical leaders. In for-­profit organ­izations, it is 
impor­tant to stress that ethical be­hav­ior is more impor­tant than 
short-­term, bottom-­line profits.39
Conclusion
Ethics is an impor­tant topic, and ethical issues are frequently complex 
and hard to ­handle. Obviously, ­there are some ele­ments of ethics, such as pro­
hibitions on physically harming another person, which would be agreed upon 
by almost every­one. But ­there are many other areas in which ambiguity 
exists, and even ­people with the best of intentions often ­will disagree about 
the right ­thing to do. However, ­there are some basic guidelines for man­ag­ers 
who want to promote an ethical environment. All man­ag­ers should (1) dem­
onstrate the importance of ethics by their own be­hav­ior, (2) be certain that 
appropriate codes of be­hav­ior are in place and that employees are informed 
of them, and (3) monitor the be­hav­ior of employees to be sure that they are 
complying.
Managing ethically is not easy, but it is the responsibility of all man­ag­
ers to uphold high ethical standards within their organ­izations. Cihak and 
Howland remind all man­ag­ers that if they want to create a sustained cul­
ture of ethics within their organ­ization they must objectively and consistently 
examine their own be­hav­ior. As they write:
A library director cannot hold her staff to higher standards than 
she demands of herself. Nor can she behave in a manner that 
does not mirror the articulated ethical values of the institution. 
Ethical be­hav­ior within a library setting ­will be tested, lived, 
and judged on a day-­to-­day basis. Ethical patterns, or the lack 
thereof, emerge as they are practiced. The question then 
becomes ­whether it is pos­si­ble for a library director to create or 
sustain an ethical workplace by the clear articulation and 
implementation of ethical princi­ples. The negative consequences 
and costs to library organ­izations that tolerate inconsistent 
ethical be­hav­ior or ignore serious ethical transgressions, such as 
lying, slander, and stealing, are incalculable.40
In organ­izations where unethical practices thrive, both the organ­ization 
and its employees almost inevitably suffer negative consequences. ­Today’s 
library man­ag­ers work in environments where ­there is an ever-­growing 
demand for accountability, an increased scrutiny of leaders and organ­izations 
by their vari­ous stakeholders and by the media, and a growing level of com­
petition for resources. It is often difficult, but as much as pos­si­ble, library 
man­ag­ers and all LIS workers should try to integrate ethical princi­ples into 
all aspects of their workplace. Behaving in an ethical manner leads to better 
outcomes for the organ­ization, its employees, its stakeholders and society 
at large.

Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 An ethics quiz: what do you think the most ethical approach would be in the 
following situations?
A.	You are the reference librarian on duty at a large public library. Two teen­
agers come in and ask for instructions on how to build a car bomb. Would you:
Help them all you could?
Call the police?
Ask your supervisor for advice?
Ask them why they want the information?
B.	You are the director of a small academic library. An automation vendor offers 
to take you out for dinner at a national meeting. Would you:
Accept with thanks?
Go ahead but pay your own way?
Decline the invitation?
Ask if another director friend could come too?
C.	Patrons in your small inner-­city public library have complained about home­
less ­people taking baths in the library rest­room and sleeping on the furni­
ture. Would you:
Lock the rest­rooms and have ­people get a key from the staff to monitor rest­
room use?
Put signs up discouraging inappropriate use of the library?
Have the police remove persons who are sleeping or using the library to 
bathe?
Suggest that patrons start a shelter for the homeless?41
2.	New technologies often pose new ethical challenges. Recently many librari­
ans have ­adopted the use of radio-­frequency identification (RFID) tags in their 
collections in order to deter theft, track materials, and check out books faster. 
However, ­because the tags collect personally identifiable information ­there have 
been concerns raised that ­because this technology provides the means to moni­
tor the reading habits of individuals, it may compromise ­free speech, as ­free 
speech depends on a right to read with relative anonymity. Concerns have also 
been expressed around the potential for inferences to be made about a patron’s 
lifestyle, sexual orientation, politics, ­etc., based on their reading habits. Although 
librarians ­were able to track reading patterns before, the RFID tags have the 
potential to be more invasive, intrusive, and pervasive, while being less vis­i­ble, 
and they also offer greater detail and granularity of data.42
RFID is just one example of a technology that has the potential to be used 
in an unethical manner in a library. If you ­were a library man­ag­er considering 
implementing RFID technology in your library, what steps would you want to 
take to ensure that the technology was used in an ethical manner?

back in his chair, stretched his arms overhead, and looked out the win­dow. It

Discussion Questions
1.	 It often has been said that reputation is how ­others perceive you and that char­
acter is how you act when no one is watching. Is it inevitable for ­people to behave 
differently when they are being observed by ­others, or does the truly ethical 
person always behave the same way?
2.	Albert Einstein once said, “Relativity applies to physics, not ethics.” Do you 
agree with this statement? Are ethical princi­ples always the same or do they 
change with the situation?
3.	 Ethical codes do not have to be long or elaborate. Consider Google’s motto, “­Don’t 
be evil.” Is this enough of an ethical code to guide employees’ be­hav­ior?
4.	Providing references for a current or former employee sometimes puts super­
visors in an awkward situation. If you ­were a man­ag­er who had one particularly 
difficult and in­effec­tive member of your team, and you received a request for a 
reference for that individual for a new position in another organ­ization, would 
you write a good reference to get rid of the troublesome employee or would you 
tell the truth?
was a warm and sunny Indian-­summer day. “What a day to be inside!” he said. 
With considerable reluctance, he spun his chair around and was about to return 
to his papers when Preston Hatch put his head into the room.
“Have a minute, Drew?” the Mayor asked, perkily. “Sure,” smiled the library 
director, “Glad to see you. ­Won’t you sit down, Preston?” He ­didn’t know the 
Mayor well, but they ­were on a first-­name basis. Hodges studied him with ques­
tioning eyes, his hand reaching for the remainder of his coffee. Hatch spoke: 
“My ­daughter, Lisa, applied for a page’s job at the beginning of September, and 
yesterday she stopped by to see the circulation head to find out when she would 
be starting. Ms. Wren told her that she was number 18 on the waiting list and 
that it would be quite some time before she would be called.”
The dim thought at the back of the director’s mind: “­You’re about to ask a 
­favor of me. I can tell.” But he kept his own counsel. The Mayor continued: “Would 
you personally look into this and see if she ­can’t be moved up on the list? She’s 
in her final year of high school, and she’s saving to go away to college next year. 
She’s bright and a ­really reliable kid. I’d appreciate it if you’d move her to the 
top of the list.”
What is the prob­lem ­here and what would you do?
4.	The ethical dilemma below was posted by an LIS student to the PUBLIB Elec­
tronic Discussion List:
The library you work for has just agreed to pay all your expenses for the 
ALA conference. You have been in your current position for six years and feel it 
is time to move on. The ALA conference ­will be a ­great place to job hunt and 
interview. Your employer has no idea this is part of your plan. Is ­there any­
thing wrong with interviewing at the conference?43 Would you consider it ethi­
cal to interview for another job at a conference where your attendance was paid 
for by your current employer? Why do you think this?

Orga­nizational 
Communication
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the importance of communication in modern organ­izations
•	 Be familiar with the vari­ous types of “noise” that keep communication from 
being understood
•	 Be aware of the many channels that can be used in orga­nizational communication
•	 Know the three ways communication can flow within an organ­ization
•	 Understand the difference between formal and informal communication
•	 Be able to identify the ­causes of conflict and know how conflict can be used con­
structively in the workplace
To be an effective orga­nizational leader, you need to be able to communicate 
well with ­others, both with individuals who work within the same organ­
ization and with members of your organ­ization’s external constituencies. In 
2016, the editors of Library Journal polled a group of prominent library direc­
tors and asked them what skills they thought ­were most essential for new 
librarians. Skill in communication was mentioned by almost ­every respon­
dent.1 In another recent survey conducted by ­career ser­vices professionals, 
man­ag­ers in all types of organ­izations stated that the ability to communicate 
with ­people inside and outside of the organ­ization was the most impor­tant 
skill that they look for in applicants for positions in their organ­izations.2
Communication competence is impor­tant at all levels from new employ­
ees to top man­ag­ers. Since at least 1938, when Chester Barnard identified 

386  Leading
the main task of an executive as that of communication, it has been com­
monly accepted that communication is a critical skill for any man­ag­er. Bar­
nard viewed communication as the means by which ­people in an organ­ization 
are linked together in order to achieve a central purpose.3 Most man­ag­ers 
spend a large part of their time communicating with other ­people; some esti­
mates of the percentage of time a man­ag­er spends in communication range 
as high as 95 ­percent. In his classic study of managerial be­hav­ior, Henry 
Mintzberg found that the greatest amount of a man­ag­er’s time was spent 
engaging in verbal communication, both on the telephone, and in meetings.4
­Today orga­nizational communication is much more complex than it was 
when Mintzberg wrote ­because of the ever-­increasing number of available 
communication options. In libraries 50 years ago, ­there ­were many fewer 
communication options; face-­to-­face conversation, written documents such as 
letters and memos, and telephone calls ­were the primary ways that employ­
ees communicated. Even 25 years ago, e-­mail was considered a relatively new 
method of communication, and many organ­izations ­were still experiment­
ing with the most effective ways to use e-­mail both internally and externally. 
­Today, e-­mail is one of the dominant forms of communication in all organ­
izations, but many organ­izations, including libraries, are utilizing newer 
channels of communication such as instant messaging (IM), text messaging, 
Twitter, wikis, and blogs. As a result, man­ag­ers need to be familiar with a 
large number of types of communication and also must know which channel 
is most appropriate to transmit the messages they want to convey.
With the availability of myriad types of communication, how man­ag­ers 
communicate has become more critical than ever before. In ­today’s organ­
izations, every­one has to be an effective communicator, and communication 
has to be both a leadership function and a responsibility of all employees. In 
this function as in most, the man­ag­ers set the tone and are responsible for 
paying close attention to all the communication flows within the organ­ization. 
All man­ag­ers should strive to create an organ­ization that is characterized 
by clear and open communication ­because it ­will increase productivity and 
trust and decrease stress among all employees.
Many man­ag­ers think that communicating is a ­simple pro­cess. ­After all, 
they have been ­doing it all their lives, and they spend the majority of their 
time on this task. Unfortunately, despite all this practice, man­ag­ers do not 
always communicate as effectively as they think they do. Poor communica­
tion is a major source of frustration in many organ­izations, and usually man­
ag­ers are unaware that their communication techniques are not effective. 
As Whyte once so aptly remarked, “The ­great ­enemy of communication, we 
find, is the illusion of it.”5 However, all man­ag­ers can learn to be more effec­
tive communicators, and this chapter ­will provide guidance about how to 
encourage effective communication within the organ­ization.
The chapter provides an overview of the complex topic of orga­nizational 
communication and discusses why man­ag­ers should make it a priority. It 
first examines the importance of communication as a function within an 
organ­ization. Types of communication and ways to promote effective commu­
nication ­will then be discussed. The chapter ­will close with a discussion of 
conflict, which often is the result of poor communication, and look at some of 
the ways conflict can be minimized and managed.

Orga­nizational Communication  387
The Importance of 
Orga­nizational Communication
Orga­nizational communication is a subfield of the larger field of general 
communication; simply put, orga­nizational communication refers to commu­
nication that takes place within the setting of an organ­ization. ­Every organ­
ization needs to communicate with both outside interests and with the ­people 
who work within the organ­ization.7 Orga­nizational communication occurs 
within a complex, open system. It involves messages and their flow, purpose, 
direction, and media; just as it involves ­people and their attitudes, feelings, 
relationships, and skills.8
Communication is not just something that occurs in organ­izations; 
communication is the glue that binds all of the parts of the organ­ization 
together and allows it to achieve its goals and purposes. Communication 
provides orga­nizational cohesiveness and direction. In fact, communication 
is often viewed as the lifeblood of the organ­ization, an essential ele­ment sim­
ilar to the circulatory system in the ­human body. Bavels and Barrett argue 
that communication is the very essence of the organ­ization and the basic 
function from which every­thing ­else that happens in the organ­ization derives.9 
Communication effectiveness thus becomes a vital ­factor in determining 
the efficiency and effectiveness of an organ­ization as a ­whole. Indeed, with­
out communication, organ­izations would cease to exist; as Mumby states, 
Management on the Job: Albertsons Library, 
Boise State University
Libraries have always communicated with their patrons, but the meteoric rise in the use 
of social media in the last de­cade has provided a new method of communication being 
used increasingly by libraries of all types. Boise State University has an enrollment of 
approximately 20,000 students, and since 2005, its library has used social media such 
as Twitter and library blogs to communicate with its patrons. Results from a recent 
student survey inspired the staff of Albertsons Library to increase its social media out­
reach, and ­today the library also uses Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest.
Effective use of social media tools is not a job for one person; ­there is a constant need 
to create and update content. Albertsons Library has a team of ­people who contribute 
to the organ­ization’s social media presence. Although ­these individuals lead the effort, 
­others on the staff are encouraged to contribute, which creates buy-in and support across 
the library as well as continuity of ser­vice. Student workers at the library are also 
encouraged to post to the library’s Facebook page. To mea­sure the effectiveness of its social 
media outreach, the library uses vari­ous tools to provide metrics that indicate how suc­
cessful each of the platforms are at reaching patrons.
Although Albertsons Library was ahead of the rest of Boise State University when 
it began adopting social media, it now collaborates with other units on campus, and this 
collaboration has enriched the social media presence of the library. Social media provides 
an increasingly impor­tant way for libraries to communicate with and meet the needs of 
their users, and the librarians at Albertsons Library are providing a good example of effec­
tive ways to use social media.6
How do the libraries with which you are familiar use social media? Can you think 
of ways they might extend their use of social media or use it more effectively?

“Organ­izations are not simply physical containers within which ­people com­
municate, rather organ­izations exist ­because they communicate.”10
It is not surprising that in knowledge organ­izations, such as libraries, 
communication is so impor­tant. Employees in ­these organ­izations are con­
stantly involved in the absorption and dissemination of information and 
ideas. In fact, they are subject to so much communication available through 
so many channels that they frequently suffer from information overload, 
confusion, and stress, ­because they receive more information than they can 
assimilate. As a result, many find it hard to filter out what is impor­tant from 
what is not, and they often feel distracted from their ­actual work. As Cowan 
puts it:
With the faster and more extensive information flows we witness 
day in and day out, we are realizing that information flows are in 
effect a flood—of e-­mails, information, attachments, requests and 
all sorts of unsorted data. We are left with the most troubling 
question in modern communications: how to cope? This is not 
simply a question of pro­cessing large quantities more efficiently in 
communications terms; it is also a question of how the brain copes 
with all this information and the demands on our attention.11
­Today information overload is also increased ­because orga­nizational com­
munication is no longer confined to the workplace. With the growing popular­
ity of smartphones, many employees are seldom out of range of orga­nizational 
­TABLE 16.1. Examples of Communication in a Library
•	 The head of the cata­loging department has scheduled a per­for­mance review 
for a beginning cata­loger ­later ­today. The new cata­loger has an unacceptably 
high error rate, and the department head is contemplating how she can convey 
the need for improvement without discouraging the new employee.
•	 The librarians in the instruction department are discussing the best way to 
alert faculty and students about a new user instruction program being 
implemented next semester. They are especially concerned about the large 
number of distance-­education students and won­der how they can most 
effectively inform ­these off-­campus users.
•	 In the reference department, the only librarian on duty is trying to respond 
both to patrons lined up at the desk and ­those using chat reference.
•	 A newly hired librarian has just learned that his ­sister is ­going to be married in 
a distant state in a few weeks and has scheduled a meeting with his supervisor 
for ­later ­today. He wants to request a week’s leave so he can attend the wedding 
but knows he ­doesn’t yet have any vacation time accrued. He is a bit ner­vous 
about asking his supervisor for the leave, which ­will occur at an especially busy 
time of the year.
•	 In the archives department, the archivists are planning to update the depart­
ment’s Facebook page. They are competing with the archivists at a neighbor­
ing library to see which page can get the most “likes” from Facebook users.
•	 In the library’s administrative suite, the director has just received news from 
the university president that the library’s bud­get ­will be cut next year by 
another 5 ­percent as a result of a legislative bud­get reduction. She is con­
cerned about the best way to convey this message to the library’s employees, 
especially to ­those who have been worried that they might be laid off if ­there 
­were another bud­get cut.

communication, and ­there is no longer a clear dividing line between profes­
sional and personal communication. No won­der many workers feel overwhelm­
ing stress as a result.
A Model of Communication
At first glance, it appears that communication should be ­simple. ­After all, 
we all communicate ­every day, and we all have been ­doing it since we learned 
to talk (actually, before we learned to talk), but what at first glance seems 
­simple is actually quite complex. It is a pro­cess composed of many ­factors. 
A number of models of the communication pro­cess have been developed to 
help explicate it. Although ­these models vary, they typically include the fol­
lowing components:
•	 Source: This is the sender of the message. The source has some 
thought, need, or information to communicate.
•	 Message: The source has to encode the message in some form that 
can be understood by both sender and receiver.
•	 Channel: The channel is the link between the source and the 
receiver. The message is transmitted over the channel. A channel can 
take many forms; for instance, a telephone is an example of a chan­
nel that can be used to link the source and the receiver.
•	 Receiver: The receiver is the recipient of the message, who must 
decode the message for it to be understood.
•	 Noise: Noise is anything that hinders communication. Noise may 
occur in the source, the message, the channel, or the receiver. For 
instance, if the receiver cannot understand the message, noise has 
occurred. This could be ­because the message contains ambiguous 
phrases, ­there is static on the channel, or the message is in a lan­
guage not understood by the receiver. Even the simplest communi­
cation is filled with opportunities for noise to obscure the message.
•	 Feedback: ­After the receiver receives and decodes the message, the 
receiver can become a source and provide feedback by encoding and 
sending a message through some channel back to the original source. 
Feedback is a response to the original message. Feedback is always 
useful, ­because it allows the original source to know if the message 
was properly encoded, transmitted, decoded, and understood. It is this 
feedback loop that is the difference between one-­way and two-­way 
communication. One-­way communication is almost never as effec­
tive as two-­way communication ­because the sender has no way of 
knowing if the message was received and understood.
To illustrate this model, imagine a library director wanting to let a depart­
ment head know about an impor­tant meeting. The library director would be 
the source of the communication. When the library director provides infor­
mation about the meeting in the form of an e-­mail, that e-­mail would be the 
message. The channel employed for the communication would be the library’s 
e-­mail system. The receiver is the department head who receives the mes­
sage and reads it. If the e-­mail system crashes or if the e-­mail message goes 
into the department head’s spam filter, that would be noise. The feedback 

390  Leading
would be the response the department head sends the library director about 
the meeting. The ele­ments in this ­simple communication model are illus­
trated in figure 16.1.
Barriers to Clear Communication
One of the biggest barriers to good communication is the fact that often 
­people communicate without listening. Listening is more than hearing; it 
demands focus and attention, unlike hearing, which refers only to the ability 
to hear sounds. In ­today’s high-­tech, fast-­moving organ­izations, good listen­
ing is more impor­tant than ever. Unfortunately, man­ag­ers often feel that 
they do not have the time to spend on ­really listening to what ­others say.
Good listeners hear more than words; they also concentrate on the tone 
of voice and on nonverbal clues. Good listeners know that they cannot ­really 
listen to someone while ­doing something else—­listening is not a multi-­
tasking activity but demands full attention and the maintenance of eye con­
tact. The best listeners practice what is known as “active listening”; they 
concentrate on what the speaker is saying and then repeat what they think 
the speaker has said. This repetition permits the speaker to restate or fur­
ther explain something that has not been correctly understood. Rephrasing 
a speaker’s message is not as impor­tant when the message being transmit­
ted is very ­simple or routine, but it is extremely impor­tant in situations where 
­there is conflict or where ­people’s emotions have become involved. In ­every 
situation, however, good listening helps to improve relationships, build under­
standing, and prevent and resolve conflicts.
FIGURE 16.1. A Model of the Communication Pro­cess

Orga­nizational Communication  391
However, good listening ­will not eliminate all communication prob­lems, 
and man­ag­ers should never assume that all workers ­will understand the 
messages they transmit. Barriers or noise may occur at any stage in the com­
munication pro­gress and cause the message to become distorted or unintel­
ligible. Some of ­these barriers may be physical, for instance when a work area 
is a noisy “cube farm,” and it is hard to hear conversations. Some may be phys­
iological, for instance when someone has a hearing or vision prob­lem. Many 
of ­these barriers are a result of the increasing diversity of our workforce. Stud­
ies have shown that dif­fer­ent generations, ethnic groups, and genders have 
dif­fer­ent styles of communication.
Generational Differences
The workforce now includes four generations of employees: veterans 
(born before 1946), baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), generation 
Xers (born between 1965–1980), and millennials (born ­after 1980). ­Because 
­these generations have dif­fer­ent values, dif­fer­ent ways of getting ­things done, 
and dif­fer­ent ways of communicating, it is not surprising that this can be a 
source of confusion and conflict. As anyone who has interacted with ­people 
from dif­fer­ent generations ­will attest, ­there are communication differences 
among ­these generations, and generally speaking, each generation has its 
preferences about how it wishes to receive and transmit information. Prob­
lems sometimes arise when ­these differences are not understood. Younger 
workers are typically more casual in their communication style and are very 
comfortable with constant, real-­time communication. Some younger workers 
have been surprised to learn that many of their older coworkers do not con­
sider a text message an appropriate method of communication on the job. The 
most effective man­ag­ers have learned how to use dif­fer­ent styles of commu­
nication to get their message across to workers of dif­fer­ent ages.12 Learning 
how to communicate with the dif­fer­ent generations helps promote a work­
place with fewer misunderstandings and confrontations.
Gender Differences
A number of studies have focused on gender differences in communica­
tion; ­these studies have uniformly found that men’s and ­women’s communi­
cation styles vary. This variation is based on dif­fer­ent values assimilated 
almost from birth by males and females, values that are inculcated both by 
parental reinforcement and by the games played by young girls and boys. 
Typically, young males are taught to prize status, in­de­pen­dence, and indi­
vidual power, but females are taught to value connection, interdependence, 
and the power of community. As a result, in general, feminine communication 
focuses on building relationships, creating equality, and offering support. 
Feminine communication is often more tentative than masculine communi­
cation. ­Women are more likely to “use hedges (e.g., ‘I sort of think that plan 
is dangerous’), qualifiers (e.g., ‘I ­don’t have much experience with this issue, 
but . . .’), and tag questions (e.g., ‘The weather is ­really nice, ­isn’t it?’).”13 
Although ­women’s communication style is sometimes characterized as being 
unassertive and weak, it is more inclusive in inviting ­others to join the con­
versation. In contrast, the masculine communication style, which is favored 
by a majority of men, is more abstract and more emotionally constricted than 
the communication style favored by most ­women. It is characterized by being 
direct, controlling, and dominant. Men typically are more objective and focus 
on facts rather than on feelings.14 As a result, this type of communication 

392  Leading
Talk About It
Deborah Tannen writes that the viewpoints of “individuals who are not as tenacious as 
­others about standing their ground, do not speak as forcefully at meetings, or do not 
begin with a high level of credibility, as a result of rank, regional or ethnic style differ­
ences, or personality, regardless of ­whether they are female or male” are often disre­
garded in the workplace.16
Can you think of times when you or someone ­else has been reluctant to voice opin­
ions or have had their opinions overlooked in a group conversation? If some individuals 
are consistently disregarded, what is the result for the individual and for the group? 
What can be done to ensure that all voices are heard in group conversations?
sounds authoritative and confident. Neither of ­these two communication 
styles is inherently better, but they are dif­fer­ent, and the resulting differ­
ences can often cause misunderstanding in the workplace.
Ethnic Differences
Dif­fer­ent ethnic groups also have dif­fer­ent styles of communication. For 
example, in some cultures, it is considered rude to maintain eye contact with 
someone while they are speaking. Some cultures encourage interruption. 
Cultures differ on many other variables, such as the preferred amount of per­
sonal space between communicators and how much touch is permissible. As 
our workplaces become more diversified, man­ag­ers need to understand the 
cultural differences that may affect communication flows. ­These differences 
are often more than linguistic and, instead, are frequently sociopo­liti­cal and 
attitudinal in nature. Every­one should try to be aware of the cultural biases 
that may impede his or her communication and interactions with ­others.15
Jargon
Another barrier that often gets in the way of communication is the use 
of jargon. Jargon is the specialized language developed by individuals in 
groups, and each profession tends to have its own jargon. That is certainly true 
of librarianship. Think of all the acronyms and technical terms that are 
associated with the library profession. ACRL, ARL, ALA, AASL, ASIS&T, 
ASCII, ALCS, abstracts, acquisitions, accessions, and authority control are 
just a few of the ones that begin with the letter A. Even within the profession, 
not ­every individual understands all of ­these terms, and when librarians 
begin to communicate with nonlibrarians, it is not surprising that the non­
librarians are often completely befuddled. Using the language of the com­
munication model presented earlier, it is easy for anyone who understands 
the jargon to encode it in a message, but it is much more difficult for receivers 
to decode if they are not familiar with the jargon. ­Because jargon has the 
potential of creating noise, it should be avoided ­unless it is absolutely certain 
that the receiver ­will understand it.
Types of Communication
Communication can be classified in many ways: one way is to use the 
common categories of written, electronic, oral, and nonverbal. Each of ­these 

Orga­nizational Communication  393
types of communication plays a specific role in orga­nizational communica­
tion, and each has certain associated advantages and disadvantages.
The truly skilled communicator knows how to pick the right communi­
cation channel or medium with which to communicate, and the choice is 
usually based on the degree of information richness, which is defined as the 
information-­carrying capacity of an item of data. Dif­fer­ent media vary in 
degree of richness; a rich medium is one that conveys a ­great deal of infor­
mation, whereas a lean medium is one that conveys the bare minimum.17 
Figure 16.2 shows a classification of dif­fer­ent types of communication media 
according to their richness. Face-­to-­face communication is the richest in terms 
of information conveyed ­because it relies on multiple channels (e.g., words, 
body language, facial gestures) to reinforce the message. In addition, face-­to-­
face communication provides an opportunity for immediate feedback.
Written Communication
Formal channels of command often require written communication. 
Although most electronic communication is “written” electronically, ­here 
written communication is defined as communication that is actually put on 
paper or created as an attachment that is intended to be printed. Although 
the “paperless” office has been talked about for more than 50 years, most of 
­today’s businesses still rely on creating and preserving a large number of 
written rec­ords. ­These written communications can include letters, reports, 
directives, and policies. Written communication has some obvious advan­
tages. It ensures uniformity in ­matters like policy and provides a lasting 
rec­ord. In cases such as disciplinary or ­legal issues, man­ag­ers almost always 
rely on written communication so they can create a “paper trail” to provide 
FIGURE 16.2. A Classification of Types of Media According to Their 
Communication Richness

394  Leading
evidence of what was done in case the decision or action might ever be ques­
tioned. However, sometimes written communication is badly flawed; it may 
be poorly written, may not fully explain the action desired, or may not com­
pletely define the scope of the prob­lem. Employees may be left with ambigu­
ous instructions. When words used in this type of communication are unclear 
and ill-­defined, prob­lems arise ­because written communication allows no 
opportunity for immediate feedback and clarification. Hence, it may take a 
long time to know if the message has been received and understood.
Although ­there is still a reliance on paper, an increasing number of 
organ­izations are trying to be environmentally responsible and reduce their 
use of paper. However, ­there are still many ­people who like to have so-­called 
hard copies of documents, thus the prediction of the paperless office has yet 
to be fulfilled. Nonetheless, the routine, day-­to-­day communication within 
organ­izations is now increasingly handled electronically.
Electronic Communication
The advent of electronic communication has revolutionized orga­nizational 
communication. The vast bulk of internal communication within an organ­
ization now occurs by e-­mail, instant messaging, or text messaging. ­Those 
methods are also used to communicate externally with vari­ous institutional 
constituents. In addition, more and more organ­izations are relying on social 
media as an impor­tant method of communicating externally. Most libraries 
now use communication channels such as Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pin­
terest, wikis, and blogs, to communicate with patrons and to raise their vis­
ibility in the community. Although the majority of the use of social media by 
libraries has been to communicate with external constituencies, ­there are 
increasing numbers that are using social media for communication within 
the library or with other LIS professionals externally.18 This use of social 
media is expected to increase in the ­future as librarians become more famil­
iar with its advantages.
Although millennial employees are known to prefer other methods of 
electronic communication, e-­mail still remains the mainstay of electronic 
communication within organ­izations. In 2016, over 215 billion e-­mails ­were 
sent and received per day and that number is projected to grow at an annual 
rate of more than 4.6 ­percent in the ­future, with the total increasing to over 
257 billion messages per day in 2020.19 The use of e-­mail on mobile devices 
is also growing at a rapid rate allowing users to access their accounts both 
at work and on the go.
E-­mail popularity is understandable. It is rapid, cost-­efficient, and allows 
for a rec­ord of the interaction. But ­there are disadvantages to e-­mail also. 
The sheer amount of e-­mail sent each day has resulted in many ­people suf­
fering from e-­mail overload which may negatively impact their productivity. 
A recent study reported in the Washington Post looked at the e-­mail habits 
of more than 1,000 white collar workers in the United States and found ­these 
workers spend an average of 4.1 hours checking e-­mail each day! As the study 
points out, ­people are spending more time than ever on e-­mail, and ­people 
increasingly expect their correspondents to responds in hours, if not minutes. 
As a result, many workers feel they must constantly check their e-­mail 
boxes.20
Although e-­mail is con­ve­nient, it pres­ents its own set of communication 
difficulties ­because despite its popularity ­there are still fewer “rules” gov­
erning its use. Codes of manners are well established concerning face-­to-­face 
or telephone communication. No such niceties exist in the e-­mail world, where

conflicts and misunderstanding often arise ­because of quick, thoughtless 
e-­mails. E-­mail messages are often misinterpreted and can cause offense 
­because they do not provide ­either visual or voice cues nor do they allow for 
feedback.
Other prob­lems with e-­mail arise ­because employees do not separate 
their orga­nizational and personal use of the Internet or e-­mail. It is very com­
mon for employees to use their work e-­mail for personal use, and over a 
third of workers admit that they regularly surf the Internet while at work.21 
Employees sometimes write inappropriate or defamatory e-­mail that may 
pose a potential ­legal liability to the employer. Users are often surprised to 
learn that e-­mail is not necessarily private or completely destroyed when they 
press the delete key, instead the message remains and can be resurrected 
with vari­ous software.22 Just as organ­izations usually have policies relating 
to the use of telephones, fax machines, and mail, ­there should be policies in 
place concerning the appropriate use of the Internet and e-­mail, and ­there 
should also be policies in place concerning the retention and preservation of 
e-­mail communication.
Without a doubt, channels of electronic communication have produced a 
major impact on the flow of communication within the organ­ization. ­Because 
the use of ­these channels is more informal than writing a letter and less 
threatening than a face-­to-­face conversation, some workers use them to com­
municate not only to workers on their own level but upward in the organ­
ization, to immediate supervisors and to man­ag­ers even higher up in the 
orga­nizational structure. Some employees are using e-­mail messages or 
social media sites to publicly raise complaints against organ­izations and 
their practices. New information technologies are relaxing many, if not most,

A series of recent e-­mail attacks on po­liti­cal figures have made many ­people reconsider 
how they use this very common method of communication. ­After the e-­mail account of 
former Secretary of State Colin Powell was hacked in 2016, it was reported that millions 
of ­people across the country ­were sensing that e-­mail made them vulnerable and ­were 
scanning their e-­mail and deleting any messages that could be construed as “compro­
mising, humiliating or career-­destroying.” Since most of the hacks to date have been on 
politicians, it is not surprising that “the soul searching is happening with a special 
urgency in Washington, DC where email accounts burst with strategies, delicate po­liti­cal 
proposals, gossipy whispers and banal details of girlfriends, husbands, bank accounts 
and shopping lists.”23 Although it has long been realized that e-­mails are not a secure 
means of transmission, and that nothing on the Internet is private, still individuals 
often put ­things into e-­mail messages that they would be embarrassed to have distributed 
widely. Also, it is well known that many employees use their orga­nizational e-­mail for 
personal reasons.
You are the director of IT at a large library and the library director has asked you 
to meet with him to discuss the library’s e-­mail policy. ­There has not been a written pol­
icy in the past, ­because it was assumed that all employees would use electronic resources 
responsibly. You know that many employees do use their work e-­mail accounts for per­
sonal reasons but have overlooked this ­because you have not considered it a prob­lem. 
However, both you and the director think that it is time to institute a policy that ­will 
protect the library and its employees. Although it is unlikely that the library’s e-­mail 
­will be hacked, what other prob­lems might be averted by a comprehensive policy? What 
would you include in this policy and how would you (or would you) ensure that it was 
followed by employees?
of the old communication constraints and are bringing vast changes to how 
employees within organ­izations communicate with each other and the out­
side world.
Oral Communication
Oral communication, conducted through individuals or groups, usually 
is considered to be the richest communication medium, but it also has prob­
lems. Oral communication can be time-­consuming, especially when many 
­people need to be told individually about something. And unlike written com­
munication, oral statements are not preserved. Not all oral messages are 
clearly stated. The prob­lem of the ambiguous or misunderstood word remains, 
but in oral communication ­there is an opportunity for feedback through which 
clarification can be accomplished. Face-­to-­face oral communication also pro­
vides an opportunity for nonverbal communication to help amplify a message. 
Oral communication often is the best way to resolve conflict situations and 
to deal with highly emotional issues.
Nonverbal Communication
Nonverbal communication is any type of communication that is not spo­
ken or written. Nonverbal communication consists of vari­ous types of body 
language, such as facial cues, hand or arm gestures, or posture. Nonverbal 
cues also are provided by ­things such as dress and the positioning of furniture 

Orga­nizational Communication  397
in an office. This type of communication can provide many clues to an observer; 
as the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. Some examples of 
strong nonverbal communication include: avoiding eye contact, staring, sigh­
ing, and vari­ous body postures, such as hands on hips or crossing of arms.
Nonverbal communication can contradict, supplement, substitute for, or 
complement verbal communication. A man­ag­er must be especially careful 
that nonverbal signals do not contradict verbal ones. For instance, consider 
a supervisor who claims to have an open-­door policy and who encourages 
employees to come to him to discuss any prob­lems that they may encounter. 
Imagine the nonverbal message that is sent if an employee enters the super­
visor’s office to discuss a prob­lem only to find that the supervisor continues 
to work, does not look up, and fails to establish any type of eye contact with 
that employee. The supervisor’s verbal invitation to feel ­free to come in to dis­
cuss prob­lems is contradicted by the power­ful nonverbal message encountered 
when the employee accepts the invitation.
Nonverbal be­hav­ior is vital to the pro­cess of clear communication. Its 
importance is realized anytime ­people communicate using nonface-­to-­face 
methods such as e-­mail. Misunderstandings often occur ­because of the lack 
of nonverbal communication clues.
Choosing the Best Channel for Communication
­Today’s man­ag­ers have a choice of many dif­fer­ent ways to communicate. 
A good rule of thumb is to use channels that are communication rich (such 
as face-­to-­face) for nonroutine messages and to use leaner media for routine, 
­simple messages.24 Complex, highly impor­tant messages should be commu­
nicated by information-­rich media to be sure that the issues are clearly 
understood, but it is a waste of time to use information-­rich media to convey 
routine messages. For instance, a supervisor would never want to tell an indi­
vidual through an e-­mail message that he or she was being disciplined, but 
an e-­mail would be a perfectly appropriate method of telling a subordinate 
the dates a man­ag­er ­will be on a trip out of town.
What­ever channel is chosen, the man­ag­er must be sure to use language 
that is clear and unambiguous. Whenever pos­si­ble, man­ag­ers should try to 
provide a way to allow employees to ask about any areas of uncertainty, 
­because noise can easily distort a message’s meaning.
Communication Flows
As discussed above, communication within an organ­ization is transmit­
ted by many dif­fer­ent channels. This communication, regardless of channel, 
may flow in three directions: down, up, or horizontally. To function most 
effectively, organ­izations need to encourage communication flows in all of 
­these directions.
Downward Communication
Downward communication, or communication that flows from superiors 
to subordinates, is found in all organ­izations. This type of communication is 
­under the control of the man­ag­er and follows the chain of command within 
the organ­ization. Man­ag­ers use this type of communication flow to trans­
mit information to employees at a lower level who need to know how to per­
form their jobs and meet per­for­mance expectations. Some common types of 

398  Leading
downward communication are directives or instruction about the job, 
information designed to provide an understanding of a specific task and the 
relationship of that task to other orga­nizational tasks, information about 
orga­nizational procedures and practices, feedback to subordinates about 
per­for­mance; and information that communicates the organ­ization’s mis­
sion and vision. Sometimes ­these communications are the so-­called “difficult 
conversations,” when a supervisor has to convey an unwelcome message to a 
subordinate. ­These difficult conversations can be on a wide variety of topics 
ranging from telling someone that he or she is not performing adequately to 
informing an employee that he or she ­will be laid off ­because of bud­get cut­
backs. This type of communication is dreaded by most supervisors, but dif­
ficult conversations are an inevitable part of being a man­ag­er.25
Although employees expect to receive communication from their man­
ag­ers, prob­lems often are associated with downward communication in an 
organ­ization. The first is that man­ag­ers in many organ­izations rely too heavi­ly 
on one-­way communication such as e-­mail messages to diffuse downward 
communication, even when personal contact and face-­to-­face communication 
might be more effective. Second, some supervisors use too much downward 
communication, and the sheer volume results in message overload. ­Because 
of the ease of sending messages via e-­mail and by photocopied documents, 
some employees are continually bombarded with memos, bulletins, letters, 
announcements, and policy statements. Many employees who are inundated 
with too many messages respond by not reading any of them. Communica­
tion also can be hampered by poor timing. Communication transmitted late 
Friday after­noons or just before a major holiday is often disregarded. Fi­nally, 
­there is always the prob­lem of filtering of information. Downward communi­
cation usually goes through several layers as it follows the chain of com­
mand down the organ­ization, thus messages may be changed, shortened, or 
lengthened, and some employees may not receive a message at all.
Upward Communication
An equally impor­tant flow, upward communication, consists of all the 
communication that flows from subordinates to superiors. Most of ­these mes­
sages ask questions, provide feedback, or make suggestions. Man­ag­ers in an 
organ­ization that is inhospitable to upward communication often inhibit such 
communication, despite the fact that upward communication is essential to 
an organ­ization’s effectiveness. Even in organ­izations with man­ag­ers who 
pride themselves on their open-­door policy, it is not uncommon to find employ­
ees who are afraid to take information to their superiors, especially when 
that information concerns prob­lems or difficult situations. Often they do not 
want to pass along bad news or point out shortcomings. Employees are more 
likely to send upward messages that enhance their own status or credibility 
and are much less likely to send up messages that make them look bad.
Practice Your Skills
Employees often find it difficult to communicate with a boss especially when they have a 
request to make or a complaint. You are a first-­line supervisor, and it is time for your 
annual per­for­mance appraisal. One issue you would like to address with your boss is 
your need for timely information. Twice in the last month you failed to appear at crucial 

Orga­nizational Communication  399
It takes a certain amount of courage for workers, especially lower-­level 
workers, to approach their supervisors. A man­ag­er has status and prestige, 
often talks and dresses differently from lower-­status workers (although this 
is less true in knowledge-­based organ­izations), and has more practice in com­
munication skills. For that reason, ­there is often ­little upward communica­
tion in an organ­ization ­unless the man­ag­er encourages it.
Man­ag­ers who want to benefit from the flow of upward communication 
should be sensitive to the barriers that can be placed in the way of such com­
munications. If man­ag­ers want to remove some of the barriers, they must be 
sympathetic listeners and make a practice of encouraging informal contacts 
with workers. Some methods commonly used to achieve upward communi­
cation include grievance procedures, suggestion boxes, focus groups, hotlines, 
group meetings, opinion surveys, and informal meetings between the man­
ag­er and workers. In addition, man­ag­ers should remember that the same sort 
of filtering and misinterpreting that is found in downward communication 
is also prevalent in upward communication.
Horizontal Communication
Horizontal communication is the lateral or diagonal exchange of infor­
mation that is shared among ­people at the same level on the orga­nizational 
hierarchy; this type of communication may occur within or across depart­
ments and is the primary means used to coordinate or tie together activities 
within or across orga­nizational subunits. In ­today’s flatter, team-­based 
organ­izations, horizontal communication is more impor­tant than it ever was 
in the past and is critical in areas such as task coordination, prob­lem solv­
ing, information sharing, and conflict resolution.
Several ­factors tend to limit horizontal communication. In some organ­
izations, it may be discouraged by upper level man­ag­ers who feel they ­will 
have a greater prob­lem in maintaining tight control with an increase in hor­
izontal communication. Information is not always shared in competitive 
organ­izations ­because employees who possess the information want to retain 
a competitive advantage over ­others. Specialization also impedes horizontal 
meetings ­because your boss did not communicate the date and time to you. Then just 
two weeks ago, your boss neglected to give you a copy of the new vacation/sick leave policy 
that you had planned to discuss with your staff in the weekly meeting. You are finding 
it increasingly difficult to act as a supervisor when you are kept in the dark about the 
basic policies you are expected to implement. You have just received your written evalu­
ation, and you ­were astounded to see that your boss awarded you “Superior” ratings in 
­every category except one. You have been rated as only average in “Effectiveness with 
­Others,” and this rating concerns you ­because you pride yourself on your ability to get 
along with ­others. When you ask your boss for more clarification, you receive the reply 
that recently many of the ­people you supervise have been complaining that you failed to 
pass on crucial information. Several of your subordinates ­were very upset last week 
when they discovered they had filled out their vacation leave requests incorrectly. They 
stated that you had failed to fulfill your supervisory duty by communicating the new 
policy to them.
Find a partner. One of you should role-­play the disgruntled supervisor and the other 
the boss. Then reverse the roles. Was it hard to bring your complaint to the boss? What 
did the boss say to make it easier/harder?

Talk About It
“Information is power” is a phrase that is used so often that it has become a cliché. 
Nonetheless, it is undoubtedly true that any individual who is able to regulate the flow 
of information within an organ­ization can derive much control and power from this 
ability. In ­today’s knowledge organ­izations what prob­lems arise from constricting the 
flow of information? Why do man­ag­ers sometimes fear the results of allowing informa­
tion to flow outside the formal channels? How can man­ag­ers be encouraged to permit 
the ­free flow of information across all levels of the organ­izations?
communication. Most organ­izations are subdivided into specialized sub­
units, and members of ­these subunits may want to further their own subunit’s 
goals rather than communicate with other man­ag­ers in order to advance 
orga­nizational goals. In addition, excessive specialization may make it dif­
ficult for members of one subunit to understand the jargon or terms used by 
another; even if they ­were willing to exchange information, they find it dif­
ficult to bridge the communication gap. Fi­nally, horizontal communication 
often does not take place ­because man­ag­ers have neither encouraged fre­
quent horizontal communication nor have they rewarded ­those who engage 
in such practices. However, the advent of electronic methods of communica­
tion has made horizontal communication much easier than it was in the past. 
E-­mail is usually the primary means of communication among orga­nizational 
peers especially ­those who do not work in close proximity.
Meetings often provide another source of horizontal flow of information. 
In professional organ­izations, many employees spend a ­great deal of their time 
in meetings; some research has shown that man­ag­ers spend up to 18 hours 
per week in meetings and unfortunately they consider 25 ­percent to 50 ­percent 
of the meetings as wasted time.26 Frequently, workers feel that they spend 
more time in meetings talking about their jobs than they spend actually ­doing 
them. Too often, meetings are frustrating and in­effec­tive, ­because they are 
poorly planned or conducted. Man­ag­ers at all levels should try to develop the 
skills and understanding about how to make meetings successful.27
Some man­ag­ers discourage the use of horizontal communication ­because 
it does not follow the chain of command. Although horizontal communica­
tion may create some difficulties, such communication is essential in most 
organ­izations that need to respond to a complex and dynamic environment. 
The importance of lateral communication increases as organ­izations grow 
more dependent on a team approach. Even when it is not encouraged, it is 
certain to take place ­because employees at the same level usually talk with 
one another about their tasks, their bosses, and their work conditions. Some 
­simple precautions can be taken to prevent potential prob­lems. It should be 
clear that horizontal communications should be used when they are appro­
priate, subordinates should refrain from making commitments beyond their 
authority, and subordinates should keep superiors informed of impor­tant 
interdepartmental activities.
Virtual Communication
One type of communication that is relatively new to man­ag­ers is virtual 
communication, which is communicating with employees who are not physi­
cally pres­ent in the workplace. This type of communication has become more 

Orga­nizational Communication  401
prevalent in the past few years as the number of telecommuting employees 
has increased and as more workers are working as parts of virtual teams. 
Communicating with remote workers is a difficult task. Workers who are not 
on-­site are not able to take advantage of communication transmitted through 
informal chats and body language. They lose the context of messages and are 
usually not able to pick up on clues such as tone of voice. If pos­si­ble, it is good 
practice to periodically bring remote employees to the worksite, so they can 
build rapport with their fellow employees. At other times, man­ag­ers have to 
rely on electronic methods of communicating. Tools such as Skype and Go-­to-­
Meeting are often used for video chats. Using video tools as much as pos­si­ble 
allows workers to pick up on the nonverbal communication and lessens mis­
communication. However, especially when employees are located in dif­fer­ent 
time zones, nonsynchronous methods such as shared documents, e-­mails, and 
text messages ­will be the methods most commonly used to communicate.
Regardless of the channel used, communication with remote workers is 
essential if they are to succeed. Man­ag­ers need to pay special attention to com­
munication with ­these types of employees, giving them clear guidance about 
the expectations for their work and how they ­will be assessed. Remote work 
is still not the norm in most libraries, but as the number of virtual workers 
increases, man­ag­ers ­will need to become more knowledgeable about how best 
to communicate with workers who are not physically pres­ent on the work site.
Informal Orga­nizational Communication
Most of what has been discussed so far concerns the formal communica­
tion channels within an organ­ization. ­These are the message channels that 
follow the official path directed by the orga­nizational hierarchy. But ­every 
organ­ization also has an informal communication system. Two of the most 
common of ­these are the grapevine and the activity often referred to as “man­
aging by walking around.” Although informal channels are neither as pre­
dictable nor as controlled as ­those of the formal communication structure, 
they are remarkably efficient at moving information.
The Grapevine
­Every organ­ization has an informal communication network commonly 
termed the grapevine. The grapevine is the generally word-­of-­mouth commu­
nication that moves upward, downward, and diagonally in the organ­ization 
between workers and man­ag­er; the grapevine extends both inside and out­
side of the organ­ization. Studies of the grapevine have shown that this means 
of communication is fairly accurate, with more than 75 ­percent of the mes­
sages being transmitted correctly.28 In addition, the grapevine is usually 
much faster at moving information than are formal channels.
However, nearly all of the information within the grapevine is undocu­
mented, and thus is open to change and interpretation as it moves through 
the network. The Internet has provided an additional mechanism for the 
spread of grapevine information. Information that, in the past, might have 
moved fairly slowly from person to person can now be transmitted and 
retransmitted at lightning fast speeds.
Although the grapevine sometimes ­causes trou­ble, this informal com­
munication channel is endemic in all organ­izations. Man­ag­ers are not able 
to destroy it, ­because it serves an essential ­human need for information. 
Given the existence of the grapevine, a man­ag­er’s task is to try to make it

Practice Your Skills
Remember the telephone game you used to play when you ­were a child? One person begins 
with a message and whispers it to the next person ­until the message has gone around 
the entire room. Usually, the message that is heard by the last person bears ­little resem­
blance to what the first person said. Besides being fun, this activity demonstrates how 
easily information can become garbled by indirect communication and noise.
Try playing the game again with a group and think about how it applies to com­
munication within an organ­ization. First, play the game as you always did. How accu­
rate was the message received by the last person? Next try it with a variation. Each 
person who receives the message is allowed to check with the person transmitting it to 
be sure they understood correctly. How much more accurate was the transmittal of the 
second message than the first? What does this tell you about feedback and its useful­
ness in communication?
contribute to the accomplishment of the organ­ization’s objectives. Man­ag­ers 
can do this by using it, ­either personally or through trusted staff members. 
When used correctly, the grapevine can be very useful in supplementing for­
mal channels.
A man­ag­er who wants to relay information can feed the grapevine accu­
rate information. In addition, man­ag­ers should be aware of the messages 
that circulate on the grapevine to be able to intercept and correct misleading 
rumors that might damage morale. In fact, tapping into the grapevine has 
the potential to serve as an “early warning system” to man­ag­ers who are 
interested in keeping up with internal situations or events that might need 
their attention.
The grapevine should never be allowed to substitute for clear, timely, and 
complete communication through formal communication channels. The 
grapevine flourishes when ­there is ­little formal communication about a topic, 
especially one that ­causes employees to feel threatened or that deals with 
impending change. Rumors usually arise ­because workers are anxious about 
some situation about which they have received ­little or no information. Many 
fewer rumors would circulate on the grapevine if man­ag­ers would provide 
sufficient information about issues of interest and concern to workers through 
formal communication channels.
Talk About It
The grapevine follows the “law of the few” articulated by Malcolm Gladwell in his book, 
The Tipping Point. He argues that if you want to spread communication effectively you 
only need to reach the tiny minority of individuals who are responsible for the majority 
of the dialogue. ­These individuals control the information flow and as a result are very 
power­ful.29
Do you think that Gladwell is right in his premise that just a few ­people have an 
outsize impact on communication? If a man­ag­er wishes to control information on the 
grapevine, how can he or she identify ­these individuals and use them to influence what 
is transmitted on the grapevine? Do you think it is ethical for man­ag­ers to do this?

Orga­nizational Communication  403
Managing by Walking Around
Another good way for man­ag­ers to supplement information received from 
formal channels of communication is for the man­ag­ers to get out of their 
offices, walk around the organ­ization, and spend some time with employees. 
This method of informal communication is usually referred to as managing 
by walking around, or MBWA. Just as man­ag­ers should be aware of what is 
being circulated on the grapevine, they also should be aware of what is ­going 
on in parts of the organ­ization away from their offices.
Man­ag­ers need to make themselves vis­i­ble and to spend time getting a 
general feel for what is ­going on throughout the organ­ization. ­Whether it is 
walking through the cata­log department, visiting the break room, or talk­
ing to shelvers as they do their job, man­ag­ers find out ­things about the library 
that they would never know without emerging from the office on a periodic 
basis. Most workers are flattered when top administrators come to their work 
area and speak with them. It makes them feel significant. As Robert Goffee 
and Gareth Jones have written, “Followers ­will give their hearts and souls 
to authority figures who say, ‘You ­really ­matter,’ no ­matter how small the 
followers’ contributions may be.”30 The most highly regarded man­ag­ers are 
­those who are able to communicate to their employees that they are interested 
in them and in what they are ­doing. MBWA is a proven way to allow man­ag­
ers and workers to communicate on an informal basis, and ­because it is done 
on the employee’s turf instead of in the man­ag­er’s office, it provides a dif­fer­
ent dimension to orga­nizational communication.
In summary, both formal and informal communication is critical to 
organ­izations. Man­ag­ers should pay close attention to the communication 
within an organ­ization in an attempt to make it as open and ­free from dis­
tortion as pos­si­ble. Man­ag­ers should always be trying to improve their com­
munication skills and should remember the advantages provided by two-­way 
communication to ensure that they ­will receive feedback and know ­whether 
the messages they are transmitting are being received. Good man­ag­ers 
should also constantly remember the importance of listening, which is criti­
cal to improving working relationships with their subordinates; if man­ag­
ers just “hear” but do not listen, they ­will never completely comprehend what 
employees say to them.
Conflict
One of the common results of poor communication is conflict. One person 
may misunderstand another. Someone may have said something that he or 
she ­really did not mean to say, or someone may have missed a message that 
was supposed to be sent. One employee says something, ­either intentionally 
or unintentionally, that hurts another. Communication and, especially, mis­
communication often lead to conflict. Once conflict exists, ­people often cease 
to talk to one another, which exacerbates the conflict. Good communication 
skills are an impor­tant part of preventing and resolving conflicts.
Conflict usually is characterized as being interpersonal or intergroup. 
Interpersonal conflict, conflict between two ­people, is often the result of 
incompatible personalities or dif­fer­ent values or points of view. Intergroup 
conflict, conflict between groups of employees, can be caused by a number of 
­factors within organ­izations and often arises as a result of competition over 
scarce resources. Both interpersonal and intergroup conflicts are heightened 
by poor communication.

404  Leading
When conflict is not managed well, it can lead to a decline in morale, a 
loss in productivity, high turnover, and generally miserable conditions in a 
workplace. ­Because of ­these disadvantages, some man­ag­ers ­will do almost 
anything to try to avoid conflicts within the units they manage. Some even 
feel that the mere existence of conflict is a reflection of their ability to man­
age. This is not so. For better or worse, conflict exists in ­every organ­ization. 
As law librarian Raquel J. Gabriel writes, “Although ­there is a ste­reo­type of 
the library as a calm oasis, I am sure that ­every librarian would scoff at the 
suggestion that conflict ­doesn’t exist within our institutions.”31
Man­ag­ers who feel that they spend a ­great deal of time trying to resolve 
conflict situations are prob­ably correct. One study showed that man­ag­ers 
reported spending up to 20 ­percent of their time dealing with conflict and 
its impact.32 Another study showed that 42 ­percent of a man­ag­er’s time is 
spent on reaching agreement with ­others ­after conflicts occur.33
­People react to conflict situations in dif­fer­ent ways. Research has iden­
tified five primary styles of ­handling conflict: avoiding, compromising, com­
peting, accommodating, and collaborating. Avoiders try to prevent conflict; 
usually they suppress their feelings and withdraw from conflict situations. 
Compromisers try to seek a solution that satisfies both parties; they are will­
ing to split differences down the ­middle. Competitors seek to dominate and 
impose their viewpoints. Accommodators almost always give in to opposition 
and acquiesce to the demands of ­others. Collaborators try to work to find a 
mutually satisfactory outcome for all parties.34 ­These approaches are affected 
by how assertive and how cooperative individuals are. The dif­fer­ent styles 
are illustrated in figure 16.3; although the figure shows five discrete posi­
tions, it is pos­si­ble for an individual’s orientation on conflict to fall anywhere 
on the diagram.
FIGURE 16.3. Five Styles of ­Handling Conflict

Orga­nizational Communication  405
Practice Your Skills
You are steaming. Your supervisor, Mrs. Wright, has just asked you to be in charge of 
the circulation desk this Saturday night—­again. You ­were on duty last Saturday night 
and the one three weeks ago. The library policy is that each worker is responsible for one 
Saturday night a month, but as far as you are concerned, that policy is just a myth. You 
are assigned to work at least two and often three Saturday nights each month. Other 
workers always seem to have ­things that conflict with working on Saturday: spouses 
who ­will be out of town, el­derly parents who need help with something, or a child’s piano 
recital or soccer game. You know that Mrs. Wright is trying to make the department 
“­family friendly,” but you feel as though you are being asked to do more than your fair 
share ­because you are the only full-­time employee who is not married with young chil­
dren. Should you go ahead and accept this week’s schedule or try to set up a time to talk 
with Mrs. Wright? If so, what would you say?
Of the five styles, the collaborative one is generally considered best 
­because it leads to a result that is usually described as a win-­win outcome. 
This type of outcome occurs when all parties perceive that they have emerged 
from the conflict in a better position than before. For instance, if two employ­
ees ­were in conflict about the scheduling of weekend and eve­ning hours, it 
is pos­si­ble that you might end up with a win-­win situation if you discovered 
that one ­really did not mind working weekend hours, and the other ­really 
did not mind working eve­nings, and thus you ­were able to arrange their 
schedules to conform with their preferences. The concept of a win-­win solu­
tion is not a new one. Almost 100 years ago, Mary Parker Follett, the early 
management expert described in chapter 2, proposed an early example of 
such a solution:
When two desires are integrated, that means that a solution has 
been found in which both desires have found a place, that neither 
side has had to sacrifice anything. Let us take some very ­simple 
illustration. In the Harvard Library one day, in one of the smaller 
rooms, someone wanted the win­dow open. I wanted it shut. We 
opened the win­dow in the next room, where no one was sitting. 
This was not a compromise ­because ­there was no curtailing of 
desire; we both got what we ­really wanted. For I did not want a 
closed room, I simply did not want the north wind to blow directly 
on me; likewise, the other occupant did not want that par­tic­u­lar 
win­dow open, he merely wanted more air in the room.35
Although win-­win solutions have been around a long time, they are not 
pos­si­ble in all cases. However, man­ag­ers who are skilled as negotiators often 
are able to deal effectively with conflict by arriving at solutions that make 
all parties feel that they have come out ahead.
Results of Conflict
Orga­nizational conflict is neither inherently positive nor negative.36 How­
ever, the negative effects are usually thought of first. Working in an envi­
ronment with a ­great deal of conflict can lead to stress and divert employees’ 

406  Leading
attention from the work that has to be done. The morale of employees often 
suffers, as well as their motivation to perform well. In cases of extreme con­
flict, workers have been known to disparage or even sabotage the work of 
­others. Conflict between departments can cause groups to close ranks and 
hamper cooperation. Unmanaged and unresolved conflict is a destructive force. 
It can destroy relationships, decrease productivity and quality of work, break 
down communication, and make ­people feel at odds with ­others in the group 
or organ­ization.
On the other hand, sometimes conflict plays a useful role. Constructive 
conflict pres­ents opportunities for positive change and prob­lem solving. This 
type of conflict can bring previously hidden prob­lems to light so that solu­
tions may be sought. Constructive conflict encourages innovation. If every­
one thinks the same ­thing, changes ­will not occur. In fact, according to 
recent research a peaceful, harmonious workplace can be the worst pos­si­
ble ­thing for a business and is the single greatest predictor of poor com­pany 
per­for­mance.37
In its early days, Microsoft was known for one of the most contentious 
corporate cultures in the United States. Bill Gates advocated a management 
style called “armed truce” ­because employees ­were encouraged to challenge 
every­one, including Gates. Conflict was at the heart of ­every decision in a 
com­pany “constantly at war with not only outsiders but also with itself.”38
Properly managed conflict can be energizing. When individuals debate 
opposing ideas and positions in a calm and reasonable fashion, this type of 
conflict may prevent stagnation; stimulate interest and curiosity; encourage 
the examination and exploration of prob­lems; lead to the solving of prob­lems 
and the making of decisions; facilitate personal growth and development; 
promote group identity and cohesion; help relieve tensions; provide the basis 
for change; encourage interpersonal communication, better understanding, 
and critical self-­reflection; strengthen personal relationships; and promote 
the exploration and awareness of feelings, needs, and opinions of other 
­people.39
In summary, conflict is an inevitable part of working in organ­izations. 
Whenever ­people are put together in an organ­ization, they become interde­
pendent, and thus, grounds for competition and conflict arise. The ability to 
discuss topics openly is a strength in any organ­ization. It is far healthier for 
individuals to be able to debate, to pres­ent opposing viewpoints, and to invite 
freewheeling conversation on any topic than to keep opinions bottled up 
inside. Conflicts that are suppressed typically reemerge.
However, ­there are some ­people who think that we have become too con­
tentious. In our modern society, ­people have been conditioned to compete 
and to achieve, and the cultures that develop within organ­izations tend to 
exaggerate this trait. Deborah Tannen has termed this an argument culture, 
which she describes as one that urges us to approach the world and the ­people 
in it in an adversarial frame of mind.40 It rests on the assumption that oppo­
sition is the best way to get anything done. The best way to discuss an idea 
is to set up a debate; the best way to cover news is to find spokespeople who 
express the most extreme, polarized views and pres­ent them as “both sides”; 
the best way to ­settle disputes is litigation that pits one party against 
another; the best way to begin an essay is to attack someone; the best way 
to show you are ­really thinking is to criticize. Unfortunately, this type of 
opposition does not lead to truth, ­because usually an issue is not composed 
of two opposing views but is multifaceted. Tannen has recently revisited the 
idea of an argument culture, and feels that, unfortunately, she may have 
actually underestimated the prob­lem in her book, ­because as she writes, 

Orga­nizational Communication  407
“­Today, ‘the argument culture’ sounds like an extreme understatement; ‘the 
combat culture’ would be more apt.”41 Our society certainly seems to be becom­
ing less civil. It is hard for an organ­ization to ­counter such outside influ­
ences, but man­ag­ers must guard against incivility of all sorts.
It is very impor­tant to remember that allowing constructive conflict 
to occur in a workplace does not mean that employees should be subjected to 
incivility. Practices such as name-­calling, bullying, and rudeness should 
never be tolerated. Part of managing conflict is treating all parties involved 
with re­spect. Man­ag­ers should remember that incivility ­toward employees 
comes at a high cost. Spreitzer and Porath found that 50 ­percent of employ­
ees who experienced uncivil be­hav­ior at work intentionally decreased their 
efforts: more than a third decreased the quality of their work.42 Man­ag­ers set 
the tone when it comes to civility in the workplace, and a single uncivil man­
ag­er can have a huge impact on the orga­nizational culture.
Man­ag­ers need to be constantly vigilant if they wish to maintain a civil 
workplace. In addition, they must remember that their own be­hav­ior is one 
of the prime determinants ­because orga­nizational culture is inherently con­
tagious, and it is the man­ag­er who sets the tone. Man­ag­ers need to model 
the good be­hav­ior they wish to see in ­others. One study found that 25 ­percent 
of man­ag­ers who admitted to having acted rudely said they did so ­because 
their own man­ag­ers ­were rude.43 If employees see their man­ag­ers tolerate or 
practice uncivil be­hav­ior, they are apt to do the same. Man­ag­ers should serve 
as role models for ­those who work for them. As leaders, they should set the 
tone and try to be aware of how their own actions are affecting their employ­
ees’ be­hav­ior.
Managing Conflict
Man­ag­ers need to find a way to strike the right balance between too 
much conflict and not enough. In other words, they have to find a way to man­
age conflict so that the organ­ization ­will reap its benefits and avoid its nega­
tive aspects.
How can conflict be managed? The first step is for man­ag­ers to realize 
that a certain amount of conflict is inevitable within any organ­ization. The 
worst ­thing man­ag­ers at any level can do is to try to suppress conflict. It is 
much better to bring it out, to open the lines of communication, and to try to 
come to a mutually beneficial solution. Even if a win-­win solution cannot be 
achieved, employees ­will be better satisfied if conflicts are recognized and 
solutions are sought in a supportive manner.
The second step is to try to deal with the conflict before it escalates. Con­
flicts typically escalate in three ways:
•	 Expansion of interests: The conflict goes from a relatively ­simple 
one focused on a few issues to one with a larger number of areas of 
disagreements. Such escalation can be very destructive and makes 
the conflict far harder to resolve.
•	 Involvement of self-­esteem or self-­image: Suddenly the conflict 
switches from one that is issue oriented to one that is personal. ­People 
become defensive and try to save face.
•	 Creation of a new real­ity: The final form of escalation occurs when 
the conflict itself begins to create its own real­ity. Participants base 
their choices on only the immediate conflict situation. Winning the 

408  Leading
conflict takes on a symbolic importance that transcends every­thing 
­else. Individuals begin to focus wholly on their incentives to compete 
rather than on their incentives to cooperate.44
The third step is to try to resolve a conflict in a way that allows the par­
ticipants to feel positive about the outcome. The best result ­will be if the 
man­ag­er can help the parties to the conflict emerge with a win-­win solution.
Conflict management is a necessary managerial skill. Inevitably, man­
ag­ers ­will be called in to act as a mediator in a large number of conflict 
situations. Man­ag­ers get better at ­handling conflict with experience. Under­
standing conflict and its impact on ­others increases a man­ag­er’s ability to 
make interventions. Man­ag­ers learn from smaller conflict situations how 
to deal with larger ones, and they learn from their successes as well as their 
failures. Man­ag­ers may fear conflict but always should be ready to manage 
the conflicts rather than having the conflict control them or the situation.
Conclusion
Communication is the glue that holds an organ­ization together. Man­ag­
ers spend the majority of their time engaging in communication of vari­ous 
types. ­Unless man­ag­ers learn to communicate successfully, they ­will not be 
successful in carry­ing out the other managerial functions of planning, organ­
izing, staffing, leading, and controlling. Communication skills are essential, 
and the improvement of ­these skills in both man­ag­ers and other employees 
should be made a priority, ­because without communication no organ­ization 
can function effectively.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 You are the director of a medium-­size public library that has a volunteer coor­
dinator who is supposed to oversee approximately 75 volunteers who have offered 
to help in the library. Since the demand for the library’s ser­vices has increased 
and the funding for the library has not, you are depending on ­these volunteers. 
Before being put on the volunteer list, each volunteer had been interviewed and 
his or her skills noted. Each volunteer has also signed up for at least two activi­
ties he or she would be interested in assisting with and has provided the times 
he or she would be available to work. The volunteer coordinator (also a volun­
teer) was to make out the schedule and assign each volunteer to a suitable task. 
Unfortunately, ­things do not seem to be working out well. Volunteers show up 
at the library and ­there are no proj­ects ready for them to do during their sched­
uled slots. This prob­lem has been ­going on for several months and understand­
ably the volunteers are becoming frustrated. Their enthusiasm has dropped off 
and many are failing to show up at their assigned times.
You have scheduled a time to meet with the volunteer coordinator. How 
­will you structure this interview? What questions ­will you ask to get to the 
cause of the prob­lem? What pos­si­ble solutions can you think of to try to improve 
the volunteer component of your library? What are some major differences in 
communicating with employees and with volunteers?
2.	Work with a partner. The two of you should come up with a list of the attributes 
that a good listener has and then a similar list for a poor listener. ­After you 

Orga­nizational Communication  409
have your list, one of you should try talking for one minute on any topic that you 
like. The other person should first display the traits of an uninterested listener. 
Then, repeat the exercise, but this time your partner should display the character­
istics of a good listener. Fi­nally, switch roles and repeat the exercise. Next, dis­
cuss with your partner, how you felt. How did it feel when your partner was 
displaying the characteristics of a bad listener? A good listener? Fi­nally, was it 
easier for you to talk when your partner displayed the qualities of a good listener?
3.	You are the director of communication at a large public library. You return 
from your break to find a note on your desk from the library director stating that 
you should come to the director’s office as soon as pos­si­ble to discuss this year’s 
rewrite of the brochure describing the employee benefits available from the 
library. You dread this discussion. The last time you undertook this task, your 
painstaking arrangements with the printer ­were countermanded by your boss 
who deci­ded at the last minute on ­doing a revision of your carefully researched 
and creatively presented brochure. The resulting brochure was a disaster—­
late, inaccurate, and ugly. To top it all off, your name was on it as editor.
Find a partner. One of you should role play the disgruntled director of com­
munications and the other the library director. Then reverse the roles.
4.	“What do we do now?” wondered Ann, Lee, and Thomas. It had been two months 
since their meeting with the new library director, Phyllis, and nothing had 
changed: communication was poor, morale was low, and defenses ­were up. Even 
the student assistants ­were beginning to notice the tension between their super­
visors and Phyllis. Although Ann, Thomas, and Lee had each noticed the lack 
of communication from Phyllis ­because they worked in dif­fer­ent departments, 
they did not have the opportunity to compare notes. And then David, the circu­
lation supervisor was fired, suddenly and abruptly. When Ann reported to work 
that after­noon, David’s desk was cleared and he was gone. Ann sought out Phyl­
lis for confirmation. Phyllis acknowledged David’s being fired, gave no additional 
information, but told Ann that since ­there was a job freeze, David’s position 
could not be filled ­until the freeze was lifted, and that ­until that happened, it 
would be up to Ann to “work ­things out.” Ann, Thomas, and Lee began to share 
observations and realized that David’s firing was merely an extreme example of 
what had been taking place since Phyllis had arrived. ­There had been no memos, 
no staff meetings, no briefings in spite of the fact that plans for a library expan­
sion ­were underway, the job freeze had affected library hours and staff, and 
that personnel ­were generally confused and becoming frustrated.
What is the prob­lem ­here? If you ­were an employee in this library what 
would you do?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Epictetus, a Greek phi­los­o­pher born almost 2,000 years ago, is reported to have 
said, “Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we may hear from 
­others twice as much as we speak.” What are the advantages and disadvantages 
for a man­ag­er in following this princi­ple? Do you know any man­ag­ers who listen 
twice as much as they speak?

2.	Communication prob­lems are very common in all organ­izations. It is sometimes 
said that if we could only communicate better within organ­izations almost all 
our other orga­nizational prob­lems would dis­appear. Do you agree with this 
statement?
3.	Many employees are hesitant to be completely truthful in their communica­
tions with their supervisors. Often they do not want to pass along bad news or 
point out shortcomings. It is the rare organ­ization that is so attuned to its employ­
ees and so trusted by them that employees feel comfortable in openly communi­
cating both good and bad news. Why do employees hesitate to bring bad news to 
their bosses? How can man­ag­ers encourage workers to be willing to provide the 
hard truths if they need to be told? How can organ­izations create the type of 
environment that allows them to get the kind of unfiltered and complete infor­
mation that is essential for their operations?
4.	It is often said that the greatest ­enemy of communication is the illusion that it 
has taken place. Can you think of times when someone (perhaps yourself) thought 
communication had taken place when it had not? What ­were some of the prob­
lems that arose? What are the ­factors that make someone assume that he or 
she has communicated sufficiently? What can a person do to ensure that his or 
her message was received clearly?

Empowering Employees 
through the Use of Teams
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Know how man­ag­ers can empower employees and the advantages of empower­
ing leadership
•	 Be able to identify the types of teams used in libraries
•	 Understand some of the prob­lems that teams may encounter in their work
•	 Be familiar with the stages of team development
•	 Understand how man­ag­ers can improve team effectiveness
•	 Be able to discuss the importance of the contingency theory of management in 
­today’s organ­izations
The library workplace has under­gone vast changes in the past few de­cades. 
Once, top man­ag­ers ­were expected to have all the answers, but that is no 
longer true. ­Today most man­ag­ers assume that lower-­level employees are 
able to solve many prob­lems effectively, often working together in a team, 
and most employees want to have at least some input and control over the 
work they do. As a result, many of ­today’s man­ag­ers empower their employ­
ees by granting them autonomy and responsibility. Empowered employees 
are provided with guidelines and then allowed to take responsibility for how 
their jobs are done.
This chapter begins with a look at employee empowerment and its advan­
tages and disadvantages, but the bulk of the chapter focuses on the use of 
teams in libraries ­because teams are one of the most common ways that

Management on the Job: Peter Sidorko, University 
of Hong Kong
The University of Hong Kong (HKU), founded in 1911, is the oldest university in Hong 
Kong. Peter Sidorko was hired as deputy librarian at the HKU library in 2001 and 
appointed to the position of university librarian in 2011. In a recent interview, he dis­
cussed the way he uses a participative management style to empower the library’s employ­
ees. When he arrived at the HKU library, the culture was very much a top down one, with 
“Even fairly trivial issues escalated to a se­nior level that was inappropriate.”1 Sidorko 
set about replacing that centralized management culture with a new one where ­every 
individual staff member in the organ­ization was given the responsibility to make deci­
sions and take responsibility for his or her own actions.
Sidorko says that the most obvious benefit of this new approach is that trivial 
­matters are not escalated to a high level, and decisions can be made by the ­people ­doing 
the ­actual work. However, he states that a necessary part of the change was “encourag­
ing ­people to take risks—­particularly when they come from a culture, an orga­nizational 
culture that does not reward risk-­taking and actually has a punitive approach to errors 
or ­mistakes.”2 Sidorko in his 13 years as a man­ag­er at HKU has never “chastised any­
body over a ­mistake that ­they’ve made, but simply helped them to see the way of their 
­mistake and purpose, and how they can do ­things differently.”3 He recognizes that 
employees learn from their own ­mistakes, and if employees never make ­mistakes, they 
­will never make any pro­gress or learn new ­things.
Sidorko was asked if the flatter, more demo­cratic organ­ization structure he has 
promoted is more appropriate to the current cultural climate. He responded:
“Well, why ­isn’t it? ­There are advantages and ­there are disadvantages. Well, the 
first disadvantage is that it is a change of mindset and culture. It is encouraging 
­people to do ­those ­things, make the decisions themselves, and take the responsi­
bilities for ­those decisions. But, as I said earlier, at the same time, it ­frees up 
much of my time to remove ­those trivial ­things. But it also ‘empowers’ ­people. 
I know that’s a word that’s thrown around loosely, but I ­really do believe that 
­people can get better job satisfaction if they feel they have got a bit of power over 
their own working environment and their own decisions.”4
Sidorko believes that in giving his employees power he is giving them the encouragement 
and freedom to fully utilize their skills, which results in their feeling good about them­
selves and feeling good about the organ­ization.
Have you ever worked for an empowering man­ag­er like Peter Sidorko? How did it 
feel to be given responsibility to make decisions about your job? If you have never worked 
for an empowering man­ag­er, would you like to? How would a job like that differ from 
one working with a top-­down style man­ag­er?
man­ag­ers empower employees. As libraries are restructuring and replacing 
the traditional hierarchy with a flatter, team-­based structure, many of ­these 
teams are being empowered to make decisions about the way their work is 
done. Leadership in a team environment requires man­ag­ers to employ dif­fer­
ent skills ­because they are working with groups instead of individuals. The 
chapter ­will conclude with a brief overview of contingency management: what 
it is and why it is impor­tant in ­today’s organ­izations.

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  415
Empowering Employees
One decision ­every man­ag­er must make concerns the extent that employ­
ees ­will be allowed to share in managerial decision making. Permitting 
employees to have input into managerial decisions is known by many names, 
including participative management, employee empowerment, dispersed 
leadership, shared leadership, and open-­book management. Whichever term 
is used, the concept is the same; decision making and leadership are dispersed 
throughout the organ­ization instead of being maintained by the man­ag­ers 
at the top of the hierarchy. The basic objective is a re­distribution of power 
between management and employees, most commonly in the form of increas­
ing employee authority and responsibility.5 Shared leadership is defined by 
Craig L. Pearce et al. as “a dynamic, unfolding, interactive pro­cess [that] 
entails broadly sharing power and influence among a set of individuals rather 
than centralizing it in the hands of a single individual who acts in the clear 
role of a dominant superior.”6
­Today, ­there is a ­great deal of talk about empowering employees; in fact, 
the term “empowerment” has become a buzzword in many organ­izations. In 
brief, empowerment is a pro­cess of allowing employees to think, behave, and 
take autonomous action regarding their work. Allowing employees to make 
decisions relating to their work also helps them to take responsibility for the 
results.7
Empowered employees are given information about the decisions that 
need to be made as well as the power to make the decisions that give them 
control over their own work. Empowering management is based on the prem­
ise that ­people at all levels of the organ­ization can do more than merely per­
form duties assigned to them. Empowered employees share information, make 
decisions, solve prob­lems, plan proj­ects, and evaluate results.8 This type of 
leadership has the virtue of forcing decision making down to the level where 
the most relevant information can be found and where the effect of the deci­
sion ­will have the greatest impact.
Empowering employees is another manifestation of the move from the 
tightly structured bureaucratic organ­izations of the past to more modern 
ones, which are becoming increasingly people-­centered. In the past most 
libraries ­were or­ga­nized in a traditional hierarchical structure and the typ­
ical management style was authoritarian. This pattern of organ­ization 
became popu­lar ­after the industrial revolution and was the norm ­until 
­towards the end of the last ­century. In librarianship, this meant that the 
reins of leadership ­were tightly held by the library director, and all the sys­
tems and ser­vices ­were or­ga­nized around the command and control model.9 
Information was also tightly controlled; for example, bud­geting was a closed 
pro­cess, and bud­gets ­were developed by a small group of man­ag­ers. As a 
result, libraries ­were authoritarian organ­izations, controlled from the top 
down, with upper-­level man­ag­ers making all essential decisions and employ­
ees expected to carry out the tasks demanded of them.
Managerial styles in libraries are changing as most directors are find­
ing authoritarian leadership styles to be less effective, and as rank-­and-­file 
librarians are demanding increased input into decision making. The old top-­
down approach to leadership does not work well with ­today’s workers who 
are highly skilled, intelligent professionals. If permitted, they can bring use­
ful knowledge and insight to the decision-­making pro­cess, and the organ­
ization profits from their involvement in leadership. In addition, the individual 
employee also benefits from being allowed to share in management decision 
making. One of the best ways to motivate ­today’s employees is to make them 

416  Leading
feel valuable by asking them for their advice and involving them in making 
impor­tant decisions.10 Employees who have played a role in making decisions 
also feel a much greater amount of owner­ship in carry­ing out the decisions 
that are made.
­Those who ­favor greater employee empowerment base their view on their 
belief that the rank-­and-­file library staff benefit from having a chance to par­
ticipate in governance, that better decisions are made with staff involvement, 
and that this management style leads to increased job satisfaction resulting 
in better library ser­vice. ­Those who ­favor less participation usually support 
their stand by concentrating on the inexperience of most librarians in man­
agement, the amount of time that is consumed by participation, and the 
inappropriateness of the participative model as a means of operating a com­
plex ser­vice organ­ization.
At pres­ent, libraries vary on how much employee participation is permit­
ted. Although only a few libraries could be considered to operate on Likert’s 
System 4 level (described in chapter 14), most library directors permit some 
employee input into decision making, and ­there is almost always some con­
sultation before decisions are made.
Empowering employees does not mean that they are left to work with 
no supervision. Empowered employees are given instructions about what 
needs to be accomplished, but are given flexibility and the opportunity for 
some risk taking in how the goal is to be achieved. Employee empowerment 
does not mean that man­ag­ers involve all their employees in ­every decision 
­every time, or that all employees have the same amount of involvement in 
decision making. The involvement is usually based on familiarity with the 
decision that needs to be made.11 It must be remembered that man­ag­ers with 
empowered employees are still ultimately responsible for the final decisions 
that are made. Employee empowerment does not substitute for the individ­
ual responsibility assigned to top man­ag­ers for the entire organ­ization, and 
in most libraries, ­there ­will continue to be directors who are accountable for 
the overall operation of the library.12
Although empowering employees by allowing them to participate in 
managerial decision making is often successful, this approach is sometimes 
difficult to implement with employees who have not had experience with it 
­TABLE 17.1. How Do You Know You that You Are Empowered?
­Today, ­there is a ­great deal of talk in organ­izations of all types about empowering 
employees. Employees who report feeling empowered make statements such as:
•	 My supervisor supported my idea without question.
•	 Financial data ­were shared with me.
•	 I was able to make a financial decision on my own.
Employees that are not empowered make statements such as:
•	 I had no input into a hiring decision of someone who was to report directly to me.
•	 I worked extremely hard on a proj­ect and my man­ag­er took full credit for it.
•	 The proj­ect was reassigned without my knowledge or input.
•	 My suggestions ­were never solicited; or if they ­were, they ­were ignored.
•	 I am treated like a mushroom and always kept in the dark.

before. Conversely, it is hard for some man­ag­ers to give up control and to let 
­others contribute to decision making and prob­lem solving. Switching to a 
more participative system of management requires changes on the part of 
both man­ag­ers and employees.
The Advantages of Empowering Employees
Why would organ­izations want to involve workers in decisions that are 
being made? Modern organ­izations face many challenges. Typically, the direc­
tor of a library holds a complex job with demands that are almost impossible 
for a single person to meet in ­today’s fast-­changing environment. Many times, 
decisions have to be made quickly if the organ­ization is to remain competitive. 
­Because of the information technology revolution, directors of libraries face a 
demand for greater productivity as well as increased pressure to change struc­
tures and ser­vices. Greater staff participation can help meet ­these challenges.
­There are many other advantages to employee empowerment: Empow­
ering employees can lead to better customer ser­vice. Empowered employees 
have reduced stress and higher job satisfaction resulting in lower turnover. 
In addition, allowing employees to participate in decision making increases 
staff flexibility and creativity and helps satisfy the increased expectations 
of staff members for self-­realization. As Gretchen Spreitzer and Christine 
Porath write, “Employees at ­every level are energized by the ability to make 
decisions that affect their work. Empowering them in this way gives them a 
greater sense of control, more say in how ­things get done, and more opportu­
nities for learning.”13
Libraries that are considering empowering employees should consider 
the success of this approach in other types of organ­izations. Southwest Air­
lines, the only continuously profitable U.S. airline over the past 40 years, pro­
vides a good example from the for-­profit world of a com­pany that empowers 
its employees. Its ­recipe for success lies in its tradition of shared leadership. 
According to its former CEO, Jim Parker, “Many ­people think that the source 
of our success is our cost structure—­that we pay our ­people less than our 
competitors—­but that simply is not true. The real source of our competitive 
advantage is our culture, which is based firmly on the princi­ples of distrib­
uted and shared leadership.”14 Southwest employees work in teams without 
outside supervision. The employees have the authority to make decisions 
and do what­ever it takes to ensure that the customer is satisfied. Southwest 
has created an orga­nizational culture than treats both its employees and 
passengers with re­spect.15 Southwest’s philosophy traces its origin to Herb 
Kelleher, who founded the airline. He stated that the core of the com­pany 
success rested on something that was difficult for competitors to imitate. “They 
can buy all the physical ­things. The ­things you ­can’t buy are dedication, devo­
tion, loyalty—­the feeling that you are participating in a crusade. A motivated 
employee treats the customer well. A customer is happy, so ­they’ll keep com­
ing back, which pleases the shareholder. It’s just the way it works.”16
Practice Your Skills
Brickman Library, the academic library at the largest public university in a Midwestern 
state, has always been structured as a hierarchy, with many layers of management, and 
with power and information carefully controlled by the top echelons of the organ­ization. 

418  Leading
Employees at Facebook also are given much discretion in making deci­
sions. One employee reported that on his second day at work, he found a fix 
for a complicated bug and expected some sort of hierarchical review of his 
solution. Instead his boss, a vice president, smiled and said, “Ship it.” The 
employee marveled that, as a new employee, he was trusted to provide a solu­
tion that would instantly reach millions of ­people.17 The challenge for man­
ag­ers is to allow empowerment while realizing that ­mistakes ­will sometimes 
be made. The com­pany motto of Facebook is “Move fast and break ­things.” 
Many traditional man­ag­ers find it difficult to give employees decision-­making 
discretion for fear that they ­will make ­mistakes, but ­doing so creates the best 
conditions for employees to learn.18 Other corporate examples of companies 
known for their culture of employee empowerment include Zappos, REI, 
Google, and Adobe.
­There are also many library directors, who are known for giving their 
employees a ­great deal of leeway and entrusting them to take risks. Peter 
Sidorko described earlier in the chapter is one such director. Susan Nutter, 
library director at North Carolina State University (discussed in chap­
ter 14), is also a power­ful advocate for empowering the staff who works with 
her. She calls her staff the primary asset of the library and prides herself on 
hiring ­people who are self-­motivated and have a passion for what they do. 
She states, she is “proud that most of the library decision-­making comes 
from staff. ‘I ­don’t have to delegate it,’ ” she says. “I ­don’t even have to worry 
about it.”19
How to Empower Employees
Chandan Kumar Sahoo et al. provide a systematic review of the previ­
ous research on empowering employees and advance a model to show the 
components that make up a system of employee empowerment. This model 
is illustrated in figure 17.1. Many of the components in this model have been 
discussed previously in this book. Some key aspects, or ­drivers, that contrib­
ute ­toward development of a favorable climate for enhancing empowerment 
include:
Role clarity: The employees know what is expected of them in terms of job 
definitions, work procedures, and per­for­mance.
Challenging job: The job itself has sufficient task complexity and respon­
sibility, along with training to acquire new skills, to make an employee 
feel empowered.
Reward and recognition: Employee efforts are appropriately recognized 
and rewarded.
A new director has just been hired who wants to make changes. This director believes 
that employees at all levels of the com­pany need to know what is ­going on and need to 
have some participation in decision making.
Imagine that you are this new director. What changes would you make, and how 
would you implement the changes? What type of program would you design to allow 
employee participation? What difficulties, if any, would you anticipate in making this 
change? Could you learn anything from Southwest Airlines?

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  419
Supportive leadership: Shared leadership leads to employee empowerment.
Span of supervision: A wider span of control provides employees more 
autonomy.
Realistic HR policies: Emphasis on multiskilling results in higher job flex­
ibility and breadth of experience.
Upward per­for­mance appraisal: Employees’ feedback on supervisors is 
an effective empowerment mechanism.
Access to information and other resources: Lower-­level employees can 
be empowered if they are granted access to relevant information and 
resources.
Attitude of top management: Empowerment must begin at the top, and 
top man­ag­ers must be open-­minded, transparent, and trust their 
employees.20
The ­drivers of employee involvement are the techniques that an organ­
ization can use to improve per­for­mance by cultivating employee interest and 
dedication. Among ­these ­drivers are:
Job enrichment: An employee ­will contribute more to a job that is more 
complex and requires her or him to devote more thought to it.
Goal setting: Employees are empowered when they are allowed to set goals 
and assume owner­ship for the completion of an assigned task.
Joint decision making: Decisions can better be made by involving ­those 
who are likely to be affected by the decision.
Team effort: Teams gain autonomy when they are made responsible for 
quality of products or ser­vices and are allowed to take corrective mea­
sures to ensure improved quality.
Collective bargaining: Collective bargaining is a demo­cratic decision-­
making pro­cess.
Employee suggestions: Individual employees are empowered by being 
allowed to suggest ideas regarding improvements in work methods or 
material.
Periodic discussions with supervisors: Regular discussions allow an 
employee to voice opinions and feelings.
Encouraging initiative: Empowered employees must take some risks, and 
an organ­ization must reward and appreciate initiatives taken, even 
though they may not always be successful.
Training and development: Empowered employees almost always need 
training in new skills.21
­These two sets of ­drivers lead to workplace commitment, which includes 
both (1) an empowering organ­ization, and (2) employees who are committed 
to their jobs and organ­izations.
Sahoo et al. have nicely summarized a large amount of research on the 
benefits of empowering employees. Previous studies that have looked at the 
effect of orga­nizational culture on per­for­mance have found that, in for-­profit 
organ­izations, a higher degree of employee participation produces higher 

420  Leading
returns on investments and improved financial results.22 Similar studies car­
ried out in libraries have shown that participation in decision making is a 
­factor that positively affects job satisfaction. The relationship between par­
ticipative management and job satisfaction in libraries has been found in 
studies done in the libraries of many countries, including the United States, 
Canada, South Africa, Malaysia, India, and Greece.23
Levels of Participation
Participative leadership can be viewed as a continuum with top man­ag­
ers varying in how much they allow employees to participate in management 
decisions. The continuum ranges from ­those organ­izations in which the 
employees are informed about decisions that have to be made to ­those in 
which the employees actually make the decisions. In organ­izations with the 
least participation, employees are informed of decisions, perhaps before they 
are implemented, and are sometimes told some of the reasoning ­behind them. 
In the ­middle levels, employees are involved to some extent in making deci­
sions. Often this involvement is confined to committees or task forces that 
gather information, and then recommend what decision should be made. For 
example, library directors commonly use search committees to screen can­
didates and to make recommendations about which individual should be 
hired. In ­these cases, the decision is not solely the committee’s, but the com­
mittee members play an impor­tant role in the decision-­making pro­cess. In 
the organ­izations with the most shared leadership, employees actually make 
the decisions. In some libraries, teams are given such responsibilities. Organ­
izations that use teams, especially self-­managed teams, are representative 
FIGURE 17.1. Empowerment, Involvement, and Workplace Commitment

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  421
of the most participative organ­izations. The rest of this chapter ­will focus on 
teams and their use in libraries.
The Use of Teams in Libraries
The use of teams in organ­izations in lieu of a traditional hierarchical 
management structure is becoming more common in all types of organ­
izations, including libraries. ­These teams do work that previously had been 
done by individuals. To use teams successfully, man­ag­ers need to call upon 
all of the skills of leading that have been discussed thus far. Effective team 
management requires man­ag­ers who are skilled at motivating, leading, and 
communicating, but this type of leading is often complicated ­because man­
ag­ers are working with groups of individuals instead of single employees.
Although many multinational organ­izations are employing virtual 
teams (i.e., teams whose members are geo­graph­i­cally dispersed, and who 
work together using vari­ous information technology tools), this chapter ­will 
focus primarily on teams working in the same physical location, ­because that 
is the type of team that is most prevalent in libraries. However, librarians 
who work with off-­site colleagues, who are active on committees in profes­
sional associations, or who work with consortia, have to function, at least part 
of the time, as members of virtual teams. As more library directors permit 
at least some workers to telecommute, that type of team likely ­will become 
more common in the ­future.24
Teams are popu­lar for many reasons. They typically outperform indi­
viduals when the tasks being done require multiple skills, experience, and 
judgment. The flexibility and responsiveness of teams is a good approach to 
dealing with the rapidly changing environment encountered in most organ­
izations. Moreover, like all other types of employee empowerment, the use of 
teams increases job satisfaction and morale.
It is hard to get any exact numbers about how many libraries are actually 
using teams. Teams are fairly common in large academic libraries. The Asso­
ciation of Research Libraries (ARL) reported as early as 1998 that most ARL 
libraries ­were, at least, experimenting with teams.25 Some academic libraries, 
for instance ­those at the University of Arizona and the University of Mary­
land, have been completely restructured into team-­based organ­izations.26
A recent study of academic libraries found that more than 60 ­percent of 
the libraries surveyed ­were ­either completely team based or partially team 
based.27 A 2006 study of academic medical libraries also found a growing 
number that use teams.28
Teams are common in many other types and parts of libraries. They fre­
quently are found in technical ser­vices departments where they perform 
functions such as acquisitions, cata­loging, and database and Web site main­
tenance.29 Teams are used in many reference departments. For instance, the 
Ohio State University Health Sciences Library has a Reference and Infor­
mation Ser­vices Team (RIST) that manages the library’s reference ser­vices 
and oversees access, outreach, and education ser­vices. RIST has a team coor­
dinator position that rotates among members on a semi-­annual basis. The 
team coordinator is responsible for preparing team agendas and facilitating 
team meetings.30 Some directors are using virtual teams consisting of librar­
ians, library technicians, and information system specialists from dif­fer­ent 
library departments or institutions to span temporal and geographic barri­
ers by communicating via e-­mail and other electronic media in order to 
accomplish specific proj­ects.31

422  Leading
Even though most of the libraries adopting the team approach have been 
large academic libraries, teams are now being implemented in smaller librar­
ies. The Teton County Library, a public library in Wyoming with a collection 
size of about 100,000 and 34 full-­time employees, has reor­ga­nized itself into 
a team-­based organ­ization.32 All indications show that the number of librar­
ies using the team-­based approach is growing steadily. The team approach 
to library organ­ization has many champions. For instance, John Lubans 
writes, “Teamwork is my preferred orga­nizational model of accomplishing 
our library mission. ­There are, of course, other models that can liberate staff 
to do their best and achieve ser­vice improvements, but based on personal 
experience I root for teams.”33
­There are also libraries that do not use team management but use work­
ing groups or committees as an integral part of their structure. Although, 
as discussed in a following section, ­there is a difference between true teams 
and other types of work groups, many of the princi­ples related to team build­
ing and developing are applicable to committees and other types of groups 
used in library management. Some of the most commonly used types of teams 
are listed in ­table 17.2.
Although the use of teams is becoming more common, library man­ag­
ers need to think carefully about the implications of changing to a team 
approach before they begin to implement the pro­cess. A man­ag­er cannot just 
create teams and expect them to work effectively. Instead, successful teams 
are built and developed. Individuals act differently when they are part of a 
group than when they are alone, so any man­ag­er contemplating establish­
ing teams should become familiar with the lit­er­a­ture concerning group 
be­hav­ior. Using teams often complicates the pay structure of organ­izations, 
as man­ag­ers have to decide ­whether all team members are paid the same or 
given the same percentage of pay increase.34 It is also sometimes difficult 
for man­ag­ers to switch from managing in a hierarchical organ­ization to a 
team-­based one ­because it takes dif­fer­ent skills to manage teams.
Even the use of the word team can produce confusion. Obviously, ­there are 
many types of teams, ranging from sports teams to debating teams. Although 
all teams share a number of similarities, the focus in this chapter ­will be on 
work teams. A work team is a group of ­people who interact and coordinate 
their work in order to accomplish specific work goals. Teams differ from groups 
in many aspects. Some of ­these differences are listed in figure 17.2.
­TABLE 17.2. Types of Teams
Self-­directed or self-­managed teams: Teams that have been given a charge by 
se­nior management relating to a specific proj­ect or ongoing pro­cess and that have 
almost complete discretion in deciding how to accomplish their objectives.
Proj­ect teams: Teams that are constituted for a set amount of time to work on a 
specific proj­ect or task. This type of team is sometimes called a task force.
Functional Teams: Work teams composed of a man­ag­er and the employees in 
his or her unit who are involved in efforts to improve work activities or to solve 
specific prob­lems within par­tic­u­lar functional unit.
Cross-­functional teams: Teams that include participants from a number of 
departments or specializations.
Virtual teams: Teams that have members who are located in dif­fer­ent geo­
graphic locations and rarely meet face-­to-­face. Team members communicate and 
work through electronic technologies such as the Internet and teleconferencing.

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  423
Teams differ from groups in that ­there is greater unity of purpose and 
loyalty in a team. ­There is also a greater tendency in teams to hold one 
another (rather than a supervisor) mutually accountable for achieving the 
team’s goals. Work teams typically are led in one of two ways. Some of them 
are self-­managed or self-­directed; that is, they provide their own leadership. 
Other teams have a leader who coordinates the team’s activities. That posi­
tion sometimes rotates among the members of the team. A team almost 
always is able to perform at a higher level than a group, ­because its mem­
bers are committed to a team goal that they are willing to put ahead of their 
own self-­interests. “Teamwork is purposeful interde­pen­dency, which has the 
synergistic effect of accomplishing more than the sum of the parts.”35
­Because the use of teams is becoming increasingly popu­lar, it is likely 
that although some man­ag­ers say that they use team management in their 
libraries, they merely are giving lip ser­vice to the concept. Just ­because you 
call a group a team, does not make it one. Renaming an existing department 
a team without changing how the work is done ­will not make a department 
a true team. As Ruth Metz writes,
A group of ­people does not make a team . . . ​Naming a group a 
team does not make it one. A group saying that it is a team does 
not make it one ­either. For instance, a group of man­ag­ers is not 
a team just ­because they call themselves a management team

Talk About It
Teams are being used more frequently in organ­izations of all types but are not univer­
sally loved by workers. In an op-ed column in the New York Times, Susan Cain points 
out some of the prob­lems:
Our companies, our schools and our culture are in thrall to an idea I call the New 
Groupthink which holds that creativity and achievement come from an oddly 
gregarious place. Most of us now work in teams, in offices without walls, for 
man­ag­ers who prize ­people skills above all. Lone geniuses are out. Collaboration 
is in. But ­there’s a prob­lem with this view. Research strongly suggests that 
­people are more creative when they enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption. 
And the most spectacularly creative ­people in many fields are often introverted. 
­They’re not joiners by nature.38
Cain does not suggest that we abolish teamwork; she recognizes that many of the prob­
lems we face ­today are more complex than ever before and benefit from a team approach. 
However, she maintains that “most ­humans have two contradictory impulses: we love 
and need one another, yet we crave privacy and autonomy. To harness the energy that 
fuels both ­these drives, we need to move beyond the New Groupthink and embrace a 
more nuanced approach to creativity and learning.”39
Do you like working in teams? In your opinion what ­things do teams do best? 
What ­things do individuals do best? Do you agree that most ­humans have the two con­
tradictory impulses described by Cain? How can organ­izations adopt the “more nuanced 
approach” to teams that Cain advocates?
and meet together regularly. A work unit may call itself a team 
when it is actually more like an armed camp. Effective, high-­
performance teams have a structure and operate ­under condi­
tions that enable the team to perform effectively.36
Implementing teams in the truest sense is a profound change for most 
man­ag­ers in organ­izations and their staffs. ­Because more time would need 
to be spent in meetings, ­there is often apprehension that use of teams might 
result in a loss of productivity. Some ­people fear that the use of teams ­will 
produce mediocre decisions or a decline in productivity. In addition, ­there is 
often a fear of loss of control. As the ARL report mentioned earlier states, 
“The command and control cultures that team-­based cultures replace are 
quite per­sis­tent, and the transition to teams can be especially difficult for 
­middle man­ag­ers, who may perceive it as a loss of power and influence.”37
However, research has shown that the use of teams in organ­izations can 
be effective, especially if the work to be done is complex. Advocates of team 
management say that teams are beneficial ­because they increase productiv­
ity, lead to better decisions, enhance employee commitment to work, foster 
creativity and innovation, increase orga­nizational flexibility, and lead to 
greater customer satisfaction.
However, the use of teams has some disadvantages. It usually takes a 
group longer to achieve a goal than it would take an individual, ­because 
group decision making is almost always slower than individual decision mak­
ing. If teams are not carefully selected, they may have members who lack 

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  425
interest or motivation and do not assume their fair share of the responsibil­
ity. The tendency of some group members to reduce their work effort in groups 
and let the other team members take up the slack is known as social loafing. 
Social loafing can understandably cause tension and resentment within a 
group. In addition, sometimes group decisions are not as good as individual 
decisions ­because of groupthink. Groupthink is a result of valuing a desire 
for harmony and conformity over critical evaluation. When pressures for una­
nim­i­ty are ­great, team members are less likely to consider alternative solu­
tions. Fi­nally, a phenomenon known as risky shift occurs when individuals 
in groups make riskier decisions than they would have if deciding alone. 
When a decision is reached by a group, each individual feels less personal 
responsibility for the consequence of that decision ­because the shared risk 
makes the individual risk less. As a result, groups are likely to make riskier 
decisions than decisions made by individuals. The group dynamics that are 
inevitable in any team situation can complicate the workings of the team 
and anyone who works on a team needs to be aware of ­these dynamics and 
their consequences.
Nonetheless, man­ag­ers who have moved to a team-­based approach are 
growing in number, and it is likely that man­ag­ers in other libraries ­will 
increasingly use teams in part or all of their organ­izations in the ­future. 
Teams can be effective if the organ­ization that employs them understands 
the complex nature of teams and group dynamics. The next sections of this 
chapter ­will look at ways to build effective teams.
Characteristics of Effective Teams
No team should be put together haphazardly. Instead, man­ag­ers need 
to choose team members carefully, ensuring that the mix is right for the task 
that has to be accomplished. Research on teams has shown that certain char­
acteristics are associated with successful teams. As can be seen in figure 17.3, 
the most successful teams have the following characteristics:
Relevant skills. The members of a team have to have both the technical 
and the interpersonal skills needed to allow the team to be effective.
Mutual trust. The participants in effective teams trust the other members 
of the team.
Appropriate size. Although teams ­will vary in number of members, the 
most effective team size usually is considered to be from 5 to 12 mem­
bers. ­These numbers produce a team large enough to have varying 
points of view but still small enough to remain workable.
Good communication. The most effective teams have learned to commu­
nicate well. They convey messages that are understood, and they have 
learned to incorporate feedback from other team members and from 
management.
Appropriate leadership. Effective teams have leaders to help them achieve 
their goals. ­These leaders are not necessarily man­ag­ers; they can be 
members of the team itself, as is common in self-­managed teams. The 
role of the man­ag­er in a team is not so much to provide direction as to 
serve as a coach and a facilitator.
Clear goals. The most effective teams know what their goals are and 
how to mea­sure pro­gress ­toward ­those goals. This clarity of goals 

426  Leading
helps ensure the team members’ commitment to the achievement of 
the goals.
Loyalty. Effective team members display loyalty to their group. They iden­
tify with the team and are willing to work hard to help the team accom­
plish its goals.40
Stages of Team Development
No team, no ­matter how carefully its members are chosen, functions at 
a high level of efficiency when it is first formed. ­People who are asked to work 
together for the first time have to get to know each other and learn how to 
work together. Most teams go through a sequence of development. The best-­
known model of how teams evolve over time is called the five-­stage model.41 
­These stages—­forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning—­
are illustrated in figure 17.4.
When individuals are first placed in a team, the team begins to take 
shape. In organ­izations, ­people usually are placed in a team ­because of a 
work assignment. The first stage, that of forming, occurs when the team is 
established and when the definitions of its purpose, structure, and leader­
ship begin to be deci­ded. The second stage, usually called storming, takes 
place in the early stages of a team’s development. The new members of the 
team are questioning many ­things, including who has control of the team 
and what is the team’s direction. ­After the storming stage is finished, the 
norming stage begins. This is a relatively tranquil period. ­There is now a 
sense of the team’s identity and purpose. The team has assimilated a com­
mon set of expectations, the norms, concerning what is expected of each team 
member. The performing stage exists when the team is fully functional. Team 
energy has gone from getting to know one another and setting the norms to 
accomplishing the tasks. The last stage, adjourning, takes place in teams 
FIGURE 17.3. Characteristics of Effective Teams

All groups have established norms, acceptable standards that are shared by the group’s 
members. Norms dictate output levels, absenteeism rates, promptness or tardiness, the 
amount of socializing allowed on the job, and so on. Some of ­these norms an implicit and 
­others are explicit.
Think of a team or group that you have been part of now or in the past. What ­were 
some of the norms that ­were accepted? How did ­those norms become established? What 
has to happen if a team leader or member wants to replace a norm that is no longer 
appropriate?
that have a limited time span, such as a task force. The team has completed 
its task and is preparing to disband. The team turns away from task per­for­
mance and directs its attention to disbanding. If the team’s work has gone 
well, ­there is a feeling of accomplishment. Many in the team may feel sadness 
and loss ­because of the breakup of the team and the loss of camaraderie.
Basic Steps in Team Building
Wise man­ag­ers realize that requiring ­people to work together does not 
automatically result in an effective team. Instead, a team must be nurtured 
and developed. Robert D. Stueart and Maureen ­Sullivan have provided some 
general guidelines for shaping successful teams. Among ­these are:
•	 Make sure each member participates and contributes
•	 Encourage creativity and expression of dif­fer­ent ideas and approaches
•	 Agree on a set of ground rules for the group
•	 Focus on the big picture, what is in the best interest of the ­whole 
organ­ization
•	 Use meeting time for discussion and developing ideas, and time 
between meetings for preparation and background work
•	 Use consensus building to make decisions
•	 Set aside time at the end of each meeting to evaluate how ­things are 
­going
•	 Ask for help or guidance as needed
•	 Always have fun and celebrate success.42
FIGURE 17.4. Five Stages of Team Development

428  Leading
Individual members of teams or groups of teams do not always get along. 
Conflict arises from vari­ous sources and when it does, it should be addressed 
as quickly as pos­si­ble. One of the most common ­causes of conflict is poor com­
munication. Other conflicts arise from personality clashes caused by differ­
ences in values and attitudes. Sometimes conflict arises ­because of disputes 
over scarce resources including information, funding, or even supplies. Con­
fusion over job bound­aries and responsibilities can also result in conflict. 
­Handling conflict can be tricky but must be done ­because ignoring conflict only 
allows it to simmer and then erupt again. The best approach to ­handling con­
flict is to try to come up with a compromise that is acceptable to all parties.
To be effective, teams need to be nurtured and developed while employ­
ees are becoming accustomed to this new approach to the way they do their 
jobs. Employees who have never worked in teams cannot be expected to make 
an easy transition from an orga­nizational structure in which they always 
have been told what to do to one in which they are responsible for their own 
self-­management. Library directors who are considering implementing a 
team approach can learn a ­great deal from other directors who already have 
implemented this type of management system.
The Roles ­People Play in Teams
Teams are composed of individuals with dif­fer­ent temperaments and 
skills. Teams need to have this diversity in membership to achieve success 
­because dif­fer­ent skills are needed at dif­fer­ent times. As team members work 
together, dif­fer­ent individuals ­will assume dif­fer­ent roles within the team 
dependent upon aspects of their skills and personality. ­Because teams usu­
ally need to accomplish a number of dif­fer­ent types of tasks, it is impor­tant 
to have team members who are able to play specific roles in helping the team 
achieve its objectives. Researchers have done a ­great deal of work on the roles 
­people play within a team setting and the relationship between ­these roles

and the team’s effectiveness.43 In general, ­these roles fall into two broad cat­
egories. The task management roles are ­those that facilitate accomplishing 
the task that needs to be done. The team maintenance roles are focused upon 
the emotional well-­being of the individuals in the group and on the function­
ing of the group itself rather than on the task that needs to be done. Some of 
the major roles in each of ­these categories can be seen in ­table 17.3.
Teams need to have individuals play both types of roles. ­People often play 
more than one role in a team, and it is very common to have ­people who play 
a variety of roles depending on what is needed at a par­tic­u­lar time. Most 
­people are ­either stronger at the task management role functions or the more 
people-­centered roles, although some team members may be equally skilled 
in both types of roles. Teams should try to avoid having members who do not 
contribute to the set of roles, ­because ­these individuals contribute ­little to 
the success of a team.
Fi­nally, ­there are some roles that ­people adopt in groups that impede the 
work of the team and make it less effective than it could be. ­These dysfunc­
tional roles, which hinder the work of the team, consist of be­hav­ior that is 
directed ­toward fulfilling personal rather than team needs. Some of ­these 
harmful roles are:
•	 Blocking other ­people’s suggestions and contributions, or the team’s 
attempt to come to closure
•	 Being overly aggressive and competitive and always pushing for one’s 
own way
•	 Putting down other team members
•	 Withdrawing and not participating in the team’s activities
•	 Disrupting meetings by excessively interrupting, talking excessively, 
and holding side discussions
•	 Acting like a clown and not taking anything seriously.
It is clear from this discussion of roles that all the members of a team 
are interdependent upon one another. The success of a team depends upon a 
group of individuals who need to cover a wide range of goals necessary to 
accomplish a task and to keep a team functioning smoothly. For this reason, 
teams with a ­great diversity of personalities and skills often perform better 
than more homogenous teams.
Team Communication
A team’s effectiveness to a large extent depends on communication. 
Obviously, the ability of team members to understand and to communicate is 
what enables them to work together collaboratively. All of the ­factors discussed 

430  Leading
previously related to improving communication are also applicable to team 
communication. In addition to interteam communication, ­there is communi­
cation in any team-­based organ­ization that takes place between the man­ag­ers 
and the members of the teams.
Managing teams requires dif­fer­ent types of managerial skills, includ­
ing a dif­fer­ent type of communication, and man­ag­ers have to learn how to 
communicate in a fashion that fits this new model. Instead of being a boss, 
a team leader functions more like a facilitator. The man­ag­er goes from being 
someone who tells employees how to do ­things to one who facilitates the 
employees ­doing it on their own. Coaching is a term that is used often in 
describing the type of communication that occurs between man­ag­ers and 
members of teams. Coaching is defined as “the purposeful and skillful effort 
by one individual to help another achieve specific per­for­mance goals.”44
If a library has self-­directed work teams, coaches can be useful in a num­
ber of situations. Sometimes they are needed when goals have to be redefined 
or clarified, when new skills have to be acquired, or when a team is struggling 
and appears to have gone off track. Sometimes difficult tasks confronted by 
a team, such as where to allocate resources, are facilitated by a coach.45 
Man­ag­ers who are skillful coaches help their organ­ization get the most out 
of teams.
The ­Future of Work Teams in Libraries
Some libraries have switched to a totally self-­managed team-­based 
approach and have been highly successful. For instance, the full-­time pro­
fessional librarians at Dowling College in New York, a medium-­sized com­
prehensive college with nine full-­time, faculty librarians, have been or­ga­nized 
into a self-­managed team since 1993, when the provost eliminated the posi­
tion of library director and reor­ga­nized the library using an academic depart­
ment model. Weekly departmental meetings are used for communication 
and to address issues, and departmental decisions are made by consensus 
or majority rule. A recent study found that not only are the librarians satis­
fied with the self-­managed team approach but that the students and alumni 
are very satisfied with the library ser­vices, which implies that “the positive 
experiences for librarians in the SMT structure translated into positive expe­
riences for library users.”46 The library at the Center for Creative Leader­
ship in Greensboro, North Carolina, has been or­ga­nized as a self-­managed 
team since 2005. Being a part of a self-­managed team brings new responsi­
bilities not shouldered by librarians in a more hierarchical structure. As Jean 
Vollrath from the Center for Creative Leadership library writes:
Suddenly, each person in the library had an equal stake in the 
governance of the library. As a team, every­one had to contribute 
to determining what work needed to be done. Every­one had to 
participate in getting the work done. Every­one carried the 
responsibility for helping the library become more innovative, 
and every­one had to participate in changing the visibility and 
perception of the library. And the team as a ­whole had to culti­
vate a new working relationship with the new boss two levels 
higher in the organ­ization.47
Vollrath reports that the new organ­ization is working very well, and the 
librarians are happy with the new structure.

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  431
Practice Your Skills
You are part of a newly formed cross-­functional team that has been implemented to select 
and purchase a new integrated library system. The team brings together ­people from 
many departments of the library and includes many ­people that you do not know well at 
all. The first team meeting was last week and the second is scheduled for this morning. 
You have noticed (it would be hard not to) that one of the team members tends to domi­
nate the discussion. This group member not only talks too much but also refuses to let 
­others enter the conversation. You have deci­ded to try to put a stop to this.
Find a classmate or colleague to role-­play this situation. What would you say to the 
team member who is talking too much? Can you think of a comment that would not 
antagonize the team member? What type of ground rules could be instituted to improve 
group communication in this team?
Organ­izing the entire library as a self-­managing team would work only 
in small organ­izations, but directors in many larger libraries have or­ga­nized 
separate departments or functions as self-­managing teams. Other libraries 
have teams with a leader who coordinates the team’s activities. Regardless 
of the type of team utilized, many librarians report success in the use of 
teams. Librarians have found that teams producing high-­quality work are 
beneficial for the employees, ­because “teaming ­people up to grapple with chal­
lenging ser­vice issues, even if the pro­cess is inefficient by some standards, 
gives ­people a place at the learning ­table.”48
Although the team approach is becoming increasingly popu­lar, it is not 
universally accepted by all library directors. A few library directors ­either 
have experimented with teams and abandoned them or have deci­ded not even 
to explore the approach. The team-­based organ­ization provides benefits, but 
to implement it successfully, a library director has to be willing to invest con­
siderable time and resources in the effort. ­These directors think that the ben­
efits that might result from the team approach are not worth the cost. The 
decision about ­whether the team approach to management should be imple­
mented ­will be dif­fer­ent for each library, and the decision may change as an 
organ­ization itself evolves. At the pres­ent, directors in many libraries are 
successfully using team-­based management, and ­others are successfully 
managing without the use of teams. Nevertheless, in ­every library, ­there is 
more employee participation in management now than in the past, and this 
participation likely ­will increase as libraries continue to change in response to 
the demands of their users and to rapid changes in information technology.
Contingency Approach to Leading
Many varying and often contradictory perspectives on leading have been 
covered in the preceding chapters. What is clear is that neither behavioral 
scientists nor experts from any other discipline have been able to provide 
man­ag­ers with a specific prescription or universal theory about the most 
effective way to lead. The ­factors that constitute this management function 
are complex and multidimensional, and, therefore, leading demands ­great 
skill to perform well. Unlike early theorists in management who relied on 
general princi­ples to provide the one best way, most modern management 
theorists are convinced that ­there are few across-­the-­board concepts that 
apply in all instances. The situations with which man­ag­ers deal are much 

432  Leading
Practice Your Skills
Think about an organ­ization that you know fairly well. This may be ­either a library or 
another type of organ­ization. Imagine that this organ­ization is trying to adopt contin­
gency theory management and has hired you as a con­sul­tant to help implement this 
approach. Analyze your organ­ization in terms of the tasks it performs, the ­people who 
work ­there, the structure of the organ­ization, the management style used, and the exter­
nal environment in which the organ­ization is located. What approaches to management 
do you think would be most likely to succeed in this organ­ization?
more complex than originally realized, and dif­fer­ent variables require man­
ag­ers to adopt dif­fer­ent approaches. Instead of advocating a universal best 
theory, most con­temporary management experts urge man­ag­ers to be flexi­
ble and to adapt to the situation at hand. ­These experts, if asked how a man­
ag­er should act, would say, “It all depends.”
Man­ag­ers should not become skeptical about the diversified approaches 
to management being offered to them. Instead, they should realize that in 
the case of leading, as in most other instances, one size does not fit all. While 
­there is no quick fix or magic solution, this does not mean that man­ag­ers 
should not become familiar with as many of the approaches or tools as pos­
si­ble. All of ­these methods are useful, but none of them is guaranteed to be 
effective in ­every situation. Instead, man­ag­ers have to look at the organ­
ization and its goals and then adopt a management strategy that ­will match 
the overall needs of the organ­ization, its employees, and its customers.
Unfortunately for ­those who are looking for one right way to manage, that 
one right way does not exist. Good management is more complex than that. 
Contingency or situational theory, already discussed briefly in chapter 2, pro­
vides man­ag­ers with a way to bring all of the disparate approaches together 
in an approach that provides the flexibility necessary to manage modern 
organ­izations. Contingency theory recognizes that ­every organ­ization is 
unique, existing in a unique environment with unique workers and a unique 
purpose. Contingency theory is used to analyze individual situations and to 
understand the interrelationships between the variables to help man­ag­ers 
determine what specific managerial actions are necessary in par­tic­u­lar sit­
uations. What is appropriate in one situation may be inappropriate in another. 
The best techniques can be selected only ­after one is aware of the par­tic­u­lar 
circumstances of each case. Contingency management suggests ­there must be 
a fit between the task, the ­people, the organ­ization, and the external envi­
ronment. In each organ­ization, man­ag­ers must be sure that each unit develops 
structures and mea­sure­ment schemes, and rewards practices that encour­
age its members to focus on the appropriate set of activities.
Man­ag­ers who wish to use the contingency approach must understand 
the complex, interrelated ­causes of be­hav­ior in an organ­ization, and then use 
their intelligence and creative ability to invent a new solution or to judge 
which existing solutions might best be used. Library man­ag­ers using this 
approach might decide that dif­fer­ent sections of the library would benefit 
from dif­fer­ent styles of leading. For example, a part of a technical ser­vices 
department that performs highly standardized, repetitive work might benefit 
from a more task-­oriented style of management. In the same library, a more 
people-­oriented style of management might be appropriate for the reference 
department.

Empowering Employees through the Use of Teams  433
The contingency theory can be used in functions of management other 
than leading. For instance, as discussed in section 3, ­there is no one best way 
for an institution to be or­ga­nized, and ­there are also no surefire approaches 
to planning, controlling, or managing ­human resources. Many variables, 
such as size, type of organ­ization, and kind of tasks being performed, play a 
role in the choice to be made. In the broadest sense, contingency theory applies 
to all of the managerial functions and provides man­ag­ers with a comprehen­
sive model that can be used to achieve maximum effectiveness in all mana­
gerial functions. With the contingency approach, the per­for­mance of managerial 
functions is closely tied to an analy­sis of the total system: the organ­ization, 
its subsystems, and its environment. Contingency theory offers a flexible 
approach that is better suited to the complexity of management than are 
other approaches.
“The basic deficiency with earlier approaches is that they did not 
recognize the variability in tasks and ­people which produces this 
complexity. The strength of the contingency approach is that it 
begins to provide a way of thinking about this complexity, rather 
than ignoring it.”49
Although the contingency approach to management certainly does not provide 
all of the answers, it provides a way of making sense of a number of disparate 
approaches.
Conclusion
This section has dealt with the function of leading, which is the most inter­
personal aspect of management. The chapters have dealt primarily with how 
to motivate, lead, and communicate, but other related topics such as ethics 
and team building have been included. The ultimate aim of leading is to allow 
the organ­ization to achieve its objectives through the activities of the ­people 
employed within it. Leading means getting employees to work efficiently and 
to produce results that are beneficial to the organ­ization. In essence, leading 
is getting ­things done through other ­people for the good of the organ­ization. 
Leading is very impor­tant ­because it allows the man­ag­er to maximize the 
use of the organ­ization’s ­human resources, which are the most impor­tant 
asset of any organ­ization.
­Because leading is so complex and multifaceted, man­ag­ers often find it 
one of their most challenging and impor­tant tasks. The need for man­ag­ers 
to excel at leading becomes more pressing as organ­izations grow larger, as 
the rate of change in the environment increases, and as demands by employ­
ees for a more rewarding work life proliferate. The next section of this book 
discusses ways that man­ag­ers coordinate a modern organ­ization. Fi­nally, 
some of the challenges and rewards of managing in the 21st ­century ­will be 
discussed in the last chapter of this book.

director. Each day, Mary does the work she is assigned. She has ­little contact with 
employees outside her own department and no input into decisions that are made 
concerning her job. Libraries of that time are like other organ­izations of the same 
era: managed from the top down with the director making almost all decisions.50
Flash forward to the pres­ent . . . ​
Mary’s grand­son, Ben, received an MLIS degree last year and also has 
gone to work in an academic library. The environment he works in as a beginning 
librarian is vastly dif­fer­ent from the one that his grand­mother encountered. 
Ben frequently works on committees and teams with ­people outside of his depart­
ment. He expects to have some input into decision making. He spends time in 
meetings in which he learns about overall library issues and contributes his 
knowledge and efforts to many activities outside of his department.
Mary and Ben each worked in libraries that reflect the managerial phi­
losophy of their time. What prob­lems would Ben encounter if he had to work in 
his grand­mother’s library? Would an employee of Mary’s era have prob­lems 
adjusting to Ben’s library?
2.	You are the leader of a nine-­person cross-­functional team that has been formed 
to migrate the library’s bibliographic rec­ords from its current platform to a new 
cloud-­based platform. This ­will be a large and complicated proj­ect. Using your 
knowledge of teams, what would be some of the first steps you would take to get 
your team off to a good start?
3.	According to Spreitzer and Porath, man­ag­ers can take four mea­sures to help 
employees thrive at work. An organ­ization wanting to promote vitality and 
learning should:
•	 Provide decision making discretion
•	 Share information
•	 Minimize incivility
•	 Offer per­for­mance feedback.51
Can you think of ways ­these four mea­sures could be or are being imple­
mented at an organ­ization with which you are familiar?
4.	The Avondale Public Library man­ag­ers have deci­ded to begin to use teams in 
most parts of their organ­ization, and a number of new teams have just been 
established. You have been put on one of ­these teams and have been working as 
part of the team for two weeks now. You are beginning to think that working in 
teams is not very effective. The workplace is full of conflict. ­People seem to be 
constantly testing each other and trying to establish control, and not much real 
work is being done. What is ­going on ­here? Should you be discouraged? What 
would you do to try to improve ­things?
Discussion Questions
1.	 Michael Jordan, the basketball legend, wrote, “One ­thing that I believe to the 
fullest is that if you think and achieve as a team, the individual accolades ­will 
take care of themselves. Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence 
wins championships.”52

7.	Sahoo, Behera, and Tripathy, “Employee Empowerment and Individual 
Commitment.”
This statement is obviously true about basketball, but does it also apply in 
the workplace? How can teams make individuals successful?
2.	Managing is sometimes defined as getting ­things done through other ­people. 
That definition can be interpreted in several ways. James Hayes, a former busi­
ness school dean once observed, “The [person] who is new to management hears 
[the definition] this way: “Management is getting ­things done through other 
­people.” Now at last I have a kingdom and someone to work for me. . . . ​Then [the 
man­ag­er] can sweep down to [the] subordinate all the nasty jobs. . . . ​However, 
[the man­ag­er] ­later reaches the point of maturity [and] hears the definition 
with a dif­fer­ent emphasis: “Management is getting ­things done through other 
­people.” It is when [the man­ag­er] gets the sense of responsibility for accomplish­
ment that he [or she] is a man­ag­er.”53
What are the differences between ­these two interpretations and why does 
Hayes say that one is more mature than the other?
3.	Virtual teams are being increasingly used in our global society. What are some 
of the prob­lems faced by teams who are not able to meet face to face? Would you 
like to be a member of a virtual team?
4.	Marianne Broadbent is an Australian management expert who believes that 
trust is essential to building a ­great team. In her opinion, ­great teams ­don’t just 
happen but instead are the outcome of a conscious and deliberate effort to under­
stand what makes teams work well. As she says, creating effective teams is not 
“rocket science.” She then asks, “So why do so many of us have experiences of 
mediocre, frustrating, or just plain bad team work? The answer lies in the ­simple 
failure to do the work to build genuine trust among team members. To build that 
trust the individuals need to ­really get to know one another as ­people. They 
need to know what ­matters to each other, to deal with conflict constructively, 
agree on commitments and then hold each other accountable for delivering agreed 
results.”54
Why is trust so impor­tant? Have you ever worked on a team that was lack­
ing in trust? What ­were the consequences? What can team members and man­
ag­ers do to increase the level of trust within the team?

Section 6
Coordinating
Accountability is a key concept in management. It shows key stakeholders 
how the library or information center is functioning. It is a way to mea­sure 
how well the organ­ization is meeting the goals of the strategic plan and per­
forming within the limits of the annual bud­get, and it is a way to demon­
strate to prospective and current donors and grant givers that the library is 
well run and worthy of support. Library and information center man­ag­ers 
are ultimately accountable to their parent institutions and to their users. 
Methods of coordination—­assessment, bud­get development, and external 
fundraising demonstrate ­whether the needs of library customers are met and 
managed within the limits of available funds. Assessment techniques such 
as per­for­mance indicators, outcomes mea­sure­ment, and tools of coordination 
give man­ag­ers useful data to chart a library’s pro­gress. A library’s bud­get 
tells a story, it shows the priorities of the organ­ization. For new areas, effec­
tive man­ag­ers find resources through grants or donations to test out new 
ideas or underwrite areas of strength.
Coordination implies the existence of workable plans with identified and 
realistic goals. This enhances the development of regulations and focuses 
orga­nizational activities on the plan’s goals and objectives. With that com­
mitment in place, tools and techniques can strengthen accountability and 
aid pro­gress ­toward meeting established goals. In order to remain account­
able, a library or information center must evaluate its per­for­mance to ensure 
that both the ­human and the material resources are effectively and efficiently 
employed ­toward achieving the library or information center’s goals and ­those 
of the larger institution of which it is a part.
Inextricably tied to the planning pro­cess, assessment is essential ­because 
it is impossible to effectively plan without knowing how the success of that 
plan can be mea­sured. The ­whole management pro­cess can be viewed as a 
circle, with the evaluation step in the decision-­making pro­cess being the com­
ponent that completes the circle and brings the organ­ization back, full circle, 
to ­future planning, a necessary step in the change cycle of organ­izations. The 
function of coordinating and controlling in order that good decisions can 
be made requires accurate and timely information. The bud­geting aspect 
pulls together the vari­ous pieces of an orga­nizational plan and relates it to 

440  Coordinating
the ser­vices plan in monetary terms. With fundraising and grant writing, 
man­ag­ers identify aspects of the plan that are worthy, but not funded by the 
bud­get. They seek out donors and grants that ­will help provide funds for 
enhanced ser­vices to library and information center users.
This section addresses the most impor­tant coordination tools and tech­
niques necessary for ­today’s information ser­vices organ­izations.

Evaluating Orga­nizational 
Per­for­mance
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand why library man­ag­ers need to mea­sure the library’s activities
•	 Discuss vari­ous per­for­mance mea­sures used in libraries
•	 Be able to explain how evaluation fits into strategic planning
•	 Know the components of an evaluation plan
•	 Be able to explain ROI, benchmarking, and focus group techniques
Since the beginning of the 21st ­century, assessment in libraries has become 
an impor­tant and recognized concept.1 Libraries have always evaluated their 
ser­vices but, with the advent of increased scrutiny and better research tools,2 
the need and importance of mea­sur­ing the success of a library has dramati­
cally increased. Recently, the number of tools and techniques developed to 
understand library user be­hav­ior has expanded. New mea­sure­ments with 
legitimacy and authority have appeared while funding organ­izations are ask­
ing man­ag­ers hard questions about the value that their organ­izations bring 
to the parent institution.3
Some basic ones are quantitative in nature; ­others have qualitative tech­
niques that have been developed or applied to libraries to mea­sure outcomes 
and observe value: how ­people use and value information accessed through 
ser­vices and systems of the library. No longer are mea­sures of circulation, 
gate count, or number of reference questions adequate to demonstrate value. 
The focus now is on users and understanding how to provide them with 

442  Coordinating
successful outcomes and demonstrating that success to ­those who fund the 
library. This chapter discusses some of the most impor­tant mea­sure­ment 
tools and techniques used to help man­ag­ers understand, improve, and mea­
sure the impact of information ser­vices.
Management on the Job: Assessment Librarians 
and Coordinators
The job title “assessment librarian” is a relatively new one in libraries. In the past the 
work of evaluating and mea­sur­ing ser­vices and programs was normally accomplished 
in the head librarian’s office. But since the increasing scrutiny of libraries of all kinds, 
with the challenge of increasing expectations from users and diminishing support from 
parent institutions, many libraries are adding assessment librarians by ­either reassign­
ing a librarian to this job or hiring from the outside. They are adding ­these positions to 
help the library administrators show the value of the library.
To help guide the hiring and development of ­these new assessment librarians, 
members of the Association of College and Research Libraries (a division of the Ameri­
can Library Association) have developed a guide called “ACRL Proficiencies for Assess­
ment Librarians and Coordinators”4 (ACRL produces a variety of “guidelines, standards 
and frameworks” to help academic librarians in all aspects of the work of academic librar­
ies.) In an article5 describing this ACRL standard, two of the ACRL committee mem­
bers, Mark Emmons and Megan Oakleaf, discuss the reasons for the standard and how 
it may be used by academic librarians. The authors discuss how this standards docu­
ment ­will benefit libraries contemplating the addition of an assessment librarian. The 
standard has 11 broad categories and 52 proficiencies that apply to assessment librari­
ans. The broad categories include:
	
1.	 Knowledge of assessment in libraries and higher education
	
2.	 Ethics
	
3.	 Assessment methods and strategies
	
4.	 Research design
	
5.	 Data collection and analy­sis
	
6.	 Communication and reporting
	
7.	 Advocacy and marketing
	
8.	 Collaboration and partnerships
	
9.	 Leadership
	
10.	 Management
	
11.	 Mentoring, training, and coaching.6
One ­thing the authors suggest is to apply a gap analy­sis to identify the organ­ization’s 
need for assessment personnel. Using this analy­sis, they can review and compare their 
own planning documents and other institutional documents to the proficiencies listed 
in the ACRL standards. Then they can identify the gaps that are not currently covered 
and use ­those areas to focus the job description/job ad. Once the position is filled the 
document may be used for onboarding the new assessment employee as well as for 
other employees for which assessment may be a smaller part of their jobs. The authors 
acknowledge that ­there may be a culture of re­sis­tance for assessment within libraries 

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  443
Mea­sur­ing and Evaluating
During the recent past, with dramatic shifts in the global economy as well 
as in the nature of information access and fast-­changing user expectations, 
the coordinating and control aspects of an information ser­vices organ­ization 
have become more pervasive, committing personnel at all levels to account­
ability in ser­vice quality. The pro­cess of reaching this point of accountability 
has involved development of several levels and types of mea­sures:
1.	 Input mea­sures, including both:
a.	 resources input; that is, bud­get, staff, facilities, materials, 
equipment
b.	 activities input; that is, programs developed to fulfill identified 
goals
2.	 Output mea­sures: the vari­ous products of program activities, mea­
sured by accomplishments (usually counted in numbers: number of 
books circulated, number of reference questions answered, ­etc.).
3.	 Outcomes assessments: the benefits or changes for individuals or 
populations during or ­after participating in activities, including, for 
instance, acquired knowledge or skills, changed attitudes or values, 
improvement in status or conditions, and so forth; ­these relate to 
inputs in order to identify and establish best practices for ­future 
ser­vices.
The pro­cess of mea­sur­ing, evaluating, and coordinating an organ­ization’s 
per­for­mance through identifying and developing output mea­sures and then 
assessing their success is now, more than ever before, an essential compo­
nent in the planning pro­cess. The concept of mea­sur­ing user-­centered infor­
mation ser­vices through user satisfaction has been incorporated in many 
strategic planning pro­cesses. This has come about through the realization 
that accountability requires assessing outcomes and determining success in 
the effort. Management strategies now more stringently address customer 
needs and satisfaction rather than simply quantifying activities as orga­
nizational inputs and tasks. This shift requires understanding user needs, 
their information-­seeking patterns, and ultimate satisfaction.
One major reason for the shift is that users and other stakeholders have 
become more sophisticated and their demands are greater, therefore placing 
more attention on adaptability and flexibility in providing ser­vices. This 
intense pressure on physical and personnel resources naturally brings with 
it a greater challenge for quality control. At the same time, it pres­ents oppor­
tunities to conduct real­ity checks along the way, providing a meaningful 
pro­cess of accountability that helps determine both the effectiveness and the 
efficiency of programs and ser­vices in the context of the organ­ization’s stated 
and that the document could provide a framework for discussion throughout the organ­
ization. They also recommend that the document be used for professional development 
planning in efforts to improve the assessment culture in libraries.
The authors recommend that nationally the document could be used for profes­
sional conference topics, to develop communities of practice, and to enhance library and 
information science education.

444  Coordinating
goals. Vari­ous techniques and tools have been developed and/or ­adopted by 
information ser­vices organ­izations to mea­sure how ­these goals are met.
This pro­cess of accountability requires greater attention to use of 
resources and proof of value of resources as well as a search for greater effi­
ciency of operation and effectiveness in meeting users’ needs. It also promotes 
efforts to mea­sure the institution’s worth in terms of user interaction with 
its resources and ser­vices.
Some Definitions
Per­for­mance indicators: an effort to develop decisions and actions in order 
to guide what an organ­ization does and why it does it
Input indicators: mea­sure resources, both ­human and financial; also can 
include mea­sures of characteristics of target populations
Output indicators: mea­sure the quantity of goods and ser­vices produced 
and the efficiency of production
Outcomes: achievement indicator reinforcing an emphasis on a specific 
per­for­mance
However, this shift does not obviate the need for factual data, which 
remains one impor­tant mea­sure for funding authorities. Traditionally, such 
statistical data have been collected in input areas, such as expenditures, 
material resources in analog or digital forms, circulation statistics, cata­
loging volume, use of cata­logs and bibliographic databases, number of staff, 
and output areas, such as number of transactions; hours the premises are 
accessible; and the availability, use, and usability of the material. ­These sta­
tistics also are used for comparative purposes with organ­izations of similar 
size and mission.
Librarians and other information ser­vices workers are now also seek­
ing ways of demonstrating deeper quality control along with that quantita­
tive data. Evaluation, accountability, and cost mea­sure­ment are intertwined 
in ­every aspect of work within the organ­ization, and solid per­for­mance indi­
cators are required to provide a basis for making decisions in the strategic 
planning pro­cess.
Qualitative information is gathered from such techniques as focus groups, 
interviewing, usability studies, and observation, which are but examples of 
techniques for understanding user be­hav­ior and are used to establish value. 
User satisfaction and expectations are impor­tant in the development of mea­
sures to establish not only user satisfaction but also the impact of library ser­
vices on communities of users and potential users.
The outcome of ­those types of tools and techniques enhances efforts to 
collect more amorphous data from such transactional information sources 
as library online systems, electronic information sources, consortial use 
arrangements, and sources available through the Internet, many of them 
based on technological innovations that now not only enhance but also chal­
lenge traditional modes of production and dissemination of information and 
mea­sure­ment of information ser­vices.
Per­for­mance Indicators
In order to improve per­for­mance standards, one technique an organ­
ization can use is to establish the outcome to be achieved. Therefore, per­for­
mance mea­sure­ment is not simply concerned with collecting data associated

Talk About It
“However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.”
—­Winston Churchill.
At this point, what are your thoughts about mea­sure­ment and library assess­
ment? How do you know if your strategic plan is successful? Can you identify any mea­
sures based on your experience? Did they work? How could they have been improved?
with a predefined per­for­mance goal or standard. The pro­cess should be quan­
titative or qualitative or both, with specific mea­sures expressed in order to 
determine success of that per­for­mance over time. Outcomes are the ways in 
which library users are changed as a result of their contact with the library’s 
resources and programs.7 ­Those outcomes have been identified variously as 
“benefits or changes” for individuals or populations during or ­after partici­
pating in program activities, including new knowledge, increased skills, 
changed attitudes or values, modified be­hav­ior, improved condition, or altered 
status (e.g., number of students whose grades improved ­after homework clin­
ics, number of ­children who maintained reading skills over the summer as 
a result of the summer reading program, number of ­people who report being 
better able to access and use networked information ­after attending infor­
mation literacy classes, ­etc.). This basically incorporates inputs, activities, 
and outputs, while adding the impor­tant ele­ment of outcome assessment.8
All types of libraries and information ser­vices organ­izations are attempt­
ing to take the next impor­tant initiative, having instituted input and output 
mea­sures, to focusing on outcomes assessment. This, of course, requires first 
identifying ­those outcomes to be achieved by the organ­ization. This step, 
beyond instituting “quality and outcome mea­sures,”9 is to develop an outcome 
assessment pro­cess to demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of ­those ser­
vices and the impact that they have on the lives of the public: the satisfac­
tion and the value they add.
Coordinating and Controlling
Some distinction must be made between the act of coordinating and the 
control mechanisms used to accomplish it. The two are interrelated. Effec­
tive coordinating within an organ­ization depends on the types of controls that 
are in place. Coordinating is the act, and controls are the means that pro­
vide information for decision making. The former pertains to an end, whereas 
the latter is the means; the first is concerned with events, and the other with 
facts; one is analytical and operational, concerned with what was and is, 
whereas the other deals with expectations.10 The management of resources 
requires a determination of what resources the organ­ization has at its dis­
posal, or should make available, and how ­those resources can be employed 
to achieve the mission of the organ­ization. It requires strong financial plan­
ning and feedback mechanisms to ensure success.
Control considers any action or pro­cess that leads to altered results and 
involves setting standards, establishing criteria, developing policies and bud­
gets, conducting per­for­mance evaluations, and scheduling actions to achieve 
objectives; monitoring the outcome on a periodic basis; and, fi­nally, provid­
ing some type of feedback mechanism to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in 
the achievement. This feedback mechanism may suggest corrective mea­sures,

adjustments, or alternatives. In a library or information center context, con­
trols relate to physical resources, information resources, and ­human resources. 
Although the primary aspect is usually a financial one, ­because no other 
ele­ment can be effectively developed without money, some ­things cannot and 
should not be mea­sured in monetary terms. ­These include ­those effective 
performance-­of-­services mea­sures and customer-­satisfaction mea­sures already 
mentioned.
Requirements for Control
Control implies the existence of goals and plans and directing the organ­
ization’s activities ­toward ­those goals. Controls are concerned with keeping 
­things on track, successful pro­gress ­toward meeting specified objectives, 
identifying operational weakness, and developing corrective action. Whereas 
plans determine what should be done, controls assure that it is done, acting 
as the tools and techniques for implementing the planning pro­cess. To avoid 
failure, controls are both desirable and, if applied consistently and fairly, nec­
essary. At the operational level, controlling techniques relate to such pro­
cesses as policies, procedures, task analyses, and job audits. The most 
effective controls prevent deviations from plans by anticipating that such 
deviations ­will occur ­unless immediate action is taken. However, other types 
of control are also necessary for feedback, and they naturally emanate from 
the planning pro­cess.
To be effective, controls must be objective and must reflect the job they 
are to perform. In addition, they should be established and agreed upon 
before they are needed to minimize conflict and to optimize success. At the 
least, the controls should point out exceptions at critical points. In addition, 
any control system that does not pose corrective actions ­after deviations occur 
is ­little more than an in­ter­est­ing exercise. In other words, ­there must be an 
action plan accompanying the evaluation pro­cess. ­After activities have been 
initiated, some sort of control mechanism must be established to monitor pro­
gress and correct actions, as needed, to achieve goals. Given ­those guide­
lines, individuals at all levels are responsible for steering the organ­ization 
on the right course. Controls, wherever they are found and what­ever they 
control, involve three basic steps:
1.	 Establishing standards.
2.	 Mea­sur­ing per­for­mance against standards.
3.	 Correcting deviations.
The ultimate act of controlling in the library and information ser­vices 
setting is, to some degree, external, ­because most information centers are 
accountable to higher public-­ or private-­sector authorities that provide pri­
mary impetus and funding for the operations of the information ser­vices 
organ­ization. The library or information center usually is legally bound by 
constitutional provisions, charters, articles of incorporation, and general or 
special laws applicable to the greater institution as a ­whole. Ultimate respon­
sibility is coordinated by a president, superintendent, mayor or city man­ag­er, 
executive director, board of overseers, or board of directors. ­These external 
authorities are responsible through their overall institutional or societal 
charge and ­because of their funding and fiduciary mandate.
In addition to ­those bodies directly related to the controlling function of 
an information ser­vices organ­ization, numerous outside groups, some with

Practice Your Skills
Based on your experience or on your observation, create a list of outside influences in a 
par­tic­u­lar library or information center. ­After you have completed the list, note which 
ones have a direct controlling influence (such as a school committee) and ­those influ­
ences which are more supportive (such as the PTA).
sanctioning powers, are involved in vari­ous aspects of the operation, including 
standard setting; certification; and accreditation of libraries, librarians, and 
other information specialists. For example, the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools, a regional agency in the United States, is 
a responsible accrediting body that observes and makes recommendations 
on libraries as a part of its overall review of secondary and higher education 
institutions. The American Library Association (ALA) influences library 
support through the establishment of standards for vari­ous types of librar­
ies and library ser­vices and through its Committee on Accreditation, which 
is responsible for setting standards for library and information science edu­
cation and accrediting ­those institutions that meet the set standards. State 
departments of education establish guidelines for the certification of school 
librarians and establish standard formulas for the allocation of funds, and 
specialty-­specific interest groups, such as the Medical Library Association, 
set certification standards and continuing education requirements for their 
members.
Some groups and agencies exist primarily to regulate activities of organ­
izations and institutions and to mea­sure, to one extent or another, their 
actions and outputs. Laws, including local, state, national, and international 
ones, regulate certain activities. For example, planning, constructing, and 
maintaining library buildings may be controlled through municipal ordi­
nances and regulations, building codes, zoning, and fire regulations. Inter­
national copyright agreements or international standards promulgated by the 
International Standards Organ­ization (ISO) or ­those that are on the agenda 
of the World Intellectual Property Organ­ization (WIPO) may direct the ser­
vices or activities of an information center. Comprehensive legislation, for 
instance, state and federal funding legislation in the United States, places 
certain other types of control on the operation of libraries and information 
centers within their jurisdiction. Such regulatory agencies and their author­
ity vary from one part of the world to another, but their influence remains 
basically the same.
Other bodies that exert some external control on libraries include ­unions, 
special interest groups, and po­liti­cal bodies. Through collective bargaining, 
­unions can influence hiring, salaries, working conditions, and fringe benefits; 
po­liti­cal bodies can influence the appointments of individuals, the allocation 
of monies, and even the disbursal of funds within libraries and informa­
tion centers. Pressure is sometimes placed on information ser­vices by out­
side bodies in areas of hiring new staff and in issues relating to collection 
development, censorship and intellectual freedom, and use of library ser­vices 
and facilities. Use of the Internet and access to information through librar­
ies remain heatedly debated topics in school and public libraries, especially 
in the United States. Groups such as Friends of the Library are examples of 
well-­meaning supporters who may expect to have some say in the directions 
libraries ­will take, sometimes in exchange for their charitable contributions.

Techniques for Evaluating Activities
Developing Standards
Standards are established criteria against which subsequent per­for­
mance can be compared and evaluations can be made. Most often they are 
developed, or at least devised, from orga­nizational goals.11 Standards fall into 
two basic classes:
1.	 ­Those relating to material and per­for­mance, including quality, 
quantity, cost, and time.
2.	 ­Those relating to moral aspects, including the organ­ization’s value 
system and ethical criteria that may be used to establish a code of 
ethics.
Standards may be physical, representing quantities of products, units of 
ser­vice, work hours, and similar ­things that can be evidenced and mea­sured 
through time-­and-­motion studies; they may be stated in monetary terms, 
such as costs, revenues, or investments, which are evidenced through rec­ord 
keeping, cost analy­sis, and bud­get pre­sen­ta­tion; or they may be expressed in 
other terms that mea­sure per­for­mance, such as per­for­mance ratings and 
appraisal systems. Of course, some other ­factors are difficult to evaluate and 
mea­sure and require a dif­fer­ent approach to mea­sure­ment. For instance, how 
does one mea­sure commitment on the part of individual employees to orga­
nizational goals? The development of ClimateQUAL by the Association of 
Research Libraries (ARL) shows promise in answering this question.12
Most of the standards are descriptive in nature, prescribe quantitative 
objectives, are arbitrarily formulated, and are directed ­toward evaluating the 
input of the library’s resources. General standards, such as ­those developed 
by the ALA’s vari­ous units or other national or international associations, 
are impor­tant as guides, but they cannot necessarily provide meaningful 
evaluation for the individual library or information center for a number of 
reasons. A good example is ­those produced by the Reference and Informa­
tion Ser­vices Division of ALA.13 Some standards are nebulous and almost 
impossible to mea­sure, some are simply guidelines for proceeding, and ­others 
combine qualitative evaluation with quantitative formulas. If a scientific 
control method is to be used in developing the standard, then it is most likely 
mea­sur­able to some extent. In ­every case, to be effective, standards should 
be acceptable to ­those whose per­for­mance is regulated by them. To be accepted 
and most effective, the pro­cess of applying per­for­mance standards should be 
explained and agreed upon by ­those affected, rather than forced, ­because it 
is ­human nature to resist standards that are forced upon individuals.
Mea­sur­ing Per­for­mance
Per­for­mance mea­sure­ment is embedded in the strategic planning pro­
cess and is an essential feedback mechanism to support decision making in 
libraries and information ser­vices. Such mea­sures are expressed in both 
quantitative and qualitative forms, including mea­sures for economic value 
and financial adequacy, image value, competency, cost of quality, and so forth. 
Feedback, or mea­sur­ing per­for­mance, is an impor­tant ­factor in this control­
ling pro­cess. It is particularly impor­tant as a technique for establishing the 
value of information ser­vices for the benefit of intended customers or fund­
ing authorities.14

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  449
An impor­tant next step is the mea­sure­ment of per­for­mance in relation 
to standards. ­After standards have been agreed upon, some sort of analy­sis 
must be performed to mea­sure the activity against the standard. Techniques 
such as cost-­benefit analy­sis and time-­and-­motion studies commonly are 
employed to mea­sure the standards of per­for­mance for operations. Of course, 
not every­thing can be quantified; judgment and flexibility are also necessary. 
However, ­great care must be taken, ­because subjective judgment may obvi­
ate ­actual per­for­mance.
Some types of per­for­mance are more difficult to mea­sure ­because they 
are less quantifiable, more complex, less regulated, and require greater ini­
tiative. In other words, not all quantitative mea­sures accurately reflect the 
quality of an activity. For example, a rare books cata­loger may perform orig­
inal cata­loging on two items during an eight-­hour period. The quality of that 
activity must be mea­sured delicately, objectively, and with full understanding 
of all nuances involved.
Increasing attention to per­for­mance mea­sure­ment in libraries and infor­
mation ser­vices is particularly evident in the regular international confer­
ences on the topic.15 A number of questions: outline the dif­fer­ent “hows” of 
mea­sure­ment and, in effect, encompass input, output, per­for­mance, and 
outcomes mea­sures. The questions can be used individually or in groups. In 
fact, some of the “hows” are calculated by using data derived from other “hows.” 
Simply stated, ­these questions focus on: “How much?” “How many?” “How 
eco­nom­ical?” “How prompt?” “How valuable?” “How reliable?” “How courte­
ous?” and “How satisfied?” 16
Therefore, mea­sures can be conducted on aspects of extensiveness (i.e., 
amount of ser­vice provided), effectiveness, efficiency, cost (i.e., cost benefit or 
cost-­effectiveness), ser­vice quality, satisfaction, or any number of other factors. 
It is obvious from the large number of reports and studies that mea­sur­ing 
per­for­mance is a continuous and continuing pro­cess, ­whether it is related to 
systems mea­sure­ment, personnel per­for­mance, or user outcomes.
One continuing challenge among researchers and prac­ti­tion­ers is the 
need to develop a set of representative outcome mea­sures that convey cus­
tomer expectations from which librarians can select for local benchmarking. 
However, a broad range of methods has been tested in an attempt to prove 
and substantiate the outcome of information ser­vices.17 It is recognized that 
per­for­mance metrics must be in place, with an infrastructure to collect, fil­
ter, analyze, and disseminate them both within and outside the organ­ization. 
Many groups are working on such activities, particularly the ARL, which, 
several years ago, began an ARL Statistics and Assessment program that 
“serves a leadership role in the development, testing, and application of aca­
demic library per­for­mance mea­sures, statistics, and management tools.”18
What is impor­tant in all mea­sure­ment activities is to keep accurate rec­
ords of what is done so that the pro­cess can be monitored on an ongoing basis 
and data can be compared from one year to the next, for example. If rec­ords 
are not kept, if ­there is lack of control, and if the output cannot be mea­sured 
objectively, then it is difficult to assess how much ­actual per­for­mance devi­
ates from the planned per­for­mance and to determine a mea­sure of success. 
A number of research reports prove helpful in this activity. Perhaps the most 
comprehensive is that developed by the International Organ­ization for Stan­
dardization, in its “Library Per­for­mance Indicators” document, which spec­
ifies a set of indicators grouped in four areas:
1.	 Resources, access, and infrastructure, which pres­ents per­for­
mance indicators that mea­sure the adequacy and availability of 

450  Coordinating
library resources and ser­vices (e.g. title availability, number of doc­
uments digitized per 1,000 in collection)
2.	 Use, which pres­ents per­for­mance indicators that mea­sure the usage 
of library resources and ser­vices (e.g., percentage of target popula­
tion reached, user satisfaction, willingness to return)
3.	 Efficiency, which pres­ents per­for­mance indicators that mea­sure 
resource and ser­vice efficiency (e.g., cost per user, cost per library 
visit)
4.	 Potentials and development, which provides per­for­mance indi­
cators that mea­sure the library’s input into emerging ser­vice and 
resource areas and its ability to gain sufficient funding for devel­
opment (e.g., percentage of expenditures on electronic resources and 
attendances at formal training lessons per staff member)19
Besides feedback, the other type of basic control is prevention, which 
attempts to predict what ­will happen by setting par­ameters. Goal setting in 
the planning pro­cess is a good example of this type of control. Goal setting 
takes information about past per­for­mance and introduces it into decisions 
about adjustments that are needed for ­future actions.
Correcting Deviations
Correcting any deviations from the norm is a vital step in the coordinat­
ing pro­cess. This correction can be achieved by exercising orga­nizational 
prerogative; for instance, in the case of personnel, by reassignment or clari­
fication of duties, by adding or subtracting staff, by better se­lection and train­
ing of staff, or by some other method of staffing. Corrections also can be made 
by adjusting goals, developing new or alternative plans, or altering ways of 
­doing ­things.
A simplified example of detecting deviations in libraries, which combines 
ele­ments of goal setting and feedback, is a monthly bud­get balance sheet that 
might show, for instance, that by the sixth month in the fiscal year, three-­
fourths of the amount bud­geted for employee overtime already has been 
expended, and that ­unless corrective action is taken, the cost for overtime ­will 
overrun the bud­geted amount in that category well before the end of the fiscal 
year. Following a review of the cause of the overtime, a decision must be made 
­either to cut back on overtime for the rest of the year, to allocate additional 
funding in the overtime line of the bud­get, or to realize that overtime is peri­
odic, and that it ­will even out by the end of the fiscal year.
Evaluating Efforts
Evaluation and assessment of ser­vices is a complex pro­cess that attempts 
to identify areas needing improvement with an aim ­toward taking correc­
tive action. It is not a one-­time ­thing or even a sometime ­thing, but rather 
an ongoing review of operations. This aspect of controlling is inextricably 
tied to and, indeed, is a major component in the strategic planning pro­cess 
­because it is impossible to evaluate ­unless it is known what is to be evalu­
ated. How effectively and efficiently a library or information center is meeting 
the goals and objectives identified in the planning pro­cess should be mea­sured 
through such an evaluation. At least three ­factors are to be considered in 
evaluation:

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  451
1.	 The input to the ser­vice or, more specifically, the application of 
resources necessary for information ser­vices to occur, including 
staff, materials, space, and equipment. They can be mea­sured in 
terms of the amount or number of resources involved and their cost. 
­Those are all mea­sures of the input one should consider.
2.	 The output should be considered in terms of the quantities of output 
of the ser­vices and how that can be cost factored, including price, 
timeliness, availability, and accessibility, all contributing to the 
value of the ser­vices. Quality of output is of primary concern. Mea­
sures of use and nonuse of the ser­vices require examining ­factors 
that affect use and nonuse and assessment of the importance and 
satisfaction with specific attributes of ­those ser­vices.
3.	 The outcomes include such ele­ments as saving time, improving pro­
ductivity, improving quality of life and work, and enhancing time­
liness, thus adding value. It is the relationship of ­those mea­sures 
that begins to illustrate the usefulness and importance of libraries 
that has some bearing on justifying the bud­get and resources in the 
effort to improve both personal and professional lives.
Evaluation requires that several questions ­will have been answered in 
the pro­cess:
1.	 Are you now able to make decisions ­because of your evaluation?
2.	 Was the primary audience adequately identified and solicited for the 
results?
3.	 Was the needed information actually received in the pro­cess?
4.	 Where was that information sought and received, and how?
5.	 ­Were resources adequate to get the information, analyze it, and 
report it?
­Those are the same primary questions that ­will have been identified to 
begin the pro­cess. Evaluation requires careful collection and analy­sis of that 
type of data in order to make decisions.
Evaluation can come from a variety of sources. Cost-­benefit analy­sis, 
bud­get analy­sis, per­for­mance evaluation, and collection evaluation are exam­
ples of techniques used in the evaluation pro­cess. Such data provide insight 
into effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and value of a program, operation, or 
ser­vice.20 Accountability in libraries has fostered the development of many 
prescriptive techniques to mea­sure the efficiency of library operations and 
the effectiveness of library ser­vices.
When one thinks of internal controls, mechanical controls come to mind 
first, including circulation control, automated serials, use of online databases, 
and the like. ­These technological controls are only examples of tools that are 
used to mea­sure library operations. Many basic techniques and tools are 
employed in the control pro­cess in the library, particularly as library direc­
tors strive for accountability of their operations. Systems of mea­sure­ment 
and evaluation have evolved over time as technology and external pressures 
have also evolved.21

452  Coordinating
Tools of Coordination
The function of coordinating and controlling so that good decisions can 
be made requires accurate and timely information for the control and moni­
toring of specific kinds of data. This pro­cess has become heavi­ly dependent 
upon technology to enhance efficient information gathering. The pro­cess of 
locating, organ­izing, transferring, and using information and expertise 
within the organ­ization, made more efficient and effective by the use of tech­
nology, fits appropriately in any discussion of tools for decision making. 
Automated systems have the capacity to crunch enormous amounts of infor­
mation relating both to input and output of information for decision making 
in libraries. However, caution always must be exercised in employing some 
of ­these tools ­because, in the hands of amateurs, the quantitative systems 
and tools frequently produce misleading data or lead to unsubstantiated solu­
tions. In addition, mechanistic formulas for dealing with complex realities 
are not always appropriate. ­Here the library or information center man­ag­er 
uses experience and professional judgment in evaluating the results.
Several initiatives can be identified in a library context that lend them­
selves to adequate mea­sure­ment tools, and ­these can prove helpful in meet­
ing goals and objectives as they coordinate and mea­sure per­for­mance. ­These 
are discussed below.
Cost-­Benefit Analy­sis and Return on Investment (ROI)
A cost-­benefit evaluation can be conducted to determine ­whether the 
potential worth or value of a ser­vice is greater than or less than the cost of 
providing it. In other words, is the ser­vice or pro­cess justified? It is an attempt 
to identify and express in monetary terms one mea­sure in determining the 
value. Developing a cost-­benefit analy­sis pro­cess need not be an intimidat­
ing undertaking. Most ­people in their daily work lives, in fact, engage in some 
level of intuitive cost-­benefit analy­sis. In its simplest form, cost-­benefit analy­
sis is ­little more than a formalized approach for identifying and weighing 
the advantages and drawbacks associated with a decision. At its best, it can 
separate good intentions from good ideas. It is, however, only a tool, and, as 
with any tool, it can be used effectively or misused. Cost-­benefit analy­sis is 
flexible and can be adapted to focus on specific functions or aggregated on 
the costs and benefits of the system as a ­whole. Some cost-­benefit activities 
appear to have ­little to do with control (financial reports, status reports, 
proj­ect reports), but they all require some type of monitoring, serving as an 
overview of what is being done, how it is being done, and if it is being done 
efficiently.
Cost-­benefit analy­sis is a set of procedures to mea­sure the merit of 
actions in monetary terms. The pro­cess reduces uncertainty by helping make 
Talk About It
As a user of libraries, what are your priories for ser­vices? Make a list of your favorite 
offerings of a library and then think about how library man­ag­ers would evaluate ­those 
functions or ser­vices. For example if you utilize interlibrary loan ser­vices, how would 
the effectiveness of that ser­vice be determined? Share your thoughts and ideas with a 
group.

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  453
decisions about the best of options available. It is used as a counterpart to 
private-­sector profitability accounting. The difference is that most public 
actions to improve public well-­being, such as ­those instituted in libraries, do 
not have well-­established private markets that generate price information 
on which to judge their value or benefits.
Cost-­benefit analy­sis is a form of mea­sure­ment that considers both direct 
and indirect costs in the allocation of resources. It requires a statement of 
the prob­lem, accompanied by an estimation of costs and benefits associated 
with each alternative identified in order to compare them with one another 
and with the benefits that are sought. ­Because the topic is a detailed one, 
requiring extensive description, it is only mentioned ­here to give the reader 
some idea of its approach.
The technique of cost-­benefit analy­sis, simply reviewed, involves choos­
ing from alternatives when mea­sure­ment in monetary or other specific mea­
sures may not be enough or even pos­si­ble. Whenever pos­si­ble, however, some 
specific mea­sures should be established. Cost-­benefit analy­sis is concerned 
with the cost, cost-­effectiveness, and value. Cost-­benefit analy­sis asks, “Which 
is the best (least expensive or most efficient) way to perform an operation?” 
whereas cost-­effectiveness asks, “­Because this is what the ser­vice costs, is it 
worth it (is it effective)?” This is a mea­sure of quality.
Another way of looking at cost-­benefit analy­sis is termed Return on 
Investment (ROI). It describes how librarians add value with the income they 
are allocated from their parent institution. Directors of public libraries have 
responded to the need to justify the value of their organ­izations with models 
that demonstrate the value to individuals of vari­ous library transactions, 
such as the value of a circulated novel or DVD.22 According to an interna­
tional meta-­analysis of library valuation studies, “The results shown in ­these 
studies indicate that for each dollar of taxpayers’ money invested in public 
libraries, the libraries on average return a value to the citizens of four to five 
times more.”23
For academic libraries this work is ongoing. The Association of College 
and Research Libraries (ACRL), which is a division of the ALA, offers a tool­
kit for academic libraries. This toolkit gives examples of how academic librar­
ians demonstrate their value to their parent institutions.24 The ARL has 
developed its MINES for Libraries25 proj­ect, which provides a way for librar­
ians to understand the use of electronic resources, which may be acquired 
individually, through consortia, or in a vendor package. Although it is not dif­
ficult to put a value on a tangible item like a book or a DVD, it is more difficult 
to value ser­vices and the impact they have on library users’ lives, sometimes 
years ­after the interaction with a library.
Benchmarking
Benchmarking, in its early stages of development, was more commonly 
identified as a Total Quality Management (TQM) tool used to mea­sure and 
compare the work pro­cesses in one’s organ­ization with ­those in other organ­
izations. It has since come into its own in libraries as librarians recog­
nize the benefits of using it in mea­sure­ment of activities. A benchmark is a 
reference point or standard against which pro­gress or achievements can be 
assessed.
Benchmarking is information driven and requires libraries to examine 
their work pro­cesses and functions and to mea­sure their productivity against 
that of ­others. By monitoring ­others, they can be encouraged to enhance 
their own per­for­mance by adopting, or adapting, the best practices of ­others. 

454  Coordinating
Benchmarking is an excellent tool to determine how effectively, efficiently, 
and eco­nom­ically an institution rates against ­others in its peer group.
The goal of benchmarking is to increase per­for­mance by:
1.	 Identifying man­ag­ers of libraries with best practices as partners
2.	 Mea­sur­ing and comparing a selected work pro­cess against ­others 
in the peer group
3.	 Emulating, or adapting, the identified best practices for the local 
library or information center situation.
Since best practices are not stagnant and are always evolving, bench­
marking is a continuous adjustment pro­cess. As a tool, it requires an organ­
ization to focus efforts on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of delivery 
of products and ser­vices. Benefits of benchmarking include the possibility of 
demonstrating the value of a library system and ser­vices in numerical terms; 
in addition, it allows comparison with libraries in the peer group. In many 
cases, a benchmarking study is used to prevent a decrease in ser­vices, includ­
ing financial and systems initiatives. The desired outcomes of benchmark­
ing are efficiency and effectiveness, reduction of costs, and improvement in 
customer ser­vice. Several types of benchmarking are being used in librar­
ies: internal benchmarking used to mea­sure similar activities performed by 
dif­fer­ent units; functional benchmarking comparing an organ­ization’s prac­
tices with ­those identified as leaders within the same ser­vice area; generic 
benchmarking, which compares an organ­ization’s functions or practices that 
cross dif­fer­ent types of organ­izations; and competitive benchmarking, which 
compares a unit’s per­for­mance of a ser­vice or pro­cess with that of a com­
petitor.26 Samples of benchmarking can be found on several Web sites; for 
example, a tool on the IMLS Web site to compare public libraries and a brief 
essay on benchmarking in a public library are available.27
Five stages have been proposed in the benchmarking pro­cess:
1.	 Mea­sur­ing ser­vices and selecting the aspects to be benchmarked
2.	 Identifying benchmarking partners, ­because the goals, aims, and 
objectives must be compatible
3.	 Identifying the best practice, ­because the best practice varies from 
one group to another
4.	 Changing procedures and features of ser­vices based upon ­those best 
practices identified
5.	 Mea­sur­ing the new approaches to ser­vice to determine the impact.28
Program Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT)
Program Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) is a common-­sense 
tool that helps remind ­people of the preparation work needed before an event 
and helps them check if the tasks ­will be completed on schedule. PERT is a 
technique of control in the planning pro­cess that is highly applicable to 
library operations. PERT originally was developed by the U.S. Navy’s Spe­
cial Proj­ects. A method of planning and scheduling work, PERT is sometimes 
called the Critical Path Method (CPM). It involves identifying all of the key 
activities in a par­tic­u­lar proj­ect, devising the sequence of activities and

arranging them in a flow diagram, and assigning duration of time for the 
per­for­mance of each phase of the work to be done. This technique consists of 
enumerating events whose completion can be mea­sured. Most likely times 
are then calculated for the accomplishment of each event, so that one can see 
how long it would take for the progression of events to be completed. This 
model-­building network approach is most effectively used for major proj­ects 
that are one-­time events. An example would be the opening of a new library or 
installing a complicated technology system. Activities can be plotted to allow 
the librarian to determine the most expeditious route (critical path) that can 
be taken to carry out the event. As with other techniques discussed, in PERT 
one must be able to state objectives, then activities must be enumerated and 
estimates must be given for the time required for each of ­these activities. The 
abbreviated, two-­path diagram in figure 18.1 illustrates the concept.
Figure 18.1 suggests that ­there are two paths to be taken, perhaps, from 
the time of the idea of a new library is formulated ­until the building is ready 
for occupancy (the circled numbers represent events and the arrows repre­
sent activities). Times would be assigned for each activity, say, three weeks 
between events 4 and 5, one week between 6 and 7. As illustrated, ­either path 
1–2–3–4–5–9–10–11 or path 1–2–3–6–7–8–10–11 can be taken. If time is 
of the essence, the shorter route might be more desirable. Time is the key 
ele­ment in the critical path schedule. Perhaps a bit more detail, illustrating 
the CPM concept, can demonstrate the critical issue of time (see figure 18.2). 
The time required to complete the series is the greatest sum of the combined 
time requirements. Of the four paths illustrated (1–2–5–8; 1–3–5–8; 1–4–
6–8; and 1–2–7–8), the longest path, with work ­going forth on all four 
paths si­mul­ta­neously, is 1–2–7–8. This path takes five weeks to complete 
and is the critical path that controls the schedule, more or less, for the 
­whole proj­ect.

The PERT/CPM technique allows one to analyze a proj­ect in depth before 
it is initiated. This not only gives the decision maker an idea of the time frame 
involved but also aids in identifying potential weaknesses. PERT is used 
mainly in industry, but staff in some library systems have explored its value 
in the planning pro­cess, particularly when the pro­cess is a complex and 
lengthy one.
Balanced Scorecard
The Balanced Scorecard pro­cess has been ­adopted by some libraries to 
integrate financial and nonfinancial mea­sures as well as internal and exter­
nal per­for­mance mea­sures. With a vision in place, librarians can decide 
what they ­will benchmark and what per­for­mance they ­will mea­sure. Key to 
the balanced scorecard approach is linking the goals to specific decisions 
regarding resource allocation. It is now a ­simple instrument rather than one 
ele­ment of a total planning system.29 The initial idea was to connect the tra­
ditional financial evaluation of an organ­ization with mea­sures concerning 
customer satisfaction, internal pro­cesses, and the ability to innovate.30 It was 
built upon some concepts of previously developed management ideas such as 
TQM, including customer-­defined quality, continuous improvement, employee 
empowerment, and, primarily, measurement-­based management and feed­
back. The balanced scorecard is a survey instrument that focuses upon a cho­
sen number of mea­sure­ments identified in a strategic planning pro­cess in 
order to mea­sure the orga­nizational per­for­mance. It is proposed that ­those 
mea­sures or indicators can be selected to best represent the ­factors that lead 
to improved customer, operational, and financial per­for­mance.
The Balanced Scorecard system consists of ­these pro­cesses:
1.	 Translating the vision into operational goals
2.	 Communicating the vision and linking it to individual per­for­mance
3.	 Developing a ser­vice plan
4.	 Providing feedback and adjusting accordingly.
In other words, identify the most impor­tant data ele­ments, ­those being 
the most crucial in the mission of the library, and tally them as part of an 
overall index or scorecard. It allows librarians to concentrate on a small num­
ber of mea­sures. Most evaluations in this pro­cess fall into four areas: users, 
finance, internal pro­cess, and learning and the ­future. Typically, each of 
­those mea­sures has one or more strategic objectives, and four to eight mea­
sure­ments or metrics are devised for each category. Each metric also has a 
specific target score. This pro­cess provides a quick analy­sis of the organ­
ization’s position in relation to its stated objectives and outcomes. At the end 
of the mea­sure­ment period, ­there is a demonstrated score to indicate which 
mea­sures have met their targets. An excellent example of a library using the 
balanced scorecard is the work of the University of ­Virginia, which provides 
information about their use of the method for a number of years.31 Also, the 
ARL provides an excellent introductory webcast on the topic.32
LibQUAL+
The ARL has been a leader in developing ways to mea­sure library per­
for­mance, with a variety of mea­sure­ment instruments that librarians can 
use to mea­sure libraries.33

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  457
LibQUAL+ is a web-­based survey offered by the Association of 
Research Libraries that helps libraries assess and improve 
library ser­vices, change orga­nizational culture, and market the 
library. The survey instrument mea­sures library users’ mini­
mum, perceived, and desired levels of ser­vice quality across 
three dimensions: Affect of Ser­vice, Information Control, and 
Library as Place.34
It has emerged as both a pro­cess and a tool that enables institutions to 
address ser­vice quality gaps between user expectations and perceived ser­
vice. It is an internationally recognized Web-­delivered survey that now 
includes more than 3,004 LibQUAL+ surveys implemented across 1,361 insti­
tutions in 34 countries, with over 2.8 million respondents. The vast majority 
of participating institutions have been academic libraries, but public, hospi­
tal, and state libraries have also participated in the use of large-­scale, Web-­
based survey applications in a digital library environment.35
LibQual+ offers librarians clear information about what ser­vices library 
users value and use. The statistics for one library may be compared to data 
from other libraries of similar size to help the librarians understand how they 
compare to ­these other libraries and to identify areas that need improvement. 
­Because libraries usually offer the survey ­every two years, the results can be 
compared to previous years’ surveys to mea­sure improvement. ­Because the 
instrument and the results are held centrally, staff members of local librar­
ies do not need to develop and refine the survey: all of this is done by the ARL. 
All the library needs to do is provide to users the URL to the survey.36 Having 
access to this survey, and the other research instruments at ARL, local librar­
ians can develop familiarity with surveys and learn about interpreting and 
acting upon data.
The LibQUAL+ questions mea­sure customer perceptions of library ser­
vice across three dimensions:
1.	 Information control (eight items) relates to ­whether users are 
able to find the required information in the library in the format of 
their choosing, in an in­de­pen­dent and autonomous way.
2.	 Affect of ser­vice (nine items) is the ­human dimension of ser­vice 
quality. ­These questions relate to user interactions with, and the 
general helpfulness and competency of, library staff.
3.	 Library as place (five items) deals with the physical environ­
ment of the library as a place for individual study, group work, and 
inspiration.37
The survey instrument is designed to be useful to library administra­
tion on several levels: identifying deficits in ser­vice per­for­mance at an indi­
vidual library, allowing comparisons with cohort libraries from multiple 
perspectives, identifying best practices, and responding to pressures for 
accountability. Basically, it allows the previously mentioned benchmarking 
to be performed against other comparable institutions as well as obtaining 
feedback from the institution’s own users.
Another feature of the survey is that ­there is a space for user comments 
at the end of the survey. This qualitative information helps analysts better 
understand the quantitative survey results.38
Other tools for libraries developed at ARL (termed “New Mea­sures Ini­
tiative”) are described in the StatsQUAL gateway. They include DigiQUAL for 
assessment of ser­vices provided by digital libraries; MINES for Libraries, 

458  Coordinating
the collection of data on the purpose of use of electronic resources and the 
demographics of users; ClimateQUAL for assessing staff perceptions concern­
ing their library’s commitment to the princi­ples of diversity, orga­nizational 
policies and procedures, and staff attitudes; and LibValue, which shows 
return on investment.39
Focus Groups
Focus groups are an excellent way to follow up a survey like LibQUAL+. 
Sometimes ­there are questions that need further explanation or more detail. 
Focus groups are best run by someone outside the library who is familiar 
with the operation, so that the participants do not offer comments that they 
think the library management ­will want to hear. To successfully manage a 
focus group requires careful planning of all the details, for example, the 
development of questions, the recruitment of subjects, organ­izing the space, 
and rewards for participants. Sometimes, at focus group sessions, library 
staff members observe unobtrusively, and other times the moderator has an 
assistant to take notes or rec­ord the session, so that the results are saved. A 
number of good articles and books give specific information about how to con­
duct focus groups and report on the results of that research.40
Usability Studies
Web sites are crucial to the success of a library or information center. 
Most users access information remotely utilizing a wide range of devices. To 
remain relevant to ­these users, staff members in libraries and information 
centers conduct usability studies to actually watch individuals perform tasks 
on the Web site. It does not take too many participants to gain valuable infor­
mation. Nielsen41 recommends five as an optimal number for each round of 
a usability study. Unlike focus groups that ask for opinions, usability stud­
ies actually engage participants in solving prob­lems. Participants show the 
person administering the study how they go about navigating a Web site, for 
example, or how they search for an item by subject, or the steps they take to 
FIGURE 8.3. Step-­by-­Step Usability Guide

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  459
request an interlibrary loan. Participants’ actions are recorded and discussed 
with Web site developers; the results of usability studies are changes to make 
the Web site easier for ­people to use. Figure 18.3 is a chart, developed by the 
U.S. government, that gives the steps necessary to conduct a usability study.42
Other Examples of Library Assessment
Information Literacy: ­There is a wealth of information about how to 
judge the value an academic library brings to the college or university. Pro­
fessional organ­izations for both school and academic libraries43 offer frame­
work for assessing instruction.
Retention and Success of First Year Students: Academic libraries 
have tried to show that exposure to the library during a student’s first year 
­will result in a higher GPA and retention at the school. ­There are many arti­
cles about how this is accomplished.44
Evaluating Public Libraries: ­There are a number of dif­fer­ent ways 
to evaluate public libraries. Library Journal has a star libraries program,45 
and the Public Library Association has developed a program with Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation support called Proj­ect Outcome.46
School Libraries: School librarians have often used action research to 
inform and evaluate their success. Action research is used by professionals 
in school libraries to better understand prob­lems and to seek solutions. A dis­
cussion and examples of action research in school libraries is offered by Jen­
nifer Robbins who studied examples of action research and surveyed school 
librarians.47
Special Libraries: Stuart Hales offers, “Librarians and information 
professionals who track their organ­ization’s goals and align their ser­vices 
accordingly ­will be in a better position to communicate their value.”48 He 
further suggests ideas suitable for librarians from all types of libraries :
•	 Regularly explore your organ­ization’s website
•	 Read your com­pany’s marketing and financial communications
•	 Participate in meetings, especially ­those with higher-­ups
•	 Engage in informal discussions with coworkers.49
Monitoring Programs for Results 
and Accountability
Monitoring is a continuous management function aimed primarily at 
providing man­ag­ers with regular feedback and early indications of pro­gress 
or lack thereof in the achievement of intended results within the organ­ization. 
Monitoring tracks the ­actual per­for­mance against what was planned or 
expected according to predetermined standards. What to monitor comes from 
the section of the strategic plan discussed previously where mea­sure­ments 
­were defined.
Monitoring
The pro­cess of monitoring and feedback is the best way of expressing 
accountability in library and information ser­vices in both qualitative and 
quantitative terms. It provides checks and balances for the ser­vice goal. 

460  Coordinating
Based on evaluation as part of the reporting mechanism, decision makers 
decide ­whether changes are desirable, ­either in the system or in the strate­
gic goals of the organ­ization. Such reporting mechanisms are not only impor­
tant to evaluate results and to correct deviations but also as marketing 
strategies intended for funding authorities, customers, and all staff within 
the organ­ization.
Monitoring means quality assurance of the programs that have been 
instituted. Communication tools, which have been used in libraries and infor­
mation centers that mea­sure per­for­mance, include personal observation, 
focus groups, meetings, e-­mail, statistical data, surveys, interviews, oral 
reports, and written reports. Other publications help facilitate the pro­cess 
of reporting results. When one searches the Internet, it is clear that the Web 
is also being used to report to the world, not just to constituents, on activi­
ties and on outcomes. This reporting activity is conducted in a number of 
ways, internally and externally. Sometimes it is on a monthly basis to review 
results; sometimes it is carried out internally on a daily basis by keeping a 
scorecard of proj­ects and pro­gress ­toward their goal accomplishment. Other 
times, for vari­ous audiences, reviews and reports are presented on a less fre­
quent basis. Occasionally, such reports are required at specific intervals, for 
accrediting or other control purposes, by outside agencies or organ­izations.
Most impor­tant, data should be reported and per­for­mance explained 
internally, and per­for­mance information should be consolidated and 
reporting mechanisms consistent across the organ­ization. Results should be 
shared not only internally but also externally with customers and stakehold­
ers through annual reports. Basically, data from the several techniques 
available fall into one of three primary categories:
1.	 Statistics (“How do we count inputs, staff, materials, and 
ser­vices?”)
2.	 Per­for­mance indicators (“How well are we ­doing?”)
3.	 Economic value (“How much are we worth, in monetary terms?”)
In the reporting pro­cess, it is impor­tant to recognize that ­there are 
strong relationships between resource allocation, strategic planning, and per­
for­mance mea­sure­ment; each builds upon the other and creates a circle of 
ser­vice. The bud­get is allocated according to primary goals and objectives 
that have been identified in the strategic plan, which should have identified 
the mea­sures to be used in terms of output. ­Because the library is not a static 
organ­ization, evaluation must be made from that perspective. As the goals 
and needs of society change, so the man­ag­ers of library or information cen­
ters must respond. Therefore, past mea­sures may no longer be impor­tant, 
and new ones may need to be found. A good example is in the area of “access” 
or “owner­ship” of materials as a criterion of quality. In the past, libraries 
­were mea­sured and valued by the number of volumes in the collection. Now 
with e-­journals, e-­books, databases, and packages supplied by vendors, some 
shared with other libraries in a consortium, and improved document deliv­
ery methods, libraries provide access to information and are valued for that 
access more than simply for the owner­ship of materials.
Accountability
All types of library and information centers must demonstrate a value 
of ser­vice or value-­added aspect to the larger organ­ization of which they are 

Evaluating Orga­nizational Per­for­mance  461
a part and to their constituencies. Through accountability, the library and 
information center is, more than ever before, expected to evaluate the insti­
tution’s per­for­mance to ensure that the ­human and material resources are 
effectively and efficiently employed ­toward achieving its goals and ­those of 
the larger institution. In the past, some libraries relied on the public-­good 
view of library ser­vices. This is no longer adequate in the current competi­
tive environment: You cannot just say that libraries are a good ­thing and 
leave it at that. ­There are too many rival organ­izations within a university, 
school, community or business and too many competing sources for informa­
tion for library users.
Accountability mea­sures are intended to provide quality assurance and 
timeliness of program per­for­mance. This requires managing for results 
through clearly stated expectations and the reporting of results. All three 
ele­ments also are required to establish clear and effective mea­sures of 
accountability. It is designed to promote efficiency in monitoring and evalu­
ating per­for­mance to demonstrate its added value and effectiveness in 
improving ser­vice. It requires determination of success and understanding 
the responsibilities for achieving orga­nizational goals. Accountability is typ­
ically a key success ­factor. Establishing ­viable per­for­mance mea­sures is 
critical for staff in organ­izations; making ­those mea­sures work is even more 
impor­tant. Per­for­mance mea­sure­ment systems are linked to strategic and 
operational planning. Employees and man­ag­ers should understand and work 
­toward the desired outcomes that are at the core of their organ­ization’s vision. 
One motto might be “Focus on the goal of ‘customer satisfaction,’ mea­sure 
the end results, and ­don’t focus on the mea­sure­ments per se.”50
Conclusion
Coordinating functions are created to facilitate the achievement of goals 
and objectives in libraries and information centers. ­Those standard-­setting 
activities, and evaluation and mea­sure­ment techniques provide vital infor­
mation to management and staff members, as activities are carried out to 
achieve the mission. Some tools and techniques for developing ser­vices are 
sophisticated yet have ­great application for information ser­vices. They are 
impor­tant parts of the pro­cess of accountability and reporting on success.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Your public library director thinks that the community would be interested in 
taking a variety of short courses. How would you help deci­ded which courses to 
offer? Would you develop an online survey, a sign-up sheet, or randomly select 
library users to answer a few in person questions? Please write a recommenda­
tion and a justification for your choice.
2.	You heard a rumor that the college where you work as a reference librarian may 
be cutting the bud­get in the coming year. How can you help your director show 
the value of the library and the reference department? Chose one aspect of the 
work of a reference department and one way to mea­sure that work and its 
impact on students.

Discussion Questions
1.	 Divide into groups. You are assistants in a school library and the librarian has 
asked you to help him evaluate how faculty members use the library. Brain­
storm in your group to decide what you want to know about faculty use and how 
you would go about finding this information. What information are you likely 
to find?
2.	Working with ­others, discuss why assessment is a crucial step in strategic 
planning. Give examples.
3.	 Students at your medium sized college want the library to stay open ­later than 
the 10:00 p.m. closing during the week. How would you evaluate ­whether enough 
students would stay ­later than 10:00 p.m. to justify the added expense? How 
could you use the students requesting this change to help you make this deci­
sion? If you go ahead with the plan, how would you develop an assessment?
4.	Your library must be cost conscious and you are wondering if a par­tic­u­lar data­
base is cost effective. How would you go about deciding to keep or cancel the 
database? What issues should you consider? Who should you consult? What would 
be a good way to mea­sure the use and value of a database?
3.	 How would you mea­sure the effectiveness of a summer reading program? What 
questions do you need to ask to develop a way to evaluate it?
4.	Select a ser­vice activity that you feel should be a priority objective in a special 
library. Identify one tool or technique that can be used to mea­sure the success 
in meeting that priority goal. ­Either qualitative or quantitative mea­sures 
may be used. Defend the se­lection as the best mea­sure­ment for that ser­vice.

Library Finance 
and Bud­gets
“Oh, ­don’t bother ME,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!”
—­Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Understand the difference between ongoing and one-­time income
•	 Be able to define capital and operating bud­gets
•	 Know the bud­get pro­cess
•	 Be familiar with dif­fer­ent bud­geting systems used in libraries
•	 Understand how to read a bud­get update
Bud­gets tell the story of a library; they show the priorities of the organ­ization. 
No one should skip over the numbers section of a report. Man­ag­ers in ­every 
type of library and information center oversee bud­gets that range from a few 
thousand dollars to many millions. Man­ag­ers learn to use fiscal data to 
reflect priorities and argue for the library. They are accountable for manag­
ing their annual bud­get, and their success in that management is critical. 
This chapter discusses the importance of bud­getary control and library advo­
cacy, introduces several applicable bud­getary systems, and gives examples 
of bud­gets in libraries and information centers.

468  Coordinating
Management on the Job: The Role of Advocacy in 
the Bud­get Pro­cess
The story of two major U.S. public libraries, the Boston Public Library (BPL) and the 
Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL), and how they fared during the economic downturn, 
demonstrates the importance of library advocacy in a library’s bud­get pro­cess. Faced 
with a decreasing bud­get, the BPL president and library board of trustees of Boston 
announced proposed bud­get cuts well in advance of the fiscal year when they ­were to 
take effect. ­These proposed cuts included closing branches, and the city’s residents ­were 
outraged. Po­liti­cal pressure was so ­great that the Commonwealth of Mas­sa­chu­setts 
legislature threatened to withhold state funding if any branches ­were closed. As a result 
no branches ­were cut and funding was restored.
In Diane L. Velasquez’s article “How the Los Angeles Public Library Responded to 
Bud­get Cuts,”1 she discusses the approach that was taken in Los Angeles. ­Here is the 
background. The amount of support for each department in Los ­Angles is dictated by 
the city’s charter. The library’s bud­get was funded by a percentage of the city’s tax rev­
enue: 1.75 ­percent beginning in 2009. The LAPL faced bud­get prob­lems for two main 
reasons during the recession.
1.	The revenue from property tax declined ­because property values dropped
2.	As a way to capture more funds for the general fund, the mayor deci­ded to begin 
charging the library and other departments for overhead without giving the 
library any additional funding to pay for it. In the past overhead items such as 
pensions, utilities, landscaping, security, fuel, motor pool, and maintenance ­were 
paid by the city’s general fund.
­Because of ­these changes, the funding for the library to actually spend on library 
ser­vices dropped significantly. The leadership of the LAPL deci­ded to cut hours and 
staff rather than launch a public advocacy campaign, such as was done in other cities 
during this crisis. The library full-­time staff numbers went from 1,156 to 793. This left 
the library with 793 employees to run 72 branches and one central library. The library 
determined that ­there was no way to run all libraries six days a week and so they deci­ded 
to close on Mondays and only have eve­ning coverage on two nights. They ­didn’t announce 
­these changes early to build support so they would not need to make so many cuts, but 
just went ahead and reduced the size of the library staff and cut hours. When the change 
of hours began, students who needed the library to help with homework, for Internet 
access, and to spend time ­after school on Mondays, had no place to go. Eventually, ­because 
of the community’s outcry about the limited hours, the city council did take up a change 
in the city charter that would bring additional revenue to the LAPL over a period of four 
years, resulting in a 1.25 ­percent increase of total property taxes collected and healthy 
bud­get increases estimated for ­future years. Interestingly a number of city councilors 
voted for this charter change that brought additional funding to the library, even though 
they and the mayor had worked to cut the library’s bud­get originally. This prob­lem might 
have been avoided if the leadership of the LAPL had gathered support when they first 
learned that the mayor was planning big cuts. The reason for this is that politics are a 
part of life in a public library and good advocacy from the beginning would have perhaps 
prevented ­these staff cuts and pain to the library.

Library Finance and Bud­gets  469
Budgets—­Planning and Evaluation Tools
One of the most impor­tant of all planning activities is to determine how 
resources ­will be allocated among the vari­ous alternatives competing within 
the organ­ization. Therefore, the bud­get can be considered a plan set in finan­
cial terms. Bud­gets, when viewed as evaluation tools, are commitments or 
contracts with funding authorities for ser­vices and programs to be rendered, 
and they can facilitate the pro­cess of evaluating how successfully the goals 
and objectives are being addressed. In that sense, a bud­get is also a po­liti­cal 
document, expressing policy decisions about priorities of programs. Bud­
geting is that part of the total planning equation that assures that resources 
are obtained and then used effectively and efficiently in accomplishing 
objectives.
The bud­get pulls together the vari­ous pieces of the operational plan and 
relates them to the ser­vices plan in monetary terms. This pro­cess demon­
strates goals and priorities for the organ­ization and for ser­vices offered. The 
bud­get, then, is the library’s operating plan for a designated fiscal period 
allowing resources to be allocated and ensuring that programs are success­
fully delivered.
Bud­gets, in detail, lay out a direction for allocating and maximizing the 
use of resources. In addition, the bud­get gives staff specific directions for 
achieving identified goals. The bud­get also is used by management to gauge 
operational per­for­mance. An effective bud­get establishes criteria that alert 
management if change is needed or if a course of action should be refined or 
altered. In that sense it also serves as a necessary monitoring device, ­because 
accountability is implied in the bud­geting pro­cess.
“Which comes first, planning or bud­geting?” is a question often asked. 
The answer is “neither,” ­because they are inextricably tied and neither can 
proceed without the other. Cost predictions must be based upon a realistic 
view of ser­vice objectives and what financial resources are available to accom­
plish ­those ser­vice objectives.
­Because some objectives already ­will be in place and ­others newly planned, 
they must be based upon what monies are likely to be available. Planning 
and bud­geting also are linked in the preparation and pre­sen­ta­tion to funding 
authorities, ­because the adoption of a planning and bud­geting framework 
has to reflect the parent organ­ization’s commitment to effective planning and 
resource allocation and accountability. This pro­cess must be viewed as a 
­whole, with the equally impor­tant parts being linked through the goals and 
Talk About It
Do you like numbers, or are you one of ­those ­people who skips-­over the ­tables and charts 
in an article? If you are in the latter category, and you aspire to a position in library 
management, you need to learn more about finance, bud­geting, and library accounting. 
Why is this impor­tant? Man­ag­ers advocate for their areas and make a case for funding. 
To be successful and for the unit to have sufficient support, the man­ag­er needs to 
understand every­thing about how income is acquired and funds are spent.

objectives of the organ­ization. In essence, the bud­get is the monetary expres­
sion of the strategic plan.
Therefore, in the preliminary stages of developing a strategic plan for the 
library, each potential goal, when it is financially analyzed, can be assigned 
a monetary figure based upon projected resources necessary to accomplish 
it. A preliminary bud­get for each of ­those goals should be developed so that 
benefits can be compared with costs before fi­nally choosing among the vari­
ous potential goals.
Libraries and information centers are usually bud­geted on a yearly cycle, 
termed the fiscal year, although it is sometimes necessary to construct oper­
ational plans that proj­ect two or three fiscal years into the ­future. The bud­get 
for any current cycle, or even for ­future ones, inevitably ­will be affected by 
past commitments, established standards of ser­vice, existing orga­nizational 
structures, and current methods of operations, as well as ­future changes. If 
changes are proposed, consideration must be given to preparing the organ­
ization for change and altering the bud­getary justification and allocation. 
The four phases of a bud­geting cycle include:
1.	 Preparing the bud­get. Library administrators develop a bud­get 
request that estimates how much the library ­will need to cover vari­
ous expenses such as personnel, materials, equipment, and travel. 
The bud­get may also include estimates for income, such as fines and 
fees. The total bud­get amount is usually set by the parent organ­
ization. This bud­geting work is developed well before the year when 
the money ­will be used.
2.	 Presenting to funding authorities, with full justification. ­Here the 
library administrator ­will account for the anticipated needs for the 
next year and how ­these needs would be met. The administrator may 
try to obtain additional funding, if ­there are extraordinary expenses, 
such as a need for another position, a special proj­ect, an estimate 
of inflation that would affect the cost of periodicals or books, or a 
change in the minimum wage laws that would affect pages and stu­
dent workers. Also if for some reason the administrator expects that 
income sources ­will be lower than the past year, this would be part 
of the pre­sen­ta­tion, along with a justification for increased revenue 
or an explanation for how this revenue decrease ­will be absorbed by 
the library.
3.	 Implementing the bud­get. Once the bud­get has been approved and 
the fiscal year for the bud­get begins, the funding levels are commu­
nicated to ­every librarian who has fiscal responsibility. Adjustments 
are made if the full request is not authorized.
4.	 Monitoring bud­geted income and expenses. Often the man­ag­er must 
watch the income categories, since all income may not be available 
at the first of the fiscal year. For example if a library bud­get relied on 
income such as receipts from fines or other sales that accumulate 
over the course of the year, the library would not have any of that 
money at the beginning of the year and they would have to watch 
as that income accumulates, to make sure it matches the amount 
bud­geted. If it does not, then the man­ag­er ­will need to make adjust­
ments. Sometimes bud­gets are cut during the year by the parent 
organ­ization, when officials discover that the revenue they expected 
is not coming in. This is difficult, ­because as the year progresses 

Library Finance and Bud­gets  471
and funds are spent, ­there ­will be fewer opportunities to cut the 
bud­get without drastic mea­sures such as cancelling all book pur­
chases or laying off employees. In any case, the administrator needs 
to closely monitor the income and expenses of the library to ensure 
that the library’s employees ­will not over spend their allotment. 
The goal is to finish the year at zero. The reason for this is that if a 
library bud­get is overspent by a lot, the library director is account­
able, and overspending ­will erode the credibility of the director; it 
may even jeopardize the director’s job. If the library’s bud­get is 
underspent by a lot, the underspending demonstrates that the library 
­didn’t need all the funding. As a result, next year’s request ­will be 
more difficult to justify.
Note: a fiscal year usually runs from July 1 to June 30, but some organ­
izations operate on a calendar year, January 1 to December 31, and the fed­
eral government’s fiscal year begins on October 1.
Library Income
When understanding library income, it is helpful to think of funding as 
­either recurring each year to pay for ongoing operating expenses or one-­time 
to cover special proj­ects.
Sources for Recurring Funds
•	 Operating funds pay for the recurring expenses of a library such as 
books, subscriptions, personnel, and equipment. ­These funds mostly 
come from the parent institution but may be supplemented by cur­
rent use gifts or receipts from sales.
•	 Endowment funds are available in ­those libraries that have wealthy 
donors. ­These funds are invested and held in perpetuity with inter­
est payouts available to spend each year. Since only the interest may 
be used, the money lasts in­def­initely. Endowment payouts range 
from 2 ­percent to 5.5 ­percent depending on the institution and how 
the funds are invested. So if a library had a $1 million endowment, the 
­actual funding received each year would be in the range of $20,000 
to $55,000. If the investments earn more than the 2 ­percent to 5.5 
­percent in a given year, the remainder of the earnings stays in the 
endowment and adds to the principal. This is a way for the endow­
ment to grow and keep up with inflation.
Sources for One-­Time Funding
•	 Capital funding is for large one-­time expenses such as a library 
renovation, new building, or major technology upgrade.
Sources of capital funding are:
•	 State, county or city funding (for state, county and municipal 
institutions)
•	 Bonds are the usual way that cities and private organ­izations 
secure funding for large one-­time expenses. They offer bonds as

Practice Your Skills
1.	 A library user wants to thank the library for an excellent ­children’s program. She 
donates $2,000 for this purpose. Would this gift be a current use or ongoing?
2.	The library has a $25,000 endowment. Roughly how much ­will be available for 
the next three years?
3.	Sam has offered to apply for a grant to convert ­music from old tape technology 
to an electronic format. Would this grant income be current use or ongoing?
a way to borrow money, using the buildings and other physical com­
ponents of the campus or city as collateral. Then they pay the money 
back over a long time period at a relatively low rate of interest.
•	 Current Use Gifts are donated funds designated for a specific pur­
pose. They are usually spent for that purpose within a year or so of 
the donation.
•	 Grants are funds for specific purposes that are available from pub­
lic and private sources. A library employee applies for a grant to solve 
a specific prob­lem and the funds are designated to be spent during a 
specific time period. More information is available about gift funds, 
endowments, and grants in Chapter 20.
The Funding Pro­cess
Man­ag­ers of libraries and information centers are accountable for their 
actions and charged with wisely expending allocated monies. External forces, 
po­liti­cal, economic, social, and technological, are constant ­factors that affect 
the bud­get and the pro­cess of bud­geting. In other sections of this volume, 
­factors—­values, orga­nizational culture, commitment, and vision—­are dis­
cussed; and they also affect the bud­getary pro­cess. Primarily they influence 
bud­get priorities.
To illustrate both the income and expenditure side of funding, look at 
figure 19.1, which shows both the income and the expenses sides of the over­
all bud­get for the University of Michigan. 2 From this illustration, one can see 
the sources of funds (where the money comes from to operate the university) 
and the uses of funds (where the money is allocated to be spent). As you see 
in the top pie chart, the largest source of revenue for the university is student 
fees, which includes tuition. In the bottom pie chart ­there is a small category, 
“libraries and museums.” So this would be the source of much of the funding 
for the libraries at that university.
Funds may come directly to the library or information center or more 
usually to the parent organ­ization (university or college, city or town govern­
ment, school district, com­pany, foundation, or another type of business), with 
a specific designation for library use. Within the income categories for librar­
ies, funds come from a variety of sources: from the larger organ­ization’s 
operating bud­get; from local taxes; from local, state, regional, provincial, 
federal, and/or national government support; from private foundation or 
other philanthropic organ­ization grants; from Friends of Libraries groups, 
gifts, fund drives, or endowments; from fees or fines; and so on. ­Table 19.1

illustrates the sources of income for a minimal bud­get for a small public 
library.3
The income section of the bud­get illustrated in ­table 19.1 and the expense 
section in ­table 19.2 both display a line item bud­get, which is the most com­
mon form of bud­geting in libraries. The term line item comes from the fact 
that bud­get lines are the rows in a spreadsheet that read across, and they 
define the vari­ous categories of income and expenses that make up the bud­
get. Each of ­these lines is a separate category and can be quite detailed in 
some libraries.
Looking at ­table 19.1, the majority of the income for this hy­po­thet­i­cal 
public library is from municipal and county funding. Smaller amounts are 
from state, federal, and other sources. One line, “funds carried forward” needs 
a ­little explanation. It is likely that this library had a ­little extra money at the 
end of the year that it wanted to spend in the next year. For example the library 
may have ordered some books that did not arrive before the end of the fiscal 
year. In that case, the library man­ag­er would identify the funds that ­were 
needed to cover the cost of ­those books and carry the income forward into the 
next fiscal year, so that when they did arrive, the money would be available to 
pay the bill. The remaining categories of income are self-­explanatory.
It should be noted that the bud­get for a par­tic­u­lar fiscal year is always 
completed well before the beginning of the fiscal year. ­After the beginning 
of the fiscal year, the man­ag­er ­will review bud­get updates, which give the 
man­ag­er a good idea of how the income and expenses are flowing and if ­there 
are any lines that seem to be higher or lower than expected. Both ­table 19.1 
and ­table 19.2 illustrate a mid-­year bud­get update. Very likely this bud­get 
was produced early in January showing the income and expenses for the first 
six months of the operating bud­get. Compare the column labeled 2016 Bud­
get to 2016 Year End Estimate in ­table 19.1. In this case, all the numbers 
are exactly the same. In real­ity, ­these columns may not be equal. For example 
in a large academic library with extensive databases or serials, the ven­
dors are likely to collect the full year’s expenses early in the fiscal year. The 
other columns for the bud­get include: the ­actual income and expenses for 
2015; the amount bud­geted for 2016 (discussed above); the six-­month bud­get

update; the year end estimate for 2016 (discussed above); and, fi­nally, the 
bud­get request for 2017.
Note the supplies line on the expense bud­get in ­table 19.2. For the past 
year 2015, the ­actual amount spent on supplies was $1,425. The library’s 
bud­get for 2016 shows a slight increase to $1,500. So far, in six months, the 
library has used $1,000, which is more than half of the amount bud­geted. 
They expect to only spend another $500 by the end of the year and have asked 
for $1,575, an additional $25 for the bud­get request of fiscal year 2017. ­There 
may be good reasons why the supplies line at the six month point is larger 
than 50 ­percent. For example, the library staff may have purchased most of 
the needed supplies early in the year and ­will use them throughout the year, 
or the supplies may be linked to a fall program that ­will not recur again that 
year.
As seen in the sample expense bud­get in ­table 19.2., the largest parts of 
the expense bud­get in most library and information centers is for staff. It is 
worth noting that this library has a line for employee benefits. Some institu­
tions cover employee benefits centrally and ­others require the library to carry 
and account for ­those expenses. Even hourly employees without benefits ­will 
still need to have Social Security and other federally mandated taxes paid 
by the employer. Other areas where money is expended include collection, 
equipment, utilities, supplies, printing, travel, meals, and other operating 
costs.
Institutions usually have restrictions on spending the bud­get. For 
example, in some cases, man­ag­ers may not spend funds specified for collections

to cover wages or any other category. Also, if gift funds or grants are available, 
the purpose of the gift or grant should be carefully understood and spend­
ing monitored. If the gift fund is for purchases for library materials in the 
humanities, the money ­can’t be used to purchase computer equipment or scien­
tific materials. ­After covering salaries, collection expenses, and other neces­
sary operations, ­there may be very ­little discretionary monies available in 
the bud­get. Many man­ag­ers focus on the expenses side of the bud­get; and, 
in most institutions, a library is allocated a set amount in the beginning of the 
year. The work of the man­ag­er is to monitor the expenses, making sure that 
they stay within the bud­get.
Another financial concept to understand is that ­there can be a lag time 
between when something, like a book, is ordered, and when it and the bill 
arrives, and the payment is reflected on the bud­get update. Funds for that 
item are termed “encumbered,” which means they are in effect “spent,” 
although the payment has not yet been made. Collection development or acqui­
sitions librarians often keep a second set of “books” to keep track of encum­
brances, “materials on order” so that they can be sure not to overspend the 
materials bud­get lines. The central administration of a parent organ­ization 
may keep track of the ­actual bills paid and income as it comes in and provide 
reports, but the library may need to keep track of encumbered expenses so 
that revenue may be brought forward into the next year to pay ­those bills.
In some library and information centers, man­ag­ers must also keep a 
keen eye on the income, not just the expenditures. For example, some librari­
ans are allowed to keep fines and fees that are paid for copying ser­vices, room 
rental, digital images, sale of discarded books, and so forth. An estimate for 
­these fees is put into the bud­get as income before the fiscal year begins. How­
ever, each year ­these amounts may fluctuate. So if part of the bud­get relies on 
the income from ­these miscellaneous revenue sources, ­these income catego­
ries need to be monitored and the bud­get adjusted during the year to reflect 
the ­actual income.
In some cases the parent institution ­will take back funds midyear when 
the anticipated revenue does not appear. When this is done, it is very chal­
lenging for librarians, since most of the expenses, such as serials and sala­
ried employees, have already been committed.
The Bud­geting Pro­cess
The bud­get is a power­ful management tool and essential for explaining 
library goals and priorities. As a total pro­cess, the bud­geting concept involves 
several discrete steps:
1.	 Bud­get guidelines issued by upper management of parent institution
2.	 Development and pre­sen­ta­tion of the justification for the next year’s 
bud­get working within the bud­get guidelines
3.	 Response from upper management on the request
4.	 Execution and monitoring of the bud­get
5.	 Audit conducted ­after the fiscal year to determine, in retrospect, 
how the allocated funds ­were actually spent. Most libraries that 
are part of a larger institution ­will not have a separate audit, but 
library bud­get information ­will be part of the parent institution’s 
audit.

Library Finance and Bud­gets  477
Although planning the bud­get is seasonal, with most activity taking 
place in the spring for an organ­ization with a fiscal year beginning in July, 
the monitoring of accounts continues throughout the year. Additional funding 
such as funded grant proposals or gift funds generally has a separate bud­get. 
­These are specific to and expended by the activities proposed for the grant or 
gift and are monitored as separate accounts.
Bud­get Justification, a Marketing Opportunity
­Whether it is a yearlong bud­get for a major university library or a small 
listing of proposed expenses for a grant, bud­get justification is critical. Jus­
tification means convincing funding authorities that the work of the library 
or information center needs to be supported. It is an opportunity for librarians 
to pres­ent their case, to enlighten authorities about not only what is being 
requested but, more impor­tant, why it is being requested, substantiated by 
backup documentation, such as the library’s strategic plan, an index of infla­
tion for library materials, technological impact, and trends that affect librar­
ies. Bud­gets are presented not only in writing but sometimes orally as well, in 
a variety of settings. When presented orally, this excellent marketing oppor­
tunity is a delicate session in which a balance must be achieved between 
just the right amount of information and information overload. Some author­
ities may not understand; ­others may not ­really care. If the presenter is 
consistent, and has a history of managing the bud­get well, the case is easier 
to make. Also, librarians who show passion, knowledge, and re­spect for the 
libraries they represent ­will have the most success. Man­ag­ers in the library 
as in any department of a larger institution should understand the bud­get 
guidelines prepared by the institution and follow them carefully. Further­
more, it is a good idea to know who the audience ­will be for the bud­get pre­
sen­ta­tion and focus on how the library’s activities help support other parts 
of the parent organ­ization. And, fi­nally, anticipate any questions and have 
the answers.
One ­great danger in bud­geting is the prob­lem of disguised needs. Librar­
ians may be accused of asking for more than they actually need basing cur­
rent bud­get justifications on past bud­gets. Such an incremental approach is 
no longer valid in the fast-­changing environment of ­today’s information ser­
vices. However, in all fairness, the approach frequently is encouraged by the 
bud­geting technique employed by parent institutions. An incremental men­
tality on the part of the funding authority can prompt automatic reductions 
in library bud­gets by ­those who hold the purse strings, ­whether they are city 
man­ag­ers, college or com­pany presidents, or school superintendents.
The bud­geting pro­cess is a time-­delayed pro­cess. A bud­get usually is pre­
pared one year or, in some cases, two or three years in advance and refined 
in the months leading up to the fiscal year. It is extremely difficult to proj­ect 
what the needs ­will be two to three years in advance, even with a good stra­
tegic plan. A three-­year bud­get is a rough estimate, but as time progresses, 
the bud­get becomes more specific. Two-­ and three-­year bud­gets give librarians 
and ­others in the institution an opportunity to guess what the ­future ­will 
hold, to plan, to adjust, and to revise. Remember that ­people in the central 
administration are looking at projections for property tax, student retention 
and admissions, profit and other ­factors that might increase or decrease 
revenue. Still, the bud­get is expected to forecast realistically expected rev­
enues, support, and expenses for the period of time covered by the bud­get 
request. Library man­ag­ers must follow the bud­get system and bud­geting cycle 

478  Coordinating
used by the larger organ­ization. Usually, guidelines4 for the preparation of the 
bud­get come from the school committee, the state or local funding agency, 
the college or university administration, or the corporation’s fiscal officer.
Although large libraries have a separate financial staff concerned pri­
marily with bud­gets and the accounting pro­cess, most libraries of any size 
involve a number of employees in bud­get planning. Some libraries and infor­
mation centers have internal bud­geting committees composed of represen­
tatives from vari­ous units of the organ­ization and the library director. Bud­get 
requests for programs or units frequently originate from the supervisor or a 
team most familiar with a par­tic­u­lar unit, program, proj­ect, or other aspect 
of the operation. This group pulls together and develops the bud­get based on 
requests from the units of the library and the guidelines given by the parent 
institution. Timetables for bud­get preparation, pre­sen­ta­tion, and overview 
are essential so that wide support can be gained. Two princi­ples guide the 
development and pre­sen­ta­tion of bud­gets: (1) effectiveness and efficiency, 
involving what sources of funds ­will be tapped, and (2) how maximum ben­
efit at minimum cost ­will be accomplished.
Bud­geting Techniques
Bud­geting techniques in libraries include traditional approaches used 
by many types of organ­izations, less-­used approaches, and a newer, innovative 
bud­geting technique. The former are more fixed in their approach, whereas 
the latter is more flexible. The shift in focus, just as in the planning pro­cess, 
has taken place as bud­gets are presented in terms of outcomes, or per­for­mance, 
rather than as input.
The most traditional types of bud­geting to be discussed include: (1) lump-­
sum allocation, based primarily on an incremental approach in which per­
centage increases are related to the previous year’s bud­get, and (2) line-­item 
allocation, in which expenses are divided into categories such as sala­
ries, benefits, materials, equipment, and so on (as seen in ­table 19.1 and 
­table 19.2).
Other forms of bud­geting that are used less but bear mentioning include 
formula bud­geting, per­for­mance bud­geting, and zero-­based bud­geting (ZBB), 
which look at programs, objectives, and benchmark costs, respectively. Respon­
sibility Centered Management (RCM) is a newer concept that has been 
­adopted by a number of large universities.
Each approach has advocates who promote its advantages. Generally, 
pro­cesses in the parent institution dictate the bud­geting pro­cess for the 
library. ­Every bud­get system, even rudimentary ones, comprises planning, 
management, and control processes.5
Lump-­Sum Bud­geting and Line Item Bud­geting
A primitive bud­get is the lump-­sum approach. In this form of bud­geting, 
a certain dollar amount is allocated to the library as a “lump sum,” and it 
becomes the responsibility of the library staff to decide how that sum is bro­
ken into categories that can be identified. ­These categories are usually the 
same ones mentioned ­under line-­item bud­geting: salaries and wages, mate­
rials and supplies, equipment, and so forth. This is more flexible than line-­
item bud­geting, and it does not relate the objectives to ser­vices. Librarians 
using this technique are forced to develop programs within the total dollar 

Library Finance and Bud­gets  479
figure allocated, instead of the other way around, assigning specific bud­get 
amounts to specific programs, as is done with the line item bud­get.
The line-­item or incremental bud­get approach is a pro­cess whereby cat­
egories of the bud­get are increased or decreased by a percentage. In such a 
pro­cess, the library director assumes its prior year’s base allocation or flat 
funding. Discussion of funding is based upon the amount of the increment, 
or in some cases decrease, that is to be applied in this next cycle. It basically 
treats existing ser­vices as preapproved, subject only to increases or decreases 
in financial resources to be allocated. The focus is on the changes anticipated 
over or ­under last year’s statistics. Sometimes the increments ­will vary line 
by line, so that inflation for serials or employee wages is taken into consid­
eration, but increases in other categories may be the same or less than the 
previous year. (See ­table 19.3 for an example of a line item bud­get.)
This is prob­ably the most common type of bud­get ­because of its simplic­
ity. The line-­item bud­get divides objects of expenditure into broad categories, 
with further subdivisions within ­those categories. This classification of 
expenditures on the basis of categories is called objects of expenditure (staff, 
collections, ­etc.), and within each category are more detailed line items (pro­
fessional staff salaries, hourly workers, overtime, serials, books, ­etc.). This 
type of bud­get focuses attention on how much money is spent and for what 
purpose, rather than the activity affected or its outcomes.
Critics believe this method is no longer effective ­because such an incre­
mental approach is based upon maintaining the status quo, with no room for 
flexibility, or even a real review of accomplishments. Its primary disadvantage 
is that items within ­those vari­ous established categories can be designated 
to such a degree that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to shift them. For 
example, a library has surplus funding in a staffing line and would like to 
add a collection of e-­books. Most parent organ­izations would not allow that 
kind of bud­get adjustment. As a result, line-­item bud­geting tends to assume 
that all currently existing programs are good and necessary and makes it a 
challenge to innovate. The greatest disadvantage to the line-­item approach 
is that ­there is almost no relationship between the bud­get request and the 
objectives of the organ­ization.
However, the line-­item approach has a few advantages. Line-­item bud­gets 
are easy to prepare. Most are done by projecting current expenditures to the 
next year, taking cost increases or inflation into account. This type of bud­get 
is easy to understand and to justify ­because it can be shown that the allocated 
funds ­were spent in the areas for which they ­were bud­geted. The funding 
authority can understand a request to add a new position or to increase the 
communication and supplies bud­gets by a specific ­percent, ­because that is 
the average amount that postage, telephone charges, and other supplies are 
projected to rise in the next year.
Formula Bud­geting
Formula bud­geting uses predetermined standards for allocation of mon­
etary resources. The example of the LAPL’s bud­get mentioned at the begin­
ning of the chapter is a formula bud­get where the library’s income is based 
on a percentage of the property tax income. In the past, this approach has 
been ­adopted by regional or state library agencies or in school districts and 
even university systems for appropriating state or regional funds. One rea­
son it is popu­lar among larger funding authorities is that, ­after the criteria 
for bud­get requests have been established, they can be applied across the

board to all units within the library system. The popularity of a formula bud­
get is reflected in several ­factors:
•	 A formula bud­get is mechanical and easy to prepare.
•	 The formula bud­get pro­cess applies to all institutions in the po­liti­
cal jurisdiction.
•	 Governing bodies have a sense of equity ­because each institution in 
the system is mea­sured against the same criteria.
•	 Fewer bud­geting and planning skills are required to prepare and 
administer a formula bud­get.
Additional advantages of formula bud­gets are that they:
•	 Facilitate interinstitutional comparison
•	 Facilitate comparisons from year to year
•	 Reduce paperwork in the bud­geting pro­cess
•	 Eliminate extraneous details
•	 Provide a systematic, objective allocation technique
•	 Connote mathematical infallibility.6
The formulas, which usually are expressed in terms of a percentage of 
the total institutional cost, focus primarily on input rather than activities 
and, therefore, are more applicable to specific aspects of library operations. 
For instance, in collection development, percentages of bud­gets can be allo­
cated, in the case of academic libraries, to the number and level of academic 
programs (bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral) and number of faculty teaching in 
each program. ­These ­factors determine how much ­will be spent on each aca­
demic department. Some formulas take into account the marketplace for 
library materials where science, technology, and medical materials cost much 
more than humanities and social science items. In that sense, formula bud­
get allocations may be thought of as a combination of the lump-­sum and for­
mula approaches.
Most librarians have tended to move away from strict formula bud­geting, 
except when outside funding is tied to established formulas or specifically 
for materials allocation.7 One distinct disadvantage to formula bud­geting is 
that some functions cannot be related to ­those formulas and must receive 
separate justification. Perhaps the biggest fallacy in such an approach is that 
it assumes a relationship between the quantity being expressed and the qual­
ity of ser­vice; that is, output mea­sures. In recent years, ­there have been 
numerous examples in journal lit­er­a­ture of library staff tying in per­for­mance 
mea­sures to library and information center bud­gets.8
Program Bud­geting
The program bud­geting pro­cess identifies all of the organ­ization’s activ­
ities and per­for­mance, as opposed to the traditional line-­item bud­get system 
that allocates resources based on line-­item expenses. ­Every activity in the 
organ­ization is linked through the all-­inclusive programs. ­Those programs 
link the activities of the organ­ization to the objectives and financial require­
ments that can be identified for each program.

482  Coordinating
The program bud­get approach establishes the total cost of each ser­vice 
unit/component and sets spending levels and priorities accordingly. Its 
approach maintains that it is pos­si­ble to relate programs to the accomplish­
ment of time/action objectives or activities that are stated in terms of per­
for­mance mea­sures in the strategic planning pro­cess. Therefore, a program 
bud­get displays a series of mini bud­gets, which then show the cost of each of 
the activities within the organ­ization. In a way, it can be said that program 
bud­geting developed along with strategic planning, ­because that type of plan­
ning pro­cess is based upon establishing costs of individual programs, which 
requires accounting as well as bud­geting. Having identified each library’s 
activity unit, monetary figures can be assigned to the vari­ous programs or 
ser­vices provided.
For example, if a public library system provides bookmobile ser­vice for 
the community, the total cost of that ser­vice (staffing, materials, mainte­
nance, overhead, ­etc.) can be calculated. In this way, one can see exactly 
what, for example, the bookmobile ser­vice costs. See ­table 19.4.

Per­for­mance Bud­geting
In a way, the performance-­budgeting approach could be called “outcome 
bud­geting,” ­because ­actual per­for­mances are mea­sured in terms of ser­vice 
effectiveness and efficiency.
It classifies expenditures on the basis of specific activities, the num­
ber of units performed, and their costs. It concentrates attention on what 
each work unit does, how frequently it does it, and at what cost, rather 
than a ­simple line-­item accounting of expenditures. It is easiest to build 
performance-­based bud­gets on the foundation of a program-­based bud­get 
system. With per­for­mance, or outcome-­based bud­gets, each major program 
or function is mea­sured using a set of benchmarks. Benchmarks are snap­
shots of par­tic­u­lar activities or functions at a beginning date and time. ­These 
benchmarks are used for comparison purposes to mea­sure pro­gress in attain­
ing specific program or functional goals over periods of time (i.e., six months, 
a year, or several years). Programs, activities, and functions also may be 
mea­sured quantitatively and qualitatively against other internal and exter­
nal comparables.
Recently, mea­sures of per­for­mance have been expanded to include more 
subjective evaluations focused on overall quality of programs and their direct 
benefits, meaning outcomes. It links revenue to resource allocation and ser­
vice per­for­mance in mea­sur­able terms and, as such, serves as an impor­tant 
policy tool. This approach is a combination of program bud­geting and per­
for­mance bud­geting.
Based on the cost of a program and its outcome objectives, or benefits, one 
can decide ­whether to continue, to modify, or to delete the ser­vice. Program 
bud­geting is an effective method of explaining needs to funding authorities. 
The focus is on consideration of all priorities and alternatives for ser­vice.9 For 
instance, other than simply withholding funds from the lower-­ranked ser­vices 
in a priority list, other alternatives can be explored, including trying to 
reduce the cost of providing a certain level of ser­vices for ­those already cho­
sen, thereby allowing the next listed priority to be funded. Another alterna­
tive might be to increase charges, say for value-­added ser­vices to individuals 
and organ­izations, thus adding to the pool of funds, which might in turn sup­
port the next level on the priority list.
The upside is that all programs can be identified and valued, whereas 
the downside is that this pro­cess is time-­consuming to establish and main­
tain, and programs tend to overlap between departments and units, which 
can make collecting data difficult. Per­for­mance bud­geting mea­sures quan­
tity rather than quality of ser­vice offered. The classification of expenditures 
is based upon specific activities, the number of units performed, and their 
costs. This type of bud­get concentrates attention on what a work unit does, 
how frequently it does it, and at what cost rather than a detailed, line-­item 
accounting of expenditures. This approach requires the careful accumula­
tion of quantitative data over a period of time. Techniques of cost-­benefit 
analy­sis are required to mea­sure the per­for­mance and to establish norms. 
Per­for­mance bud­geting has been criticized ­because the economic aspect over­
shadows the ser­vice aspect. Fixed costs of building maintenance, heating, 
lights, equipment, and other items that are variable but are directly related 
to the work being done also must be added to the final cost. With such detailed 
bud­geting activity, benefits of awareness and participation may be overshad­
owed by the costly time and efforts involved in maintaining the pro­cess. 
Zero-­Based Bud­geting (ZBB), is a spin-­off of program budgeting.

484  Coordinating
Zero-­Based Bud­geting (ZBB)
The zero-­based bud­geting (ZBB) approach is not a strict procedural one 
but rather an approach that annually requires the organ­ization to review and 
to reevaluate each of their ser­vice programs and activities on the basis of 
both output mea­sures and costs. Each line item or program is examined in 
its entirety, regardless of prior funding. Detailed mea­sure­ment of per­for­
mance and costs of the activity are identified. ­Those items that cannot be 
justified are subject to elimination or significant reduction. Efficiency and 
effectiveness are key considerations, ­because each program is justified and 
its priority identified according to its level of importance in achieving the mis­
sion of the organ­ization. This pro­cess requires stating the reason for the 
activity as well as the consequences of not implementing the endeavor. This 
bud­geting approach is occasionally used by a new administrator at a parent 
organ­ization, in order to “shake ­things up,” but overall it has not been used 
much in recent years.
Responsibility Centered Bud­geting (RCM)
Rising costs and tightening bud­gets have forced greater accountability 
among institutions of higher education. Responsibility Centered Bud­geting 
(RCM), sometimes called decentralized bud­geting, is the approach of “each 
tub on its own bottom” and has been implemented in large universities in an 
attempt to give man­ag­ers more control over fiscal ­matters and show the 
financial effects of their decisions. The goal of RCM is to delegate authority 
and responsibility to the appropriate unit on campus.
With RCM, institutions divide the campus into responsibility centers or 
units: college of liberal arts, library, student affairs, and office of the presi­
dent are some examples. Then they further divide ­these units into ­those that 
are capable of self-­support and ­those that need funding for the good of the 
institution. The former include all academic units with tuition-­ and fee-­
paying students, faculty capable of bringing in contracts and grants, and 
other income-­generating units such as dining ser­vices, housing, and other 
business ser­vices. ­These units are funded with the income they generate. The 
other units on campus that do not take in much or any funding are consid­
ered a “greater or public good.” ­These units that are necessary but cannot be 
self-­supporting include central administrative units (president and vice pres­
ident’s offices) as well as libraries. ­These units are funded by “taxing” the 
income-­generating units. An impor­tant aspect to understand about RCM is 
that funding that is ­going to the units is formulaic. If the library is supported 
by a percentage of tuition, for example, then the tuition realized could easily 
be more or less than bud­geted. If, ­after all the tuition has been collected, 
­there is a change from what was bud­geted, ­either ­under or over the expecta­
tion, that change in tuition income flows to the library and any other units 
funded by tuition, and ­those units must make adjustments ­after the begin­
ning of the fiscal year to respond to the change in the bud­get.
Also with RCM, units are required to hold some funding in reserve to 
cover unexpected costs such as an opportunity to purchase a special collec­
tion or to pay for repairs. A portion of the university’s reserve fund is held in 
the library’s bud­get, and any surplus may be expended by the library. If the 
library staff anticipates a bud­get deficit or a special proj­ect (new furniture 
for a renovated branch library), then some of the reserve fund may be avail­
able to use for that purpose. An impor­tant aspect to RCM is that unspent 
funds may be kept in reserve by the library and spent in a ­future fiscal year. 

Library Finance and Bud­gets  485
Most other bud­geting systems require that all money be spent by the end of 
the fiscal year or it reverts to the central administration of the parent 
institution.
­These RCM formulas are complicated, and library man­ag­ers need to 
fully understand the financial structure in order to navigate through this 
pro­cess. Heated debates revolve around how the central administration 
allocates funds to units. For example, “how charges for space, libraries, and 
other ser­vices [­will] be allocated; and how the hardware and software needed 
to run the new information systems [­will] be configured.”10 It requires that 
the administration recognize and support units that exist for the “public 
good”—­such as the physical plant, technology, and the library [and that they] 
must receive funding that is adequate, but at taxation levels that the aca­
demic units can support financially and intellectually without seriously 
attenuating RCM’s under­lying incentives.”11
Accountability and Reporting
The final aspect of bud­geting to be mentioned ­here is keeping accurate 
rec­ords of what has been disbursed, what has been encumbered, and what 
remains. Before the bud­get has been approved by the proper authority, a 
mechanism for keeping track of both expenditures and encumbrances must 
be in place to keep track of not only what has been spent but also to set aside 
funds for items ordered but not yet received, so that funds ­will be reserved 
and available for their payment when they do arrive. Established account cat­
egories and numbers play a vital role in this pro­cess to identify such items 
as salaries, materials acquired or ordered, equipment installed, and so forth. 
Periodic statements of expenditures and an audit of the expenses at the end 
of the year provide impor­tant feedback to the bud­getary pro­cess. An account­
ing pro­cess allows for efficient and effective adjustments to the pro­cess when 
and where they are needed. Reporting usually is accomplished through 
monthly rec­ords prepared by the accounting office, which usually is a part of 
the library or a part of the larger organ­ization, such as the city government. 
Monthly statements, or on-­demand electronic reporting, can act as bench­
marks to inform the library man­ag­ers how they are progressing, financially, 
­toward the library’s objectives and, at the same time, alert them to potential 
prob­lem areas (i.e., over expenditures). This monthly summary statement (see 
­table 19.5 Monthly Summary Statement) is typical in most organ­izations.
­Because accounting is an in­de­pen­dent function, many large libraries 
employ bud­get analysts in staff positions; their primary responsibility is 
to report facts as they exist or have existed. Such bud­get officers are not 
normally responsible for making decisions that affect the operations of the 
library. However, they are most helpful in collecting relevant cost data for 
anticipated decisions and in making cost studies that might be keys to 
decision making.
Along with accounting goes the impor­tant ele­ment of reporting: report­
ing to the funding authority, reporting to the staff, and reporting to the pub­
lic, however that might be defined. Reporting procedures can take a variety 
of forms: formal written reports,12 with detailed statistical documentation, 
or informal reports, such as memos, staff meetings, board meetings, or blog 
posts. In reporting, the librarian’s public relations responsibility becomes 
most evident. Only by conscientiously selling the library and its ser­vices can 
the librarian hope to maintain a high level of activity and funding. A primary 
role of the director of a library or information center is to be so convincing 

486  Coordinating
that support for library activities ­will increase, and that officials of the parent 
institution ­will understand and support the library or information center.
As detailed in chapter 6, public relations for librarians is an art through 
which information and persuasion solicit public support for the ­causes that 
are set forth in the goals of the library. A public relations plan is an integral 
part of the goals, objectives, and bud­geting procedure in a library. This is

the librarian’s primary means of gaining and holding the support necessary 
to develop programs. It is also a way of expanding that support through new 
financial initiatives. A man­ag­er with bud­get control responsibilities ­will be 
held accountable for a balanced bud­get, and overtime and with bud­get suc­
cess, ­will gain credibility and trust from the parent organ­ization.
Conclusion
Bud­geting is the ultimate controlling operation ­because it is the mone­
tary expression of a plan of information ser­vices in libraries and other infor­
mation centers. Vari­ous types and levels of bud­geting are used to plan for 
information ser­vices. Some are more applicable to not-­for-­profit organ­izations 
than ­others, but all are being used, in one form or another, in libraries and 
information centers ­today. The pro­cess of bud­geting is impor­tant, ­because it 
is the way organ­izations fund their plans, monitor pro­gress of that plan, and 
remain financially accountable. The next chapter discusses ways to supple­
ment the basic bud­get of a library or information center with fundraising and 
grant writing.
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 It is January and you have just learned that the tax revenue for your city is 
missing the estimate for the fiscal year dramatically. You have been asked to 
cut 17 ­percent of your bud­get. This is a very difficult prob­lem ­because the fiscal 
year started in July and half the money in your bud­get has already been spent. 
Using the bud­get form in ­table 19.2, determine how much money a 17 ­percent 
cut to the bud­get would be. What figures are you using to determine the 
17 ­percent cut? Once you know the ­actual amount you need to cut, make a list 
of priorities and then decide where you ­will take the cuts.
2.	In the above bud­get cutting scenario do you think you have an opportunity for 
advocacy? What would you recommend?
3.	 You would like to add some makerspace programming in the high school library 
where you work. Write a brief justification for the program listing the educa­
tional benefits. How many students would you serve with this program? Draft 
a bud­get that would cover the expenses for equipment, supplies, staff, and any 
other necessary categories.
4.	You are the dean of the University Library and some ­Music Department faculty 
members have been begging for a separate branch library for their department 
for many years. You understand that consolidation of branch libraries has been 
the trend, and with tight bud­gets ­there is no way you could fund a separate 
­music department branch. Fi­nally in desperation, you told the faculty members 
that the only way they ­will get a ­music library is if someone donates it. You 
thought at last you would be rid of this demand. But about six months ­later, the 
­Music Department announces a major gift, and they have made an appointment 
to meet with you to make their dream come true. Before the meeting you need 
to sketch out the costs of ­running a separate branch library. The ­Music Depart­
ment has offered space and students to move the collection. What you need is 
an estimate of the one-­time costs for moving and setting up a library and then

Discussion Questions
1.	 Of the bud­get techniques described in this chapter, which do you prefer? Have 
you used any of them and what has been your experience?
2.	If you ­were responsible for a bud­get, ­whether it be a full library or a program, 
what involvement would you give to ­people who work for you? If you are an 
employee in a library, do you want to know about the bud­get, help prepare it, or 
just stay out of it?
3.	You work in a hospital library, and the bud­get for the library is always tight 
and a challenge to justify. Brainstorm with your group and make a list of ways 
you could show value to the hospital from the library. What other kinds of advo­
cacy or marketing could you suggest to keep the library from major cuts?
4.	You are members of the Friends of the City Library. Your group has just learned 
that an el­derly cata­loger, who had worked his ­whole life in the city library, died 
and left a bequest of $3 million to the city without any specific purpose. He also 
left $200,000 to the library. As members of this committee, how would you advise 
the library director? How might she spend the $200,000? Should she use it for 
a current use or ask the city’s attorney if it could be converted into an endow­
ment? If the director decides on the endowment, how much ­will the library get 
in the annual payout? What about the $3 million? Should the group advocate 
for any of that money?
a bud­get to cover the operating costs. The donor says that she ­will give both a 
current use gift to cover the move and set-up and an endowment to cover the 
operating costs of a small ­music library. Your university pays out 4 ­percent per 
year for endowment income. Set up a bud­get for the branch library, including 
staffing and other categories. Decide if you ­will allocate funds for collections from 
the central bud­get, or expect the endowment to cover ­those expenses. Then 
calculate how large the endowment would need to be to cover the annual oper­
ating bud­get. Also set up a one-­time bud­get for the library move and any deco­
rating or remodeling that might be necessary.

Library Fund-­Raising 
(Development) and 
Grant Writing
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Know where to look for grant opportunities
•	 Understand the steps for writing a grant
•	 Appreciate the importance of integrity in fund-­raising
•	 Be aware of the kinds of gifts a donor may provide
•	 Understand how to cultivate donors
•	 Know that the importance of stewardship is not just thank you notes
Librarians of all kinds engage in finding external support to supplement funds 
from their parent institutions. ­These activities range from a ­simple bake sale, 
to a grant to purchase a special collection, to a large capital campaign.
This chapter ­will introduce fund-­raising in libraries, which includes 
identification and then cultivation of donors, how to solicit, and the steward­
ship that results. This is often called development. An overview of the pro­
cess of fund-­raising, the kinds of fund-­raising activities performed in libraries, 
types of gifts and giving, and staffing for fund-­raising are described.
The first steps in fund-­raising are described, as well as the kinds of 
activities performed, types of gifts and giving, and staffing needed. The chap­
ter ­will then cover the basics of learning about and securing grants for a 
library or information center.

Overview of the Pro­cess of Fund-­Raising
Crumpton describes the four major steps of fund-­raising as identifica­
tion, cultivation, solicitation, and stewardship. The first is identification.
Identification
Who are the donors? At schools, colleges, and universities they are pre­
dominantly alumni, and “libraries are at a competitive disadvantage with 
other academic units on campus ­because the university libraries do not have 
alumni.”2 They can also be companies in the geographic area or who have 
an affinity for the university. Library vendors, for example, may have a foun­
dation with funds available for libraries. Public librarians are most likely to 
solicit residents, cardholders, and local businesses. School librarians have the 
school’s parent group and alumni. ­People donate ­because they want to par­
ticipate in the life of the institution; ­because they had a good experience as 
a user; and ­because they want to stay connected. Donating makes ­people feel 
good; it connects them to the organ­ization and gives them recognition.
Development personnel identify potential donors and how much they are 
likely to donate. Then they match up prospective donors’ interests with iden­
tified needs of the library. If the fund-­raising is part of a major campaign, 
then they might share vari­ous parts of the campaign’s case statement, or 
even show them a draft of the case statement and ask for an opinion about 
how much donors in general are likely to give. This estimate gives the devel­
opment staff an idea of the giving capacity of the person interviewed. In plan­
ning a major campaign, the total amount needed is developed into a pyramid 
of gifts showing how many gifts by size ­will need to be raised to meet the 
campaign goal.
Cultivation
Like many other aspects of life, social media plays a role in library fund-­
raising. Using social media sites to expand a library’s community of sup­
porters is a good way to link ­people to programs, collections, or ser­vices.3
Management on the Job: Using Employees 
in Library Development
Library directors understand the need for outside funding to supplement the support from 
parent organ­izations. In his article “Cultivating an Orga­nizational Effort for Develop­
ment,”1 Michael A. Crumpton makes a case for training and involving staff in the pur­
suit of philanthropy, adding that fund-­raising is not only about money, but about building 
relationships and networks, and having a shared vision for the library. Crumpton tells 
how the library offered a course, “Development 101: What’s in It for You,” to library employ­
ees who ­were interested. Topics of the course included the structure of development on 
campus, fund-­raising terminology, roles of development officers and library administra­
tion, typical funding needs, strategies to reach out to donors, types of giving, and what 
staff can do to support development.
Fund-­raising is folded into the library’s strategic planning pro­cess; involving staff 
in the fund-­raising pro­cess helps employees better understand the mission and vision of 
the library, resulting in more engaged, motivated workers.

Library Fund-­Raising (Development) and Grant Writing  493
At some institutions, convincing the officials that the library should be 
a priority can be a major hurdle. A lot depends upon the values and priorities 
of the leader of the parent institution. If the officials launch a capital cam­
paign and library proj­ects are part of the campaign, the work of finding donors 
is easier ­because the foundation ­will assign donors and a gift officer to the 
library. Often the foundation has done some research and asked potential 
donors what areas they would like to support. ­Those that selected the library 
or wish to help faculty or students could be approached by the library’s gift 
officer. Then the next steps are deciding how much the prospective donor 
might give, and which proj­ects might pique their interest.
Solicitation
The gift officer might invite the donor to visit the library, meet librari­
ans, or have lunch and discuss the case statement. Sometimes the gift offi­
cer or librarian ­will go to the prospective donor’s workplace or home. Usually 
several meetings occur before the gift officer is ready to make a specific 
request. “The key strategies, in any library situation, ­will remain establish­
ing and leveraging relationships with major donors.”4 Time spent building a 
relationship with the prospective donor is very impor­tant. It gives every­one 
a chance to develop trust and demonstrate that any funds given ­will be well 
managed. ­There are other times when a donor ­will appear ready to write a 
check without any visits or lunches. ­These are cases, for example, when a 
donor has gained a ­great deal of money from an inheritance, or a spouse has 
died, and the ­widow wants to memorialize her husband by naming a room 
in the library. ­There are other times when library ser­vices or programs have 
struck a chord with a donor, and they offer to help.
When a major gift is solicited, the library director or gift officer ­will be 
prepared to show pos­si­ble naming opportunities, by showing architectural 
drawings, if the building is not yet constructed; by giving a hard hat tour of 
a proj­ect, if it is ­under construction; or by showing the space as it exists. It 
is very exciting for prospective donors to see the ­actual space that they might 
memorialize. For an annual fund or smaller campaign, solicitations may be 
made by mail or social media.
When the gift is received the library director undertakes appropriate 
and timely acknowl­edgment of the gift. The nature of this acknowl­edgment 
FIGURE 20.1. Gift Pyramid for a $1,000,000 Campaign

494  Coordinating
depends on the size of the gift and the wishes of the donor. Some ­people wish 
no formal recognition, and ­others expect continuous and ongoing thanks. A 
well-­drafted, handwritten letter is always appropriate, greatly appreciated, 
and absolutely essential.
Stewardship
Stewardship is work that is done with the donor ­after the gift has been 
made and initially acknowledged. The point of stewardship is to continue 
building a relationship with the donor and keeping the donor appraised of 
activities in the library and any information about how the gift has been 
used.
The librarian or the person in the foundation of the parent organ­ization 
manages stewardship by setting out in advance the appropriate range of 
ways donors are recognized. That way, the appropriate method of recogni­
tion ­will be offered. Ways an organ­ization may show gratitude include: tak­
ing the donor to lunch or dinner, holding a reception for donor and ­family, 
giving special gifts such as pins or bowls conferred at a ceremony, or includ­
ing the donor’s name in an annual publication of benefactors. The connec­
tion between the library and the donor does not end with a thank you letter 
or recognition event. Most successful library fund-­raisers maintain relation­
ships with personal visits and notes. A short communication about the use 
of a library room named for a donor or a copy of a letter from a faculty mem­
ber thanking the library for purchasing materials funded by the donor gives 
the donor an idea of how the library is using his or her gift, and ­these small 
steps keep donors connected to the library. Most fund-­raisers believe that 
donors are likely to give again if they feel their first gift was appreciated. 
Beyond appreciation, library man­ag­ers should ensure that all funds are spent 
according to the gift agreement. It can be tempting to reallocate funds to a 
dif­fer­ent, inappropriate but pressing purpose, but this is unethical. Like all 
other aspects of library planning and ser­vice, man­ag­ers should set aside time 
to reflect on the effectiveness of fund-­raising efforts.5
Fund-­Raising Resources
­There are a host of organ­izations designed to aid ­those who seek out­
side funding. For the uninitiated, The American Library Association (ALA) 
and several of its divisions offer a broad range of activities, publications, and 
committees devoted to fund-­raising. In par­tic­u­lar, the ALA’s Welcome to 
Frontline Fundraising: Getting Started in Eight Easy Steps is a wealth of 
information.6 The Association of Research Libraries also published SPEC Kit 
on Library Development7 that explores the status of fund-­raising in the larg­
est academic libraries.
First Steps
In most cases, before anyone raises a dollar for a library, the parent 
organ­ization needs to be consulted and needs to approve ­these activities. In 
the case of an academic library, it would be the vice president for academic 
affairs or the president who allows the library to participate in fund-­raising 
at any but the most minimal level. Public libraries are governed by city or town 
man­ag­ers or councils, or they may be in­de­pen­dent with an elected or appointed 

Library Fund-­Raising (Development) and Grant Writing  495
board of trustees who would approve such a proj­ect. Within a school district, 
the principal, the school library supervisor, or some other person in the super­
intendent’s office would be the appropriate persons to contact.
Why do library directors need to ask for permission before approaching 
a potential donor?
•	 It could be that someone ­else in the organ­ization is already approach­
ing that person, and donors dislike multiple requests in the same year 
from the same organ­ization. Multiple requests give potential donors 
the impression that the institution is disor­ga­nized, with poor internal 
communication. Or a donor may already have given a substantial gift 
that just has not yet been publicized.
•	 If the library director asks for $5,000 and someone ­else was plan­
ning to ask for $50,000, the library’s request could undercut the 
larger solicitation, ­because the donor might be satisfied with giving 
$5,000 to the library and not want to donate more than one gift. 
Then, as a ­whole, the parent organ­ization has lost $45,000.
•	 Top administrators want to shape fund-­raising to reflect priorities 
of the parent organ­ization.
•	 Finding and soliciting donors is not something done quickly and with­
out research, coordination, and multiple contacts with the potential 
donor.
Understanding Fund-­Raising Terms and 
Types of Gifts
Like any enterprise, fund-­raising has a unique vocabulary. ­Here are 
some of the most impor­tant terms and concepts in the field:
Institutional Advancement in higher education is the part of the univer­
sity that works with the president or chancellor to oversee fund-­raising. 
Sometimes this group also includes alumni relations, government rela­
tions, and communications.
Contact Report is a brief written summary of an encounter with a prospec­
tive or current donor. Sometimes ­these reports are put in a database 
managed by institutional advancement, other times they are just notes 
in a library director’s file. A contact report file is impor­tant for keeping 
track of information about the donor or prospective donor. Also, when a 
new library director is hired, having a contact report file helps the new 
person get up to speed in fund-­raising.
Challenge Gifts are pledges made to motivate other donors. ­These could be 
from a foundation, government organ­ization, or from other donors.
Gift Agreement is a written contract between the donor and the institution 
receiving the gift. Gift agreements are impor­tant when ­either the donor 
is promising to donate funds over a period of time or when the dona­
tion is not money, but a tangible gift, such as a book, manuscript, or 
furniture.
Acknowledgement is the first step taken when a gift has been received. 
Usually a thank you note is written. Sometimes a follow-up phone call 

496  Coordinating
is also made to thank the donor in person. Thank you notes are impor­
tant and should be written soon ­after the gift is given. Best written by 
hand, they should include information on how this gift ­will make a dif­
ference to the library.
In addition to fund-­raising terminology, ­there are vari­ous types of gifts 
and types of giving that are available to prospective donors. ­These include:
Current use gifts are for proj­ects that ­will be short term, and where all 
the money should be spent within a year or two for the specific purpose 
of the gift.
Endowments are like savings accounts where the library staff only spends 
the interest each year. The endowment is donated with the understand­
ing that the gift ­will be invested by the parent institution or a founda­
tion arm of the library and a percentage ­will be paid out to the library 
annually. ­Because the library only gets the interest, the fund remains 
available in perpetuity. Since an endowment is a legally binding agree­
ment, it is very difficult and unadvisable to convert an endowment to 
current use. Endowments are generally not set up below $25,000, ­because 
the payout would be very small. Each institution ­will have a policy on 
how much to pay out and the minimum size for initial endowment. In 
­either case, donors may specify how the funds should be spent; it is the 
responsibility of the person in charge of the library to ensure that the 
donor’s request has been met.
Occasionally a donor ­will give a combination of a current use gift, to get 
a proj­ect started, and then an endowment to keep it ­going. For example, a 
donor may pledge $100,000 for a digital proj­ect in the library. The first $25,000 
is to be spent in the first year or two, and then the interest on the remaining 
$75,000 would pay out ­every year. Perhaps the $25,000 would be used to pur­
chase equipment, and the endowment payout would cover wages for student 
workers to digitize collections. A payout of 4 ­percent of $75,000 would yield 
$3,000 per year. The benefit of an endowment is that it lasts forever; however, 
the annual yield is small. A current use gift may be quite large, but it ­will 
be spent in a short time and then be gone.
Annual Fund gifts are usually unrestricted donations meant to be 
spent during the current or next fiscal year. Solicitation entails an annual 
mailing or telephone solicitation, or both. This activity builds a list of sup­
porters and generates modest income. Some public libraries solicit ­every adult 
with a library card or who attends a program or event. Academic libraries 
solicit a few non-­university affiliated ­people, but ­because ­there are no alumni 
of a library; soliciting alumni who graduated from a school or college in the 
university may be off limits, ­unless the alumnus specifies an interest in sup­
porting the library. Some families donate to an academic library when sib­
lings or parents attended dif­fer­ent schools or colleges within the university; 
they see the library as a neutral way to support the university without con­
centrating on any one college or school.
Unsolicited gifts arrive unexpectedly. ­These donors or their ­lawyers 
contact a library with a check or notice that a gift is pending. Unsolicited 
gifts are often bequests, but they also may come from a living library donor. 
Someone may walk into the library and announce that they want to help with 
a library building program ­because ­family members have been satisfied with 
library ser­vices and programs. Unsolicited gifts usually come when ser­vice 
has been outstanding and the donor has had a good experience in the library.

Library Fund-­Raising (Development) and Grant Writing  497
Solicited gifts are simply gifts that come as a result of a request. ­These 
solicitations can go on anytime, but are a key part of an institution’s capital 
campaign.
Capital campaign means a multiyear activity to raise large amounts 
of money. Libraries in private schools, universities, and colleges participate 
in an institution-­wide campaign; public libraries may have a major campaign, 
especially for capital proj­ects such as a new library or renovation. The cam­
paign has specific goals and a variety of proj­ects that can be matched to 
donors. Capital campaigns range from a few million to over a billion dollars; 
this amount is determined not by the needs but by how much the institution 
thinks it can raise. Presidents, in the case of academic libraries, determine 
the priorities of the campaign, including ­whether the library’s needs are 
included in the campaign case statement. A con­sul­tant or someone from the 
organ­ization determines the giving capacity of potential donors and estab­
lishes a financial goal for the campaign. College deans, athletic directors, and 
­others develop proposals for the campaign. Then the president pares down 
the proposals to reflect administrator priorities. Next, writers on staff develop 
a campaign case statement that describes the specific proj­ects and goals for 
the campaign, with dollar amounts attached to each proj­ect. The case state­
ment is then ready to be shared with potential donors.
Usually ­there are many small gifts, some medium-­sized gifts, and a very 
few large ones. In the campaign case statement, ­there ­will be more proj­ects 
and proposals than number of gifts in the pyramid (see figure 20.1), ­because 
no one can predict which proj­ects ­will appeal to donors. A library director 
needs to be engaged not only in the fund-­raising planning but also in the 
development of potential donors and the solicitation of ­those donors. Without 
this involvement, the library may come up short in donations, even though 
the case statement had numerous library proposals.
­Until approximately half of the funds are raised, the campaign is con­
sidered to be in a “quiet phase” where donors are solicited, but ­there is no 
external publicity. ­After 50 ­percent has been raised, and the institution is 
confident that the fund-­raising goal is achievable, then an active publicity 
campaign is launched to build enthusiasm and press forward to complete the 
campaign.
Collaborative Fund-­Raising is an approach where library staff pair 
with another organ­ization to raise funds for mutual benefit. This approach 
is often seen in support of collection development, where faculty members in 
a department in higher education institutions or community organ­izations 
work with a public or school library to build a collection on a specific topic. 
In ­these instances, potential fund-­raising rivals can become collaborators.8
Types of Giving
Contributors have a variety of ways to give funds to a charitable 
organ­ization:
•	 They can write one check or make a credit card charge online. If the 
amount is relatively small, this is usually the way ­people donate to 
an annual fund.
•	 Benefactors may make a promise (called a pledge) and pay the gift 
over a number of years. This is usually done with large gifts.
•	 Donors set up a living trust, which is a way for a person to provide 
perhaps more than they think they can actually afford. They donate 

498  Coordinating
a lump sum to a non-­profit institution and gain a tax benefit, espe­
cially if the funds are held in stocks or mutual funds, which have 
increased over time. ­After the gift, the donor receives an annuity 
from the money while they live. Managed by an insurance com­pany, 
the amount of the annuity paid out each month is calculated on the 
donor’s life expectancy, and on estimates for the rise or fall of the 
stock market. ­After the donor of a living trust dies, the remainder of 
the gift goes to the non-­profit institution. A living trust is a way for 
a donor to receive recognition, to get a tax benefit, and monthly pay­
ments while they are still alive. ­After the donor’s death, the non-­profit 
institution ­will receive a larger gift.
•	 Donors specify the library in their ­will or list the library as a benefi­
ciary of their investments or insurance policies; when they die, the 
money goes to the library. This is called a bequest. Sometimes the 
library ­will know about this potential gift, and sometimes it comes 
as a nice surprise.
•	 Crowdfunding on the Internet started during the financial crisis of 
2007–2008. It is a way for ­those supporting libraries and other cul­
tural proj­ects to raise amounts of money from a large number of 
­people. Online ser­vices such as GoFundMe, Indiegogo, Alumni Funder, 
and Kickstarter are used.9 ­These ser­vices take a fee for setting up 
the account and managing the money donated.
•	 In-­kind or non-­monetary gifts. Examples include donations from a 
vendor, such as the use of a database at a discount or no charge; a gift 
of a collection of rare books, paintings or other art; or photo­graphs, 
manuscripts, or other unpublished materials. When a library accepts 
­these kinds of gifts, it is impor­tant that the donor and a representative 
from the library sign a deed of gift.10 This agreement verifies that 
the donor does indeed own the donated items, describes the owner­
ship, and copyright status, which may or not be transferred with the 
gift. ­Owners of manuscripts may retain some rights, and the library 
may refuse to accept a gift if ­there are questions about rights to 
digitize, for example. Having a deed of gift for ­every donation is very 
impor­tant and without it, prob­lems for the library may develop in 
the ­future.
Types of Fund-­Raising Activities
The following are examples of fund-­raising activities in libraries. ­These 
activities are a good place to start a fund-­raising program, ­because they not 
only provide some needed income, but offer visibility of the library to the 
community.
Events such as book sales, auctions, and benefit concerts, all build posi­
tive support for a library. School librarians hold book sales for one or two 
days, often with help from parents. ­These sales provide opportunities for 
­children to buy books when their parents do not take them to bookstores.
Organ­izing events involves many volunteers and staff. They are a way 
for the community to come together, have some fun, and provide support to 
the library. In public libraries and some academic libraries, the Friends of 
the Library groups help with ­these activities. This dedicated group of volun­
teers working on a library event is a good first place to start when beginning 

Library Fund-­Raising (Development) and Grant Writing  499
a library development program. Friends of the Library groups require the 
time of library man­ag­ers to make sure that their activities are helpful and 
contribute to the priorities of the library. “Finding individuals who are depend­
able, who work successfully with a variety of personalities, and who are will­
ing to be vis­i­ble, involved, and ardent champions for the library on and off 
campus can be a challenge.”11 Some public libraries use their friends group as 
an umbrella organ­ization that stewards the endowment or serves as a non-­
profit 501(c)(3),12 which is the part of the tax code that defines the type of 
non-­profit organ­ization that is exempt from tax. They use their Friends group, 
although public libraries are usually non-­profit, in order to separate and main­
tain donations for the library, so that the library has control of this money 
and it does not just go to the city.
Although ­these events may not result in a significant financial yield, 
they do provide some needed funds and they offer a ­great opportunity to pro­
mote the library. They offer opportunities to build support in the commu­
nity and help libraries build their database of prospects.
Staffing for Fund-­Raising
While smaller libraries conduct fund-­raising in-­house with the board of 
trustees, parents’ council, or Friends of the Library groups, larger institu­
tions usually work with a foundation or development office. In any case, large 
or small, the library director is always deeply involved in planning, coordi­
nating, and carry­ing out fund-­raising. This is ­because the director has a big 
picture view of the library, knows best the needs and goals of the library, 
and can express an exciting vision for the ­future of the library, a vision that 
is pos­si­ble with extra financial support. Also, donors want to talk to the per­
son in charge. On the other hand, some experts believe that front line staff 
may have a close relationship with ­people who might be donors and that pro­
viding development training for all staff, even student workers, is a good 
idea.13
Most fund-­raising in larger institutions is centralized in a development 
office or foundation. The development office has employees who conduct 
research, run events, and manage money, and ­those who solicit major dona­
tions, called gift officers. Gift officers are assigned to vari­ous units on campus 
or parts of a large public library and help to identify donors and communicate 
the message of their unit to the donor. Some very large libraries have their 
own gift officer or multiple officers. Gift officers are creative and enjoy working 
with ­people; they usually spend much of their time traveling to meet with 
prospective donors. To best support a gift officer, a librarian needs to give 
them specific information about library needs and make the needs sound 
exciting and impor­tant. Gift officers ask such questions as, “Who ­will be 
helped?” and “Why is this proj­ect impor­tant?” Librarians strategize with 
gift officers about specific individuals who may become potential donors and 
what proj­ects might appeal to them. Faculty can be very helpful to academic 
libraries by bringing prospective donors to the attention of the library staff, 
and by helping donors find homes for impor­tant books. Sometimes retir­
ing faculty may want to unload books from their offices, and libraries pro­
vide a good ser­vice to ­those faculty members by taking their books. ­Because 
faculty members may value their personal collections more highly than 
their library does, it is a good idea to accept the books with the stipulation 
that anything not wanted may be passed on to other libraries or disposed of 
by the library.

Talk About It
Look at the 10 traits listed above and discuss why each of them is impor­tant in develop­
ment. Can you think of other traits that would be helpful for a person who is asking 
­others for money?
Like any other employee, a gift officer needs to be motivated. ­Here are 
several ideas for working with staff from a development office:
•	 Show up to the development office informally, and see who is avail­
able to talk. Sometimes ­these informal conversations keep gift offi­
cers reminded about the library and may result in donations.
•	 Take a fund-­raiser to lunch or breakfast. Fund-­raising staff mem­
bers are used to being the ones who take ­others out for a meal, and 
they may appreciate it. Be sure to use this time to learn from the 
fund-­raiser. They are usually interested in teaching their craft.
•	 Become familiar with all the gift officers in the organ­ization and be 
available to help. Sometimes a business school gift officer (for 
instance) needs to find a purpose for a small gift; books or other mate­
rials that help business faculty and students could make the library 
the recipient of that gift.
•	 Offer the library’s databases for foundation staff research. Set up 
one-­to-­one training, or attend a staff meeting and do a training ses­
sion ­there.
•	 Offer library meeting rooms for foundation staff meetings. It never 
hurts to have fund-­raisers walk through the library and see students 
or public library users engaged with the library’s resources.
­Whether the fund-­raiser is a library director, staff member, or a foun­
dation staff member, ­there are some impor­tant traits that each person who 
is involved in development should have.

Giving the Gift
When a donor has committed to making a gift, the gift officer may sug­
gest pos­si­ble ways to recognize the donation and honor the contributor. Insti­
tutions ­will have drawn up guidelines for “naming opportunities” and the 
appropriate ones can be offered. In a building proj­ect, rooms, wings, and 
­whole buildings can be named as ways to recognize significant gifts. Also, 
endowments are often named for the donor. For construction gifts, librari­
ans work with gift officers to determine the value of specific spaces. ­Factors 
in valuing a room or other space include the number of square feet, location, 
and purpose. Officials from the parent institution (president, board of trust­
ees, or superintendent) approve this list of library spaces with dollar amounts. 
The list guides the gift officer when working with ­people who might donate 
large amounts. Once a donor specifies a large donation and would like to name 
a room or building, another approval is needed by the president or board of 
trustees. The reason for this second approval is that the administrators want 
to make sure that the gift is not given by someone who ­will embarrass the 
organ­ization.
Other ways of recognizing a smaller gift include a paper or electronic 
bookplate, a wall of donors, or listing in an annual report. In some libraries, 
furniture such as ser­vice desks may have a name plaque; ­others limit nam­
ing to rooms. It all depends on the guidelines set by the parent institution. 
In a small library, it may be pos­si­ble to put a plaque on chairs in a computer 
room or a set of ­table and chairs in a reference room.
Once details for a gift are worked out, a gift agreement is drafted and 
signed by both the donor and a representative of the library or the library’s 
parent organ­ization. Most library directors and gift officers try to word gift 
agreements, especially endowments, as broadly as pos­si­ble, so that the library 
director and ­future library directors ­will have flexibility, and ­because librar­
ies change, and a specific technology or need for a specific type of collection 
may be outmoded in ­future years.
Grants
What are grants? They are resources available from a variety of philan­
thropic and governmental organ­izations set up to give out money. ­There are 
hundreds of government agencies and private organ­izations, such as foun­
dations and trusts, with billions of dollars to give away. The challenge is

finding grants that match your need and then writing a successful grant to 
convince the funding organ­ization that your library or information center 
deserves the funding.
The granting organ­ization specifies in detail what one needs to do to 
receive that money. Although grants can be a ­great way to enhance a pro­
gram, purchase a collection or offer a ser­vice, they take time and a commit­
ment to be successful. The four types of grants are general operating support, 
program support, proj­ect support, and capital support. It is rare to find a 
grant for general operating support. Most grant agencies consider that the 
parent organ­ization for the library should be ­handling operating funding.
Program support helps a library create or expand an existing program 
such as a successful program to help the unemployed. Proj­ect support offers 
funding for a new proj­ect such as an afterschool program for ­children who 
have no caregivers at home. Capital support is used to renovate or build a 
new library or to fund new technology.15
Preliminary Steps
A quest for granting organ­izations begins with the library’s strategic 
plan. What areas of the plan could use some supplemental funding? In what 
areas would the library staff like to experiment or try out a ser­vice or pro­
gram? When a grant application comes from strategic planning, the basis 
for the need and the case ­will be more compelling. A good first step in look­
ing for grants is to develop a prioritized list of proj­ects and pos­si­ble approaches 
to accomplishing each goal. This is called a needs assessment. It should 
include needs from the perspective of the library and from users.16
Then the next step is to develop a rough bud­get for the proj­ect including 
estimates for staffing, equipment, and outside ser­vices.17 Also, the strategic 
plan may have had a component for assessment of the vari­ous goals. At this 
point it is a good idea to review how the library proj­ect’s success would be 
assessed. Once ­there is an assessment plan and a rough bud­get, it ­will be much 
easier to identify appropriate grant opportunities.
Sources for Grants Information
The best place to start is at home. Even within organ­izations ­there are 
sometimes opportunities for internal grants. For example if the university’s 
academic vice president’s office has funding to support new technology or ser­
vices for students or faculty, the library in that institution may be very suc­
cessful if the grant can show that the library serves a wide range of students 
and/or faculty. Then the application can make a compelling case. An in­ter­
est­ing example of internal grant writing is the success the University of Cen­
tral Florida has had in winning technology grants that ­were funded by 
student technology fees.18
For funding outside the parent organ­ization, the Foundation Center19 
publishes The Foundation Directory, which is available in print and online. 
This lists foundations in the United States with a certain amount of fund­
ing available and the type of proj­ects they are seeking, as well as how and 
when to submit an application.
The ALA Book of Library Grants also has an extensive listing of organ­
izations that make grants to libraries and grants related resources.20 For fed­
eral grants from U.S. government agencies, use the Web site Grants.gov​.­21 
Applications are in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP) and have very 

Library Fund-­Raising (Development) and Grant Writing  503
strict guidelines for how to make a proj­ect proposal. Other places to identify 
granting opportunities include state and local government or organ­izations, 
and descriptions of awards to libraries in library periodicals.
Next Steps
­After ­doing the research, and locating a potential grant source, the next 
step is to read the directions for what is required. For foundations, one may be 
able to write a letter of interest or even initiate the pro­cess online. It is always 
a good idea to contact the program officer listed in the contacts with any ques­
tions. Making this connection and building a relationship with the granting 
organ­ization can help determine ­whether this is an appropriate grant.
Some granting organ­izations offer workshops for prospective grant writ­
ers. ­These can be helpful both in terms of the technical issues of writing the 
grant and as an opportunity to meet ­people from the granting organ­ization.
Before beginning to write the grant application, it is crucial that the 
writer read the directions for submission very carefully. If the grant proposal 
is limited to a certain number of pages, double spaced using a certain size 
font, submitting an application with single spacing and a smaller font to try 
to use more words ­will not help. Not following directions may mean the grant 
is never read ­because of a technicality. The reason that ­these details ­matter 
is that some granting agencies receive so many applications that ruling out 
some on ­these seemingly minor criteria helps the agencies limit the number 
of readers they ­will need for grant applications. It is also a good idea, if pos­si­
ble, to read a successful grant from the organ­ization before tackling the job 
of writing one. Not all agencies can legally share information from a proposal 
­because some of the information is considered private. If you know of another 
library where they are successful in getting grants funded, they might be 
willing to share. The world of grant funding is a very competitive place, so you 
may have a ­little difficulty ­going outside your institution. Perhaps ­others in 
your institution who are successful at getting grants could offer advice.
Writing the Grant Application
A good way to write the proposal is to take the application and list out 
all the headings; use ­these headings as the outline for the proposal, then fill 
in the content ­under each heading. If ­there is no outline this is a standard 
structure:
•	 Abstract (250 words ­unless other­wise indicated)
•	 Prob­lem Statement
•	 Proj­ect Purpose
•	 Research Design or Work Plan (activities and timeline)
•	 Applicant Qualifications for fa­cil­i­ty and for staff
•	 Evaluation Plan, Expected Outcomes (what ­will happen once the 
goals have been reached)
•	 Bud­get (Summary and Justification)
•	 Sustainability
•	 Dissemination

504  Coordinating
The abstract is the first ­thing read by the agency and it must sell the 
proj­ect in ­those very few words. If the proj­ect does not seem to be appropri­
ate to the proposal or ­doesn’t seem ­viable, the reader is likely to turn to the 
next grant application.
The proj­ect purpose/problem statement must fit what the agency is 
expecting to have happen. How ­will you solve the prob­lem?
The applicant fa­cil­i­ty and staff means the requesting agency has the 
space and equipment to fulfill the proj­ect’s activities, as well as qualified staff 
to carry out the activities.
The evaluation section shows how you ­will mea­sure success: if or to what 
degree you have solved the prob­lem. If you cannot show how you can con­
firm your success, your proj­ect ­will not be funded.
The bud­get proposed must be adequate to pay for the proj­ect; it is best 
if it does not seem to be asking for more than would be needed. Sustainabil­
ity is a part of the funding. If you must hire additional staff to carry out the 
proj­ect, the sustainability ­factor ­will include how to keep the newly hired 
staff ­after the proj­ect is over so that it ­will not just collapse.
Most agencies who send out RFPs want to know how the proj­ect ­will be 
reported so that both the funding agency and the outcome of the proj­ect are 
reported to a wider audience. ­Whether you put a logo on the side of the book­
mobile or simply give a pre­sen­ta­tion at a conference, the way you dissemi­
nate the outcome of the proj­ect is very impor­tant.
It is crucial to follow the directions. Grants are scored on checklists, and 
many applicants fail ­because of small details such as not sending a copy of a 
document that was requested, or neglecting to include multiple copies in the 
packet. Key points to remember are to write the most compelling case using 
plain En­glish, leaving out jargon ­unless you are sure the readers are ­going 
to be other librarians, and have ­others proofread.
One final caution is to make sure you have the support of all the per­
sons who must sign off on this proposal and that they ­will be available to 
sign. Nothing is as sad as finding out that the financial officer who needed 
to sign the cover sheet left with the baseball team at 4:00 p.m. and your pro­
posal had to be postmarked by 5:00 p.m.
Katie Krueger suggests that the “Seven Deadly Grant-­Writing Sins” are:
•	 Submit a poor match
•	 Ignore directions
•	 Be a stranger
•	 Leave copyediting to spellcheck
•	 Submit a sloppy bud­get
•	 Miss the deadline
•	 Ask for the impossible22
Grants are reviewed, and the reviewers usually make comments. If 
the grant is not funded, ­these comments can be very helpful in planning 
­future proposals.23 It is not uncommon to have a grant rejected; ­there is 
much competition as financial resources erode. Grant writing and grant 
administration can be time consuming and ­labor intensive; however, they 
do have a role in successful libraries and information centers. The rewards 
include opportunities to experiment with ser­vices to users and pi­lot new 
programs.

Library Fund-­Raising (Development) and Grant Writing  505
Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Select a library and try to see it as an outsider. What does this library need? 
What are its biggest challenges? ­After you have made a list, draft areas where 
a donor could help. Note: it is unlikely for a donor to fund a new air conditioning 
system. Think about your list from the perspective of a donor. Now refine your 
list. Remember that donors like to make a difference.
2.	Take the top item from your list in #1 and draft a one-­page essay explaining why 
funding for this need would make a difference in the lives of the ­people who use 
the library.
3.	Select a library or a library proj­ect in which you believe. Draft an “elevator 
speech” (no more than three minutes) that you might give to a potential donor. 
Be sure to be positive and enthusiastic.
4.	Write a thank you note to a donor who has provided your library with $25,000 
for technology equipment. Be sure to be specific about how the money ­will be 
spent and what it ­will mean to library users.
Conclusion
Although some ­people recoil at the idea of fund-­raising or “begging” for 
money, most library directors recognize that supplemental funds raised for 
the library ­will make a significant difference to the ser­vices and collections 
the library can offer to its users. The commitment to fund-­raising and grant 
writing is significant, but the rewards are certainly worth the time and effort 
spent. If librarians believe in the mission of the library and have clear goals 
and a vision for the ­future, it is not difficult to share that information with 
­people who are interested and who have the capacity to help the library. 
Between 2006 and 2016, $2.9 billion in private philanthropy has been given 
to libraries.24
Discussion Questions
1.	 You are library staff members in a circulation department. Discuss how you 
might help the library in its fund-­raising efforts.
2.	Have you ever written a grant proposal? How did it go? Are you interested in 
writing one? What would be your topic?
3.	Practice your “elevator speech” to members of your group. Remember this eleva­
tor speech is a way to show your enthusiasm for an idea or proj­ect in a library. It 
is a good idea to have a well thought out argument for your idea, ­because you 
never know when you ­will have an opportunity to convince a library director or 
a donor to give you the funding. Critique and offer suggestions ­after each speech.
4.	If you had the capacity to give a large gift to a library, how would you want that 
money to be spent? Share your ideas with group members.

Section 7
Managing in the 
21st ­Century
We hope that ­every reader of this textbook has been considering ­whether or 
not she or he would like to be a man­ag­er. Libraries as institutions are in the 
midst of a vast transformation. Their ­future has yet to be determined, but 
one ­thing we know for certain is that the library of the ­future ­will be dif­fer­
ent from the libraries of the past and the pres­ent. To successfully navigate 
the journey from the pres­ent to the ­future ­will require the talent and inge­
nuity of talented library man­ag­ers.
A number of challenges confront individuals who move into management 
positions. Their perspective has to broaden. Instead of focusing only on their 
individual per­for­mance, man­ag­ers are responsible for helping other ­people 
do well on the job. New man­ag­ers must learn how to delegate and how to 
win the trust and re­spect of ­those who work for them. Becoming a man­ag­er 
also requires a change in roles. A man­ag­er has to assume an authoritative 
position and be ready to direct the actions of ­others.
Some ­will weigh the option of becoming a man­ag­er and decide that it is 
not something they want to do. However, for many individuals, management 
can be a fulfilling ­career option. It is a good choice for ­those who like to assume 
responsibility and enjoy working with ­people. Management is also a good option 
if individuals are comfortable with change and living with a certain level of 
ambiguity. Management positions require hard work, but in return they typ­
ically provide more pay and prestige, as well as a sense of personal achieve­
ment. This section ­will provide guidance to individuals preparing to become 
man­ag­ers and discuss both the challenges and the rewards associated with 
management in libraries and other information centers.

Man­ag­ers: 
The Next Generation
Chapter Takeaways
­After reading this chapter you should:
•	 Be familiar with some of the challenges that man­ag­ers face
•	 Be able to identify the three generations of workers in libraries ­today and 
their characteristics
•	 Know ways that individuals can acquire the skills needed to become man­ag­ers
•	 Be able to discuss the differences in the work that man­ag­ers and nonmanagers do
•	 Know why it is impor­tant that all professionals take charge of their own ­career 
development
Many students enrolled in Library and Information Science (LIS) programs 
do not think they would ever want to become man­ag­ers. Perhaps they do not 
want the responsibility or simply cannot imagine themselves becoming some­
one like Dilbert’s pointy-­haired boss. Nonetheless, most LIS gradu­ates ­will 
be man­ag­ers, if not in their first jobs then soon thereafter. Man­ag­ers are not 
born but made (and sometimes reluctantly at that), and libraries need a con­
stant stream of individuals who are willing and able to take on the respon­
sibilities of management.
As ­today’s baby-­boomer man­ag­ers reach retirement age, ­there is an even 
greater need and opportunity for a new generation of library man­ag­ers. This 
chapter ­will look first at how the decision to become a man­ag­er should be 
made, and then at how individuals who have deci­ded they want to manage 

512  Managing in the 21st ­Century
can acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to be a successful library 
man­ag­er.
Management in ­Today’s Libraries
Imagine Melvil Dewey, the library pioneer considered to be the ­father of 
modern American librarianship, waking from a 100-­year-­long Rip Van 
Winkle-­like sleep and suddenly being confronted with the 21st  ­century 
library. He would be astounded at some of the changes he encountered. Where 
is the card cata­log? What about the shelf list? What are ­these flat rectangu­
lar metal boxes with win­dows on them? What are ­those gadgets that ­people 
seem to have glued to their ears? Are they speaking to someone ­else or to 
themselves? What is all this talk of metadata and Dublin Core? OCLC and 
ARL LibQual+ mea­sure­ments? Outsourcing and customer satisfaction? Self-­
directed teams and flattened organ­izations? Change management and stra­
tegic planning? How could the print volumes of the Dewey Classification 
system ever have been replaced by something called WebDewey? What are 
library employees actually ­doing ­these days? They seem to be no longer sit­
ting ­behind desks and checking out books, but to be spending the bulk of 
their time on something called the Internet!
The transformation of libraries that has taken place over the past 
100 years would, at first, certainly leave Dewey bewildered, but Dewey was 
always a reformer. It seems likely that ­after he readjusted to the realities of 
the 21st ­century library, Dewey would begin to think like the man­ag­er he 
was and consider additional innovations that might allow ­these libraries to 
serve their users even better.
Stability and continuity are no longer characteristics that are associated 
with libraries or with library man­ag­ers’ responsibilities. The entire library 
profession is now best characterized by words such as change, discontinuity, 
and opportunity. Man­ag­ers are at the center of all that is happening in librar­
ies ­today. The only way libraries can preserve the good that has been built 
in the past while moving to a more challenging, vital mission is by innovat­
ing ­under the leadership of man­ag­ers who are willing to face the challenges 
confronting the 21st ­century library.
Management on the Job: Making the Leap into 
the Managerial Ranks
The transition from nonmanagement employee to man­ag­er can sometimes be difficult to 
make. Fortunately more experienced man­ag­ers can often offer helpful advice. Femi 
Cadmus, now Edward Cornell Law Librarian at the Cornell Law School, provided such 
guidance in an article she wrote a few years ago when she was associate law librarian 
for administration at the Yale Law School. In “Making the Leap to Management: Tips 
for the Aspiring and New Man­ag­er,” Cadmus writes that “a fortunate few are able to 
effortlessly transition from line position to management positions,” but that most need 
to plot the path to management to succeed. She describes the techniques that allowed 
her to pro­gress from being a circulation-­reference librarian to her first administrative 
position and provides tips on how to “avoid the unnecessary pitfalls of the unseasoned 
and untried man­ag­er.”1

Man­ag­ers  513
The challenge of managing is one ­thing that has remained the same from 
Dewey’s time to the pres­ent. The nature of the work being done; the types of 
technologies employed; the speed with which activities are accomplished; and 
the way workers interact, communicate, and provide ser­vice have all have 
been drastically altered. However, the man­ag­ers of the early 21st ­century still 
face many of the same challenges that confronted their pre­de­ces­sors: How 
does one motivate workers? How can a realistic bud­get be developed? How can 
the organ­ization be both more effective and more efficient? How can library 
organ­izations capitalize upon the fact that workers are better educated, more 
involved in decision-­making, and more committed to interacting with custom­
ers than ever before?
As discussed in chapter 2, managerial practices and procedures have 
evolved over the years, drawing upon the theories developed in the past to 
cope with developing trends. Management and the techniques used to prac­
tice it have changed, but the need for man­ag­ers remains constant. Many of 
the interpersonal and orga­nizational skills that made man­ag­ers successful 
According to Cadmus, the first question you need to address is ­whether you actually 
have the ability and desire to take on this new role. If you are not interested in utilizing 
your ­people skills, coaching and advising employees, and providing leadership, she sug­
gests you should not consider making the transition to man­ag­er. However, if you are 
interested, ­these are her suggestions:
•	 Develop a leadership/managerial mind-­set before you become a man­ag­er. She 
suggests that you become the “go to” person in your area of expertise and that 
you attain leadership skills by working on committees and volunteering.
•	 Proj­ect the right image and brand yourself. How are you perceived by your col­
leagues and peers, and what kind of reputation do you have in professional 
circles?
•	 Seek opportunities to practice being a man­ag­er. If you have no supervisory 
responsibilities in your pres­ent position, offer to be a backup for someone who 
does. Try to stretch yourself beyond your regular job and volunteer for proj­ects. 
Seek opportunities to collaborate and to correct any managerial deficiencies in 
areas such as bud­geting or accounting.
•	 Forge relationships and network to help move from a solo orientation to a team 
building mind-­set.
•	 Demonstrate integrity and establish credibility. Lead by example. Strive to cre­
ate a fair and equitable workplace.
•	 Develop your communication and interpersonal skills. Find the best ways to 
communicate within your organ­ization and practice sharing information in a 
timely and accurate fashion.
•	 Seek out a mentor who ­will give you candid advice about your strengths and 
weaknesses in addition to providing you with ­career advice.
As Cadmus says, the leap to becoming a man­ag­er is actually not so much a leap as 
an early recognition of a desire to serve as coach, leader, and man­ag­er. New librarians 
who recognize this early in their ­careers ­will be able to identify opportunities and plot 
their paths ­towards a successful ­future in management.

514  Managing in the 21st ­Century
in the past are still impor­tant for modern man­ag­ers. In addition, man­ag­ers 
in 21st ­century organ­izations require augmented skills and talents to lead 
new types of organ­izations.
Practice Your Skills
Interview a man­ag­er that you know and ask her or him questions that ­will help you 
gain insights into what man­ag­ers actually do, and what you should be ­doing now to 
prepare yourself to be a man­ag­er in the ­future. Start out by asking ­these questions:
•	 How did you become a man­ag­er?
•	 What are the most difficult parts of being a man­ag­er? The most rewarding?
•	 What have you learned from being a man­ag­er?
•	 How do you keep up-­to-­date?
•	 How do you make decisions? What difficult decisions have you had to make?
•	 What is your management style?
•	 What ­career advice can you offer me?
The New Generation of Man­ag­ers
A ­great deal has been written in the past few years about the graying of 
the library profession and the need to both recruit new librarians and to find 
replacements for many of ­today’s library man­ag­ers. The majority of ­people 
working and managing in libraries now are part of that very large age cohort 
of baby boomers born somewhere between 1946 and 1964. Many of the baby 
boomers are now beginning to retire, and ­these retirements ­will result in a 
growing need for new man­ag­ers. The boomers ­were followed by a much 
smaller cohort, often called generation X, born between 1965 and 1978. The 
newest entrants into the library workforce are the Millennials (also known 
as generation Y) who ­were born between 1979 and 2000. It is the generation 
X and Millennial librarians who ­will be the man­ag­ers of the libraries of the 
21st ­century.
The generational change in man­ag­ers has been slower in coming to 
libraries than expected. ­Because of economic conditions, many baby boomer 
librarians who had been expected to retire early in the first de­cade of the 
new ­century delayed retirement for some years. However, ­these librarians 
are now retiring, leaving a large number of managerial vacancies to be filled 
in all types of libraries. Stanley Wilder, library director at Louisiana State 
University, states that the member libraries of the Association of Research 
Libraries (ARL) are entering a period of high demand for library expertise. 
He predicts that the ARL libraries soon ­will be experiencing “a large and 
impor­tant youth movement, so large that it ­will have only one pre­de­ces­sor 
in our recent history, the mass recruitment of young baby boomers that accom­
panied the extraordinary growth of higher education in the 1960s.”2 The 
changes that Wilder sees occurring in ARL libraries are reflected in other 
types of libraries as the generational guard changes, and new man­ag­ers come 
to the fore, “injecting new experience, attitudes, and aspirations into our 

Man­ag­ers  515
libraries, keeping them relevant in a climate of fundamental change and 
uncertainty.”3
­Because libraries have existed for centuries, the workers in this type of 
institution have had past experience with successive waves of workers com­
ing into the library workforce, and certainly this is not the first time that 
­there have been librarians who need to interact with colleagues and patrons 
of dif­fer­ent generations.4 Although librarians are used to welcoming new 
workers, ­there is still a need for them to realize the unique characteristics 
of ­today’s entrants to the workplace. The newest librarians, the Millennials, 
are the first generation to come to the library workplace as digital natives 
and not digital immigrants. They have a preference for teamwork, experien­
tial activities, and using technology. They are strong in multitasking, goal 
orientation, positive attitudes, and a collaborative style. ­These librarians are 
likely to be technologically savvy, flexible, and assertive in their workplace 
and to “refuse to fit into the traditional bookish ste­reo­type of a librarian.”5
Talk About It
One genY librarian was quoted as saying:
While generational issues do need to be discussed and resolved, I am concerned 
about making too big an issue out of them. We do not want to draw a line between 
two generations of librarians and unintentionally alienate them from each other. 
Instead, we need to learn to work together as we seek to help librarianship evolve 
with the times to serve the needs of the public. Each librarian, new or experienced, 
old or young, brings valuable experiences, perspectives, skills, and ideas to the 
profession. We need to find a way to acknowledge ­those assets and put them to 
good use.6
How much do you think generational difference affect workers? What differences 
do you see in baby boomer, genX, and genY librarians? How can libraries be welcoming 
work environments for ­people of all generations?
It would be a ­mistake to focus too much attention on generational dif­
ferences, but man­ag­ers need to remember that younger librarians may have 
dif­fer­ent attitudes ­toward some of the traditional practices in the workplace 
and may have “changing expectations of work/life balance, a differing view 
on employer/employee loyalty, and a predisposition ­toward continuous chal­
lenges and lifelong learning.”7 As librarians begin to plan to make the suc­
cession from the man­ag­ers of ­today to ­those of the ­future, the characteristics 
and strengths of ­these new man­ag­ers must be taken into consideration.
Deciding to Become a Man­ag­er
In all types of libraries, the proportion of nonprofessional library employ­
ees and the use of teams continue to grow, and as a result, most professional 
librarians spend at least part of their time as man­ag­ers. It is common for 
new librarians to begin to manage on their first job. Thus, individuals who 
joined the profession so they could perform professional tasks soon find them­
selves man­ag­ers as well.

516  Managing in the 21st ­Century
The need for man­ag­ers at all levels ­will continue as bureaucratic orga­
nizational structures are replaced by flatter structures with team-­based 
management. During the course of their ­careers, almost all librarians ­will 
supervise ­others and engage in some management activities in teams or com­
mittees. However, what if you are interested in ­going beyond this level of 
management and want to be a mid-­ or upper-­level man­ag­er? Some readers 
already may have taken initial steps ­toward such a management ­career. They 
have been, perhaps, intrigued by the idea of managing an organ­ization or 
trying to make ­things work better. ­Others may be working in jobs in which 
the management approach has been poor and believe that they can initiate 
necessary improvements. ­Others are intrigued by the idea of putting into 
practice some of the theories and techniques discussed in this text. The work 
of a man­ag­er, though often difficult, is never dull and is usually rewarding.
Unfortunately, some ­people who would be excellent man­ag­ers never con­
sider the possibility of moving into a management position. Librarianship, 
like many other ser­vice professions, attracts individuals who often do not 
have a strong desire to manage. In fact, many enter the profession with a 
strong aversion to being a man­ag­er. In librarianship, professionals usually 
enjoy the tasks traditionally associated with the profession: collecting, organ­
izing, preserving, and disseminating information. ­People who are drawn to 
the library profession become librarians ­because they like to work with infor­
mation and ­people.
In addition, many librarians, especially ­women, lack confidence that they 
would be successful as man­ag­ers and, thus, never apply for managerial posi­
tions. Research has shown that ­there is a large difference between men and 
­women in term of confidence. Females, compared to males, typically are less 
confident of their abilities. They do not consider themselves as ready for pro­
motions as their male colleagues, predict they ­will do worse on tests, and, in 
general, underestimate their abilities.8 For example a professor in the School 
of Management at Yale, states that although all of her students are highly 
intelligent, the females have a lack of belief in themselves. “­There’s just a 
natu­ral sort of feeling among the ­women that they ­will not get a prestigious 
job, so why bother trying,” she explained. “Or they think that they are not 
totally competent in the area, so ­they’re not ­going to go for it.” As a result, 
female students tend to opt out.”9 In a similar manner, underrepresented 
minorities often do not feel confident about their abilities to succeed as man­
ag­ers.10 Lack of confidence is not the only reason that ­women and minorities 
are underrepresented, especially in upper managerial ranks, but it often 
keeps very competent ­people who would be good man­ag­ers from pursuing 
higher positions within an organ­ization.
Becoming a man­ag­er can be a rewarding ­career choice, but it is not the 
right one for every­one. ­There is a commonly accepted belief that success can 
only be mea­sured by moving up the ladder, assuming more responsibility, 
receiving higher pay and ultimately becoming a top man­ag­er. However, 
moving into the managerial ranks is the right path for many but not for all. 
Management requires specific personality traits and skills that some ­people 
do not possess. It also requires a dedication to a task that some ­people do 
not find congenial.
Before deciding to pursue a managerial ­career, an individual should 
decide ­whether he or she wants to assume the responsibilities of manage­
ment. Individuals vary greatly in what they hope to achieve from their ­career. 
Edgar Schein has developed one of the best-­validated and most commonly 
used models for discovering ­career interests. His so-­called ­career anchors are 
composed of a combination of motivation, attitude, and values. According to 

Man­ag­ers  517
Schein, ­these anchors are formed early in life, and they both guide and con­
strain an individual throughout an entire ­career. ­These anchors are the 
­career values an individual would not give up even in the face of difficulty.11 
One of Schein’s ­career anchors is general managerial competence. ­People who 
have that as their anchor have the characteristics shown in ­table 21.1. When 
an individual’s ­career anchor is general managerial competence, most likely 
that person ­will enjoy management and be a success at it. However, as Schein 
recognizes, the clear-­cut distinction between man­ag­ers and other employees 
that once existed is becoming much more blurred. As he writes:
General management, like leadership, may cease to be a role or 
a position, and ­will become more of a pro­cess skill that ­will be 
needed in all kinds of roles and positions. This skill may come to 
be distributed among the members of a group or team rather 
than residing in a single individual. Every­one ­will be expected to 
become somewhat competent at management and leadership.12
Henry Mintzberg, in a seminal study, examined the work that man­ag­ers 
do.13 He actually sat in the offices of man­ag­ers, followed them around, and 
recorded their activities. He found that man­ag­ers work at demanding activ­
ities that are characterized by their variety, fragmentation, and brevity. In 
other words, man­ag­ers rarely have long stretches of uninterrupted time to 
spend on any one task. They si­mul­ta­neously work at a variety of tasks, each 
for a short period of time. Their days are fragmented, and ­there are many 
demands on their time. A man­ag­er also performs a ­great deal of work at a very 
fast pace. For most man­ag­ers, ­there is usually more to be done than ­there is 
time in which to do it.
Man­ag­ers are required to assume a ­great deal of responsibility. They 
are responsible for other ­people, their actions, and the success or failure of 
the enterprise. Man­ag­ers are accountable, at vari­ous levels, for the operation 
of a team, a unit, a division, or a ­whole organ­ization. Often, they are in charge 
not only of operations but also of facilities. As a result of this heavy workload, 
they often feel stress. Managerial responsibilities often become a central 
focus in a man­ag­er’s life. With all the negative attributes associated with 
managerial positions, many ­people won­der, why anyone would want to be a 
man­ag­er.
Although ­there are many challenges and difficulties associated with 
management, most competent man­ag­ers enjoy their jobs. They like the sense

of autonomy and the ability to set their own agendas and are proud of being 
able to make a difference and of performing well. They are challenged by the 
diversity of the work they do and the diversity of the ­people—­staff, custom­
ers, and other stakeholders—­with whom they work. Most man­ag­ers appre­
ciate the higher salaries that accompany managerial positions. Man­ag­ers are 
rewarded monetarily ­because they are accountable for the actions of ­others 
and for the achievement of orga­nizational objectives.
The decision about ­whether to pursue a managerial ­career deserves 
thoughtful consideration by all new professionals. Learning to be a man­ag­er 
in a rapidly changing era involves learning about a ­great many ­things. Many 
management skills are developed only through long practice. Through con­
certed effort, librarians can improve their managerial skills as they acquire 
experience and advance in management positions. However, it takes more 
than just time to become a good man­ag­er.
Steps to Becoming a Man­ag­er
If you have thought about your options and deci­ded that you think you 
would like to explore the possibility of becoming an upper-­level man­ag­er, 
what should you do to make this happen? Getting ahead in management fre­
quently seems to be affected by serendipity. Often, someone just seems to be 
in the right place at the right time and then moves up the ­career ladder 
­because of it. Although serendipity and luck sometimes play a role in becom­
ing a man­ag­er, it is wise to plan and to prepare for such a move from the start 
of one’s ­career to be sure to be ready when the opportunity pres­ents itself.
If you are not yet a man­ag­er but would like to be one, the first step is to 
do the best you can at the job you have now. Even entry-­level jobs in librar­
ies usually pres­ent at least some opportunity to work autonomously and to 
exercise creativity. Volunteer to lead proj­ects, especially ­those that cross 
departments or involve working with ­people from other areas of the organ­
ization. Take advantage of any staff development opportunities that ­will 
allow you to expand your knowledge of your area of the organ­ization or ­others. 
Join professional organ­izations and attend conferences if pos­si­ble. Network­
ing with colleagues outside of your organ­ization ­will increase your visibility 
and marketability. In addition, be sure that your man­ag­er knows you are 
interested in moving up in the organ­ization in the ­future. Although you may 
assume that your boss knows this, be explicit about it. As mentioned earlier, 
some ­people do not aspire to management and your man­ag­er may assume 
that you are one of them.
One ­career strategist describes what she called “the good student” syn­
drome. Many employees use the same be­hav­iors on the job that worked for 
them in school; they do their best and then wait passively for recognition, 
approval, and promotion. In the workplace, this can lead to frustration when 
the expected recognition does not come, and employees often become resent­
ful when ­others who are newer in the organ­ization or seem to have done less 
are promoted and given new opportunities.14 The lack of self-­confidence that 
was discussed earlier can lead to individuals not wanting to put themselves 
forward, but not indicating a desire to be considered for a promotion ­will 
almost inevitably lead to your being overlooked.
In ­every position you hold, begin to think about the skills and the expe­
riences you ­will need to qualify you for the type of position you desire next. 
How can they be acquired? Once again, you can enlist your man­ag­er’s help 
in finding ways to acquire ­those skills and experiences. You should also be 
looking for opportunities on your own. Are ­there opportunities for you to 

Man­ag­ers  519
acquire management experience on committees ­either in the library or in a 
professional organ­ization? Are ­there courses or workshops that you could 
take to increase your capabilities? More information about obtaining skills 
needed for management is provided ­later in this chapter. Mentoring, which 
was discussed in chapter 13, is also helpful if a person wants to become a 
man­ag­er. Mentors help protégés advance in an organ­ization by informally 
teaching them about the job and the organ­ization. In addition, as the proté­
gés begin to ascend the orga­nizational ladder, mentors often sponsor them 
and use their connections to help them advance ­either in their pres­ent organ­
ization or in another one.
Becoming a man­ag­er is rarely accomplished in just one easy step. Although 
a few new gradu­ates do begin their ­careers as directors of small libraries or 
information ser­vice units, most managers-­in-­training have the opportunity 
to learn about management through a series of positions and promotions.
As has been discussed before, in most large libraries, management is 
divided into three levels: first-­line man­ag­ers (often called supervisors), ­middle 
man­ag­ers, and top-­level man­ag­ers. Many recent gradu­ates immediately 
become supervisors. They are assigned responsibility for supervising a group 
of support staff and directing specific ser­vices or procedures. If a newly quali­
fied professional begins work in a very small library, he or she may be the 
only professional and, thus, becomes the top man­ag­er. In ­these cases, the new 
man­ag­er ­will need to work with other man­ag­ers in the larger organ­ization of 
which the library is a part to develop the expertise needed in the job. How­
ever, more frequently, new gradu­ates go to work in larger organ­izations, in 
which they have a chance to learn management skills from their supervisors 
before they themselves become ­either middle-­ or top-­level man­ag­ers.
New man­ag­ers inevitably face some prob­lems in adjusting to their new 
roles. If they have been promoted from within, they may find themselves in 
the position of managing ­people who ­were previously their peers. Many find 
making this transition difficult, ­because the former relationship ­will have 
to be modified. The new man­ag­er is now responsible for assigning responsi­
bilities, assessing per­for­mances, and often determining pay increases. 
Although the new man­ag­er can certainly remain friends with former peers, 
some distance has to be established so he or she can give directions, resolve 
conflicts, and make decisions for the group. Another difficulty some new man­
ag­ers face is in supervising employees who are older and have more years of 
experience than they have. It is not uncommon for new man­ag­ers to super­
vise employees from their parents’ generation. Once again, the generational 
differences mentioned earlier have to be considered. It is impor­tant for any 
new man­ag­er to eliminate any ste­reo­types he or she may have about older 
employees. They are individuals and need to be treated as such. Never forget 
they have a wealth of knowledge and experience that they have gained through­
out their ­careers. They have a familiarity with the orga­nizational culture, 
and their expertise can often help a new man­ag­er avoid costly ­mistakes. A 
younger man­ag­er who treats older employees with re­spect ­will often discover 
they are a ­great source of knowledge.
Practice Your Skills
You have worked in the reference/user instructor department of the Statesville Univer­
sity library since you graduated from your LIS program five years ago. It has been a 
­great job. ­There are eight other professional librarians working in the department and 

520  Managing in the 21st ­Century
Perhaps the most impor­tant ­thing for new man­ag­ers to remember is that 
some ­mistakes are inevitable. It takes time to learn to be a good man­ag­er. It 
is especially impor­tant for new man­ag­ers to call upon mentors and more 
experienced man­ag­ers to help provide strategies and advice.
Skills Needed by Man­ag­ers
Man­ag­ers need dif­fer­ent sets of skills at dif­fer­ent levels of management. 
The specific skills needed by most man­ag­ers ­were discussed in chapter 1. 
Many diverse skills, including conceptual, ­human relations, and technical 
skills, are required of man­ag­ers. A recent survey in Library Journal reported 
the skills that academic and public library directors expect to need in new 
librarians in the next 20 years.15
Although ­these are skills the respondents would like all new librarians 
to have, many of ­these skills are especially impor­tant to man­ag­ers. The 
ability to advocate for an institution, to market its programs, and to provide 
creativity and leadership are key managerial tasks. Most ­people receiving 
their LIS degrees gradu­ate with a rudimentary knowledge of many of ­those 
skills. Some they may have acquired from past job experience; ­others they 
have learned during their MLIS program; and still ­others, including creativ­
ity and ­people skills, they ­either ­were born with or have acquired in their 
life experience. However, few individuals gradu­ate knowing enough to become 
a top-­level man­ag­er.
Joan Giesecke and Beth MacNeill, two academic library directors, state 
that man­ag­ers and supervisors need to develop a variety of competencies 
beyond technical expertise to be successful. In their opinion, the “soft skills” 
of ­human resources, teambuilding, and leadership are the foundation of suc­
cess for all man­ag­ers. The skills they think are especially impor­tant are:
•	 Interpersonal skills
•	 Communication skills
•	 Prob­lem solving and decision making
•	 Initiative
you like them all. Five of them are about your age, and the six of you hang out a lot out­
side of work. You share many interests and are good friends. The other two librarians 
are near retirement age. They both are very pleasant and very competent, but they are 
involved with ­family and community interests, and you rarely see them when you are 
not working. Your department head surprised every­one last week by announcing that 
she is leaving for her dream job in about a month. This morning, the library director 
called you in and asked if you would like to become the next department head. You are 
intrigued by the possibility ­because you have always had some interest in management, 
but at the same time you are a bit overwhelmed. The department head is in charge of 
scheduling, assigning responsibilities, disciplinary procedures, and performing all the 
personnel evaluations. You have no experience in management and won­der what it would 
be like to be in charge of the workers in your department. You have told the director you 
want a few days to think the offer over.
What do you think your biggest challenges might be? How could you meet ­these 
challenges and be successful? What, if anything, might you ask the director to do to 
support you in this new position?

Man­ag­ers  521
•	 Del­e­ga­tion
•	 Time management
•	 Meetings management
•	 Customer Ser­vice.16
Giesecke and MacNeill think that ­these “soft skills” are often more 
impor­tant to man­ag­ers than possessing technical competence. In addition, 
­there is a need for all man­ag­ers to have some fa­cil­i­ty with numbers. Elisa­
beth Doucett, director of Curtis Memorial Library in Brunswick, Maine, pro­
poses that the following “basic facts and figures for librarians” tools are 
essential for ­every librarian. Among the basic skills she recommends are: 
(1) proficiency with Microsoft Excel; (2) knowing how to calculate percent­
age difference; (3) being familiar with several mea­sure­ments of use; (4) know­
ing the basics of a library bud­get; and (5) understanding a profit and loss 
statement, including how to read a balance sheet.17
In addition, becoming familiar with some basic managerial tools ­will 
help you become a successful man­ag­er. Patricia Katopol warns that:
[I]f you ­can’t do a ­simple SWOT analy­sis (strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats) of your environment, if you ­don’t know 
how to bud­get, if you ­can’t make the case for why your department, 
your team, or your library should lay claim to the limited resources 
available to it, you ­will not get them. Someone ­else ­will and they 
­will be perceived as promotable and management material.18
­There are dozens of other sources available that provide lists of the 
knowledge and skills needed by new man­ag­ers. Not surprisingly ­there is a 
lot of overlap in the lists. Experienced man­ag­ers all realize that the first 
transition from being a nonmanagerial employee to being a man­ag­er is the 
most difficult. Instead of being told what to do, suddenly the new man­ag­er 
is in charge of telling ­others what to do. A new man­ag­er is forced to embrace 
a new perspective and view the workplace through a dif­fer­ent lens; no longer 
is success mea­sured by what he or she can achieve alone, but by what the 
man­ag­er can achieve through other ­people. Perhaps one of the most impor­
tant lessons for new man­ag­ers to remember is not to be afraid to ask for 
help. ­There are many ­people who are willing to provide the help if they are 
asked. No one expects a new man­ag­er to know every­thing the first day on 
the job.
Acquiring Management Skills
If you are interested in acquiring more management skills, where can 
you go to get that knowledge? If you are already a man­ag­er, how can you 
improve your management skills and keep up-­to-­date with all the changes 
in the field?
The first opportunity to learn skills related to management often comes 
as part of the educational preparation for entering the profession. Manage­
ment is taught as a part of the curriculum in almost all LIS programs. Most 
of the schools offer more than one management course, including such offer­
ings as ­human resources management, strategic planning, marketing, and 
financial management. The same types of courses are offered not only in 
North Amer­i­ca but also in schools across the world.

522  Managing in the 21st ­Century
Talk About It
Think about the best man­ag­er that you ever had, and then think about the worst one. 
What are three ­things you learned from each? How do man­ag­ers shape the be­hav­ior of 
the ­future man­ag­ers who have worked for them?
Although all LIS schools offer management courses, ­there are some prob­
lems associated with teaching management in programs designed for pre­
paring individuals for their first professional position. One is the short length 
of most programs. In the United States, where the MLIS is the standard 
entry-­level degree, most programs are still only about a year in duration. In 
that year, students have to master the skills related to librarianship, and the 
number of ­these skills has grown as the knowledge base of the field has 
expanded. In addition to the new skills required by the digital revolution, LIS 
students must still master the traditional skills of librarianship, such as refer­
ence, collection development, and cata­loging and classification. ­Because many 
students do not see themselves becoming man­ag­ers, they often do not take 
the management courses that are offered ­unless they are required to do so.
On-­the-­Job Opportunities
When newly minted librarians begin their professional ­careers, it is then 
that they see the importance of management. Although a few gradu­ates of 
LIS schools get jobs as directors of small libraries, most gradu­ates go to work 
in larger organ­izations in which they have a chance to learn some manage­
ment skills before they themselves become middle-­ or top-­level man­ag­ers. All 
man­ag­ers learn from ­doing. Often ­mistakes are made when a person is learn­
ing to manage, but making ­mistakes is one way of learning. New man­ag­ers 
also learn from other man­ag­ers in the organ­ization and from professional 
colleagues outside the organ­ization, through mentoring and networking. 
Both observation and on-­the-­job training are impor­tant aspects of develop­
ment as a man­ag­er. One can acquire skills from other man­ag­ers who are 
higher in the management structure as well as from ­those who are on the 
same level. New man­ag­ers, also, often encounter inefficient man­ag­ers and 
are able to pick up ways not to do ­things.
Continuing Education
On-­the-­job training is rarely enough. Continuing education is an impor­
tant part of ­every professional’s ­career development. Staff development 
classes are provided in most large libraries to teach the management skills 
that are needed by many of the man­ag­ers within the organ­ization. Library 
associations, both state and national, provide other opportunities to learn 
management skills. ­These organ­izations often provide preconferences or 
institutes on specific managerial topics. Library consortia often contract for 
classes to be given for their members; regional networks such as Lyrasis pro­
vide courses on an ongoing basis. Many state libraries provide workshops and 
online training opportunities for librarians in their states. In addition, many 
library-­related organ­izations provide continuing-­education courses. LIS pro­
grams frequently provide continuing-­education opportunities. Increasingly, 
vari­ous types of classes are offered online so that man­ag­ers can learn new 
techniques and skills without leaving home. Webinars have become very 

Man­ag­ers  523
popu­lar as a means of providing continuing education. As a result of the 
interest in developing leaders, a number of leadership institutes at both 
the state level and the national level have been established.
It is impor­tant to remember that getting an MLIS degree is just a begin­
ning. As Elisabeth Doucett advises new librarians:
From your first day on your first job as a librarian, you should 
take ownership of your own career. That means that you should 
actively seek and pursue opportunities for training . . . ​If your 
library can’t afford to send you to a seminar or training session, 
then find a way to get training on your own. But don’t make the 
mistake of assuming that once you received your master’s degree in 
library science you are done with your education.19
Therefore, aspiring library man­ag­ers can improve their knowledge by 
attending a wide variety of educational offerings. Sometimes man­ag­ers, hav­
ing recognized that to manage large and complex organ­izations requires 
advanced management expertise, want a more systematic immersion in the 
discipline, and so they decide to get an additional degree in the field of man­
agement. ­Today, many library directors have MBA degrees, whereas ­others 
have master’s degrees in public administration.
One impor­tant component in ­every man­ag­er’s continuing-­education port­
folio must be keeping up-­to-­date by reading both LIS management lit­er­a­
ture and management lit­er­a­ture in general. Most librarians have easy access 
to both types of lit­er­a­ture, which can provide a quick way to stay abreast of 
current trends. In addition, ­there is a wealth of management information 
available at one’s fingertips through the Internet. Indeed, ­there is so much 
material available online, that individuals are required to use their good 
judgment about its accuracy, timeliness, and authenticity.
As was discussed in chapter 13, ­career development is the responsibility 
of each professional. Organ­izations have a role to play in helping their employ­
ees grow and develop, but the ultimate responsibility to shape a ­career belongs 
to each individual. As Peter Drucker noted, even ­today remarkably few Amer­
icans are prepared to select jobs for themselves. “When you ask, ‘Do you know 
what you are good at? Do you know your limitations?’ they look at you with 
a blank stare. Or they often respond in terms of subject knowledge, which is 
the wrong answer.”20 In a similar vein, Reid Hoffman, one of the found­ers of 
LinkedIn, argues that ­today’s professionals need a new mind-­set and skill set 
to compete. He states, “The old paradigm of climbing up a single ­career ladder 
is dead and gone. No ­career is a sure ­thing anymore . . . ​Therefore, you should 
approach ­career strategy the same way an entrepreneur approaches starting 
a business.”21 Library and information ser­vices man­ag­ers in the 21st ­century 
need to develop their own portfolios of management skills that ­will permit 
them the flexibility to respond to a rapidly changing environment.
Practice Your Skills
Peter Drucker, one of the “gurus” of modern management provided some excellent advice 
for modern knowledge workers. According to Drucker:
We live in an age of unpre­ce­dented opportunity: If ­you’ve got ambition and smarts, 
you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started 

524  Managing in the 21st ­Century
Opportunities for good man­ag­ers are unlimited. Many libraries are com­
peting for a limited number of talented man­ag­ers of the 21st ­century. ­Those 
professionals have numerous opportunities to assume new, more challeng­
ing positions. They are able to advance in their managerial positions to 
achieve their professional goals. They have learned to network effectively, to 
think strategically, and to manage skillfully. Consequently, they are given 
opportunities to advance through the managerial ranks and to assume top 
positions at leading institutions. If questioned about their ­career goals, it is 
likely that most would describe a plan, a strategy, with at least a 10-­year 
timeline. They have identified and developed the skills necessary to succeed 
in the pres­ent position while developing strategies for the next one.
Conclusion
Good ­people in management positions are vital to the existence of library 
and information ser­vice organ­izations. The authors hope that ­every reader 
of this textbook considers the option of becoming a man­ag­er and begins to 
prepare for that ­future. Management in successful organ­izations is a pro­
cess that involves many individuals, from top-­level man­ag­ers to team lead­
ers, and all man­ag­ers play a key role in an organ­ization’s success.
This chapter began by imagining Melvil Dewey awakening from a long 
nap, and it ­will close with him. As a man­ag­er, Melvil Dewey had a ­great 
impact on the libraries of his day. ­Because of his efforts, the library profes­
sion came of age in the late 19th ­century.23 Man­ag­ers such as Dewey can 
have a ­great influence on their individual organ­izations and on their profes­
sions as a ­whole.
Due to the efforts of man­ag­ers such as Dewey, our libraries and infor­
mation agencies have had an organ­ization and a structure that has worked 
well in the past. However, at the pres­ent time, man­ag­ers in ­these institu­
tions are in the pro­cess of making a major transition from paper-­based to 
digitally based organ­izations. They are confronting increasing competition 
and new challenges. Library man­ag­ers are needed to prepare libraries to 
meet the demands of tomorrow. To ensure their continued existence, librar­
ies need man­ag­ers who ­will be the Melvil Deweys of the 21st ­century. We 
hope that the readers of this book ­will be ­those man­ag­ers.
out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies ­today ­aren’t manag­
ing their employees’ ­careers; knowledge workers must, effectively, be their own 
chief executive officers. It’s up to you to carve out your place, to know when to 
change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life 
that may span some 50 years. To do ­those ­things well, you’ll need to cultivate a 
deep understanding of yourself—­not only what your strengths and weaknesses 
are but also how you learn, how you work with ­others, what your values are, and 
where you can make the greatest contribution. ­Because only when you operate 
from strengths can you achieve true excellence.22
Find a quiet time and a quiet spot, sit down, and think about the ­factors Drucker 
suggests are impor­tant to understanding yourself. Where you would like to be in 
10 years? Or 20 years? At the end of your ­career? Do you see yourself as the CEO in 
charge of your own ­career? How can you achieve the type of ­career that you envision?

Practice What You Have Learned
1.	 Lou has been a reference librarian since she graduated from library school almost 
40 years ago. She is planning to retire next month. One of her friends asked 
her, “Lou, did you ever think of ­doing anything besides being a reference librar­
ian?” Lou replied that she had always enjoyed her position, but that she had 
once considered becoming a man­ag­er when the head of the reference depart­
ment position was available and the director asked her to consider applying for 
it. “What happened?” asked her friend. “Well,” said Lou, “I deci­ded not to apply 
­after all. I thought about it, but deci­ded it was more than I wanted to take on. 
You know that the head of the department has to do the per­for­mance apprais­
als of every­one who works in the department. The head also has to ­handle any 
disciplinary situations. The more I thought about it, the more I knew that I just 
­didn’t want the responsibility. What if someone ­were ­doing a bad job? I would 
be the one who would have to write the negative appraisal. What if an employee 
­were consistently late and I had to issue the reprimand? I deci­ded it ­wasn’t worth 
the hassle.”
Certain challenges and hassles are associated with being a man­ag­er. 
Are ­there specific ­things that man­ag­ers do that you would dislike ­doing? Can 
you think of other aspects of a man­ag­er’s job that you would enjoy? Would the 
advantages of being a man­ag­er outweigh the disadvantages for you?
2.	Understanding yourself is critical when you are choosing what ­career path to 
take. Some ­people have a very clear idea of what they want to get out of their 
­careers, while ­others have ­either a vague idea or perhaps no idea at all. If you 
have never taken a ­career compatibility test, see if you can take one. Your univer­
sity’s testing center may offer you the chance to be tested professionally. If you do 
not have access to a professional administered test, ­there are many ­free ­career 
self-­assessment tools on the Internet. Try one or two. What insights did you get 
from the results of ­these tests? Based on what you learned, have you chosen the 
right ­career? Do the results indicate that you would enjoy becoming a man­ag­er?
3.	Duckettville is a medium-­sized town in the heart of Tennessee. Due to its prox­
imity to a fast growing city, Duckettville is experiencing steady population 
growth. The feel of the town was one of the attractions for Meredith, the new 
assistant man­ag­er of the Duckettville Library. ­After having lived, worked, and 
studied in the New ­England area, when Meredith saw the job posting for this 
position a year ago, she was excited about the opportunity to experience life in 
a dif­fer­ent part of the United States, and therefore deci­ded to apply for her first 
managerial position. However, ­after a year, the excitement had faded, and she 
was wondering why she remained.
It was a bit surprising to Meredith that she was even selected to fill the 
position of assistant man­ag­er. Although her interview with Pam, the director, 
went well, Meredith thought that she did not have the necessary experience. 
Pam explained that it was Meredith’s hard working, dependable, and creative 
attitude that led to her hiring. Soon ­after she arrived, Meredith was asked to 
supervise all of the library’s full-­time employees. She was constantly rushing 
to get her work accomplished, and never felt as though she was caught up. Mer­
edith has reached a point of burnout. She is beginning to resent Pam ­because 
of the discrepancies she sees in how much work they perform.
Meredith has assumed a managerial position but feels that she is in over 
her head. What is Pam’s motive in acting as she does? If you ­were Meredith, what 
would you do?

Discussion Questions
1.	 Robert Quinn wrote:
As one moves up the orga­nizational ladder, ­matters become less tangible 
and less predictable. A primary characteristic of managing, particularly 
at higher levels, is the confrontation of change, ambiguity, and contradic­
tion. Man­ag­ers spend much of their time living in fields of perceived 
tensions. They are constantly forced to make trade-­offs, and often find 
that ­there are no right answers. The higher one goes in an organ­ization, 
the more exaggerated this phenomenon becomes.24
In the quotation above, Robert Quinn points out some of the challenges 
facing top man­ag­ers. Why is it so difficult to function in an ambiguous environ­
ment? How do man­ag­ers learn to cope with such conditions? How do you feel 
that you would do in circumstances such as ­these?
2.	Joseph Berk and Susan Berk note that:
Mentoring is a complex subject. ­There are advantages and disadvantages 
to the practice. Obviously, ­those in the organ­ization who ­don’t have 
mentors may resent ­those who do. . . . ​[I]f one wishes to continue to 
advance, developing a network that includes a mentor greatly enhances 
the probability of success.25
As the Berks state, ­there are both advantages and disadvantage to men­
toring. What do you think are the primary advantages and disadvantages? If 
­those who ­don’t have mentors resent ­those who do, is ­there a way for organ­izations 
to provide mentoring for all?
3.	Assume that you have just been appointed to your first managerial position. 
What ­things would you do on your first day? Make a list of your five top priori­
ties and compare them with the top priorities of one or more colleagues.
4.	Diane Brady pointed out:
Man­ag­ers looking to get ahead in the 21st ­century ­will need a completely 
dif­fer­ent set of tools than their counter­parts in the last ­century . . . ​With 
change the only constant, man­ag­ers ­will have to be far more entrepre­
neurial. Anyone inclined to wait for ­orders or follow established 
4.	Jennifer is a new, genY man­ag­er who always has her smartphone or laptop 
with her; she is most comfortable communicating electronically in all situa­
tions. She supervises a group of 10 employees of vari­ous ages and years of expe­
rience. Some of the individuals she supervises have begun to complain about 
her management style. They say they never see her, and that she ­doesn’t seem 
to know anything about them or their jobs.
If you ­were Jennifer’s supervisor, what would you suggest she do to become 
a more effective supervisor?

procedures ­will simply be lost. While the Industrial Age put a premium 
on machines and proprietary systems, the Information Age relies on the 
ideas and skills that reside in workers’ heads. With technology, products, 
markets, and customers all in flux, the corporation ­will need group-­
oriented leaders who can thrive amid uncertainty.26
Brady thinks that 21st ­century man­ag­ers ­will need dif­fer­ent tools from 
­those used in the past. Why ­will ­these tools be necessary? What skills do you 
think ­will be most necessary for 21st ­century man­ag­ers?
