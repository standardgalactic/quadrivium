PREFACE 
 
 
This book presents current research in the field of applied mathematics. Topics discussed 
include, Linear Systems, the Discrete Davey-Stewart System, Kukles Systems, nonlinear 
equations, differential equations, and many other advanced and relevant topics in 
mathematics. 
In Chapter 1, center conditions, the bifurcation of limit cycles and local bifurcation of 
critical periods for a quintic Kukles system are studied. The first 8 singular point values of the 
origin are obtained by using computer algebra system. The authors give the conditions for the 
origin to be a center and prove that the system has 8 limit cycles bifurcated from the origin. 
By the computations of period constants, the weak center conditions and local critical periods 
of the origin are also obtained. 
In chemical graphs, the vertices of the graph correspond to the atoms of the molecule, 
and the edges represent the chemical bonds. Chemical graph theory is a branch of 
mathematical chemistry which applies graph theory to mathematical modeling of chemical 
phenomena. Among topological descriptors connectivity indices are very important and they 
have a prominent role in chemistry. 
In Chapter 2 the authors focus on two connectivity indices and compute Randić 
connectivity and Sum-connectivity indices for Capra-designed of Cycles. 
In Chapter 3, an extended homogeneous balance method is used for an analytical study 
on time-dependent coefficient modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. Firstly, an 
auto-Bäcklund transformation of the variable coefficient mKdV equation are obtained by the 
extended homogeneous balance method. Then, a symmetry and two conservation laws of the 
variable coefficient mKdV equation are given. At last, three types of similarity reductions for 
the variable coefficient mKdV equation are obtained. Some soliton-like solutions are also 
obtained from the Bäcklund transformation and similarity reduction obtained above. 
In Chapter 4, the authors produce a pfaffian version of the discrete Davey-Stewartson 
system through the Hirota and Ohta's pfaffianization procedure. As a result, a new coupled 
semi-discrete integrable system is derived. The authors observe how the resulting discrete 
integrable system reduces to the pfaffian identities by presenting Wronski-type pfaffian and 
Gramm-type pfaffian solutions. 
Asymptotic expansions of one oscillatory double integral is discussed in Chapter 5. For 
large parameter, the asymptotic expansions of the integral is obtained by means of the high-
dimensional asymptotic method.

An iterative method called ALP based on combination of line projection and accumulated 
projection techniques is introduced in Chapter 6. This method does not belong to the so-called 
extended Krylov subspace method since it does not construct any Krylov subspace to get 
approximations. Numerical experiments are done to demonstrate the efficiency of the 
proposed algorithm and comparison are made between GMRES and ALP. It is observed that 
in some cases ALP behaviors much better than GMRES.

in which degree of a 
vertex v denoted by dv. In Chapter 7 the authors compute these topological indices for a type 
of Nanotubes that namly: “Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube VAC5C7(S)”. 
In Chapter 8, the exact solutions of the derivation nonlinear Kawahara equation are 
investigated using the double function method, which is composed by the polynomials of two 
functions f and g. As one can see that more general traveling wave solutions are obtained. 
This approach is also applicable to other nonlinear evolution equations. 
Chapter 9 introduces a domination polynomial of a graph G. The domination polynomial 
of a graph G of order n is the polynomial D(G;x)=

domination polynomial of TUC4C8(S) Nanotubes by using the 2-variables generating 
function. The function P(x,y)=Πi=0kPi(x,y) is called the 2-variables generating function for the

Chapter 10 establishes a set of Seven presumably new results which depict the 
relationships between q-Product Identities, Combinatorial Partition Identities and Continued-
Fraction Identities. Several closely-related q-identities such as (for example) Jacobi's triple 
product identity are also considered.

Chapter 12 is concerned with a study of water waves generated due to presence of a line 
singularity (source) with time dependent strength in ocean with porous bottom. The 
expression for the potential function is obtained by solving the corresponding initial value 
problem by using Laplace transform technique. The free surface depression is obtained for 
various forms of source strength and are depicted graphically for different time and distances. 
Chapter 13 presents new sufficient conditions for the oscillation of all solutions of first-
order linear differential equations with several deviating arguments and positive coefficients. 
Corresponding differential equations of both delayed and advanced type are studied. 
Examples illustrating the results are also given.

Chapter 14 is concerned with pullback attractor of Hopfield neural networks with delays. 
By using the theory of pullback attractors, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix 
inequality, the sufficient criteria on the existence of pullback attractor are derived. A 
numerical example is presented to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical result. 
The evaluation of the action of a string field action allows the effect of instantons on the 
perturbation series to be determined in Chapter 15. A string field redefinition is found such 
that a nonvanishing tachyon background requires tunneling through a potential barrier. 
Tachyon condensation then is a nonperturbative effect resulting from the embedding of the 
union of Hilbert spaces on the ends into a Fock space on an ideal boundary of non-zero linear 
measure. 
In Chapter 16, the authors introduce a new method of optimization to restore additive 
noised images. This method is based on an algorithm of resolution known under the name 
Proximal penalty. The authors make the mathematical study of our method. They present 
numerical results which show that their algorithm is effective to solve the problems of 
restoration of the images perturbed by noise. 
A fully discrete Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent sources is constructed in 
Chapter 17 using the source generation procedure. The algebraic structure of the resulting 
fully discrete system is clarified by presenting its discrete Gram-type determinant solution. 
The author of Chapter 18 establishes a set of ten presumably new results which depict the 
modular relationships for the Roger-Ramanujan type identities. Several closely-related  
q-identities such as (for examples) Combinatorial partition identities, Continued-fraction 
identities and Jacobi’s triple product identities are also considered.

 where d(x,i) is the number of all dominating sets with cardinality i. In 
Chapter 19 the authors present an algorithm for obtaining the domination polynomials of 
some special graphs like molecular graphs. In the algorithm presented the authors will try to 
achieve the domination polynomial a graph G step to step with using two methods 
“classification method” and “remove-substitution method”. In continue, since the molecular 
graph Ca(C6) (Capra-designed planar Benzenoid) has a very remarkable and suitable 
structure, we will run the algorithm on it and obtained desired results of the graph.

subcritical case, when the nonlinear term of the equation has the time decay rate less than that

limit of the sequence of solutions for iterative linearized systems. They prove the existence 
and uniqueness theorems for the strong solution. The results may be used as well in numerical 
algorithms of calculation of the dynamics of the Atmosphere.

Abstract
In this paper, center conditions, the bifurcation of limit cycles and local bifurcation
of critical periods for a quintic Kukles system are studied. The ﬁrst 8 singular point
values of the origin are obtained by using computer algebra system. We give the
conditions for the origin to be a center and prove that the system has 8 limit cycles
bifurcated from the origin. By the computations of period constants, the weak center
conditions and local critical periods of the origin are also obtained.

Introduction
The studies of centers and limit cycles for polynomial differential systems are classic prob-
lems in differential equation qualitative theory. With the development of computer algebra,
many new results have been achieved [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In [6], Kukles investigated ﬁrstly the
centre problem of the system
dx
dt = −y,
dy
dt = x + b1x2 + b2xy + b3y2 + b4x3 + b5x2y + b6xy2 + b7y3.

The following system is called Kukles system of the order in n
dx
dt = −y,
dy
dt = x + Q(x, y),
(2)
where Q(x, y) is a polynomial with real coefﬁcients of degree n. Wang [7] improved the
center conditions of system (1). Shub`e [8] gave that a cubic Kukeles system (2) can have
ﬁve limit cycles. Wu [9] found a cubic system (2) with two foci can generate at least six
limit cycles. Gin´e [10] obtained necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of
centers and the system has four limit cycles and ﬁve limit cycles around the origin when
Q(x, y) is quartic and quintic homogeneous polynomial respectively.
One problem concerned tightly with the center and the limit cycle is the critical pe-
riod of polynomial differential systems. Chicone and Jacobs [11] introduced the notion of
bifurcation of critical periods by analogy with the method of Bautin and solved the local
critical periods for the quadratic system. The authors of [12] proposed a complex method
to investigate local critical periods, gave the weak center conditions and the bifurcation of
local critical periods for the complex cubic homogeneous system. The local critical periods
bifurcated from the origin of the cubic Kukles system was solved in [13]. Recently, we
considered the weak center conditions and local critical periods for a Z2 equivariant cubic
system, and found that at most three local critical periods bifurcating from the bi-center
[14].
In this paper, we investigate centers, small amplitude limit cycles and local critical
period bifurcations for the the following quintic Kukles system
dx
dt = −y,
dy
dt = x + a1xy + a2y2 + a3x5 + a4x4y + a5x3y2 + a6x2y3 + a7xy4 + a8y5,

where parameter λ = (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8) ∈R8. By transformations

By the computations of singular point values we obtain that system (3) has 8 limit cycles
around the origin. To our knowledge it is the ﬁrst example of a quintic Kukles system with
eight limit cycles bifurcating from the origin. In the paper we also give the local critical
period bifurcations at origin of the system by the computations of period constants.

where c0,0 = 1, for all ckk ∈R, k = 1, 2, ..., and to any integer m, µm is determined by
following recursion formulas: c0,0 = 1 when (α = β > 0) or α < 0 or β < 0, cα,β = 0,

(ak,j−1 −bj,k−1)cα−k+1,β−j+1.
(11)
µm in Lemma 2.1 is said to be the singular point value at the origin of system (8). The
origin is called a complex center if all µm = 0, m = 1, 2, · · ·. In [16], it was presented that
the relation between the ﬁrst nonvanishing focal value and the ﬁrst nonvanishing singular
point value of the origin as
ν2m+1(2π) = iπµm.
(12)
It shows that the computations of focal values of system (7) can be transformed into the
computations of singular point values of system (8), and the system (3) has a center in the
origin if and only if its concomitant complex system (5) has a complex center in the origin.
From Theorem 2 in [17] and similar to Theorem 7 in [18] , we have
Lemma 2.2. Assume that µi (i = 1, 2 · · ·), the singular point values in the origin of system
(7), have k independent parameters λ = (a1, a2, · · · , ak), i.e., µi = µi(a1, a2, · · · , ak). if
λ = λ0, the origin of the system (3) is an m-order weak focus (m ≤k), and the Jacobian
determinant
∂(µ1, µ2, · · · , µm−1)
∂(a1, a2, · · · , am−1) |λ=λ0 ̸= 0,
(13)
then, the perturbed system (3) there exists m small amplitude limit cycles bifurcated from
the origin.
Applying the recursive formulas in Lemma 2.1, we compute singular point values at
the origin of system (5) with the computer algebra system Mathematica and obtain the
following result.
Theorem 2.1. The ﬁrst eight singular point values of system (5) are as follows

(15)
Proof. It is not difﬁcult to see the sufﬁciency. We need only to prove that the conditions are
necessary.
Case 1. If a8 = 0, from µ2 = 0 we have a4 = −a6. From µ3 = 0, we assume a6 =
−290a8
13
= 0, then we get a4 = 0. Thus, the set (14) holds. If a8 ̸= 0 and a2 ̸= 0,
from µ2 = 0 we obtain a4 = −a6 −5a8. From µ3 = 0, we ﬁnd a6 = −290a8
13 , thus
a4 = 225a8
13 . From µ4 = 0, there is a5 = −−1380a3−316a7−1575a4

, from µ5 = 0 we have
a3 =

2)
789156
. It is easy to check that the
equation F1 = 0 has no real root except a2 = a7 = a8 = 0, thus µ6 ̸= 0. We ﬁnd that the
most order weak focus of origin of system (3) is 6.
Case 2. If a8 = 0, from µ2 = 0 we have a4 = −a6. From µ3 = 0, we assume a6 = a8 = 0,
then we get a4 = 0. Thus, the set (15) holds. If a8 ̸= 0 and from µ2 = 0 we have
a4 = −a6 −5a8. From µ3 = 0, we obtain a6 = 5a8. From µ4 = 0, we have a3 =

Computing the resultant of the G1 and G2 with respect to the variable a7 to get:
Resultant[G1, G2, a7] = Aa8
1 ̸= 0.
Hence, we get that G1 and G2 have no common zero which implies that the origin of system
(3) is at most 8-order weak focus.
If the condition (14) holds, system (3) becomes
dx
dt = −y,
dy
dt = x + a2y2 + a3x5 + a5x3y2 + a7xy4,
(16)
It is symmetric with respect to the x-axis. If the condition (15) holds, system (3)
dx
dt = −y,
dy
dt = x + a1xy + a3x5 + a5x3y2 + a7xy4,
(17)
is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So we have
Theorem 2.3. The origin of system (3) is a center if and only if (14) or (15) holds.
By µ1 = µ2 = · · · = µ7 = 0, µ8 ̸= 0, we have
Theorem 2.4. The origin of system (3) is an 8-order weak focus if and only if
a1 ̸= 0, a2 = G1 = 0, a3 = −1215a7 + 872a4

Let a1 = 1, from G1 = 0 we have

(19)
By computing carefully, we obtain that the Jacobian determinant
∂(µ1, µ2, µ3, µ4, µ5, µ6, µ7)
∂(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a7, a8) |(18),(19) ≈0.0000275031i ̸= 0.
(20)
From Lemma 2.2, we have
Theorem 2.5. For system (3), under the condition (18), by small perturbations of the pa-
rameter group (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8), then there are 8 small amplitude limit cycles
bifurcated from the origin.

Local Bifurcation of Critical Periods
Let P(h, λ) denotes the minimum period of the periodic orbit around the origin through
initial point (h, 0). Following [11], we can know that the period function can be represented
as Taylor series
P(h, λ) = 2π +
∞
X
k=1
P2kh2k,
(21)
P2k is called the kth period constant of the origin of system (3).
Deﬁnition 3.1. If there exists λ∗such that
P2(λ∗) = P4(λ∗) = · · · = P2k(λ∗) = 0, P2k+2(λ∗) ̸= 0,
(22)
the origin of the system (3) is called the k−order(k ∈N) weak center on the parameter λ∗;
(ii) if k = 0, the origin is called strong center; (iii) if for all positive integer k, P2k = 0,
then the origin is called isochronous center.
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let origin be a weak or isochronous center for system (3) corresponding to
the parameter λ∗∈Λ. It is said that k local critical periods bifurcate from center if there
is ε0 > 0 such that for every 0 < ε < ε0 and every sufﬁciently small neighborhood W of
λ∗there is a λ1 ∈W such that P ′(h, λ1) = 0 has k solutions in U = (0, ε).
Deﬁnition 3.3. Consider a ﬁnite set of functions fi : RN →R, i = 1, 2...l. The real
(respectively, complex) variety V (f1, f2, ..., fl) is deﬁned to be the set of λ ∈RN (respec-
tively, CN ) such that fi(λ) = 0 for i = 1, 2, ..., l. If f : RN →R, then we say that
f1, f2, ..., fl are independent with respect to f at λ∗∈V (f1, f2, ..., fl) if (i) every neigh-
borhood of λ∗∈RN contains a point λ ∈V (f1, ...fl−1) such that fl(λ)f(λ) < 0; (ii)
the varieties V (f1, f2, ..., fj), 2 ≤j ≤l −1, are such that if λ ∈V (f1, ..., fj), and
fj+1(λ) ̸= 0, then every neighborhood W of λ contains a point σ ∈V (f1, ..., fj−1) such
that fj(σ)fj+1(λ) < 0; (iii) if λ ∈V (f1) and f2(λ) ̸= 0, then every open neighborhood of
λ contains a point σ such that f1(σ)f2(λ) < 0.
It is easy to see that if f1, f2, ..., fl are independent with respect to f at λ∗∈
V (f1, f2, ..., fl), then for each k = 1, 2, ...l, f1, f2, ...fk−1 are independent with respect
to fk at every λ ∈V (f1, ...fk−1) such that fk(λ) ̸= 0.
Lemma 3.1 ([13]). If center of system (3) is a weak center of order k corresponding to
the parameter λ∗, then at most k critical periods bifurcate from center. Moreover, if the
period constants P2, P4, P6..., P2k are independent with respect to P2k+2 at λ∗, then there
are exactly m critical periods bifurcating from center for any m ≤k.
Substituting a4 = a6 = a8 = 0 into the recursive formulas of Theorem 3.1 in [19] and
computing carefully, we obtain
Theorem 3.1. The ﬁrst four complex period constants of the system (5) at the origin are as
follows
τ1 = −1
12(−a2
1 −4a2
2),
τ2 = 1
8(5a3 + a5 + a7),
τ3 = 0,
τ4 = −1
384(105a2
3 + 6a3a7 + a2
7).
(23)

Ting Chen, Wentao Huang and Jian Yang
Above every τk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are computed under the assumption τk−1 = 0.
If condition (14) or (15) satisﬁes, we have a1 = a2 = 0 from τ1 = 0. If τ2 = 0 we
can have a5 = −5a3 −a7. And it is easy check that 105a2
3 + 6a3a7 + a2
7 = 0 if only if
a3 = a7 = 0. And the system becomes linear, so the origin of the system is an isochronous
center. Otherwise we can know τ4 ̸= 0. It implies the origin of system (3) is the 3-order
weak center. It is easy to obtain the following results.
Theorem 3.2. The origin of the system (3) is isochronous if and only if a1 = a2 = a3 =
a4 = a5 = a6 = a7 = a8 = 0.
Theorem 3.3. If λ ∈K1
S K2, the origin of system (3) is a weak center of order at most
3. Moreover, the origin of the order k(k = 0, 1, 3) if and only if λ ∈Kk, where
K0 ={λ ∈R8 : a1 = a4 = a6 = a8 = 0, a2 ̸= 0, or a2 = a4 = a6 = a8 = 0, a1 ̸= 0};
K1 ={λ ∈R8 : a1 = a2 = a4 = a6 = a8 = 0, a5 ̸= −5a3 −a7};
K3 ={λ ∈R8 : a1 = a2 = a4 = a6 = a8 = 0, a5 = −5a3 −a7, a3 ̸= or a7 ̸= 0}.
(24)
Theorem 3.4. If λ∗∈K3,the system (3) can have 2 critical periods bifurcating from the
origin.
Proof. We need to prove the independence P2,P4 with respect to P8 at each λ∗∈K3. We
only verify the condition (i) and (iii) of Deﬁnition 3.3. For any λ∗∈K3, i.e.,
λ∗= (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8) = (0, 0, a3, 0, −5a3 −a7, 0, a7, 0) ∈V (P2, P4).
For an arbitrary neighborhood W of λ∗, we can ﬁnd a point
λ′ = (0, 0, a3, 0, −5a3 −a7 + ε, 0, a7, 0) ∈W,
where ε > 0 is sufﬁciently small. The period constants can be calculated and satisfy with
P2(λ′) = 0, P4(λ′)P8(λ′) = −(105a2
3 + 6a3a7 + a2
7)π2ε
3072
< 0.
Thus, conditions (i) in Deﬁnition 3.3 holds. And we let
λ∗= (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8) = (0, 0, a3, 0, a5, 0, a7, 0) ∈V (P2).
For
every
neighborhood
W ′
of
λ,
there
exists
σ
=
(0, ε, a3sign(a3), 0, a5sign(a5), 0, a7sign(a7), 0) ∈W ′, where ϵ > 0 is sufﬁciently
small, such that
P2(σ)P4(λ) = −1
24π2ε(5a3sign(a3) + a5sign(a5) + a7sign(a7)) < 0.
Hence P2 is independent with respect to P4 at λ. From the Lemma 3.1, we can know that
if λ ∈K3, the system (3) has two critical period bifurcating from the origin.

Abstract 
In chemical graphs, the vertices of the graph correspond to the atoms of the molecule, 
and the edges represent the chemical bonds. Chemical graph theory is a branch of 
mathematical chemistry which applies graph theory to mathematical modeling of chemical 
phenomena [1-3]. Among topological descriptors connectivity indices are very important and 
they have a prominent role in chemistry. 
In this paper we focus on two connectivity indices and compute Randić connectivity and Sum-
connectivity indices for Capra-designed of Cycles.

1. Introduction 
In chemical graphs, the vertices of the graph correspond to the atoms of the molecule, and the 
edges represent the chemical bonds.  
Chemical graph theory is a branch of mathematical chemistry which applies graph theory 
to mathematical modeling of chemical phenomena [1-7]. 
Numbers reflecting certain structural features of organic molecules that are obtained from 
the molecular graph are usually called graph invariants or more commonly topological

indices. In other words, an arbitrary topological index is fixed by any automorphism of the 
graph. There are several topological indices have been defined. 
One of the oldest graph invariants are the Wiener index, which was formally introduced 
by Harold Wiener [1] (in 1947). 
The Wiener index is defined as the sum of distances between any two atoms in the 
molecules, in terms of bonds and denoted by W(G).

where d(u,v) denote the distance between vertices u and v in G.  
Among the numerous topological indices considered in chemical graph theory, only a 
few have been found noteworthy in practical application, connectivity index is one of them. 
Milan Randić proposed in 1975 a structural descriptor called the branching index [8] that 
later became the well-known Randić connectivity index Χ(G). Motivated by the definition of 
Randić connectivity index based on the end-vertex degrees of edges in a graph and is equal to

This index has been successfully correlated with physo-chemical properties of organic 
molecules. Indeed if G is the molecular graph of a saturated hydrocarbon then there is a 
strong correlation between χ(G) and the boiling point of the substance [9-13]. 
Recently, Zhou and Trinajstić [14, 15] proposed another index named the sum-
connectivity  
X(G) in 2008, which is defined as the sum over all edges of the graph of the terms  
(du+dv)

X(G)=

We encourage the reader to consult papers [16] and references therein, for further study 
on the topic. 
In this article many attempt have been made to compute Randić connectivity and Sum-
connectivity indices for Capra-designed of Cycles. Throughout this paper our notation is 
standard and mainly taken from standard book of graph theory such as [1-7] as well as [16-23]. 
2. Main Results 
In this section we compute closed formulas of Randić connectivity and Sum-connectivity 
indices for Capra-designed of Cycles. The Capra-designed operation of cycles C3, C4, C5 and 
C6 are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Figure 1. First member of Capra-designed operation of cycles C3, C4, C5and C6[29, 30]. 
A mapping is new drawing of an arbitrary planar graph G on the plane. Capra map 
operation was introduced by M.V. Diudea, see Definition 1 and references [24-28] and some 
its applications in papers series [29-39].  
 
 
Figure 2. Capra map operation on the square and hexagonal face, respectively[29, 30]. 
Definition 1. [30] Let G be a cyclic planar graph. Capra map operation is achieved as 
follows:  
 
(i) 
Insert two vertices on every edge of G;  
(ii) 
Add pendant vertices to the above inserted ones and  
(iii) 
Connect the pendant vertices in order (-1,+3) around the boundary of a face of G. 
By running these steps for every face/cycle of G, one obtains the Capra-
transform of G Ca(G), see Figure 2.  
 
Consider the molecular graph of Cak (Cn), where k is steps of growth in this type of 
drawing. In other words, kth order of Capra-designed operation of cycle Cn denoted by Cak(Cn). 
For a molecular graph G=(V, E), we divide V(G) into several partitions on based the 
degrees of vertices/atoms as Vk={vV(G)|dv=k}. Therefore  
 
 
|E(G)|= 1

where δ and Δ are the minimum and maximum, respectively, of dv for all vV(G).

Next, the three partitions of E(G) are as follows 
 
 
E4=E4*={uvE(G)|du=dv=2} 
 
 
E5=E6*={uvE(G)|du=2 & dv=3} 
 
 
E6=E9*={uvE(G)|du=dv=3}. 
 
By definition of the Capra-designed operation, one can see that the structure Cak(Cn) 
collects a Cak-1(Cn) and ntimes of structure Cak-1(C6). In other words,

So, for the vertex set V(Ca2(Cn)), we have [30]

V2={v V(Cak(Cn))| dv=2} → |V2|=v2(n,k)=

Abstract
In this chapter, an extended homogeneous balance method is used for an analytical
study on time-dependent coefﬁcient modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)equation.
Firstly, an auto-B¨acklund transformation of the variable coefﬁcient mKdV equation are
obtained by the extended homogeneous balance method. Then, a symmetry and two
conservation laws of the variable coefﬁcient mKdV equation are given. At last, three

Some soliton-like solutions are also obtained from the B¨acklund transformation and
similarity reduction obtained above.

Introduction
It is well known that the KdV equation plays an important role in the soliton theory. KdV
equation and its various generalized forms have been studied by many Physicists and math-
ematicians. When the inhomogeneities of media and non-uniformity of boundaries are

taken into account in various real physical situations, the variable coefﬁcient nonlinear evo-
lution equations often can provide more powerful and realistic models than their constant-
coefﬁcient counterparts in describing a large variety of real phenomena. To describe the
realistic physical phenomena accurately, it is very important to study the variable coefﬁ-
cients nonlinear evolution equations.
Recently nonlinear equations with variable coefﬁcients have attracted considerable at-
tention in the literature because most of real nonlinear physical equations possess variable
coefﬁcients [1]. In [1], the KdV equation with variable coefﬁcients was investigated by
using a new auxiliary equation method and a various of exact soliton-like solutions were
obtained. Zhao et.al [2] and Zhang [3] obtained soliton-like solutions for KdV equation
with variable coefﬁcient by using Jacobi elliptic function expansion method.
Such a meaningful variable coefﬁcients KdV equation
ut = K0(t)(uxxx + 6uux) + 4K1(t)ux −h(t)(u + xux)
(1)
and the variable coefﬁcients MKdV equation
ut = K0(t)(uxxx + 6u2ux) + 4K1(t)ux −h(t)(u + xux)
(2)
where K0(t), K1(t), h(t) are all arbitrary functions of t, is also of importance in mathemat-
ical physics ﬁeld. The KdV equation and the cylindrical KdV equation etc.are special cases
of Eq.(1). The Eq.(2) describes the propagation of weakly nonlinear long waves in a mKdV-
typed medium that is characterized by a varying dispersion and nonlinear coefﬁcients. The
mKdV equation and the cylindrical mKdV equation etc. are special cases of Eq.(2) [4,5,6].
By using the Miura method, Lou et.al[6] studied the inﬁnite conservation laws for Eq.(1)
and (2). In [7], Yan employed the direct similarity reductions method to reduce the variable
coefﬁcients MKdV equation (2). He obtained two types of symmetric reductions of the vari-
able coefﬁcients MKdV equation (2)and some soliton-likesolutions. He also found a trans-
formation between the variable coefﬁcients MKdV equation (2) and the mKdV equation.
More recent years, many effective methods for obtaining exact solutions of nonlinear par-
tial differential equation were applied to investigate the variable coefﬁcients MKdV Eq.(2),
such as a further improved projective Riccati equation method[8], the variable-coefﬁcient
generalized projected Ricatti equation expansion method[9], a generalized( G′
G )-expansion
method[10], the sub-Ode method [11], a new generalized Jacobi elliptic functions expan-
sion method[12], the auxiliary differential equation technique[13,14]. In [15], Triki, Taha,
and Wazwaz studied a generalized time-dependent variable coefﬁcients combined KdV-
mKdV equation arising in plasma physics and ocean dynamics. They obtained many ex-
plicit soliton-like solutions of the variable coefﬁcients cobined KdV-mKdV equation by
using three amplitude anstaz.
Pradhan and Panigrahi [16] studied the modiﬁed KdV equation with variable coefﬁ-
cients
ut + α(t)ux −β(t)u2ux + γ(t)uxxx = 0,
(3)
and some Jacobi elliptic function solutions with the forms Asn(ξ, m), Bcn(ξ, m),
Cdn(ξ, m) were obtained by reducing (3) to one second-order ODE in the form g′′(ω) =
Pg(ω) + 2Qg3(ω). Yan in [17] investigated more types of solutions of Eq.(3) using some

powerful transformations and obtained some fractional solutions with one traveling wave-
like variable, exact breather-like and doubly periodic wave-like solutions with two different
traveling wave-like variable. Zhang, Li and Lv in [18] considered the variable coefﬁcient
modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries equation
ut + g(t)uxxx + f(t)u2ux + l(t)u + q(t)ux = 0
(4)
where g(t), f(t), l(t) and q(t) are all analytic functions. Salas [19] considered a special
mKdV equation with variable coefﬁcients of the form
ut + p(t)u2ux + cp(t)uxxx = 0
(5)
A transformation of variables is ﬁrst applied in order to obtain a mKdV equation with con-
stant coefﬁcients. Then some soliton-like solutions are derived by using Hirota’s bilinear
approach. Zhang, Lai and Wu in [20] investigate a generalized mKdV equation with vari-
able coefﬁcients
ut + α(t)unux + β(t)uxxx = 0, n > 0.
(6)
Some exact Jacobi elliptic function wave-like solutionsto the Eq.(6) were obtained by using
the auxiliary differential equation technique.
In [21], Johnpillai and Khalique studied a dimensionless form of the mKdV equation
ut + u2ux + a(t)u + b(t)uxxx = 0,
(7)
with time-dependent variable coefﬁcients of the linear damping and dispersion. They dis-
cussed the Lie group classiﬁcation of the Eq.(7) with respect to the time-dependent co-
efﬁcients and constructed some similarity solutions for the equation. With the aid of an
equivalence based method, Vaneeva [22] considered the group classiﬁcation of classes
of mKdV equations with time-dependent coefﬁcients and obtained some exact solutions.
Zheng, Shang, and Huang [23] investigated the variable coefﬁcients mKdV equation

By using the ﬁrst integral method the authors obtained many exact solutions of Eq.(8).
These exact solutions include solitary wave-like solutions,periodic wave solutions, and el-
liptic function-like solitons.
The homogenous balance method is primary and concise method for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations [24]. In [25,26], Fan used improved HB method to search
for B¨acklund transformation and similarity reductions of variant Boussinesq equations and
KdV equation with variable coefﬁcients. The aim of this paper is to investigate the special
mKdV equation (5) with time-dependent variable coefﬁcient by the extended homogenous
balance method [27]. We ﬁnd an auto-B¨acklund transformation and three types of similar-
ity reductions for the variable coefﬁcient mKdV equation. Some exact solitary wave-like
solutions of Eq.(5) are also obtained.

Auto-B¨acklund Transformation, a Symmetry and the First
Two Conservation Laws
According to the extended homogenous balance method [27], we suppose that the solution
of Eq.(5) be the form
u(x, t) = f′(w)wx + v(x, t)
(9)
where f(x, t), w(x, t) are functions to be determined later, and v(x, t) is a solution of
Eq.(5). With the aid of Maple 12, we have
ut = f′′(w)wxwt + f′(w)wxt + vt(x, t),
(10)
ux = f′′(w)w2
x + f′(w)wxx + vx(x, t),
(11)
u2 = (f′)2(w)w2
x + 2f′wxv(x, t) + v2(x, t),
(12)
uxxx = f(4)(w)w4
x + 6f′′′(w)w2
xwxx
+ (4wxwxxx + 3w2
xx)f′′(w) + f′wxxxx + vxxx.
(13)
Substituting (10-13) into Eq.(5) yields
p(t)(cf(4) + f′2f′′)w4
x + p(t)(6cf′′′ + f′3)w2
xwxx + 2p(t)f′f′′w3
xv+
(wxwt + p(t)w2
xv2 + 3cp(t)w2
xx + 4cp(t)wxwxxx)f′′ + p(t)(2wxwxxv
+ w2
xvx)f′2 + (wxt + p(t)wxxv2 + 2p(t)wxvvx + cp(t)wxxxx)f′
+ (vt + p(t)v2vx + cp(t)vxxx) = 0.
(14)
Setting the coefﬁcient of w4
x in (14) to be zero, we obtain a nonlinear ordinary differential
equation for f
p(t)(cf(4) + f′2f′′) = 0,
(15)
which has a special solution
f(w) = γ lnw,
γ = ±
√
−6c
(16)
and thus we have
f′f′′ = −1
2γf′′′,
f′3 = 1
2γ2f′′′,
f′2 = −γf′′
(17)
By making use of (17), setting the coefﬁcients of f
′′′(w), f
′′(w), f
′(w), f0(w) to be zero
respectively, we have
p(t)w2
x(3cwxx −γvwx) = 0,
wx(wt + p(t)v2wx + cp(t)wxxx) + p(t)∂x[wx(3cwxx −γvwx)] = 0,
∂x(wt + p(t)v2wx + cp(t)wxxx) = 0,
vt + p(t)v2vx + cp(t)vxxx = 0.
It is easy to see that above equations are satisﬁed, provided that
3cwxx −γvwx = 0,
(18)

Auto-B¨acklund Transformation and Similarity Reductions ...
23
wt + p(t)v2wx + cp(t)wxxx = 0,
(19)
vt + p(t)v2vx + cp(t)vxxx = 0.
From (9) and (16), we obtain desired auto-B¨acklund transformation of Eq.(5)
u = ±
√
−6c ∂
∂x ln w + v(x, t),
(20)
where w(x, t) satisﬁes (18) and (19), v(x, t) is a solution of Eq.(5).
Differentiating Eq.(19) with respect to x and setting σ = wx yields
σt + (2p(t)vvx + p(t)v2∂x + cp(t)∂3
x)σ = 0,
(21)
which implies that σ is a symmetry of Eq.(5).
Here we can also obtain the ﬁrst two conservation laws of Eq.(5):
ut + (1
3p(t)u3 + cp(t)uxx)x = 0,
(u2)t + (1
2p(t)u4 −cp(t)u2
x + 2cpuuxx)x = 0.
The higher-order conservation laws are not so direct and they are now under investigation.
It is obvious that (18) and (19) have a solution
v = 0,
w(x, t) = c1x + c2,
(22)
where c1, c2 are arbitrary constants. Substituting (22) into (20), we obtain a static solutions
of Eq.(5)
u(x, t) = ±
√−6c
x + c0
,
(23)
where c0 is an arbitrary constant.
The equations (18) and (19) have another solution
v = α ̸= 0,
w(x, t) = ±
3c
α√−6c exp(ξ) + c1,
(24)
where ξ(x, t) = ±√−6c[ α
3cx −α3
9c
R p(t)dt + c2], c1, c2 are two arbitrary constants.
Substituting (24) into (20) we obtain a exact traveling wave-like solution
u(x, t) = α±c1
√−6c −3c
α exp(ξ(x, t))
3c
α exp(ξ(x, t)) ± c1

(25)
where ξ(x, t) = ±√−6c[ α
3cx −α3

R
p(t)dt + c2], c1, c2 are two arbitrary constants.
In particularwe obtain a kink type solitary wave-like solution
u(x, t) = −α tanh 1
2(ξ(x, t)),
(26)
and a singular traveling wave-like solution
u(x, t) = −α coth 1
2(ξ(x, t)),
(27)
where ξ(x, t) = ±√−6c[ α

Similarity Reductions by the Extended Homogenous Balance
Method
In this section, we will use assumption (9) to ﬁnd similarity reduction of Eq.(5). To do this
we only need to rewrite (14) as the form of different derivatives and power of f:
p(t)w4
xf′2f′′ + cp(t)w4
xf(4) + 6cp(t)w2
xwxxf′′′ + p(t)w2
xwxxf′3
+ 2p(t)vw3
xf′f′′ + (wxwt + p(t)v2w2
x + 3cp(t)w2
xx
+ 4cp(t)wxwxxx)f′′ + p(t)(2vwxwxx + vxw2
x)f′2
+ (wxt + p(t)v2wxx + 2p(t)vvxwx + cp(t)wxxxx)f′
+ vt + p(t)v2vx + cp(t)vxxx = 0
(28)
To make Eq.(28) be an ordinary differential equation of f and w, the ratios of coefﬁcients
of different derivatives and powers of f have to be functions of w. We use the coefﬁcient
of f′2f′′ as normalizing coefﬁcient and therefor we have
cp(t)w4
x = p(t)w4
xΓ1(w)
(29)
6cp(t)w2
xwxx = p(t)w4
xΓ2(w)
(30)
p(t)w2
xwxx = p(t)w4
xΓ3(w)
(31)
2p(t)vw3
x = p(t)w4
xΓ4(w)
(32)
wxwt + p(t)v2w2
x + 3cp(t)w2
xx + 4cp(t)wxwxxx = p(t)w4
xΓ5(w)
(33)
2p(t)vwxwxx + p(t)vxw2
x = p(t)w4
xΓ6(w)
(34)
wxt + p(t)v2wxx + 2p(t)vvxwx + cp(t)wxxxx = p(t)w4
xΓ7(w)
(35)
vt + p(t)v2vx + cp(t)vxxx = p(t)w4
xΓ8(w)
(36)
where Γi(w)(i = 1, 2, ..., 8) are some arbitrary functions of w to be determined. There are
two freedoms in the determination of v and w which we can exploit the following rules
without loss generality.
(i) If w has the form w = w0(x, t) + (∂2/∂x2)Ω(w), then we can assume that Ω=
0(make the transformation f(w) →f(w) −Ω(w)).
(ii) If w(x, t) is deﬁned by an equation of the form Ω(w) = w0(x, t), we can also
assume that Ω= w(make the transformation w →Ω−1(w)).
By using (i) and (ii), one can obtain the general solutions of Eqs.(29)-(36)
Γ2(w) = Γ3(w) = Γ4(w) = Γ6(w) = Γ8(w) = 0,
Γ1(w) = c,
Γ5(w) = Aw + B, Γ7(w) = A, v(x, t) = 0, w(x, t) = xθ(t) + σ(t),
(37)
where θ(t), σ(t) should be satisfy
θ′(t) = Ap(t)θ4(t),
σ′(t) = Ap(t)θ3(t)σ(t) + Bpθ3(t).
(38)

Auto-B¨acklund Transformation and Similarity Reductions ...
25
Therefore, from (9), the similarity solutions of Eq.(5) read as
u = θ(t)Q(w),
w(x, t) = xθ(t) + σ(t),
(39)
where Q = f′ is given by a third order nonlinear ordinary differential equation
cQ′′′ + Q2Q′ + (Aw + B)Q′ + AQ = 0.
(40)
There exist three subcases for further discussions.
(i)A = B = 0. In this case, the general solutions of (38) are
θ = θ0,
σ = σ0
(41)
and Eqs.(39) and (40) become
u = θ0Q(w),
w = θ0x + σ0,
cQ′′′ + Q2Q′ = 0,
(42)
which is equivalent to Weierstrass elliptic function equation.
Integrating (42) twice with respect to w and taking integral constants c1 = c2 = 0, we
know that Eq.(42) has a special solution
Q = ±
√−6c
w
,
(43)
and thus we obtain a static solution of Eq.(5)
u = ±
√−6c
(θ0x + σ0).
(44)
(ii)A = 0, B ̸= 0. In this case, the general solutions of (38) are
θ = θ0,
σ(t) = Bθ3
0
Z
p(t)dt,
(45)
where B, θ0 are arbitrary constants.
In this case, associated similarity reduction of Eq.(5) is
u = θ0Q,
w(x, t) = θ0x + Bθ3
0
Z
p(t)dt,
(46)
and Q satisﬁes
cQ′′′ + Q2Q′ + BQ′ = 0.
(47)
Integrating (47) once with respect to wwe see that Q satisﬁes Dufﬁng equation
cQ′′ + 1
3Q3 + BQ = c1.
(48)
Let c1 = 0, B = 1
6, one can obtain a special solution of Eq.(48)
Q = sec h[
1
√−6cw]
(49)

26
Xiaoming Peng and Yadong Shang
therefore we obtain a bell type solitary wave-like solution of Eq.(5)
u = θ0 sec h[

Z
p(t)dt)]
(50)
Let c1 = 0, B = −1
6, one can obtain a special solution of Eq.(48)
Q = sec h[ 1
√

(51)
therefore we obtain a bell type solitary wave-like solution of Eq.(5)
u = θ0 sec h[ 1

(52)
(iii)A ̸= 0. In this case we can set A = −1
3, B = 0, without loss of generality(by transfor-
mation σ →σ −B
A). Solving Eq.(38) yields
θ(t) = (
Z
p(t)dt)−1
3 ,
σ(t) = (
Z
p(t)dt)−1

(53)
The similarity solution of Eq.(5) is
u = (

w = (x + 1)(

(54)
and Q satisﬁes
cQ′′′ + Q2Q′ −1
3wQ′ −1
3Q = 0
(55)
which is equivalent to the second Painlev´e equation.
Conclusion
In this chapter, we employ the extended homogenous balance method to investigate the
mKdV equation with time-dependent variable coefﬁcient. We ﬁnd the auto-B¨acklund trans-
formation, a symmetry, two conservation laws, and three types of similarity reductions of
the mKdV equation with variable coefﬁcients by means of the extended homogenous bal-
ance method. Furthermore, we obtain some exact solitary wave-like solutions.

A PFAFFIAN ANALOGUE OF
THE DISCRETE DAVEY-STEWARTSON SYSTEM

Abstract
We produce a pfafﬁan version of the discrete Davey-Stewartson system through the
Hirota and Ohta’s pfafﬁanization procedure. As a result, a new coupled semi-discrete
integrable system is derived. We observe how the resulting discrete integrable system
reduces to the pfafﬁan identities by presenting Wronski-type pfafﬁan and Gramm-type
pfafﬁan solutions.

Introduction
In recent years, a great deal of attention has been paid to the search for new discrete inte-
grable systems. Integrable discretization is one way of ﬁnding discrete integrable systems.
Various approaches to the problem of integrable discretization are currently available. Hi-
rota’s approach is one of the effective methods of ﬁnding integrable discretizations for con-
tinuous integrable equations([1]-[6]). In [7], the Hirota’s discretization method is used to
obtain a discrete version for the DSI system. Pfafﬁanization, which was initially used by
Hirota and Ohta in the early 1990s[8], is another way of producing new integrable sys-
tems. Some continuous, semi-discrete and fully discrete equations like Davey-Stewartson
equation[9], self-dual Yang-Mills equation[10], differential-difference KP equation[11], the
two-dimesional Toda lattice[12], and discrete KP equation[13] have been pfafﬁanized, and

new coupled continuous and discrete integrable systems with pfafﬁan solution have been
derived.
A pfafﬁan is a generalization of a determinant. The multisoliton solutions for BKP-type
equations such as the Sawada-Kotera equation, shallow-water wave equation, discrete-time
Toda equations of BKP type, and many coupled equations like coupled modiﬁed KdV equa-
tion, coupled modiﬁed KdV equation of derivative type, coupled KP equation etc. can be
compactly expressed by means of pfafﬁans, and these soliton equations resolve themselves
into very simple algebraic structures-pfafﬁan identities[14, 15]. The solutions expressed
by the pfafﬁans are not only compact in form but also characterized by large numbers of
parameters, and therefore can be expected to model complex interactions. However, seek-
ing the pfafﬁan solutions is far from being algorithmic. It is an interesting and challenging
subject to ﬁnd the pfafﬁan solutions of soliton equations.
In this paper, we ﬁrst pfafﬁanize the discrete Davey-Stewartson system studied in [7]
to derive a new discrete integrable system, and then clarify the algebraic structures of the
resulting discrete system by expressing the solutions by means of two types of pfafﬁans.
In Sec. 2, a pfafﬁan version of the discrete Davey-Stewartson system is derived. In Sec.
3, the Gram-type pfafﬁan solution for the pfafﬁanized discrete Davey-Stewartson system is
given. Finally, we give concluding remarks in Sec. 4.

Pfafﬁanizing the Differential-Difference Davey-Stewartson
System
In [7], a differential-difference Davey-Stewartson system which has a continuous limit into
the DSI system is proposed. The double-Casorati and Grammian determinant solutions to
this discrete Davey-Stewartson system are also given in [7]. In this section, we ﬁrst review
the double-Casorati determinant solutionfor the discrete Davey-Stewartson system and then
pfafﬁanize the system to produce a pfafﬁan version of the discrete Davey-Stewartson sys-
tem.
We consider the differential-difference Davey-Stewartson system given in [7]
ivt + α1eun−1+un+1−2uvn−1 + α2euk−1+uk+1−2uvk+1 −(α1 + α2)v = 0,
(2.1)
−iwt + α1eun−1 +un+1−2uwn+1 + α2euk−1+uk+1−2uwk−1 −(α1 + α2)w = 0,
(2.2)
z1 −z1eun+1,k+1+u−uk+1 −un+1 + z2vk+1wn+1 = 0,
(2.3)
where α1, α2, z1 and z2 are constants. In equations (2.1-2.3) and in the following we
always use a simpliﬁed notation for f(n, k, t) where we only write explicitly a discrete
variable only when it is shifted from its position. For example,
f ≡f(n, k, t),
fn+1 ≡f(n + 1, k, t),
fk+1 ≡f(n,k + 1, t),
fn+1,k−1 ≡f(n + 1, k −1, t).
Through the dependent variables transformations
u = lnF,
v = e−i(α1+α2)tG/F,
w = ei(α1+α2)tH/F,
(2.4)
equations (2.1-2.3) become[7, 16]:
[iDt + α1e−Dn + α2eDk]G · F = 0,
(2.5)
[iDt + α1e−Dn + α2eDk]F · H = 0,
(2.6)
z1[e1/2(Dn−Dk) −e1/2(Dn+Dk)]F · F + z2e1/2(Dk−Dn)G · H = 0,

We are now in a position to look at pfafﬁanizing the discrete Davey-Stewartson system
(2.5-2.7). Inspired by the two-component structure of the Casorati determinant solution to
the discrete Davey-Stewartson system, we consider the following two-component Wronski-
type pfafﬁans:
F = (1, 2, · · · , L1; 1′, 2′, · · · , L′
2),
(2.15)
G = z1(1, 2, · · · , L1, L1 + 1; 1′, 2′, · · · , L′

∂t(i, j′) = −α1(i −1, j′) + α2(i, j′ −1),

(i, j)n−1 = (i −1, j −1)n,
(2.21)
(i′, j′)k+1 = (i′ + 1, j′ + 1)k,
(i′, j′)k−1 = (i′ −1, j′ −1)k,
(2.22)
(i, j′)n+1 = (i + 1, j′)n,
(i, j′)n−1 = (i −1, j′)n,
(2.23)
(i, j′)k+1 = (i, j′ + 1)k,
(i, j′)k−1 = (i, j′ −1)k,
(2.24)
where the entry (i, j) is a function of n, t, (i′, j′) is a function of k, t, (i, j′) is a function of
n, k, t respectively.
We can derive the following differential and difference formulae for F, G′s and H′s by
employing equations (2.18-2.24):

It is easy to verify that functions (2.66-2.68) with (2.69-2.70) satisfy the pfafﬁanized dis-
persion relations (2.18-2.24).
We obtain the soliton solution for equations (2.57-2.65) by choosing φl(n, t), ˜φl(n, t)

So Gram-type pfafﬁans (3.10-3.14) solve the system of coupled equations (3.1-3.9).
Since the system of equations (3.18-3.19) is linear, examples of generating functions

Conclusion
In this chapter, the technique of pfafﬁanization is utilized to derive a new coupled discrete
Davey-Stewartson system (2.57-2.65). We have shown that how the resulting new discrete
system has been resolved into pfafﬁan identities by providing two types of pfafﬁan solu-
tions. The discrete Davey-Stewartson system is a reduction of this coupled larger system.

A Pfafﬁan Analogue of the Discrete Davey-Stewartson System
39
In [9], the pfafﬁanized Davey-Stewartson equation is obtained. It would be of interest
to ﬁnd the certain continuous limit which gives the pfafﬁanized Davey-Stewartson equation
investigated in [9] from the pfafﬁan version of the discrete Davey-Stewartson system (2.57-
2.65).

dimensional asymptotic method.

Introduction
Consider the following double integral with parameters of the form
I(x, y, k) =
ZZ
D
g(u, v, x, y)eikf(u,v,x,y)dudv.
(1.1)
The integrals of this type frequently arises in many boundary value problems for the
basic elliptic PDEs in two-dimensional domain [1], which also arises in the problems of the
diffraction theory of optics [2, 3]. In the past few decades, a variety of numerical methods
have been used for this type of integrals computation. But calculation of the integrals
encountered great difﬁculties in the case of large k . For example on the high-frequency
scattering problems[4, 5, 6]. Some new calculation methods are still being explored.
The objective of the present paper is to use the high-dimensional asymptotic method
including the divergence theorem and a high-dimensional version of the method of steepest
descents, to derive the asymptotic expansions of the integral as k →+∞. To illustrate

the idea of the method, consider the oscillatory double integral with parameters where the
phase function f and the amplitude function g are respectively
f(u, v, x, y) = 2(x −u)cosv −2ysinv, g(u, v, x, y) ≡1,
(1.2)
and (u, v) ∈D = [a, b] × [0, π/2]; (x, y) ∈Ω= {(x, y) : x ≥0, y ≥0}.

Main Results
The rest of the paper, we are committed to derive the asymptotic expansions of the integral
I(x, y, k) as k →+∞. We denote
Ω1 = {(x, y) : 0 ≤x < a, y ≥0}; Ω2 = {(x, y) : a < x < b, y ≥0};
Ω3 = {(x, y) : x > b, y ≥0}.

Note. Here in the Theorem, we only give the leading asymptotic for k →+∞, but the
asymptotic expansions can be extended to full expansions.
Proof. (i)For ﬁxed (x, y) ∈Ω1,the gradient ∇f(u, v) = (fu, fv) does not vanish in the
closed domain D. Thus an high-dimensional analogue of the integration-by-parts formula,
based on the divergence theorem, gives the following asymptotic expansion for all (x, y) ∈

∂D is positively oriented, and to which n is the unit outward normal.
Picking up the leading term of (2.6), we have

The k−3/2 term represents the contribution from the pair of stationary points x −b + iy
and x −a + iy of the line integral in (2.6).
(ii)For ﬁxed (x, y) ∈Ω3, the gradient ∇f(u, v) = (fu, fv) does not vanish in the closed
domain D as well. Thus, from(2.6)we have the leading asymptotic as
I(x, y, k) =

(2.8)
(iii)For ﬁxed (x, y) ∈Ω2, the coupled equations fu = −2 cos v = 0 and fv =
2u sinv −2y cos v = 0 have a unique solution (u, v) = (x, π/2), which is a stationary
point on the boundary of D. The contribution to the asymptotic expansion comes from this
stationary point and the rest part of ∂D. The boundary stationary point can be isolated via
introducing a neutralizer ψ(u, v) related to a neighborhood O of (x, π/2). The neutralizer
is a C∞(D) function which is identically 1 in O and vanishes outside of another neighbor-
hood, say O′, such that O ⊂O′. A partition of unity technique suggests that I(x, y, k) can
be written as
I = Ip + Il := g

ψ(u, v)eikf(u,v,x,y)dudv + g

of which the ﬁrst integral Ip gives the contribution from (x, π/2), and the second one from
other boundary. It is worth mentioning that the points at D ∩∂O are of no signiﬁcance
since g [1 −ψ(t, α)] vanishes C∞smoothly at these points, and that ∇f never vanishes in
D∗= D\O.
Similar to the previous derivation, Il can be treated by replacing D by D∗and g by
g [1 −ψ(u, v)], as a result, we have

It is readily seen that (u, v) = (x, π/2) is a saddle point of f since fuu = 0, fuv = −2
and fvv = −2y at the stationary point, and accordingly fuufvv −f2
uv < 0. To evaluate Ip,
the ﬁrst few steps in [7, pp.440-442] should be modiﬁed. We write the phase function as
f(u, v) = −2y+2(u−x) sin(v −π/2)+2y(1−cos(v −π/2)), and begin with the change

its derivatives are zero at the limits s = m and M since ψ vanishes C∞-smoothly outside
of D′. To evaluate h(s), we bring in the parametrization
ξ = √y√s sinh τ, η = −

(2.17)
the curves Γs are also illustrated in Figure 1.
We chose positive numbers d and δ (compare Figure 1) such that D′ lies in the strip
|ξ| < d, and ψ(u, v) = 1 for (u, v) →(ξ, η) ∈Γs ∩{|ξ| ≤δ}, with |s| small. So when s
is positive and small, we can turn h(s) in (2.15) into

2G(ξ, η)dτ := hL(s) + hO(s) + hR(s),
(2.18)
where τd = sinh−1(d/√ys), and τδ = sinh−1(δ/√ys). We may assume that ψ is a C∞
radial function of ξ2 + η2, therefore we can write hL(s) as
hL(s) = −g

(2.19)
Here and hereafter, σ(s) stands for a generic C∞function at s = 0. In deriving the last
formula we have used the fact that the integrand of hL(s) is C∞with respect to η2, and that
η2 is of the order s for small s along this portion of Γs.
Similarly, we have

where, for convenience, we have written ψ(ξ, η) = ψ(u, v) under transformation (2.11); cf.
Figure 1 for the integration path, which is the portion δ ≤ξ ≤d of the line 2ξ + yη = 0.
The reason why the derivation is different from that in [7, p.434], is that the upper boundary
of D′ contributes to the asymptotic expansion of Ip. When −δ ≤ξ ≤δ and s small, we
have G(ξ, η) = g(1 −η2/4)−1. Hence, taking (2.16) into account, the remaining integral

Abstract
An iterative method called ALP based on combination of line projection and ac-
cumulated projection techniques is introduced in this paper. This method does not be-
long to the so-called extended Krylov subspace method since it does not construct any
Krylov subspace to get approximations. Numerical experiments are done to demon-
strate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithm and comparison are made between GM-
RES and ALP. It is observed that in some cases ALP behaviors much better than GM-
RES.

Introduction
The study of iterative methods for solving linear system of equations, especially for large
scale computing is of vital importance. So far there are numerous iterative schemes avail-
able, which are traditionally classiﬁed as stationary and non-stationary iterative methods.
Stationary methods includes the well-known Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel method and
Successive Over-Relaxation Method as well as row-projection methods[1, 3], while non-
stationary iterative methods contains an even large number of schemes, such as Richardson
method, Chebyshev semi-iterative method[3] as well as the most widely applied Krylov
subspace methods including CG, GMRES, BiCG, MINRES, etc[1].
Recently all current iterative methods are classiﬁed as extended Krylov subspace meth-
ods in [5], which are characterized by their major operations: matrix-vector multiplications

which usually one or two ﬁxed matrices and one or two ﬁxed initial vectors. In [5] authors
also presents a ﬁrst non-krylov subspace type methods–The Accumulated Projection Meth-
ods. These type of methods rely on successive projections over subspaces of Rn, which
produce a sequence of projection vector of the exact solution with a monotonically increas-
ing Euclidean norms. Unlike the well-known row-projection technique which can be shown
as a traditional stationary iterative method[2], the AP methods do not involve matrix -vector
multiplications with any ﬁxed matrices and ﬁxed vectors. Equipped with some accelerating
technique, the AP methods exhibit some superior behavior than traditional extended Krylov
subspace methods[5]
The success of AP methods rely on the calculation of the inner product between the
projection vector and the exact solution vector, successive accumulated projection may in-
sult in the danger of accumulated rounding-off error and leads to the instability of the AP
process. It is thus our purpose here to propose a modiﬁed accumulated projection scheme
to remedy this.
Our approach here is based on the line-projection technique proposed in [6]. The LP
method can also be categorized as an extended Krylov subspace since it resembles the
traditional row-projection methods except the “iterative” matrix G has a spectral radius
being exactly 1 instead of being less than 1 for traditional stationary iterative schemes.
From this point of view, it can actually not be classiﬁed as stationary iterative method as the
row-projection method, however it does involve the construction of Krylov subspaces with
some ﬁxed generator matrix, even though the approximations are not from these Krylov
subspaces. However it seems to be reasonable to categorize it into the extended Krylov
subspace methods.
For the sake of completeness, we are to brieﬂy review the LP method and accumulated
projection method in the next section.

Line Projection and Accumulated Projection
Consider the general form of linear system of equations
Ax = b
(1)
where A ∈Rn×n and b ∈Rn. Here and after we always assume A is nonsingular. Thus
there exists a unique solution x ∈Rn to the system.
We also assume b ∈Rn is a non-zero vector . The Line-Projection method relies on the
transformation of (1) into a special linear system of equations
˜Ax = ˜b
(2)
where ˜A = HA and ˜b = Hb. H is a Householder matrix: H = I −2vv′ which converts
vector b in (1) into vector βe1, with β = ||b|| and e1 is the ﬁrst column vector of the identity
matrix I.

ALP: A Projection Method for Linear Systems
51
2.1.
The Line Projection Process
Now we assume the Householder matrix H converts vector b in (1) into βe1 and thus system
(2) can be rewritten as
 ˜a1x
= β
˜aix
= 0
(i = 2, 3, · · ·n)
(3)
system (3) reminds us that the solution vector x lies in the one-dimensional subspace V ⊥
of Rn, where V = L(˜a2, ˜a3, · · · , ˜an) and V ⊥stands for its orthogonal complement. The
main process of LP starts from an initial vector y( say y = ˜a1) and repeatedly updates it by
the vector y −¯yi (i = 2, 3, · · ·n successively where ¯yi is the projection of y on each vector
˜ai and the whole process can be depicted through an “iterative” matrix G deﬁned as
G = (I −Pn)(I −Pn−1) · · ·(I −P2)
(4)
where Pk (k = 2, 3, · · ·n) represents the projection matrix over subspace L(˜ai), i.e., Pi =
˜a′˜ai/(˜ai˜a′
i) and ˜ai denots the i-th row vector of matrix ˜A.
Matrix G deﬁned by (4) has a spectrum radius of 1 and thus can not be regarded as an
iterative matrix as in traditional stationary schemes. Actually the following conclusion says
more about G(See [6] for its proof).
Lemma 2.1. Let G be deﬁned in (4), λ1, λ2, · · · , λn are the eigenvalues of G in the as-
cending order by their magnitude, i.e., |λ1| ≤|λ2| ≤· · · ≤|λn|. Then λ1 = 0 and
λn = 1.
A complete LP process is equivalent to the calculation of matrix-vector multiplication
of G and y as
yk = Gky,
k = 1, 2, · · · , ∞
where y ∈Rn is an initial vector. It is shown in [5] that the sequence {yk} takes ¯y ∈V ⊥
as its limit, where ¯y is the projection of y on the subspace V ⊥and the ﬁnal approximation
to the exact solution x is given as α¯y, where α is taken as β/(x′¯y).
It is observed that the convergence speed of the simple LP process is in general not
satisfactory and an accelerative scheme is proposed in [5] based on the spectrum structure
of G. The algorithm is stated as follows

2.2.
Accumulated Projection Method
Now we review the basic idea of accumulated projection methods. As we have stated
previously, unlike the extended-Krylov subspace methods which rely on the matrix-vector
multiplication with only a few ( one or two) ﬁxed generator matrix as well as some ini-
tial vectors so that approximate solutions are sought in the sequence of Krylov subspaces
Km(A, v), the accumulated projection search for approximations in subspaces which do not
involve any Krylov subspaces at all. Instead it uses the sequence of approximations to form
subspaces from which better(closer in distance) approximations are sought. The following
graph can be used to illustrate the whole idea, where xi stands for the approximations to x
and ai are projection vectors of x on some subspaces of Rn. We need to keep in mind that
all approximation vectors xi are also projection vectors.
The following algorithm describes a simple implementation of the accumulated projec-
tion idea, where vector ai is orthogonal to vector xi.
Algorithm 2. (accumulated projection process-AP) The following procedure produces an
approximate vector p to the solution vector x which satisﬁes Ax = b.
Step 1. Divide matrix A into k blocks: A = [A′
1.A′
2, · · · , A′
k]′, divide b corre-
spondingly: b = (b′
1, b′
2, · · · , b′
k)′.
Step 2. Initialize p0 as p0 = αA′b and c0 = α||b||2, where α =
||b||2
||A′b||2.

Step 3. For i = 1 to k
Step 3.1. Construct matrix Wi = [pi−1, A′
i] and vector l = [ci−1, b′
i]′.
Step 3.2. Compute the projection vector pi of x onto subspace
ran(Wi) and the scalar ci(= x′pi).
Step 4. Output p(= pk) and c(= ck).
Note that we have to store the inner product c between projection vector p and the exact
solution x in this process since it is necessary for later use, a major feature not seen in other
iterative schemes.
A direct application of the above AP process leads to the following stationary accu-
mulated projection method(SAP) for solving general linear system of equations. Its con-
vergence analysis can be seen in [7]. Unlike other iterative methods, SAP always use the
original linear system to update the approximations instead of using residual equation, i.e.,
to obtain approximation x(k+1) from x(k), the residual vector e(k) = x −x(k) is not used at
all, that is why it is named as a “stationary” method.
Algorithm 3. (Stationary Accumulated Projection Method-SAP). Let A ∈Rm×n, b ∈Rn
with m ≤n. ϵ be a given tolerance. The following procedure produces an approximation
p to the vector x ∈Rn satisfying Ax = b.
Step 1. Initialize s as s = 0, vector x0 as x0 = αA′b, c0 = αb′b, tol = ||b−Ax0||
||b||
,
where α =
||b||2
||A′b||2.
Step 2. While tol > ϵ
Step 2.1. Use Algorithm 2. to get a projection vector xs+1 of x and
c(s+1)(= x′xs+1) with p and c in step 2 replaced by xs and
cs respectively.
Step 2.2. Calculate tol = ||b −Axs||/||b||;
Step 2.3. s = s + 1;

54
Wujian Peng, Feng Ling and Yan Xia
Step 3. Output p(= xs) and c(= cs).
The convergence behavior of SAP is in general not satisfactory if the block number k
in the AP process is large. Thus an accelerative scheme is usually needed to reach a fast
convergence. In extended Krylov subspace methods, people can usually use a ﬁxed linear
combination of some successive approximations to reach a better approximation (for exam-
ple, Chebyshev semi-iterative methods, SOR with optimal relaxation parameter), provided
that some vital spectrum information is known, which is usually impractical. The following
accelerating scheme for SAP also uses the combinations of two neighboring approxima-
tions to get a better approximation, however it does not need any information about the
spectrum of any ﬁxed matrix at all.
Algorithm 4. (A Modiﬁed Stationary Accumulated Projection Method-MSAP version 1).
Let A ∈Rn×n, b ∈Rn. ϵ be a given tolerance. The following procedure produces an
approximation p to the solution x of system Ax = b.
Step 1. Construct Householder matrix H such that Hb = βe1 with
β = ||b||.
Step 2. Update A by A := HA.
Step 3. While t > ϵ
Step 3.1. Use Algorithm 2. to get a projection vector x(k+1) of x and
c(k+1)(= x′x(k+1)) with p and c the initial projection vector
and the corresponding scalar taken as x(k) and c(k) respec-
tively;
Step 3.2. Calculate the projection p of x onto subspace W
=
span{x(k+1), xk)} and scalar c = x′p. Rename p and c
as x(k+1) and c(k+1) respectively;
Step 3.3. Calculate t = ||b −Ax(k+1)||/||b||;
Step 3.4. k = k + 1;
Step 4. Output p = (x(k)) and c = (c(k)).
It is attempting to increase the dimension of the subspace W in Algorithm 4. step 3.2 to get
a better convergence speed. Unfortunately this seems not work well since the “distance”
between {x(k)}m
1 are not far enough and thus the submatrix formed by these vectors tends
to be ill-conditioned. Another accelerative scheme is also proposed to handle this problem
in [4], which shows an amazing improvement on the convergence speed in the numerical
experiments.

Accumulated Line-Projection Method
As we have seen in previous section, LP method usually has a slow convergence rate and
needs to be accelerated in someway, while the accelerated LP algorithm requires the itera-

55
tive matrix G to be symmetric, i.e., both a forward and backward LP process are needed,
and the convergence rate can be improved signiﬁcantly only when the distance between the
ﬁrst and second largest eigenvalues is big enough. These restrictions may be too harsh in
many situations.
In this section we show how to remove the restrictions on the LP methods while it
can reach an even faster convergence by applying the AP technique introduced in previous
section.
3.1.
Basic Accumulated Line Projection Process
The following algorithm depicts the line projection method improved through AP tech-
nique.
Algorithm 5. (Accumulated Line Projection). Let A ∈Rn×n, b ∈Rn. ϵ be a given
tolerance. The following procedure produces an approximation to the solution x of system
Ax = b.
step 1. Construct Householder matrix H such that Hb = βe1, where e1 is
the ﬁrst column vector of identity matrix I ∈Rn×n. Construct ˜A as
˜A = HA.
step 2. Let ai (i = 2 · · ·n) be the ith row vector of matrix ˜A, update ai
(i = 2, · · ·n) by ai = ai/||ai||, i.e, each row vector has a unit length.
step3. Set k = 1, x1 = a1, p1 = x1 . Do until convergence
step 3.1. For i = 2 to n
update pk by pk = pk −(aipk)a′
i
End-for
step 3.2. Find
the
projection
vector
of
x
on
the
subspace
span{xk, pk},name it as xk+1.
step 3.3. Calculate residual vector r = b −Axk+1;
step 3.4. if ||r||/||b|| < ϵ, stop. else set k = k + 1, pk = xk, go back to step
3.1.
It is easy to see that step 3.1 is a forward LP process while step 3.2 is the application of
accumulate projection technique. To practically implement the above algorithm, we need
to ﬁgure out how to carry out step 3.2.
In order to ﬁnd the projection vector p of a vector q into a subspace W of Rn, it is
necessary for us to ﬁgure out the inner product between q and all vectors vi i = 1, · · ·k that
form the basis of subspace W. The following conclusion states some key fact to ﬁgure out
this problem.
Lemma 3.1. Let x be the exact solution to system (1), {xk}∞
1 be the approximations to the
exact solution x produced by Algorithm 5., βk = x′xk, then for k = 1, 2, · · ·
(i) p′
kx = βk.

Wujian Peng, Feng Ling and Yan Xia
(ii) β1 = ||b|| and for k = 2, c · · ·n −1,
βk+1 = βk(c1 + c2)
(5)
where
c1 =
βk(p′
kxk −p′

||xk||2||pk||2 −(x′
kpk)2
(6)
and
c2 =
βk(x′
kxk −x′
kpk)
||xk||2||pk||2 −(x′
kpk)2
(7)
Proof. Note that from step 1 we have ˜Ax = βe1, thus x′ai = 0 for i = 2, · · · , n, hence
x′pi
k = x′(pi−1
k
−aipi−1
k
a′
i) = x′pi−1
k
, where pi
k stands for the vector pk before its projection
over vector ai, and p1
k = xk in step 3.1. Therefore we have
x′pk = x′pn
k = x′pn−1
k
= x′pn−2
k
= · · · = x′p1
k = x′xk = βk,
which yields (I).
It is obvious that x′x1 = x′a1 = β1. Since xk+1 is the projection of x over subspace
span{xk, pk}, we have
xk+1 = c1xk + c2pk
(8)
for some real numbers c1 and c2 satisfying
(x −xk+1, xk) = (x −xk+1, pk) = 0
which leads to the following linear system of equations
 (x′
kxk)c1 + (p′
kxk)c2 = βk
(x′
kpk)c1 + (p′
kpk)c2 = βk
The solution to this system is (6) and (7), multiplying both sides of (8) by x′ yields (5).
3.2.
Implementation Details of ALP
Note that in Algorithm 5., matrix ˜A needs to be stored, though the projection vectors pk
needs storage for only one vector. In case the coefﬁcient matrix A is sparse, ˜A is usually
a full matrix, hence we need to ﬁgure out a way to keep the sparsity of A without storing
matrix ˜A and thus bring us some savings of memory usage.
To avoid the storage of ˜A, we have to check its construction. Note that ˜A = HA where
H = I −2vv′ is the Householder matrix that transform b into vector βe1 with β = ||b||,
vector v can be constructed as v = α(b −βe1), where α is a parameter such that v is a unit
vector. Let ω = 2A′v, we can than write ˜A as ˜A = A −vω′, i.e, ˜A is just a rank-one update
of matrix A. Thus the tranformed linear system can be rewritten as ˜A.
 (a1 −v1ω)x = β
(ai −viω)x = 0
for i = 2, 3 · · ·n
(9)
By this observation we only need to store the vector ω instead of storing the whole matrix.
The following algorithm take advantages of (9 ) and avoid storing the matrix ˜A.

Algorithm 6. (Accumulated Line Projection-A practical version). Let A ∈Rn×n, b ∈Rn.
ϵ be a given tolerance. The following procedure produces an approximation to the solution
x of system Ax = b.
Step 1. Construct vector v = ρ(b −βe1), where e1 is the ﬁrst column
vector of identity matrix I ∈Rn×n and ρ is a scalar so that v is
a unit vector. Set ω = 2A′v.
Step 2. Let ai (i = 1 · · ·n) be the ith row vector of matrix A, vi be the ith
element of vector v, i.e., v = (v1, v2, · · · , vn)′. Construct vector
α = (α1, α2, · · · , αn)′ as
αi =
q
aia′
i −2viaiω + v2
i ω′ω
for i = 2, 3, · · · , n.
Step 3. Set y = a1, p = y. Do until convergence
Step 3.1. For i = 2 to n do
c = aip, d = ω′p
p = p −α−2

Step 3.2. Calculate
c1 =

and

−||y||2||p||2 + (y′p)2
update y by
y = c1y + c2p
set p = y and update β by β = β(c1 + c2).
Step 3.3. Calculate residual vector r = b −Ay;
if ||r||/||b|| < ϵ, output y (and β) stop.
else go back to step 3.1.
One can notice that in this algorithm, besides the coefﬁcient matrix A and vector b,
only ﬁve extra vectors p, y, v, ω and α are needed. Thus its storage requirement is very
economy. Now we count the ﬂoat point operations in one ALP loop, the calculation of
each approximation y needs a ﬂop counts of O(n2). In case A is sparse, this is not very
satisfactory. Observing the structure of matrix ˜A in (9), a more efﬁcient ALP process for
sparse linear systems is introduced in the following algorithm.
Algorithm 7. (Accumulated Line Projection for sparse coefﬁcient matrix). Let A ∈Rn×n,
b ∈Rn. ϵ be a given tolerance. The following procedure produces an approximation to the

update y by y = c1y + c2p and set p = y.
update β by β = β(c1 + c2).
Step 3.3. Calculate residual vector r = b −Ay;
if ||r||/||b|| < ϵ, output y (and β) stop.
else go back to step 3.1.
Note that in above algorithm, the operations needed for updating vector p in step 3.1 is
only O(n) for each loop since each vector ai(i ̸= k) contains only a few nonzero elements.
Thus the number of ﬂops needed for calculating vector y is also O(n). As a matter of fact,
this algorithm takes advantages of the following facts.
On the basis of (9), one more step of transform will turn it into



(a1 −v1ω)x = β
(ai −viω)x = 0
for i = k
(ai −(vi/vk)ak)x = 0
for i ̸= k, 1
(10)
where k is the subindex such that |vk| =
max
i=2,··· ,n |vi|.
In large scale computing, a block version of the accumulated projection can be used,
where the projection process can be done by picking up the QR factorization of each block
of submatrix, a more efﬁcient approach is to use the orthogonal accumulated projection
method recently proposed in [7].

Numerical Experiments
In this section we test the above ALP algorithm with some examples, and we also compare
ALP with the benchmark Krylov subspace method GMRES, which is often used for general
linear systems with unsymmetric coefﬁcient matrix.
In the ﬁrst example we use a randomly created matrix as the coefﬁcient matrix, the exact
solution x is taken as the function values of u(t) at grid nodes t = ih (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) with
h = 1/(n + 1) and n = 400, where u(t) = t(1 −t)e1−t. the following table(Table 1) lists
the iteration numbers and relative residual as well as relative errors obtained by running
ALP and GMRES.

It can be seen from this table that ALP is superior to GMRES in this example. Not only
it needs much less iteration numbers to reach convergence, but also the approximations by
ALP have a better precision in terms of relative error as well as relative residual.
In the second example, we use the the unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix A
=
trid{−1, 2, −1.01}, and the solution x is taken all ones. We use both ALP and GMRES to
solve the resulted system and the results are listed in Table 2.

1. Introduction 
Let G be a simple connected graph in chemical graph theory, then its vertices correspond to 
the atoms and the edges correspond to the chemical bonds. The vertex set and edge set of G 
denoted by V(G) and E(G) respectively and for every u,vV(G); e=uv is an edge\bond of G 
(eE(G)) in chemical graph theory. Among topological descriptors connectivity indices are 
very important and they have a prominent role in chemistry. There are many indices for a 
connected graph G.

The Wiener index is the first reported distance based topological index and is defined as 
half sum of the distances between all the pairs of vertices in a molecular graph and introduced 
by chemist Harold Wiener in 1947[1]. If u,vV (G) then the distance dG(u,v) or d(u,v) 
between u and v is defined as the length of any shortest path in G connecting u and v. And the 
Wiener index is equal to [1-5]

We have many connectivity topological indices, for an arbitrary graph with connected 
structure in chemical graph theory. The Randić Connectivity Index χ(G) is oldest of them,

branching and defined as

it has been applied up until now to study the stability of alkanes, the strain energy of 
cycloalkanes. This index is defined as follows:

In this paper we compute these connectivity topological indices ABC and GA for a type 
of Nano-structures that namely: “Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube VAC5C7(S)”. 
2. Main Results 
In this section, we investigate the above presented Connectivity topological indices “atom 
bond connectivity ABC’ and “geometric-arithmetic GA” in a type of Nano-structures 
Nanotubes “Pent-Heptagonal” (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).

The structure of Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube is consisting of cycles with length five C5 (or 
Pentagon) and seven C7 (or Heptagon) by different compound. In other words, a C5C7 net is a 
trivalent decoration made by alternating C5 and C7.

M.V. Diudea [19, 20] denoted VAC5C7(S) nanotube by G=VAC5C7[m,n], such that m be 
the the number of heptagons in the first row of the 2D-lattice of VAC5C7(S) and n be the 
number of heptagons in the first column of it. See the 3-dimensional cylinder lattice and 2-
dimensional lattice of Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube VAC5C7[m,n] in following figures. On the 
other hands, some topological indices computed for Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube in references 
[21-26]. At first to achieve our aims, we need to introduce the following definition.  
 
Definition 1. [25] There are the vertex and edge partitions for a simple connected graph 
G=(V,E) 
with 
the 
Minimum 
degree 
δ=Min{dv|vV(G)} 
and 
Maximum 
degree 
Δ=Max{dv|vV(G)} as follow: 
 
k: δ≤k≤Δ, Vk={vV(G)| dv=k} 
 
i: 2δ≤i≤2Δ, Ei={e=uvE(G)|du+dv=i} 
 
j: δ2≤j≤Δ2, Ej*={uvE(G)|du×dv=j} 
 
Theorem 1. Let G be Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube VAC5C7[m,n]. Then m,nℕ, its atom 
bond connectivity ABC and geometric-arithmetic GA indices are equal to: 
 
 
ABC(VAC5C7[m,n])=m(8n+5
2 - 83 ) 
 
GA(VAC5C7[m,n])=2m(6n+ 8 6

Proof. m,nℕ, Consider G=VAC5C7[m,n] Pent-Heptagonal Nanotube. By according to the 
general form of this Nano-structure in Figure 1, one can enumerate all heptagons C7 in the 
first row\column by number 1,2,...,m and 1,2,...,n, respectively then the number of 
vertices/atoms and edges/bonds of G are equal to  
 
 
|V(VAC5C7[m,n])|=8mn+6m. 
 
and  
 
|E(VAC5C7[m,n])|=12mn+6m. 
 
Also because all Carbon atoms/vertexes in Nanotube G has two or three adjacent thus the 
vertex set V(G) has two partitions with their size as 
 
 
V2={vV(VAC5C7[m,n])| dv=2}→|V2|=2(2m+m)=6m 
 
 
V3={vV(VAC5C7[m,n])| dv=3}→|V3|=8mn 
 
In Figure 1, by coloring the members of E4 and E5 by yellow and red colors, respectively, 
one can see that three possible subsets of the edge/bond set E(G) are as follow: 
 
 
E4=E4*={uvE(VAC5C7[m,n])|du=dv=2}→ e4=½(|V2|-2m)=2m 
 
 
E5=E6*={uvE(VAC5C7[m,n])|du=2 & dv=3}→ e5=4|E4|=8m 
 
 
E6=E9*={uvE(VAC5C7[m,n])|du=dv=3}→ e6=12mn-4m 
 
The 2-Dimensional lattice of G is shown in Figure 1 with this edge coloring.  
 
We now compute the atom bond connectivity ABC index of G=VAC5C7[m,n] Pent-
Heptagonal Nanotube m,nℕ.

APPLICATION OF THE DOUBLE FUNCTION
METHOD TO THE NONLINEAR KAWAHARA
EQUATION
Jiaojiao Zhang and Ruoxia Yao∗
School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi’an, China
Abstract
In this chapter, the exact solutions of the derivation nonlinear Kawahara equation
are investigated using the double function method, which is composed by the poly-
nomials of two functions f and g. As one can see that more general traveling wave
solutions are obtained. This approach is also applicable to other nonlinear evolution
equations.

Introduction
In order to study nonlinear phenomenon better, maybe one can start from the exact solu-
tions of the nonlinear equations of them. Then seeking new solving methods and skills
becomes more important. In the past few decades, a variety of efﬁcient methods have
been used to study nonlinear partial differential and ordinary differential systems, like the
B¨acklund method[12], the Hirota method[15, 8], the Jacobi elliptic method[10, 3, 18], the
tanh method[11, 14, 6], the exp-function method[13, 5, 4] and so on.
More general exact traveling solutions can be obtained using double function method.
In Section 2, we ﬁrst introduce the solving steps of the double function method. Then in
Section 3, the method is utilized to investigate new type exact traveling wave solutions of
the nonlinear Kawahara equation.

The Double Function Method
Let us consider the general nonlinear partial differential equation
F(u, ut, ux, uxt, utt, uxx, . . .) = 0,
(2.1)
where u = u(x, t) is an unknown function, and F is a polynomial of u(x, t) and its partial
derivatives. The main steps of the double function method are given as follows:
Step 1. Consider the following traveling wave transformation
u(x, t) = u(ξ),
ξ = x −kt,
(2.2)
where k is a constant to be determined later. Then using the above variable transformation,
Eq. (2.1) is changed into an ordinary differential equation
F(u, u′, u′′, . . ., u(n)) = 0,
(2.3)
where ′ = d
dξ.
Step 2. Suppose that the solution of Eq. (2.3) can be expressed as the ﬁnite series
u(ξ) =
n
X
i=1
aifi(φ)gn−i(φ),
n ∈N
(2.4)
where f′ = F(f, g), g′ = G(f, g) and φ′ = H(f, g). The positive integer n can be
determined using the famous homogeneous balancing method [16, 17].
Step 3. Substituting Eq. (2.4) into Eq. (2.3), then collecting all terms with the same order
of f and g together, and setting each coefﬁcient of f and g to be zero, we get a system of
algebraic equations for ai(i = 1, 2, . . ., n).
Step 4. Solving the above system of algebraic equations with the aid of Maple, we obtain
the values of ai(i = 1, 2, . . ., n). Then, substituting the determined values into Eq. (2.4),
we can immediately ﬁnd the traveling wave solutions of Eq. (2.1).
3.
Application to the Kawahara Equation
Consider the Kawahara equation
ut + ωuux + ηuxxx + νuxxxxx = 0,
(3.1)
where ω, η and ν are non-zero arbitrary constants. Eq. (3.1) was ﬁrst proposed by Kawahara
[9] in 1972 and plays important role in the modeling of many physical phenomena such as
magneto-acoustic waves, plasma waves, etc. [2, 7, 1]

Application of the Double Function Method to the Nonlinear Kawahara Equation

To construct the exact traveling wave solutions of Eq. (3.1), substituting the traveling
wave transformation u(x, t) = u(ξ), ξ = x −kt into Eq. (3.1) and integrating once, we
obtain
−ku + 1
2ωu2 + ηu′′ + νu′′′′ = 0.
(3.2)
Suppose that the solution of Eq. (3.2) can be expressed by a ﬁnite series
u(ξ) =
n
X
i=1
aifi(φ)gn−i(φ),
(3.3)
where
f′ = F(f, g),
g′ = G(f, g),
φ′ = H(f, g).
(3.4)
Here, we set f(φ) = sinhφ, g(φ) = cosh φ. As we know, f(φ) and g(φ) satisfy the
relation g2 = 1 + f2, then Eq. (3.3) can be written as
u(ξ) =
n
X
i=1
sinhi−1 φ(bi sinhφ + ai coshφ) + a0,
(3.5)
where the positive integer n can be determined using the famous homogeneous balancing
method, for (3.2), n = 4.
Hence, the solution of Eq. (3.2) is of the form
u(ξ)
=
b4 sinh4 φ + a4 sinh3 φ coshφ + b3 sinh3 φ + a3 sinh2 φ coshφ
+b2 sinh2 φ + a2 sinhφ + b1 sinhφ + a1 cosh φ + a0,
(3.6)
where a0, a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4 are undetermined parameters.
In the following, according to two kinds of assumptions of φ′ = H(f, g), we obtain
different solutions of the nonlinear Kawahara equation.
Case 1. Assume that
dφ
dξ = sinh φ,
(3.7)
then substituting Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7) into (3.2), and setting the coefﬁcients of sinhi φ(i =
1, 2, . . ., 8), sinhi φ coshφ(i = 0, 1, . . ., 7) to zero gives a system of nonlinear algebraic

changed into

1. Introduction 
Let G=(V,E) be a simple graph. For any vertex vV(G), the open neighborhood of v is the set 
N(v)={uV(G)|uvE(G)}and the closed neighborhood of v is the set N[v]=N(v){v}. For a 
set SV(G), the open neighborhood of S is N(S)=vS N(v) and the closed neighborhood of S 
is N[S]=N(S)S. A set SV is a dominating set of G, if N[S]=V, or equivalently, every 
vertex in V\S is adjacent to at least one vertex in S. The domination number (G) is the 
minimum cardinality of a dominating set in G. A dominating set with cardinality (G) is called

a-set. For a detailed treatment of this parameter, the reader is referred to [1]. We denote the 
family of dominating sets of graph G with cardinality i by D(G,i). The Domination Number of 
G denoted by γ(G)=γ and is the cardinality of a smallest domination set in G. 
Polynomials of graphs are invariant of graphs (i.e., functions of graphs that are invariant 
with respect to graph isomorphism). They are usually polynomials in one or two variables 
with integer coefficients. 
In this report, we state the definition of domination polynomial and some of its 
properties. 
 
Definition 1. Let D(G,i)be the family of dominating sets of a graph G with cardinality i and 
let d(G,i)=|D(G,i)|. Then the domination polynomial D(G,x)of G is defined as 
 
 
D(G;x)=

where γ(G) is the domination number of G. [2-10]. 
 
In this chapter, we determine the domination polynomial for a molecular graph 
TUC4C8(S) nanotube (see Figure 1). Also, through this paper our notations are taken from 
[11,12]. In the following theorem we compute the domination polynomial of G=TUC4C8(r,s) 
(Figure 3) by using the 2-variables generating function [9] and results from [12-21].

Now, we introduce three cases of domination set of a graph G, and compute these sets by 
using 2-variables generating function similar to [9]. 
 
Case 1. We add several vertices of V\DG to an original domination set D. Thus i>1, there 
are 

n
i


Non-Minimal domination sets with size|D"|=γ+i. 
 
Case 2. We remove i domination vertices of an original domination set D and replace with 
minimal number of vertices (j) of G to create a new domination set. In this case, a non-
minimum domination set with size strictly larger than γ(γ+j-i>γ) named by Minimal 
domination set D'. 
 
Case 3. We add several vertices to a Minimal domination set D'. i,j,k>1, there are 

n
j
k


 
Non-Minimal domination sets with size |D"|=γ+j-i+k. 
 
By these terminologies, we have following theorem for the domination polynomial of 
molecular graph TUC4C8(r;s) Nanotubes. 
 
Theorem 1. The domination polynomial of G=TUC4C8(r;s) Nanotubes is equal to: 
 
D(G;x)=D1(G;x)+D3(G;x)-2xγ

Figure 3. The 2-Dimensional lattice) of TUC4C8(r, s) Nanotubes. 
First, by using the descriptions of M.V. Diudea [12], we denote the molecular graph of 
TUC4C8(S) Nanotubes by G=TUC4C8(r,s), since there are s numbers of OctagonsC8 in a 
column and r numbers of OctagonsC8 in a row (See Figure 1 and Figure 3). Following we 
determine the domination polynomial of TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotubes. To computing the 
domination polynomial of G some terminologies are necessary. 
 
Definition 1 [9]. We say that a sub-graph H=TUC4C8(1,1) (or octagon C8) of graph G is a 
block and the block number of G is equal to the minimal number of vertices of H, which 
shows by θ. The block H=TUC4C8(1,1) has 12 vertices, 14 edges and θ=8 (Figure 2).

In this section, first we consider some parts of the graph G=TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotubes and then 
we can compute the domination number and domination polynomial of G. 
From Figure 3 and results in [9], we see that the general form of TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotubes 
has only two original domination sets 
 
 
D1={v2,v5,v10,v13,…,v8rs-6,v8rs-3}{v8rs+1,v8rs+3, …,v8rs+2r-1}, 
 
 
D2={v3,v8,v11,v16,…,v8rs-5,v8rs} {v8rs+2,v8rs+4,…,v8rs+2r} 
 
such that γ=|D1|=|D2|=r(2s+1) and D1∩D2=, (see Figure 3).  
Also, from Figure 1 and 3, it’s easy to see that G=TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotubes is equal to 
G’=TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotorus by adding the foursquareC4’s in the first row of Nanotorus. In 
other 
word, 
G=TUC4C8(r,s)=G’ 
Λ 
(Λ={v8rs+1,v8rs+2,…, 
v8rs+2r}) 
and 
obviously 
V(G’)V(G)&E(G’)E(G). 
Thus, we can compute domination polynomial of G=TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotubes by using the 
results from [9] and its main theorem.  
First, if there are not any vertex v of set Λ (foursquareC4of the first row) or any vertex v 
in an octagon C8 of the end row with degree 2 to original domination set D1 (or D2), then we 
can add tow vertices v',v" in this domination set by 4 ways. Since dv=2 and has two adjacent 
vertices v1,v2. Thus one of pair vertices (v1,v2),(v1,u2), (v1,u1), (v2,u1) do dominate to v. (See 
part A of Figure 4). 
 
 
Figure 4. A vertex v in the first row or in the end row of degree 2 and its adjacent (A)and a vertex v in 
two blocks B1, B2 of degree 3 and its adjacent (B). 
Now, by refer to Theorem 1, 2 in [9], start the proof of main theorem. 
 
Theorem 2 [9]. Let G be the molecular graph TUC4C8[r,s] Nanotorus. The domination 
polynomial of G is 
 
 
D(G;x)=D1(G;x)+D3(G;x)-Δ1(G;x)

Figure 5. [9]A "k-consecutive vertices", such that v1,v2,…,vk-1andvkhave been removed. 
 
Theorem 3 [9]. Let v1,v2,…,vkbe k removed vertices from an original domination set D of 
G=TUC4C8(r,s), such that v1,v2,…,vk belong to consecutive blocks B1,B2,B3,…,Bk+1 (Figure 5). 
Hence v1,v2,…,vk are called a k-consecutive domination vertices (2s-1≥k≥1). If we remove 
vertices v1,v2,…,vk, then: 
(i) There exist only 2k vertices dominate to {v1,…,vk,u1,u2,u3,…,u3k-2,u3k-1,u3k}. Thus, there 
is a minimal domination set of G with γ+k. 
(ii) There exist ak=(12.6k+3)/5 distinct ways that 2k+1 replacing vertices dominated to 
{v1,…,vk,u1,u2,u3,…,u3k-2,u3k-1,u3k} and we have ak minimal domination sets with size γ+k+1. 
 

On Domination Polynomial of TUC4C8(S) Nanotubes 
81
Proof of Theorem 1. Let G be the Nanotubes TUC4C8(r;s) for integer numbers 
r,s(|V(G)|=8rs+2r and |E(G)|=12rs+r) and r×sis number of block of G.F or create all 
original domination sets of G, it is obvious that we must choosing two possible vertices from 
all C8’s. Thus 
 
D1={v2,v5,v10,v13,…,v8rs-6,v8rs-3}{v8rs+1,v8rs+3,…,v8rs+2r-1} 
 
and 
 
D2={v3,v8,v11,v16,…,v8rs-5,v8rs}{v8rs+2,v8rs+4,…,v8rs+2r} 
 
are only two original domination sets of G=TUC4C8(r,s)Nanotubes with size 2rs+r=γ(G)=γ. 
So the first term in the domination polynomial of G is equal to 2xγ.  
 
In Case 1 of TUC4C8(r,s). j>1, we add j vertices of vertex set V\D1 (or V\D2) to the original 
domination set D1(or D2) for creating the non-original domination sets D" with size γ+j and 
there are 

Obviously every subset of V with size larger than n-2 is a non-minimal domination set of G. 
 
In Case 2 of TUC4C8(r,s). By repeat all steps of Case 2 (refer to its definition) and similar to 
Case 2 of TUC4C8(r,s) Nanotorus [9],we some terms of domination polynomial of

That generated from [gk(x,y,1)]nk=gk(x,y,nk)=[xky2k+akxky2k+1]nk. 
Since, if we remove j vertices from an original domination set D1(or D2), such that nk 
numbers 
of 
them 
are 
k−consecutive 
vertices 
(1≤k≤2s-1) 
and 
(0≤nk≤r[j/r(k+1)]≤r[2s−1/k+1]), see Figure5 and Theorem3. It is easy to see that we can 
replace 2k vertices with k−consecutive vertices v1,v2,…,vk in only one way and replace 2k+1 
vertices with them in ak ways. Then, their 2-variables function of these created minimal 
original 
domination 
sets 
with 
size 
γ-k+2k=γ+k 
and 
γ-k+2k+1=γ+k+1 
is 
as 
gk(x,y,nk)=xky2k+akxky2k+1 
 
In Case 3 of TUC4C8(r,s). We choose a non-original minimal domination set D' of 
G=TUC4C8(r,s) and add several vertices of V-(D'D1D2) to D' and create a non-minimal 
domination set D”.  
In this case, we construct all non-minimal domination set Di"=Di'{w1,…,wh} with size 
γ-j+k+h, such that Di'=[Di\{v1,…,vj}]{u1,…,uk} and w1,…,whV\(D' D1D2). 
Since, suppose we add a vertex v from D1 (or D2) to a minimal domination set 
D1'=[D1\{v,v1,…,vj}]{u1,…,uk}) such that j<k+2, v≠v1,…,vjD1 and v≠u1,…,ukV-D1; also 
add a vertex u from D1 (or D2) to a minimal domination set D2'=(D1-{u,v1',…,vj'})
{u1',…,uk'}) such that j<k+2, u≠v1',…,vj'D1, u≠u1',…,uk'V-D1. Then obviously D2'{v}, 
D1'{u} are equivalent. In other words, if we consider two sets D1' and D2', then we counted 
them twice times and this is false. So, we have two polynomials D3(G;x) and D3'(G;x). 
Now, we rewrite D2(G,x) as follows:

Also φf is the number of all minimal domination set D′ with size f such that |D′|=f=γ+i 
(1≤i≤γ+r). So, we consider a minimal domination set Di′, where Di′∩Di≠and 
Di′∩Di+1=i{1,2}. Thus by adding every number of vertices of the original dominance set

Lastly, we turn to the recent investigation by Andrews et. al. [3], involving combinatorial
partition identities associated with the following general family:
R(s, t, l, u, v, w) :=
∞
X
n=0
qs(n 2)+tnr(l, u, v, w; n)
(1.18)
where
r(l, u, v, w : n) :=
[ n

X
j=0
(−1)j
quv(j 2)+(w−ul)j
(q; q)n−uj(quv; quv)j
(1.19)
In particular, we recall the following combinatorial partition identities [3, p.106, Th.3]:
R(2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2) = (−q; q2)∞
(1.20)
R(2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2) = (−q2; q2)∞
(1.21)
R(m, m, 1, 1, 1, 2) = (q2m; q2m)∞
(qm; q2m)∞
(1.22)

The outline of this paper is as follows. In sections 2, we record a set of known results
which are found to be useful in the paper. In section 3, we state and prove our main results
associated with the families given in (1.15)-(1.17) and (1.20)-(1.22), which depict the inter-
relationships between q-product identities, combinatorial partition identities and continued-
fraction identities.

Abstract
In this paper, we present a new method to prove that there exists t0 ∈(0, ∞) such
that the function A(t)/B(t) is strictly increasing (decreasing) on (0, t0) and strictly
decreasing (increasing) on (t0, ∞) if the power series A(t) = P∞
k=0 aktk and B(t) =
P∞
k=0 bktk converging on R with bk > 0 for all k and there exists m ∈N such that
the non-constant sequence {ak/bk} is increasing (decreasing) for 0 ≤k ≤m and
decreasing (increasing) for k ≥m.

Introduction
In 1955, Biernacki and J. Krzy˙z [1] established an important criterion for the monotonicity
of the quotient of power series as follows.
Theorem A. Let A(t) = P∞
k=0 aktk and B(t) = P∞
k=0 bktk be two power series con-
verging on (−r, r) (r > 0) with bk > 0 for all k. If the non-constant sequence {ak/bk}
is increasing (decreasing) for all k, then the function A(t)/B(t) is strictly increasing (de-
creasing) on (0, r).
In 2007, Belzunce, Ortega and Ruiz [2] presented a piecewise monotonicity criterion
for the quotient of power series A(t) = P∞
k=0 aktk and B(t) = P∞
k=0 bktk with the radius

of convergence R = ∞, but without giving the details of the proof.
Theorem 1.1 (See [2, Lemma 6.4]). Let A(t) = P∞
k=0 aktk and B(t) = P∞
k=0 bktk be
two power series converging on (−∞, ∞) with bk > 0 for all k. If there exists m ∈N
such that the non-constant sequence {ak/bk} is increasing (decreasing) for 0 ≤k ≤m
and decreasing (increasing) for k ≥m, then there exists t0 ∈(0, ∞) such that the function
A(t)/B(t) is strictly increasing (decreasing) on (0, t0) and strictly decreasing (increasing)
on (t0, ∞).
Very recently, Yang, Chu and Wang [3] give a strict proof of Theorem 1.1. The purpose
of this short note is to give a new and strict proof of Theorem 1.1.
2.
Proof of Theorem 1.1
In order to prove Theorem 1.1 we need two lemmas, which we present in this section.
Lemma 2.1 (see [3, Theorem 2.1]). Let A(t) = P∞
k=0 aktk and B(t) = P∞
k=0 bktk
be two power series converging on (−r, r) (r > 0) with bk
> 0 for all k, and
HA,B(t) = A′(t)B(t)/B′(t) −A(t). If HA,B(r−) < (>)0 and there exists m ∈N such
that the non-constant sequence {ak/bk} is increasing (decreasing) for 0 ≤k ≤m and
decreasing (increasing) for k ≥m, then there exists t0 ∈(0, r) such that the function
A(t)/B(t) is strictly increasing (decreasing) on (0, t0) and strictly decreasing (increasing)
on (t0, r).
Lemma 2.2. Let U(t) = P∞
k=0 uktk and V (t) = P∞
k=0 vktk be two power series converg-
ing on R with uk, vk > 0 for all k. Then
U(t)
V (t) ≥lim
n→∞min
k≤n

(2.1)
for all t > 0 if limk→∞uk/vk = λ > 0 or ∞.
Proof . Let Un(t) = Pn
k=0 uktk and Vn(t) = Pn
k=0 vktk. Then we clearly see that
Un(t) =

Vn(t),

(2.2)
for all t > 0.
It follows from the sequence {mink≤n uk/vk}∞
n=0 is decreasing and uk/vk > 0 that
there exists the limit limn→∞mink≤n(uk/vk). Therefore, the ﬁrst inequality of (2.1) fol-
lows from (2.2).
Next, we prove the second inequality of (2.1). We divide the proof into two cases.

positive integer K such that

integer K∗such that

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We only prove the desired result in the case of the sequence {ak/bk}
is increasing for 0 ≤k ≤m and decreasing for k ≥m. From Lemma 2.1 it sufﬁces to
prove that HA,B(∞) = limt→∞[A′(t)B(t)/B′(t) −A(t)] < 0. To this end, we write
B′ (t) HA,B(t) as
B′(t)HA,B(t) = A′(t)B(t) −A(t)B′(t)

Abstract
The present paper is concerned with a study of water waves generated due to pres-
ence of a line singularity (source) with time dependent strength in ocean with porous
bottom. The expression for the potential function is obtained by solving the corre-
sponding initial value problem by using Laplace transform technique. The free surface
depression is obtained for various forms of source strength and are depicted graphi-
cally for different time and distances.
Keywords: source, time dependent strength, source potential, free surface depression, time

Introduction
Velocity potentials due to presence of various types of singularities commonly known as
source potentials, have wide application in the linearized theory of water waves. In the
problems concerning scattering and radiation of water waves due to presence of bodies
of various conﬁgurations, the resulting motion in water can be described by a series of
singularities placed on the bodies. Also, various problems concerning water wave inter-
action with inﬁnitely long cylinder submerged or ﬂoating on surface of water have been
investigated using linear theory by employing general expansion for wave potential. This
expansion involves a general combination of a regular wave, a wave source, a wave dipole
and a regular wave free part. Thus it is extremely important to construct source potentials
which are singular solutions of Laplace Equation. In the present paper we have considered

two dimensional problem of generation of water waves due to time dependent source sub-
merged in ocean with a porous bed. The porous structures in coastal areas are widely used
to protect beaches and harbours from the effect of rough sea. Physically, porous structures
are able to absorb and dissipate wave energy. Silva [1], Zhu [2] considered water wave
propagation problems where a porous medium was assumed to lie on a sea bed of varying
quiescent depth. Tsai et al [3] studied the problem of wave propagation over a submerged
permeable breakwater on a sloping porous sea bed. Recently Maiti and Mandal [4] studied
the problem of water wave scattering by an elastic plate ﬂoating in an ocean with porous
bed.They considered a special type of porous bottom ( cf [5]) in which the motion of ﬂuid
inside the porous bed is not analysed and it is assumed that the ﬂuid motion is such that
the boundary condition used by them on the porous sea bed holds good and depends on a
known porosity parameter α. They considered the porosity parameter α to be real, for the
reason that due to percolation at ﬂuid porous interface, only ﬂow resistance is considered
neglecting the inertial effect (cf [6]). They also mentioned that for existence of progressive
waves α must be real. Otherwise if α is complex then there will be only damping of wave
energy and progressive waves cannot exist on the surface of ocean.
The problem concerning the construction of source potentials were investigated by a
number of researchers. Thorne[7] gave a detailed survey of source potentials describing
time harmonic motion due to line or point singularities submerged in water of inﬁnite or
uniform ﬁnite depth. Later these results were modiﬁed by Rhodes Robinson[5] by including
the effect of surface tension. Rhodes Robinson[6] considered the problem of generation of
water waves at an inertial surface due to presence of source with time dependent strength in
deep water. He solved the corresponding initial value problem by using Laplace transform
technique. Later Mandal and Kundu[3] studied this problems in water of ﬁnite depth when
the water surface was cover by an inertial surface. Later Chowdhury and Mandal[1] ob-
tained these results in ﬁnite depth water with an elastic cover. The above mentioned works
focused on wave motion when the water region is of inﬁnite depth or it is of ﬁnite depth
with a rigid bottom.
However, in real situation,it is important to consider the effect of porous sea bed instead
of rigid sea bed on the wave motion due to the presence of singularities. This motivated us
in studying the wave motion due to fundamental line singularities in water with porous bot-
tom. In the present work the condition at the porous bed has been assumed after Maiti and
Mandal ([4]). The problems of generation of water waves due to presence of singularities or
source can be mathematically viewed as a initial and/ or boundary value problem for the po-
tential function (Source potential) satisfying Laplace equation in the ﬂuid region except at
a point where the source is present together with initial condition and boundary conditions.
The boundary conditions satisﬁed by the potential function are Churchill type condition at
one boundary (free surface) and Neumann type conditions at other boundaries. However,
unlike in the case of rigid bottom where the potential function satisﬁes Neumann type con-
dition at the bottom, in case of porous bottom, the potential function satisﬁes Churchill
type condition at the bottom. This paper is concerned with a study of waves due to presence
of line singularity with time dependent strength. The corresponding initial cum boundary
value problem is solved by using the Laplace transform technique. The expression for po-
tential function and the free surface depression is obtained by considering three different
forms of source strength and depicted graphically for different time and distances and for

different values of porosity parameter. The known results are obtained from the present
study by making porosity parameter zero. It is observed from the numerical results that the
free surface depression exhibits oscillatory behavior for different time and distance. As the
distance from the source point increases the from of free surface depression does not show
signiﬁcant change. Also as the porosity of the sea bed increases, the free surface depression
also increases.
In the following sections we study the problem for solutions.

Waves Due to Line Source with Time Dependent Strength
in Water with Porous Bottom
Problem Formulation
We choose a rectangular cartesian coordinate system in which y axis is chosen downwards
and xz plane is along the mean free surface of water occupying the region 0 < y < h.
Here y=h represents the porous bed of water region. Let the motion be two dimensional,
symmetric and irrotational and starts from rest at time t=0 due presence of a time dependent
line singularity of strength m(t) submerged in water at a point (X,Y) (Y > 0).
If G(x, y; X, Y, t)denotes the velocity potential, Then G satisﬁes the following initial value
problem,
∇2G = 0 in the ﬂuid region, except at(X, Y ).
(2.1)
The free surface condition is given by
Gtt −gGy = 0
on y = 0,
(2.2)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity.
The initial condition are given by
G = 0, Gt = 0
on y = 0 at t = 0,
(2.3)
the bottom condition is given by
−αG + Gy = 0
on y = h,
(2.4)
where α is the porosity parameter. The porous effect parameter is in general complex.
However, for a medium in which the resistance dominates the inertial effect, the porosity
parameter α can be taken to be real(cf[8]) .
Also,
G ∼m(t) log(ρ),
as ρ =
q
(x −X)2 + (y −Y )2 −→0.

The form of free surface depression is given by :

η increases as t increases. Similar phenomena is observed form ﬁgs 3 and 4.
From ﬁgs 1 and 3 it is observed that for a particular time ¯t = 4, the height of peak
or depth of gorge in η decreases as the position of source point changes from (0, 0.1) to
(0, 0.2). Similar behavior is exhibited by ¯η for time ¯t = 7.
From ﬁgs 5 and 6 it is observed that for a particular position of the source point, the
frequency of oscillation in ¯η decreases at ¯x increases. Similar behavior of ¯η is observed
from ﬁgs 7 and 8.
From ﬁgs 5 and 7 it is observed that for a particular value of ¯x = 1, the height of peak

or depth of gorge in ¯η decreases as the sources point is moved from (0, 0.1) to (0, 0.2).
However from ﬁg. 6 and 8 it is observed that for ¯x = 3, the change in ¯η when the source
point is at (0, 0.1) is not much signiﬁcant when it is at (0, 0.2). This shows that at large
distance from the source point, the wave proﬁle does not shows signiﬁcant changes as time
increases.
From ﬁgs 1-8, it is observed for source with impulsive strength, η increases as β in-
creases from 0 to 0.1. This shows that as the character of sea bed changes from rigid bed to
porous the free surface depression increases.
The ﬁgures 9 to 16 shows the behavior of ¯η where m(t) = 1,
¯β = 0, 0.05, 1.0 and
( ¯X, ¯Y ) at (0, 0.1) and (0, 0.2). Figures 9 to 12 depicts ¯η against ¯x for ¯t = 4 and 7. In
ﬁgures 13 to 16 ¯η is plotted against ¯t for ¯x = 1 and 3.

ﬁgs 11 and 12. From ﬁgs 9 and 11 it is observed that when the source points is nearer to
free surface, the peak in ¯η increases. Similar behavior of ¯η is observed from ﬁgs 10 and 12.
In ﬁgs 13 and 14 it is observed that ¯η shows more oscillation for ¯x = 1 than for ¯x = 3
for ﬁxed position of source point. Similar behavior of ¯η is observed from ﬁgs 15 and 16.
Now from ﬁgs 13 and 15, it is seen that peak in ¯η increases slightly for ¯x = 1, when the
source point is at (0, 0.1) than when it is at (0, 0.2). However for ¯x = 3 this change is
not signiﬁcant as is observed from ﬁgs 14 and 16. Thus as the distance from the source
point increases, the from of free surface depression does not change signiﬁcantly. Also as
¯β increases from 0 to 0.1, ¯η increases, which shows that porosity of sea bed increases the ¯η.
Figures 17 to 24, shows the behavior of ¯η for different values of ¯x and ¯t when m(t) =

From ﬁgs 17- 24, it is observed that ¯η exhibits oscillatory behavior for various values

of ¯x and ¯t. From ﬁgs 17 and 18 it is observed that for a ﬁxed position of source point
frequency of oscillation in ¯η increases as ¯t increases from 4 to 7. Similar phenomena is
observed from ﬁgs 19 and 20. Also the height of peak in ¯η decreases as the source point
moves from (0, 0.1) to (0, 0.1) as is obvious from ﬁgs 17, 19 and ﬁgs 18, 20.
From ﬁgs 21 and 23 it is observed that for ¯x = 1 height of peak or depth of gorge in ¯η
decreases as the source moves from (0, 0.1) to (0, 0.2). However, from ﬁgs 22 and 24 it is
observed that for ¯x = 3, there is no signiﬁcant change in ¯η for change of position of source
point. Thus in this case also, from of ¯η does not show signiﬁcant change at large distance
from the source point. It is also observed from ﬁgs 17- 24 that ¯η increases when ¯β increases
from 0 to 0.1. Thus the porosity sea bed enhances the free surface depression.

Conclusion
The effect of porous sea bed on the surface waves due to presence of line singularity with
time dependent strength, submerged in water is studied here. Three different forms of
source strength are considered and corresponding forms of free surface depression ¯η are
obtained which are depicted against different values of times and distances. It is observed
that ¯η exhibits oscillatory behavior. For a ﬁxed position of source point, the oscillations in
¯η increases as time ¯t increases. Also, for a particular time, the height of peak or depth of
gorge in ¯η decreases as the position of source point moves down below the free surface.
However, at large distance from the source point the form of free surface depression is
independent of the position of the source point. Finally, it is observed that as the porosity
of the sea bed increases, the ¯η increases. This may be attributed to the interaction between
porous material of the sea bed and surface waves. The known results for rigid bottom are
recovered by making α = 0.

where m ∈N, pi, 1 ≤i ≤m, are functions of positive real numbers, τ i, 1 ≤i ≤m, are
functions of positive real numbers such that
τ i(t) ≤t, t ≥t0,
and
lim
t→∞τ i(t) = ∞,
1 ≤i ≤m
(1.2)
and σi, 1 ≤i ≤m, are functions of positive real numbers such that
σi(t) ≥t, t ≥t0,
1 ≤i ≤m.
(1.2′)
Let T0 ∈[t0, ∞), τ(t) = min{τ i(t) : i = 1, 2, . . ., m} and τ (−1)(t) = sup{s : τ(s) ≤
t}. By a solution of the equation (1.1) we understand a function u ∈C ([t0, ∞), R), con-
tinuously differentiable on [τ (−1)(T0), ∞) and that satisﬁes (1.1) for t ≥τ (−1)(T0). The
deﬁnition of a solution of the equation (1.1′) is similar.
A solution of (1.1) or (1.1′) is called oscillatory if it has arbitrarily large zeros. Other-
wise, the solution is said to be nonoscillatory.
In the special case where m = 1, equations (1.1) and (1.1′) reduce to the equations
x′(t) + p(t)x (τ(t)) = 0,
∀t ≥t0
(1.3)
and
x′(t) −p(t)x (σ(t)) = 0,
∀t ≥t0,
(1.3′)
respectively.
The problem of establishing sufﬁcient conditions for the oscillation of all solutions to
the differential equation (1.3) and (1.3′) has been the subject of many investigations. See,
for example, [1−21] and the references cited therein. The ﬁrst systematic study for the
oscillation of all solutions to the equation (1.3) was made by Myshkis. In 1950 [19] he
proved that every solution oscillates if
lim sup
t→∞
[t −τ(t)] < ∞and lim inf
t→∞[t −τ(t)] lim inf
t→∞p(t) > 1

In 1972, Ladas, Lakshmikantham and Papadakis [17] proved that the same conclusion holds
if in addition τ is a non-decreasing function and
A = lim sup

τ(t)

(1.4)
In 1982, Koplatadze and Canturija [14] established the following result.
If
a = lim inf

Main Results
2.1.
Delay Differential Equations
We present new sufﬁcient conditions for the oscillation of all solutions of (1.1), under the
assumption that the arguments τ i are strictly increasing for all i ∈{1, . . ., m}.

Then all solutions of (1.1) oscillate.

123
Proof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a nonoscillatory solution
x(t) of the retarded equation (1.1). Since −x(t) is also a solution of (1.1), we can conﬁne
our discussion only to the case where the solution x(t) is eventually positive. Then there
exists t1 > t0 such that x(t), x (τ i(t)) > 0, (i = 1, . . ., m) for all t ≥t1. Thus, from
(1.1) we have
x′(t) = −
m
X
i=1
pi(t)x (τ i(t)) ≤0,
for all t ≥t1
and so x(t) is an eventually nonincreasing function of positive numbers.
By (2.1), it is clear that there exists a sufﬁciently large number t2 > τ −1
i (t1), i =
1, . . ., m. Taking into account the fact that τ −1
i (t) ≥t, (2.1) guarantees that

Proof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a nonoscillatory solution
x(t) of the retarded equation (1.1). Since −x(t) is also a solution of (1.1), we can conﬁne
our discussion only to the case where the solution x(t) is eventually positive. Then there
exists t1 > t0 such that x(t), x (τ i(t)) > 0, 1 ≤i ≤m for all t ≥t1. Thus, from (1.1) we
have
x′(t) = −
m
X
i=1
pi(t)x (τ i(t)) ≤0,
for all t ≥t1
and so x(t) is an eventually nonincreasing function of positive numbers. In view of this,
and taking into account the fact that τ i(t) ≤t, 1 ≤i ≤m, (1.1) guarantees that
x′(t) +

pi(t)x (t) ≤0, t ≥t1
or

(Clearly, τ −1(t) = max1≤i≤m{τ−1

Observe that the function f : R →R deﬁned as
f(x) := ex −ex,
attains its minimum at x = 1, which equals fmin = 0. Hence ex −ex ≥0, i.e., ex ≥ex
for all x ∈R. In view of this, (2.8) becomes
(ec)x (t) ≤x (τ(t)) , t ≥t3.
Repeating the above procedure, it follows by induction that for any positive integer k,

Abstract
This chapter is concerned with pullback attractor of Hopﬁeld neural networks with
delays. By using the theory of pullback attractors, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional
and linear matrix inequality, the sufﬁcient criteria on the existence of pullback attractor
are derived. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the correctness of our
theoretical result.

Introduction
Since 1982, Hopﬁeld neural networks have attracted increasingly interests due to their
potential applications in classiﬁcation, associative memory, parallel computation, and op-
timization problems. Such applications strongly depend on dynamical behaviors of the
networks. A large number of scholars have studied some dynamical behaviors of Hopﬁeld
neural networks and obtained considerable results. For example, bifurcations and chaos are
investigated in [1-6], periodic solutions are studied in [7-11] and stability is discussed in
[12-22].
Attractor is also one of foundational dynamical behaviors. The theory of global attrac-
tors for autonomous systems as developed by Hale [23] owes much to examples arising in
the study of (ﬁnite and inﬁnite) retarded functional differential equations [24]. The theory
of pullback attractors has been developed for stochastic and non-autonomous systems in

which the trajectories can be unbounded when time increases to inﬁnity, allowing many
of the ideas for the autonomous theory to be extended to deal with such examples [25-
32]. However, as far as we know, there are few published results on the pullback attractor
for Hopﬁeld neural networks. Therefore, our main aim of this paper is to establish some
sufﬁcient criteria on the existence of pullback attractor for Hopﬁeld neural networks.
In this paper, we consider the following Hopﬁeld neural networks with delays
dx(t)
dt
=
−Cx(t) + Af(x(t)) + Bg(x(t −τ)) + J,
(1.1)
where x = (x1, · · · , xn)T is the state vector, A = (aij)n×n and B = (bij)n×n represent
the connection weight matrix; C = diag(c1, · · · , cn) is a positive diagonal matrix; τ > 0 is
a given positive number; J = (J1, · · · , Jn)T denotes the external bias; activation functions
f(x(t)) = (f1(x1(t)), · · · , fn(xn(t)))T and g(x(t)) = (g1(x1(t)), · · · , gn(xn(t)))T are
continuous and there exist constants l−

The content of the paper is as follows. Some preliminaries are in Section 2. Main result
is presented in Section 3. Numerical example is given in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are
drawn in Section 5.

Preliminaries
First, let us introduce some notation.
Let L be a Banach space C([−τ, 0]; Rn) endowed with the norm ∥ξ∥
=
sups∈[−τ,0] |ξ(s)|,
|·| is the Euclidean norm and C([−τ, 0]; Rn) is the space of all continuous Rn-valued func-
tions deﬁned on [−τ, 0]. Denote by xt the element in L given by xt(s) = x(t + s) for all
s ∈[−τ, 0]. A > 0 (respectively, A ≥0) means that matrix A is symmetric positive def-
inite (respectively, positive semi-deﬁnite). AT denotes the transpose of the matrix A. The
norm of matrix A is deﬁned as |A| =
p
λmax(AT A), λmin(A) and λmax(A) represents
the minimum and maximum eigenvalue of matrix A, respectively.
System (1.1) can be written as
dx(t)
dt
= F(t, ·),
(2.1)
where the map F(t, ·) is deﬁned as
F(t, ξ) = −Cξ(0) + Af(ξ(0)) + Bg(ξ(−τ)) + J, ξ ∈L.
F : R × L →Rn is continuous since f(x(t)) and g(x(t)) are continuous.
Lemma 1. F is a bounded map (i.e., maps bounded sets into bounded sets).

Pullback Attractor for Hopﬁeld Neural Networks

Proof. For every ∥ξ∥≤r(r > 0) ,
|F(t, ξ)| ≤|Cξ(0)| + |Af(ξ(0))| + |Bg(ξ(−τ))| + |J|

It follows from [23, 27, 28] that for any (s, ξ) ∈R × L, there exists a solution x(t; s, ξ)
for system (2.1). We deﬁne a solution operator φ(t, s) which gives the solution (in L) at
time t when xs = ξ, via
φ(t, s)ξ = xt(·; s, ξ).
For the following deﬁnitions and result, see [27].
Deﬁnition 1. Let φ be a process on a complete metric space X. A family of compact sets
{A(t)}t∈R is said to be a (global) pullback attractor for φ if, for all s ∈R, it satisﬁes
φ(t, s)A(s) = A(t), for all t ≥s,
lims→∞dist(φ(t, t −s)D, A(t)) = 0, for all bounded subsets D of X.
In Deﬁnition 1, dist(A, B) is the Hausdorff semidistance between A and B, deﬁned as
dist(A, B) = sup
a∈A
inf
b∈B d(a, b), A, B ⊆X.
Deﬁnition 2.
{B(t)}t∈R is said to be absorbing with respect to the process φ if,
for all t ∈R and all D ⊂X bounded, there exists TD(t) > 0 such that for all
h > TD(t), φ(t, t −h)D ⊂B(t).
Lemma 2. Suppose that F and φ(t, s) map bounded sets into bounded sets, and that there
exists a family {B(t)}t∈R of bounded absorbing sets for φ. Then there exists a pullback
attractor {A(t)}t∈R for problem (2.1).

Conclusion
Recently, there are few published results on attractor for neural networks with delays. In
this chapter, we investigate pullback attractor for Hopﬁeld neural networks with delays.
The sufﬁcient criteria on the existence of pullback attractor are established based on the
theory of pullback attractors and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Numerical example is
presented to demonstrate the correctness of our theoretical result.

STRING FIELD SOLUTIONS
AND PERTURBATION SERIES
Simon Davis∗
Research Foundation of Southern California, La Jolla, CA, US
Abstract
The evaluation of the action of a string ﬁeld action allows the effect of instantons
on the perturbation series to be determined. A string ﬁeld redeﬁnition is found such
that a nonvanishing tachyon background requires tunneling through a potential barrier.
Tachyon condensation then is a nonperturbative effect resulting from the embedding
of the union of Hilbert spaces on the ends into a Fock space on an ideal boundary of
non-zero linear measure.

Introduction
String perturbation series arise from the ﬁrst-quantized formalism. The path integral for a
two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory with couplings given by the metric of the embed-
ding space may be expanded as a sum of partition functions at each genus. It has been
veriﬁed that the unambiguous deﬁnition of the sum cannot be given by a series that is not
Borel summable. Solutions to the string ﬁeld equations, for which action have been evalu-
ated, may be used to remove this discrepancy.
The divergences of bosonic string perturbation theory can be traced to the expansion
about an unstable vacuum. A graph of the tachyon potential clearly indicates the existence
of a nonperturbative vacuum at a nonzero value of the ﬁeld. This result may be derived
directly from the Chern-Simons ﬁeld theory.
Boundary states are predicted by string ﬁeld theory, including the transformation of n
closed strings to n + 1 closed strings after the reduction of the length of the open string

boundary to zero. It follows from this result that the unstable and nonperturbative vacua
are not related by a unitary transformation. Instead, a Bogoliubov transformation must be
deﬁned such that its action on the initial vacuum yields the creation of a new string.

Solutions to the String Field Equations
Several recent analytic solutionsto the string ﬁeld equations have been found to be related to
tachyon condensation and instanton-anti-instanton conﬁgurations. The string ﬁeld satisﬁes
Ψ+ B0
L0(ΨΨ) = 0 in the gauge b0Ψ = 0, where b is the ghost ﬁeld. If B0 =

(2.1)
where {QBRST, ˜B0} = ˜L0, ˆL = ˜L0 + ˜L†
0 and {Bn} is the set of Bernoulli number [1].
The nonperturbative vacuum is deﬁned by a non-zero value of the tachyon and a van-
ishing of the potential for this ﬁeld. Since there is a cubic interaction between the open
string ﬁelds, the tachyon potential has two extrema. The local maximum at the vanishing
tachyon ﬁeld is unstable, while the local minimum at a non-zero value of the tachyon is
stable against perturbations.
These conclusions may be inferred from the form of the action. It can be written also
as a purely cubic integral over the string conﬁgurations which satisfy QA = 0 [2][3]. A
functional having the form of a pure cubic would vanish at A = 0 and any conﬁgurations
with A ∗A = 0. However, there is no new nonperturbative vacuum without a redeﬁnition
of the string ﬁeld.
The QA ∗A term could be removed on-shell by solving the equation QA + A ∗A = 0,
such that QA ∗A + 2
3A ∗A ∗A = −1
3A ∗A ∗A. The form of the potential is V (T) =
a(T −T0)2(T −T ′
0) for T0 > 0. This potential may be derived from an action of the form
Z
D[Xµ] [QA′ ∗A′ + (A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A′
0)].
(2.2)
Equality with the Chern-Simons action requires
QA′ ∗A′ + [(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) −(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0)(A′
0 −A0)]
= QA ∗A + A ∗A ∗A.
(2.3)
Suppose that
A = (A′ −A0) + A1.
(2.4)
Then
A ∗A ∗A = (A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) + (A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) ∗A1

+ A1 ∗A1 ∗A1.
(2.5)
The commutation rules for the star product of the operators is
A ∗B = (−1)|A|+|B|B ∗A
(2.6)
Since the string ﬁeld is a Grassmann odd state,
A1 ∗(A′ −A0) = (A′ −A0) ∗A1.
(2.7)
The inner product of a third string ﬁeld with the star product of the ﬁrst two is deﬁned by a
folding of the modes. The star product of three odd Grassmann ﬁelds is
A ∗(B ∗C) = (−1)3(B ∗C) ∗A = −(B ∗C) ∗A.
(2.8)
An example is
A1 ∗(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) = −(A′ −A0) ∗(A′ −A0) ∗A1.
(2.9)
Setting
A1 = −(A′
0 −A0)Q(A0 −A1) = −A1 ∗A1QA ∗(A0 −A1) = (A0 + A1) ∗A1 ∗A1
(2.10)
is suﬁcient for a solution to Eq.(2.3). A shift of the minimum to zero demonstrates that the
problem can be regarded as tunneling through a potential barrier.
Physical quantities in a bosonic ﬁeld theory increase with the order of perturbation
series as

.
(2.11)
where Icl is the action of the instanton solution tunneling through a perturbative ground
state [4]. A theoretical explanation of the observation of string ﬁeld instantons is provided.
The initial formulation likewise potentially determines a description of a transition from
matter to gravity.
Since the interaction between instantons becomes repulsive when κ2 = |κ2|eiπ, there
will be an attractive force between an instanton and an anti-instanton in a gauge theory.
The equivalent of the instanton-anti-instanton pair is that of a two hyperplanes that are
solutions to the string equations [5]. The tachyon mode of the open string between these
two hyperplanes has been regarded as an indication that this conﬁguration is unstable.
It is known that there is an nonperturbative instanton-anti-instanton solution in N=4
super-Yang-Mills theory that has a negative energy [6] and represents a more stable conﬁg-
uration. The supersymmetric string solutions of a theory that include a super-Yang-Mills
sector, deﬁned by the nine-dimensional hyperplane [7], also would be stable. More gen-
erally, these systems must satisfy the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfeld condition or there is
an elimination of the tachyon [8][9].

Simon Davis
Conclusion
The most recent formulation of string theory is descibed by a cubic action with two extrema.
There is an unstable maximum at vanishing tachyon ﬁeld and a locally stable minimum at
a non-zero value of the tachyon. Solutions to the string ﬁeld equations exist, which predict
tachyon condensation.
A shift in the string ﬁeld can duplicate the tachyon potential. Equivalence with the
standard cubic action for string ﬁeld theory is demonstrated after introducing another string
ﬁeld satisfying two conditions. After a ﬁeld redeﬁnition yielding a purely cubic integral,
the locally stable extremum would be shifted to zero. Then instanton tunneling is required
to achieve a tachyon background. Consequently, this formulation of open string ﬁeld theory
relegates tachyon condensation to a nonperturbative effect.
The nonperturbative effects in the path integral quantization of string theory are de-
scribed by either the addition of Dirichlet boundaries representing open-closed string in-
teractions or inﬁnite-genus surfaces. When the ideal boundary of a surface is a Cantor set
of ends, the quantization of a ﬁeld theory at each end generates a new state in the Hilbert
space. Even though the instanton Hilbert space has been proven to be distinguishable from
the collection of Hilbert spaces on each end in the interior for ideal boundaries of positive
linear measure [10], the countable union of Hilbert spaces on inﬁnite-genus surfaces can
be regarded as the nonperturbative Fock space on surfaces in the class OG [11]. When a
tachyon state is prepared at each end, and the tensor product causes tachyon condensation in
the neighbourhood of the ideal boundary. The embedding of the countable union of Hilbert
spaces in a Fock space on an ideal boundary of non-zero linear measure would represent
the nonperturbative instanton effect of tachyon condensation on the boundary.

Abstract
In this chapter, we introduce a new method of optimization to restore additive
noised images. This method is based on an algorithm of resolution known under the
name Proximal penalty. We make the mathematical study of our method. We present
numerical results which show that our algorithm is effective to solve the problems of
restoration of the images perturbed by noise.

Introduction
Today, image restoration is a very interesting problem in the industry. It is a fundamental
problem in various areas of applied sciences such as medical imaging ([22], [25]), mi-
croscopy, astronomy ([6]), ﬁlm restoration ([10]), and image and video coding ([10], [11]).
Image reconstruction is to recover an original clean image from an degraded image ([24],
[25]). Let us given an original image, we suppose that it was degraded by an additive
noise. In general, a regularization method need to be used in image restoration since it is an
ill-conditioned problem.

u), we try to reconstruct u. If we suppose that the additive noise is Gaussian, the Maximum
likelihood method leads us to look u as solution of the following problem of optimization:
(P)
α := Inf
u∈U ad
1

where
Uad = {u ∈BV (Ω) : J(u) ≤0}

J(u) = Sup

.
We are going to use the Proximal penalty method ([2], [16]) to resolve this problem.
For it we content with presenting the principle of this method. Then, its principle comes
because the problem
(P)
α := Inf
u∈U ad

is equivalent to the following unconstrained problem:
(Pe)
αe = Inf

where
ΨU ad(u) =




if u ∈Uad,
+∞if u /∈Uad
is the indicator function of the admissible set Uad.
So, the general principle of this method consists in replacing (P) by the following
unconstrained problem:
(Pr)
αr = Inf
u∈Bw

ϕ(u, r) = 1
2 ∥Im −u∥2

where r > 0 and h(u) is non-necessarily differentiable function deﬁned from BV −→R
such that

h is a continuous convex differentiable function;
h(u) ≥0 ∀u ∈BV ;
h(u) = 0 ⇐⇒x ∈Uad
so that when (r −→+∞) the obtained solution u(r) tends to u ∈S (the set of solutions of
(P)).
r is called penalty coefﬁcient, h is called exterior penalty function.

In our problem we consider h(u) in the form:
h(u) = max(0, ΠK(u))
where ΠK(u) is the projection of u on K and
K =

div(ϕ(x)) : ϕ ∈C1
c (Ω, R2), ∥ϕ∥∞≤1
	
.
We begin by choosing a penalty coefﬁcient r1 and then we resolve the problem without
constraints:

αr1 = min
u∈BV

ϕ(u, r1) = 1

.
Let u(r1) be the obtained point.
If the quantity r1h(u(r1)) is enough weak, u(r1) is a good approximation of the opti-
mum, otherwise we shall thus choose a penalty coefﬁcient r2 > r1 and we shall solve the
new problem without constraint:
(Pr2)
αr2 = min
u∈BV

ϕ(u, r2) = 1

Main Results
A large family of problems in image processing ([1], [11], [12]), in apprenticeship ([3]), or
in vision by computer ([6], [9]), can be formulate as the minimization of a sum of convex
functions, non-necessarily differentiable ([7], [8], [16]). Here, we are interested in the
problem of restoration of images via the Proximal method.
2.1.
Proximal Method
According to ([2], [15]), its principle is the following one: to the problem

The following theorem summarizes the most remarkable properties of this method:
Theorem 2.1. ([16]) Let φ : BV

and we have
∇φ(w) ∈∂

;
(c) the sequence uk+1 = u(uk) converges to an optimal solution of
α = Inf

2 ∥Im −u∥2

;
(d) the iteration uk+1 = u(uk) also spells uk+1 = uk −∇φ(u(w)).
Proof. Indeed, we have
(a) the function
φ(u) = 1
2 ∥Im −u∥2
2 + rh(u) + 1
2 ∥u −w∥2
2
is strictly convex in u, hence the uniqueness of the solution.
(b) Let w1,w2 and u1, u2 be the associated solutions. For λ ∈[0, 1], denote
u = λu1 + (1 −λ) u2.

Calculation of the gradient:
For the calculation of the gradient, we choose any direction d ∈BV , and a real t > 0.
We have

(2.1)
We calculate the directional derivative of φ in the direction −d.
φ

We have

Hence

2 ∥d∥2
2 −(w −u)∗d
which implies
φ′(w, −d) ≥−(w −u)∗d ⇒φ′(w, −(−d)) ≥(w −u)∗(−d) .
It holds that
φ
′(w, d) ≥(w −u)∗d
(2.2)
From (2.1) and (2.2) it results that
(w −u)∗d ≤φ′(w, d) ≤(w −u)∗d
namely φ
′(w, d) = (w −u)∗d for all d, hence
∇φ(w) = w −u(w).
Since u(w) realizes the minimum of the problem (P(w)), we have

2.2.
Discretization
Being inspired by ([5]), a discreet image is a matrix N × N which we shall identify with a
vector of size N 2 (for example by tidying up it line by line).
Denote E the Euclidean space RN×N and F = E × E. We provide E with the usual
inner scalar product
< x, y >=
X
1≤i,j≤N
xi,j yi,j
and the associated Euclidean norm ∥.∥E.
We are going to give a discreet formulation of what was previously made and in partic-
ular deﬁne a discreet total variation which we shall denote in the same way as in ([8]).
For it we introduce a discreet version of the gradient operator ([28]). If x ∈E, the
gradient ∇x is a vector of F given by
(∇x)i,j = ((∇x)(1)
i,j , (∇x)(2)
i,j )
with
(∇x)(1)
i,j =



xi+1,j −xi,j, if i < N,
0,
if i = N,
and
(∇x)(2)
i,j =



xi,j+1 −xi,j, if j < N,
0,
if j = N.
Here, ΠK(u) denotes the projection of u on K. The space of the noises is given by
Kd := {div(p) : p ∈E × E, pi,j ≤1∀i, j}.
We are going to calculate
ΠKd(u) = arg min

by using a ﬁxed point method ([12]):

We propose the following proximal-penalty algorithm:

If
u1 −u0 < ε and if r0h(u1(r0)) < δ, then u1 is the best and good approximation
of the optimum and the calculations end in the iteration k + 1.
Else, we choose a penalty coefﬁcient r1 > r0, we put r0 = r1 and u0 = u1; k = k + 1
and return to the step 1.
2.4.
Numerical Tests
In this paragraph, we suggest applying this last algorithm for restoration of images with
various choices of the penalty function h(u) = max(0, ΠK(u)).

Conclusion
We proposed a new algorithm, with associated results of convergence, to solve a class of
non-differentiable optimization problems. The main advantage of the algorithm lies in its
simplicity of implementation.
This algorithm can be generalized within the framework of the method for non-linear
least squares problems. The theoretical study of the speed of convergence and the eventual

possibilityof accelerations for these algorithms stays a widely unexplored topic of research.
The results will be of a big contribution to the sciences of the engineer in the future.
Using primal-dual algorithms, we can found similar results in ([6], [7], [9], [10], [11],
[12], [18] and [20]).

the defocusing case and the equation with a plus sign is referred to as the focusing case.
The nonlinear Sch¨odinger equation (1.1) can be written in the equivalent form
iqt = qxx −2rq2,
(1.2)
−irt = rxx −2qr2,
(1.3)
where the focusing NSL is equivalent to the case r = −q∗and the defocusing NSL is
equivalent to the case r = q∗.
The Davey-Stewartson system
iqt −(qxx + qyy) = αrq2 −qφ
(1.4)
−irt −(rxx + ryy) = αr2q −rφ
(1.5)
φxx −φyy = 2α(qr)xx

is an integrable (2+1)-dimensional generalization of the nonlinear Schrodinger system (1.2-
1.3). Note that the reduction r = q∗simpliﬁes the three-component system (1.4-1.6) to the
DSI equations
iqt −(qxx −qyy) = −α|q|2q + qφ,
(1.7)
φxx + φyy = 2α(|q|2)xx.

Through the simple variable transformation ∂x =

In [4], the authors propose an integrable differential-difference Davey-Stewartson sys-
tem
ivt + α1eu(n−1)+u(n+1)−2uv(n −1) + α2eu(k−1)+u(k+1)−2uv(k + 1) −(α1 + α2)v = 0,

−iwt + α1eu(n−1)+u(n+1)−2uw(n + 1) + α2eu(k−1)+u(k+1)−2uw(k −1) −(α1 + α2)w = 0, (1.13)
z1 −z1eu(n+1,k+1)+u−u(k+1)−u(n+1) + z2v(k + 1)w(n + 1) = 0,
(1.14)
where α1, α2, z1 and z2 are constants. In equations (1.12-1.14) and in the following we
always use a simpliﬁed notation for f(n, k, t) by writing explicitly a discrete variable only
when it is shifted from its position. For example,
f ≡f(n, k, t),
f(n + 1) ≡f(n + 1, k, t),
f(k −1) ≡f(n, k −1, t),
f(n + 1, k −1) ≡f(n + 1, k −1, t).
The discrete system (1.12-1.14) can be considered as a spatial discretization of the Davey-
Stewartson system (1.9-1.11)[4]. Under the dependent variable transformation
u = lnF,
v = e−i(α1+α2)tG/F,
w = ei(α1+α2)tH/F,

In [6], the authors investigate a difference-analogue of Davey-Stewartson system
F(s + 1, ˜s + 1)F −F(s + 1)F(˜s + 1) −G(s + 1)H(˜s + 1) = 0,

FG(t + δ) −F(t + δ)G −a1F(s −1)G(s + 1, t + δ) + b1F(˜s + 1, t + δ)G(˜s −1) = 0, (1.20)
HF(t + δ) −H(t + δ)F −a1H(s −1)F(s + 1, t + δ) + b1H(˜s + 1, t + δ)F(˜s −1) = 0, (1.21)
where a1 and b1 are constants. The fully discrete system (1.19-1.21) is an integrable time
discretization of the bilinear differential-difference Davey-Stewartson system (1.16-1.18)
and possesses determinant solutions, bilinear B¨acklund transformation and lax pair [6]. It
is shown in [7] that the system of difference equations (1.19-1.21) can also be derived as a
specialization of discrete two-component KP hierarchy and has a continuum limit into the
bilinear form of Davey-Stewartson equation. Under the dependent variable transformation

(1.22)
bilinear equations (1.19-1.21) are transformed into the following nonlinear difference
equations[7]:
u(t + δ) −u −a1u(t + δ, s + 1)v + b1u(˜s −1)˜v = 0,
(1.23)
˜u(t + δ) −˜u −b1˜u(t + δ, ˜s + 1)˜v + a1˜u(s −1)v = 0,

Soliton equations with self-consistent sources have important applications in many
branches of physics, such as plasma physics, hydrodynamics, solid state physics, etc. Since
the pioneering works of Melnikov[8], lots of soliton equations with self consistent sources
have been studied via inverse scattering methods [8]-[12], Darboux transformation meth-
ods [13]-[16], Hirota’s bilinear method and Wronskian technique [17]-[25]. However, most
results have been achieved in continuous case. Comparatively less work has been done
in discrete case, especially in the fully discrete case. In [26], a direct method, called the
source generalization procedure, was proposed to construct and solve the soliton equations

with self consistent sources both in continuous and discrete cases. The method was applied
there to produce and solve the discrete KP equation with self consistent sources which was
the ﬁrst example of soliton equations with self consistent sources in the fully discrete case.
Moreover, the discrete KP equation with self consistent sources is the only fully discrete
soliton equation with self consistent sources found in the literature until now[26, 27]. The
purpose of this paper is to utilize the source generalization procedure to the difference-
analogue of Davey-Stewartson system (1.19-1.21) to produce a difference-analogue of
Davey-Stewartson system with self consistent sources and clarify its algebraic structure
by presenting its discrete Gram-type determinant solutions.
The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec.2, we construct the difference analogue of
the Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent sources and give its discrete Gram-type
determinant solutions. Sec. 3 is devoted to a conclusion.
2.
The Difference Analogue of the Davey-Stewartson System
with Self-Consistent Sources
In this section, we will apply the source generation procedure to the difference analogue of
the Davey-Stewartson system (1.19-1.21) to produce a fully discrete Davey-Stewartson sys-
tem with self-consistent sources, and clarify its bilinear structure by presenting the discrete
Gram-type determinant solutions.
It is known that the bilinear difference equations (1.19-1.21) have the following form of
the discrete Gram-type determinant solution [6]:

(2.6)
In order to construct the fully discrete Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent
sources, we change the discrete Gram-type determinant solutions (2.1-2.2) into the follow-
ing form:
F = |c(t) + Ω| = |F|,

with cµ(t) being an arbitrary function of t and K being a positive integer. Then we have

Similarly, we can express the functions F(s+1), F(˜s+1), F(s+1, ˜s+1), G(s+1), H(˜s+
1), F(s−1), G(˜s−1), H(s−1), F(˜s−1) appearing in (1.19-1.21) in terms of Grammian
determinants which are the same as the results given in [6].
According to the above results, F, G, H in equations (2.7-2.8) still satisfy the equation
(1.19), but will not satisfy equations (1.20-1.21) again. In fact, they satisfy the following
equations:

in which Fr,0 is a (M + N −1) × (M + N) matrice obtained by eliminating the r th row

the m th column from the matrice F. In addition, ∆cr(t) is given by
∆cr(t) = cr(t + δ) −cr(t).
(2.23)
We can also show that functions (2.7-2.8) and new ﬁelds (2.21-2.22) for r, m =
1, · · · , K satisfy the following bilinear equations:
H(˜s + 1)Qr,m + F(˜s + 1)Lr,m −FLr,m(˜s + 1) = 0,
(2.24)
FQr,m(s −1) −GLr,m(s −1) −F(s −1)Qr,m = 0,
(2.25)
FPr,m(˜s + 1) −F(˜s + 1)Pr,m −GJr,m(˜s + 1) = 0,
(2.26)
FJr,m(s −1) −F(s −1)Jr,m −Pr,mH(s −1) = 0.
(2.27)
So equations (1.19,2.19-2.20,2.24-2.27) constitute the difference analogue of the
Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent sources. In the following, we will verify that
functions (2.7-2.8) and (2.21-2.22) for r, m = 1, · · · , K solve bilinear equations (2.19-
2.20,2.24-2.27).
We ﬁrst show that functions F, G, Pr,m, Qr,m given in equations (2.7),(2.8),(2.21)
satisfy equation (2.19). Substituting equations (2.7),(2.8),(2.10-2.14),(2.21) and F(s −
1), G(˜s −1) expressed in terms of Grammian determinants[6] into equation (2.19), we
obtain the following determinant identity:

Conclusion
In this chapter, a fully discrete Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent sources
(1.19,2.19-2.20,2.24-2.27) is produced via the source generation procedure. It is shown
that how the resulting fully discrete system is resolved into determinant identities by pro-
viding the discrete Gram-type determinant solutions.
In [28], the author applies the source generation procedure to the differential-difference
Davey-Stewartson system (1.16-1.18) to produce a semi-discrete Davey-Stewartson system
with self-consistent sources. It is known that the difference-analogue of Davey-Stewartson
system (1.19-1.21) is an integrable time discretization of the differential-difference Davey-
Stewartson system (1.16-1.18)[6, 7]. It would be of interest to ﬁnd the certain continuous
limits which give the semi-discrete Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent sources
investigated in [28] from the fully discrete Davey-Stewartson system with self-consistent
sources (1.19,2.19-2.20,2.24-2.27).

ON MODULAR RELATIONS FOR
THE ROGER-RAMANUJAN TYPE IDENTITIES

Abstract
The author establishes a set of ten presumably new results which depict the mod-
ular relationships for the Roger-Ramanujan type identities. Several closely-related q-
identitiessuch as (for examples) Combinatorial partition identities, Continued-fraction
identities and Jacobis triple product identities are also considered.

Introduction and Deﬁnitions
For q, λ, µ ∈C (|q| < 1), the basic (or q-) shifted factorial (λ; q)µ is deﬁned by (see for
example, [1], [15] and [20]; see also the recent work [18] dealing with the q-analysis)

where, as usual C denotes the set of complex numbers and N denotes the set of positive
integers. For convenience, we write
(a1, a2, a3, ..., ak; q)n = (a1; q)n(a2; q)n(a3; q)n...(ak; q)n
(4)
and
(a1, a2, a3, ..., ak; q)∞= (a1; q)∞(a2; q)∞(a3; q)∞...(ak; q)∞
(5)
In Chapter 16 of his celebrated Notebooks, Ramanujan deﬁned the general theta func-
tion f(a, b) as follows (see, for details [1; p.31, Eq.(18.1)]; see also [16]).
f(a, b) = 1 +

= f(b, a) (|ab| < 1).
(6)
so that, if n is an integer, we have
f(a, b) = a
n(n+1)
2
b
n(n−1)
2
f(a(ab)n, b(ab)−n) = f(b, a).
(7)
Ramanujan also rediscovered Jacobi’s famous triple-product identity (see [1, p.35, En-
try 19]):
f(a, b) = (−a; ab)∞(−b; ab)∞(ab; ab)∞,
(8)
which was, in fact, ﬁrst proved by Gauss.
Several q-series identities emerging from Jacobi’s triple-products identity (8) are worthy

Equation (11) is known as Euler’s Pentagonal Number Theorem. The following q-series
identity:
(−q; q)∞=

χ(−q)
(12)
provides the analytic equivalent of Euler’s famous theorem.
The number of partitions of a positive integer n into distinct parts is equal to the
number of partitions of n into odd parts.

Proof. First of all, in order to prove the ﬁrst assertain (29), we apply the iddentity (24). We
thus ﬁnd that

n=0
(−1; q)2nqn2+n
(q2; q2)n(q2; q4)n

(q2, q4, q8, q10, q12; q12)∞(q6; q12)∞
(39)
which in view of the formula (16), yield the required result(29). Further, applying (20) and
(21)(for m=6) in (39), we obtain (30).
Our proof of the third assertion (31) is based upon (25)which can be rewritten as follows

(40)
which in view of the formulae (16), yield the required result(31). Further, applying (19)
and (21)(for m=6) in (40), we obtain (32)
Now, by making use of the formula (26), it is easily seen that

(41)
After suitable arrangements of terms and using (16), we get (33). Further, applying (20)
and (21)(for m=6) in (41), we obtain (34)
Further, by making use of the formula with suitable arrangements of terms of (27), we
have

(42)
which in view of resulty (16), yield the required result (35). Further, applying (21)(for
m=6) in (42), we obtain (36)
Finally, it follows from formula (28) that

(q2, q4, q8, q10, q12; q12)∞(q6; q12)∞
(43)
which by application of (16), yield the required result (37). Further, applying (21)(for m=6)
in (43), we obtain (38). We thus have completed our proof of the Theorem.

1. Introduction 
Let G=(V,E) be a simple connected graph of finite order n=|V|, such that it has the vertex set 
V=V(G) and the edge set E=E(G). A general reference for the notations in graph theory is 
[33]. In graph theory, we have invariant polynomials for the graphs. They are usually in one 
and two variables with integer coefficients. Further, they define by their values. Some given 
examples of graph polynomials are as follows: Chromatic polynomial, Characteristic 
polynomial, Forest polynomial, Dependence polynomial, Independence polynomial,

Matching polynomial, Padmakar-Ivan polynomial, Omega polynomial, Sadhana polynomial, 
Domination polynomial and Cyclically Domination polynomial. For definitions of these 
polynomials see [1-12, 31, 32]. 
It is important to say that the methods of obtaining domination polynomial of some 
special graphs are sometimes various. Most of them are dependent on the structures of graphs. 
Of course sometimes we cannot consider them in general case, but in the most of these 
methods what is important to note that using of combinatorial techniques and principals of 
enumeration are very usual. 
In this chapter, we will denote a new algorithm for obtaining domination polynomial of 
some special graphs like molecular graphs which sometimes computing their domination 
polynomials with classical methods is so complex and difficult to understand. Additionally in 
most of the time will get time taking and slow to run. 
In this algorithm we will try to achieve the domination polynomial a graph G step to step 
with classifying the vertex set of graph G. We use two methods in this algorithm 
(classification method and remove-substitution method). To begin, we consider a subset D 
from vertex set V which is called a dominating set such that each vertex of V-D is adjacent to 
a member of set D. Therefore, one of the important characteristic of graph G is the number of 
all dominating sets D with distinct cardinality. By these terminologies, we will have the 
following definitions: 
 
Definition 1. The domination polynomial of graph G, which shows by D(G,x) is defined as 
D(G,x)=
0 ( , )
n

d G i x



 where d(G,i) is the number of all dominating sets with cardinality i. The 
domination number of G denoted by γ0(G) and is the cardinality of smallest dominating set in G. 
In this paper, we introduce the new index and new number for a graph G, with following 
definition: 
 
Definition 2. The domination index of G denoted by DI0(G) and is defined as first derivative 
of the domination polynomial, in x=1, DI0(G)=

 The dominating set 
number of G is the summation on the cardinality of all dominating sets for G and denoted by 
DS0(G), in other words we have: DS0(G)=D0(G,1). 
2. Algorithm and Methods 
In this section we will introduce two new methods (classification method and remove-
substitution method), which are useful for obtaining the domination polynomial of each 
thoroughbred and shapely graph. 
In this method, we classify the dominating sets of graph G into three subsets in base of 
their members and their size. 
 
Original vertex dominating sets: These sets consist of some vertices of graph that are 
able to dominate to all vertices of graph. We consider the size of these sets with γ0 and we 
denote these sets by D. 
 

A New Method for Computing Domination Polynomials of Graphs 
187
Minimal vertex dominating sets: These sets are the original vertex dominating sets with 
minimal size such that are strictly larger than γ0. We denote these sets by D'. It is obvious that 
if we remove an arbitrary vertex from a minimal dominating set then it will not be a 
dominating set. 
 
Non-original vertex dominating sets: These sets are the vertex dominating sets which 
are not minimal, we denote by D". 
 
Here at the rest of the algorithm we must enumerate the number of all dominating sets 
(Original, Minimal, Non-original), in order to achieve a domination polynomial of a graph. 
By these terminologies, we have the following cases: 
 
• Case 1. In this case we will enumerate all of the original dominating sets D with using 
combinatorial methods. At last we will obtain the coefficient of xγ0. 
 
• Case 2. In this case we will create a minimal dominating set from vertex set V-D with 
using remove-substitution method. First we choose an original dominating set D (arbitrary) 
then we remove i vertices from D such that 1≤i≤γ0. Now it is turn to substitute j vertices from 
V-D to D. Here, we could create an original dominating set with minimal size such that 
i+1≤j≤n-γ0. 
 
This is important to say that for each deleted vertex from D, we can obtain the different 
enumerations of minimal dominating sets of G. Also we use the notation D(G,i,x) when we 
remove i vertices from D (say that Sub-case(2-i) and abbreviated by Sc(2-i)). 
 
• Case 3. In this case we can choose an arbitrary dominating set (original or minimal) and 
add any number of vertices from V-D/V-D' to D/ D' such that: 
 
I. If we choose D then for each added vertex from V-D to D, we can create a non-original 
dominating set. In other words, if we add i vertices to D (1≤i≤n-γ0) then there are 

0
i
n 

 
dominating sets with size γ0+i. 
II. Else, we choose a minimal dominating set D' then we can add any number of vertices 
from V-[DD'N(D')]=FD(FD denoted the set of free-vertices in based D') to D' and create 


|

D

F
 non-original minimal dominating sets D" (|D"|=|D'|+i). 
 
Definition 3. Let D' is a minimal dominating set of molecular graph where |D'|= γ0-i+j 
(1≤i≤γ0, j≥i+1). We define each members of FD'=V(G)-[DD'N(D')] as a free-vertex 
with rooted D' such that

Now it is turn to run the algorithm on the appropriate example. We consider a special 
style of the molecular graphs called Capra-designed planar Benzenoid. Benzene is more 
practical in the chemical, physics and Nano sciences. This molecule is very useful to create 
the aromatic compounds. To begin, we use Capra-Designed Operation for creating the new 
structure of molecular graph benzene. This method was introduced by M.V. Diudea [13] and 
used in many papers (A. Dress and G. Brinkman), see the references [14-29].  
Since Capra-designed planar benzenoid Ca(C6) (in Figure 1) has a very remarkable 
structure, we lionize it and the following theorem is the main result in this paper. 
 
 
Figure 1. The structure of molecular graphs C6, Ca(C6), and Ca2(C6). 
Theorem 1. Let G=Ca(C6) be Capra-designed planar benzenoid. Then: 
 
• The domination polynomial of G is equal to: 
 D(G,x)=x6+18x7+387x8+3123x9+1249213068x10+31686x11+53096x12+70200x13+76758x14

So the domination number of G is γ0=6. 
• The domination index of G is DI0(G)=6230997 and the number of the all dominating 
sets of G is DS(G)=438921. 
3. Necessary Lemmas 
In this section, we introduce several lemmas and we will prove them. Following lemmas are 
useful to compute the number of dominating sets in the next section and also help us to prove 
Theorem 1. At first, we need to the following denotations. 
 
Denotation 1. Let V(G) is the vertex set of G=Ca(C6) with cardinality 24 and E(G) is the 
edge set of G with cardinality 30. Therefore, we name all vertices and edges of G by 
automorphism f as follows (See Figure 2):

f: V(G)→ {vi,ui,wi,ti|iℤ6} 
 
f: E(G) →{vivi+1,viui,uiwi,uiti,witi+1|iℤ6} 
 
where ℤ6 is the set of natural numbers from 1 to 6. 
Now, according to the structure of molecular graph Ca(C6), it is obvious that we can 
consider the vertex set {ui|iℤ6} as an original dominating set D uniquely (in order to Case 1). 
So, we will verify Case 2 (Sub-case(2-i), i=1,...6) and Case 3 in the following lemmas 
(Lemmas 1,…, 6). 
 
 
Figure 2. The Capra-designed planar benzenoid Ca(C6). 
Lemma 1. Let ui (i=1,...,6) be an arbitrary vertex from the original dominating set D of 
G=Ca(C6) which is removed from D. Then there exist ten ways for three vertices from 
{vi,vi+1,vi-1,wi,wi-1,ti,ti+1} dominate to the four vertices ui, vi, wi and ti. 
 
Proof. According to Figure 3-(A), if we choose vi as a dominating vertex, then the vertex ti or 
wi-1 dominate to its adjacent vertices and also vertex ti+1 or wi dominate to its adjacent 
vertices. So we have 4 non-original dominating sets 
 
D'1={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi,ti,wi} 
D'2={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi,wi-1,wi} 
D'3={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi,ti,ti+1} 
D'4={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi,wi-1,ti+1} 
 
with size γ0-1+3=8. Otherwise, if we don't choose vi, then vi-1 (or vi+1) dominate to vi. Also, 
two vertices {ti,wi} (or {ti,ti+1}/{wi,wi-1}) dominate to ui,wi,ti. So we have three minimal 
dominating sets: 
 
D'5={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,ti,wi} 
D'6={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,ti,ti+1} 
D'7={ui+1,ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi,wi-1} 
 
Therefore, the proof of Lemma 1 was completed by using 4+2(3) minimal dominating 
sets with size 8.■

Lemma 2. Let ui and ui+1 (uiiℤ6) are two arbitrary removed vertices from D of G=Ca(C6). 
Then, there exist respectively twelve and four minimal dominating sets of order eight and nine. 
 
Proof. According to Figure 3-(B), if we choose vertices vi+1,ti (or vi,wi-1) as two dominating 
vertices, then we have three minimal dominating sets iℤ6. 
 
D'1={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi-1,wi,wi+1} 
D'2={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi-1,ti+1,wi+1} 
D'3={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi-1,ti+1,ti+2} 
 
with size γ0-2+4=8.Otherwise, if we don't choose vi and vi+1, then we must choose vi-1,vi+2. 
Hence, we will have 4 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-2+5=9. These sets are listed as 
follows: 
 
D'13={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi-1,vi+2,ti,ti+1,ti+2,} 
D'14={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi-1,vi+2,ti,ti+1,wi+1} 
D'15={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi-1,vi+2,ti,wi,wi+1} 
D'16={ui+2,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi-1,vi+2,wi-1,wi,wi+1}.■ 
 
Lemma 3. Let ui,ui+1and ui+2 (i=1,...,6) are three arbitrary removed vertices from D of 
G=Ca(C6). Then, there exist respectively nine and sixteen dominating sets with size γ0+2 and 
γ0+3. 
 
Proof. According to Figure 3-(C) and with using Lemma 2, if we choose vi+1,wi+1,wi+2 as 
dominating vertices, then we have three minimal dominating sets: 
 
D'1={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi+1,w=,ti,wi} 
D'2={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi+1,wi+2,ti,ti+1} 
D'3={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,wi+1,wi+2,wi,wi-1}. 
 
In addition, by choosing vi+1,ti+2and ti+3 (or wi+2) as dominating vertices, we will have 
three minimal dominating sets: 
 
D'4={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,ti+2,ti+3,ti,wi} 
D'5={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,ti+2,ti+3,ti,ti+1} 
D'6={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1,ti+2,ti+3,wi,wi-1} 
 
with size γ0-3+5=8. Otherwise, by choosing vi+2,vi-1,wi+1(or vi,vi+3,wi+1) and wi+2 (or ti+3) as 
dominating vertices, we have 12 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-2+5=9. Some of these 
sets (consist of vi+2,vi-1) are listed as follows: 
 
D'10={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+1,wi+2,ti,wi} 
D'11={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+1,wi+2,ti,ti+1} 
D'12={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+1,wi+2,wi,wi-1}

Else, if we don't choose wi+1, then there exits 4 sets with size 9 such that one of them is 
D'16={ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,ti,ti+1,ti+2,wi+2}. 
 
 
Figure 3. The sub-graph L1, L2and L3 of Ca(C6) that presented in Lemma 1, Lemma 2 and Lemma 3, 
respectively. 
Here, the proof of Lemma 3 was completed by determining 9 and 16 minimal dominating 
sets with size 8 and 9, respectively.■ 
 
Lemma 4.iℤ6, let ui,ui+1,ui+2and ui+3 are vertices from D of G=Ca(C6) which are removed. 
Then, there are 40 minimal dominating sets with size γ0+3. 
 
Proof. In this state, by according to Figure 4-(A) we have two models for classifying vertices 
and counting all minimal dominating sets with size γ0-4+7=9, without vertices ui,ui+1,ui+2and 
ui+3iℤ6. 
 
Model 1. If we choose {vi,vi+3} and {ti,wi+3} (or {wi-1,wi+3}/{ti,ti+4}/{wi-1,ti+4}) as four 
dominating vertices, then we have: 
 
D'1={ui+4,ui+5,vi,vi+3,ti+1,ti+2,ti+3,ti,wi+3} 
D'2={ui+4,ui+5,vi,vi+3,wi+2,ti+1,ti+2,ti,wi+3} 
D'3={ui+4,ui+5,vi,vi+3,wi+2,ti+1,wi,ti,wi+3} 
D'4={ui+4,ui+5,vi,vi+3,wi+2,wi,wi+1,ti,wi+3}. 
 
Model 2. If we choose vi-1,vi+2,wi+1 (or vi+1,vi+4,wi+1) and wi+2,wi+3 (either ti+4,ti+3 or wi+3,ti+3) 
as five dominating vertices, then we have three sets as follows: 
 
D'17={ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+1,wi+2,wi+3,ti,wi} 
D'18={ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+1,wi+2,wi+3,ti,ti+1} 
D'19={ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+1,wi+2,wi+3,wi,wi-1} 
 
Else, if we don't choose wi+1, so we will have: 
 
D'29={ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+3,ti+3,ti,ti+1,ti+2} 
D'30={ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,wi+3,wi+2,ti,t=,ti+2} 
D'31={ui+4,ui+5,vi+2,vi-1,ti+4,ti+3,ti,ti+1,ti+2} 
 
Here, the proof is complete.■

Figure 4. The figures of Lemma 4 (A), Lemma 5 (B) and Lemma 6 (C). 
Lemma 5. Consider the molecular graph Ca(C6). Then there exist 63 minimal dominating 
sets D' with only vertex (ui|iℤ6) such that |D'|=9. 
 
Proof. By referring to Figure 4-(B) and with analogous argument in above proof, we will 
have the three similar models for all minimal dominating sets D' with size γ0-5+8=9. So, it is 
enough to verify one of them. Here just note that,D'∩D={ui}iℤ6. 
 
Model 1. If we choose ui-1,wi+1, vi+4,vi+1 (either vi,vi+3 or vi+2,vi+5), wi+4 (or ti+5) and wi+2,wi+3 
(either ti+4,ti+3 or wi+3,ti+3) as six dominating vertices, then we will have three minimal 
dominating sets as follows: 
 
D'1={ui+5,vi+4,vi+1,wi+1,wi+2,wi+3,wi+4,ti,wi} 
D'2={ui+5,vi+4,vi+1,wi+1,wi+2,wi+3,wi+4,ti,ti+1} 
D'3={ui+5,vi+4,vi+1,wi+1,wi+2,wi+3,wi+4,wi,wi-1}. 
 
Else, if we don't choose wi+1, then we have: 
 
D'19={ui+5,vi+4,vi+1,wi+3,ti+3,ti,ti+1,ti+2,wi+4} 
D'20={ui+5,vi+4,vi+1,wi+3,wi+2,ti,ti+1,ti+2,wi+4} 
D'21={ui+5,vi+4,vi+1,ti+4,ti+3,ti,ti+1,ti+2,wi+4}. 
 
Here, the proof of Lemma 5 was finished by determining the 3(18+3)=63 minimal 
dominating sets of order nine. ■ 
 
Lemma 6. There exist 48 minimal dominating sets D' without any member of D with size 
eight. 
 
Proof. According to Figure 4-(C) and Lemma 5, it is obvious that we have 3×16=48 minimal 
dominating sets with vertices vi,vi+3 and wi+1 (i=1,2,3). These sets are listed as follows:  
 
D'1={vi,vi+3,wi+1,wi+2,wi+4,wi+5,wi,wi+3} 
D'2={vi,vi+3,wi+1,wi+2,wi+4,wi+5,ti+1,wi+3} 
D'3={vi,vi+3,wi+4,wi+5,ti+2,wi+2ti+1,wi+3} 
D'4={vi,vi+3,wi+4,wi+5,ti+3,ti+2ti+1,wi+3} 
D'5={vi,vi+3,wi+1,wi+2,wi+4,wi+5,wi,ti+4}

D'12={vi,vi+3,ti+2,wi+2,wi+5,ti+5,ti+1,ti+3}

D'14={vi,vi+3,ti+3,ti+2,wi+4,wi+5,ti+1,ti+3} 
D'15={vi,vi+3,ti+3,ti+2,wi+5,ti+5,ti+1,ti+3} 
D'16={vi,vi+3,ti+3,ti+2,ti,ti+5,ti+1,ti+3}.■ 
4. Main Results and Discussion 
In this section, the desired results and the proof of Theorem 1 can be obtained easily by 
applying all lemmas and models introduced in the previous section. In addition, to achieve 
our aims we need to the following definitions. 
 
Definition 4. If we remove k vertices from an original dominating set D of molecular graph 
G. Then d(G,x,k) is the number of dominating set of G without these k removed vertices 
(0≤k≤γ0) and we have D(G,x)=

We are now equipped to prove Theorem 1, by running the presented algorithm in this 
paper. It is obvious that 
 
 
D(Ca(C6),x)=

D(Ca(C6),x,k). 
 
Proof of Theorem 1. Let G be the molecular graph Ca(C6). In order to the unique original 
dominating set of G (D={u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6} with minimum size 6), we see that there exits 18 
free-vertices for dominating set D. Thus, 
 
 
D(G,x,0)=

Now if we remove some vertices from D={ui|iℤ6} we will have the following Sub-cases 
with using all free-vertices and several substitute vertices (see Case 2 in Section 2). 
 
• Sc(2-1). If we remove a vertex ui from D. According to Lemma 1, we can add three 
vertices from vi,vi+1,vi-1,ti,ti+1,wi,wi-1 to D-{ui} in ten ways and the size of these minimal

dominating set are equal to γ0-1+3=8, with 24-5-8=11 free-vertices. Of course by adding 
other vertices from sub-graph L1 in Figure 3, we have following polynomial. Hence:

• Sc(2-2). If we remove two arbitrary vertices ui,uj from D then in order to distance of i 
and j, we will have: 
 
Sc(2-2)1. If j=i+1 then according to Lemma 2, by adding vertices of {vi,vi+1,vi+2,vi-
1,ti,ti+1,ti+2,wi-1,wi,wi+1} to the vertex set D-{ui,ui+1}, we can make 12 minimal dominating sets 
with size γ0-2+4=8 and 4 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-2+5=9 (see Figure 3-(B)). 
And since there are eight free-vertices, therefore we have:

Sc(2-2)2. If j=i+2 (see Figure 5) then we add a vertex vi+1 to D-{ui,ui+2}. Therefore, we 
can add other vertices (four vertices) to {ui+1,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5,vi+1} in 3×3 ways and create a 
minimal dominating set with size γ0-2+1+4=9. Otherwise, according to Lemma 1, we can 
add 3+3 vertices to {ui+1,ui+3,ui+4,ui+5} in 7×7 ways and create a minimal dominating set with 
size γ0-2+6=10. Also with five free-vertices, we have:

Sc(2-2)3. Otherwise, j=i+3 then according to Lemma 1 and Figure 5, it is obvious that we 
have 100 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-2+6=10. Since there exist 4 free-vertices, 
thus:

Sc(2-3). In this Sub-case, we remove three vertices ui, uj, uk from D and in order to

nine minimal dominating sets with size γ0-3+5=8 and 16 non-original dominating sets with 
size γ0-3+6=9. Hence:

such that exist five free-vertices. 
Sc(2-3)2. If j=i+1, k=j+2 (or k=i-2) (see Figure 6-(A)) then we add a vertex vi+2 to D-
{ui,ui+1,ui+3}. Therefore, according to Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we have 4×3=12 minimal 
dominating sets with size γ0-3+1+4+2=10. Otherwise, it is easy to show that without adding 
a vertex vi+2 to D-{ui,ui+1,ui+3}, we have 12×7=84 non-original dominating sets with size γ0-
3+4+3=10. Also since wi+4,ti-1 are two free-vertices, thus:

two vertices from {vi+1,vi+3,vi+5} for adding to {ui+1,ui+3,ui+5} then we can create 3×3×7

=189 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-3+2+6=11. But while we choose one vertex from

3
1( ) =441 minimal 
dominating sets with size γ0-3+1+3+2+2=11. Otherwise, if we don't add any vertex of them

3
0( ) =343 minimal dominating sets of order γ0-

So, we will have:

Sc(2-4). If we remove 4 vertices ui, uj, uk and ul from D in order to the distances among 
the vertices we will have: 
 
Sc(2-4)1. If j=i+1, k=i+2 and l=i+3 then according to Lemma 4, with adding seven 
vertices to {ui+4,ui+5}, we have 40 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-3+7=9. It is obvious 
that there are only two free-vertices in Sc(2-4)1. This implies that, its domination polynomial 
is equal to  
 
D1(G,x,4)= 40( )

Sc(2-4)2. If j=i+1, k=j+1 and l=k+2 then according to Figure 7-(A) and analogously by 
applying Lemma 1 and Lemma 3, there exist 4×9=36 sets with size γ0-4+3+5=10. So, by 
adding one vertex from (vi,vi+3)/(vi+2,vi-1) to {ui+4,ui+5}, we have 3×8( )

1 =48 minimal 
dominating sets with size γ0-4+1+2+5=10 and also we have not any free-vertex. Therefore:

Sc(2-4)3. If j=i+1, k=j+2 and l=k+1 according to Figure 7-(B) and Lemma 2, first we 
add two vertices vi+2 and vi-1 to {ui+4,ui+5} now, by adding 3+3=6 vertices to the remaining 
vertices ui+2,ui+5,vi+2,vi+5 we can create 4×4=16 dominating sets with size ten (see Lemma 2).

Otherwise, we have 12×12 minimal dominating sets with size γ0-4+4+4=10 (refer again to 
Lemma 2). Since there isn't a free-vertex, we have: 
 
 
D3(G,x,4)=(144+16)

Thus: 
D(G,x,4)=240x9+1994x10+240x11 
 
• Sc(2-5). If we remove five arbitrary vertices from D, then according to Lemma 5 and 
Figure 4-(B), we have 64 minimal dominating sets with size 1+8=9. Note that these sets have

(Figure 4-(C)), we will have 48 minimal dominating sets with eight vertices from V-D. Also 
since D={ui|iℤ6} is unique original dominating set, therefore |FD|=0 and we have:

Now we can enumerate all dominating sets of molecular graph G=Ca(C6). So the 
domination polynomial of G is equal to: 
 
 
D(G,x)=x6+18x7+387x8+2763x9+14132x10+34296x11+90334x12+150996x13

p1, p2, q1, q2 ∈[0, 1] such that the double inequalities Hp1(a, b) < I(a, b) <
Hq1(a, b), Gp2(a, b) < I(a, b) < Gq2(a, b) hold for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b. Here
I(a, b), H(a, b) and G(a, b) denote respectively the identric, harmonic and geometric
means of two positive real numbers a and b.

Introduction
For p ∈R, and a, b > 0 with a ̸= b. Then the logarithmic L(a, b) and identric mean I(a, b)
of a and b are deﬁned by
L(a, b) =
a −b

respectively. The p th power mean Mp(a, b) of a and b are deﬁned by
Mp(a, b) =
ap + bp
2
1/p
(p ̸= 0),
M0(a, b) =
√
ab.
(1.2)
It is well known that Mp(a, b) is continuous and strictly increasing with respect to
p ∈[0, +∞) for ﬁxed a, b > 0 with a ̸= b. In particular, we have M−1(a, b) = H(a, b) =
2ab/(a+ b) is harmonic mean, M0(a, b) = G(a, b) =
√
ab is geometric mean, M1(a, b) =
A(a, b) = (a + b)/2 is arithmetic mean.
The identric mean I(a, b) was introduced by S´andor in [2], it can be rewritten in the
following symmetric form (see [3]):
I(a, b) = G(a, b)e
A(a,b)
L(a,b) −1.
(1.3)
Then it is well known that the inequalities
H(a, b) < G(a, b) < L(a, b) < I(a, b) < A(a, b)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
Let p ∈[0, 1] and N be a bivariate symmetric mean. Then the one-parameter bivariate
mean Np(a, b) was deﬁned by Neuman [13] as follows:
Np(a, b) = N
h1
2(1 + p)a + 1
2(1 −p)b, 1
2(1 + p)b + 1
2(1 −p)a

.
(1.4)
Very recently, the identric mean I(a, b) and the one-parameter bivariate mean Np(a, b)
have been the subject of intensive research. In particular, many remarkable inequalities for
I(a, b) and Np(a, b) can be found in the literature [1-2, 9-10, 13-15, 16-21].
In 1975, Stolarsky [4]] established that
L(a, b) < I(a, b) < A(a, b)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
In [5] the author and Pittenger [6] proved that the inequalities
M2/3(a, b) < I(a, b)
and
I(a, b) < Mlog 2(a, b)
hold for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b, respectively, where the constants 2/3 and log 2 are the best
possible.
In [7,12], the author gave

αA(a, b) + (1 −α)G(a, b) < I(a, b) < βA(a, b) + (1 −β)G(a, b)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b if and only if α ≤2/3, β ≥2/e = 0.7357 · · ·.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that a > b > 0. Let x = (a −b)/(a + b) ∈

(2.3)
Then simple computations lead to

F ′(x) = 1

(2.5)
where
F1(x) = x(1 + p2x2)

x→1F1(x) = −∞,

(2.8)
where
f(x) = p4x4 −2p2(p2 + 2)x2 + 6p2 −1,
(2.9)
f′(x) = 4p4x3 −4p2(p2 + 2)x
< 4p4x −4p2(p2 + 2)x = −8p2x < 0.
(2.10)
We divide the discussion into two cases.
Case 1. p =
p
1 −2/e = 0.5140 · · ·. Then numerical computations lead to
f(0) = 6p2 −1 > 0, f(1) = −(1 −p2)2 < 0.
(2.11)
It follows from (2.10) imply that f(x) is strictly decreasing on (0, 1). From (2.7)-(2.8)
and (2.11) together with the monotonicity of f(x) we known that there exists λ1 ∈(0, 1)
such that F1(x) > 0 on (0, λ1] and F1(x) < 0 on [λ1, 1). Then (2.5) lead to the conclusion
that there exists λ∗
1 ∈(0, 1) such that F(x) is strictly increasing on (0, λ∗
1] and strictly
decreasing on [λ∗
1, 1).
Note that equality (2.4) becomes
F(0+) = F(1−) = 0,
(2.12)
From (2.2), (2.12) and the piecewise monotonicity of F(x) we clearly see that the
inequality
I(a, b) > H√
1−2/e(a, b)
(2.13)

holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
Case 2. p =
√
6/6. Then (2.9) becomes
f(x) = 1
36x2(x2 −26) < 0.
(2.14)
From (2.5) and (2.7)-(2.8) together with (2.14) we clearly see that F(x) is strictly de-
creasing on (0, 1), then (2.4) leads to the conclusion that
F(x) < 0
(2.15)
for x ∈(0, 1).
Therefore,
I(a, b) < H√
6/6(a, b)
(2.16)
for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b follows from (2.2) and (2.15).

Theorem 2.2. Let p2, q2 ∈[0, 1]. Then the double inequality
Gp2(a, b) < I(a, b) < Gq2(a, b)
(2.20)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b if and only if p2 ≥
p
1 −4/e2 = 0.6772 · · · and
q2 ≤
√
3/3.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that a > b > 0. Let x = (a −b)/(a + b) ∈
(0, 1) and p ∈[0, 1]. Then (1.3) and (1.4) lead to

(2.27)
where
g(x) = p2(p2 + 1)x2 −3p2 + 1,
(2.28)
We divide the discussion into two cases.
Case 1. p =
√
3/3. Then (2.28) becomes
g(x) = 4
9x2 > 0.
(2.29)
From (2.24) and (2.27) together with (2.29) we clearly see that G(x) is strictly decreas-
ing on (0, 1), then (2.23) leads to the conclusion that
G(x) < 0
(2.30)
for x ∈(0, 1).
Therefore,
I(a, b) < G√
3/3(a, b)
(2.31)
for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b follows from (2.22) and (2.30).
Case 2. p =

g(0) = 1 −3p2 = −0.3759 · · · < 0, g(1) = (1 −p2)2 > 0.
(2.32)
g′(x) = 2p2(p2 + 1)x > 0,
(2.33)
It follows from (2.33) imply that g(x) is strictly increasing on (0, 1). From (2.24) and
(2.33) together with the monotonicity of g(x) we known that there exists λ2 ∈(0, 1) such
that G1(x) > 0 on (0, λ2] and G1(x) < 0 on [λ2, 1). Then (2.24) lead to the conclusion
that there exists λ∗
2 ∈(0, 1) such that G(x) is strictly increasing on (0, λ∗
2] and strictly
decreasing on [λ∗
2, 1).
Note that equality (2.23) becomes
G(0+) = G(1−) = 0,
(2.34)
From (2.22), (2.34) and the piecewise monotonicity of G(x) we clearly see that the
inequality
I(a, b) > H√
1−4/e2(a, b)
(2.35)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.

Abstract
We derive some optimal convex combination bounds related to seiffert means.
We ﬁnd the greatest values α1, α2 and the least value β1, β2 such that the double
inequalities α1D(a, b) + (1 −α1)G(a, b) < P (a, b) < β1D(a, b) + (1 −β1)G(a, b),
α2D(a, b) + (1 −α2)G(a, b) < T(a, b) < β2D(a, b) + (1 −β2)G(a, b) holds for all
a, b > 0 with a ̸= b. Here, D(a, b), G(a, b), P (a, b) and T(a, b) denote the second
contraharmonic, geometric, ﬁrst Seiffert and second Seiffert means of two positive
numbers a and b, respectively.
Keywords: second contraharmonic mean, geometric mean, ﬁrst Seiffert mean, second Seif-
fert mean

Introduction
For r ∈R, the Lehmer mean Lr(a, b) [1] of two positive numbers a and b is deﬁned by
Lr(a, b) = ar+1 + br+1
ar + br
(1.1)
It is well known that Lr(a, b) is increasing with respect to r ∈R for ﬁxed a and b.
Many means are the special cases of Lehmer mean, for example, L−1(a, b) = H(a, b) =
2ab/(a + b) is the harmonic mean, L−1/2(a, b) = G(a, b) =
√
ab is the geometric mean,
L0(a, b) = A(a, b) = (a + b)/2 is the arithmetic mean, L1(a, b) = C(a, b) = (a2 +
b2)/(a + b) is the contraharmonic mean, L2(a, b) = D(a, b) = (a3 + b3)/(a2 + b2) is the
second contraharmonic mean.
Investigation of the inequalities between Lehmer and other means has attracted the at-
tention of a considerable number of mathematicians [2-5].
For a, b > 0 with a ̸= b the ﬁrst Seiffert mean P(a, b)[6], second Seiffert mean
T(a, b)[7] are deﬁned by
P(a, b) =
a −b
2 sin−1 
(a −b)/(a + b)
,
(1.2)
T(a, b) =
a −b
2 tan−1 (a −b)/(a + b),
(1.3)
respectively.
Recently, both means P(a, b) and T(a, b) have been the subject of intensive research.
In particular, many remarkable inequalities for P(a, b) and T(a, b) can be found in the
literature [7-16].
Then it well known that
H(a, b) = L−1(a, b) < G(a, b) = L−1/2(a, b) < P(a, b) < A(a, b) = L0(a, b)
< T(a, b) < C(a, b) = L1(a, b) < D(a, b) = L2(a, b)
(1.4)
for a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
In [17], Seiffert proved that
P(a, b) >
3A(a, b)G(a, b)
A(a, b) + 2G(a, b), P(a, b) > 2
π A(a, b)
(1.5)
for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
In [13], the authors answered the question: What are the best possible parameters λ and
µ such that the double inequality Lλ(a, b) < T(a, b) < Lµ(a, b) holds for all a, b > 0 with
a ̸= b.
In [14, 15], the authors proved that the inequalities
p1T(a, b) + (1 −p1)G(a, b) < A(a, b) < q1T(a, b) + (1 −q1)G(a, b)
(1.6)
p2S(a, b) + (1 −p2)H(a, b) < T(a, b) < q2S(a, b) + (1 −q2)H(a, b)
(1.7)

The purpose of the present paper is to ﬁnd the greatest values α1, α2 and the least value
β1, β2, such that the double inequalities
α1D(a, b) + (1 −α1)G(a, b) < P(a, b) < β1D(a, b) + (1 −β1)G(a, b)
(1.8)
α2D(a, b) + (1 −α2)G(a, b) < T(a, b) < β2D(a, b) + (1 −β2)G(a, b)
(1.9)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.

Main Results
Firstly, we present the optimal convex combination bounds of the second contraharmonic
and geometric means for ﬁrst Seiffert mean as follows.
Theorem 2.1. The double inequality
α1D(a, b) + (1 −α1)G(a, b) < P(a, b) < β1D(a, b) + (1 −β1)G(a, b)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b if and only if α1 ≤2/15 and β1 ≥1/π.
Proof. Firstly, we prove that the inequalities

G(a, b)
(2.2)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
Since P(a, b), D(a, b) and G(a, b) are symmetric and homogeneous of degree 1. With-
out loss of generality, we assume that a > b. Let t = (a−b)/(a+b) ∈(0, 1), r =
√
1 −t2
and p ∈{2/15, 1/π}. Then r ∈(0, 1).
From (1.1) and (1.2) we have

f(r) = (p −1)2r5 + (−5p2 + p + 1)r4 + 2(5p −2)r3 + 4(5p2 −p −1)r2
+ 4(1 −4p)r + 4(1 −p −4p2).
(2.11)
We divide the proof into two cases.
Case 1. p = 2/15. Then from (2.11) we have
f(r) = (1 −r)
225
(−169r4 −404r3 + 196r2 + 1136r + 716)

225
(−169r3 −404r3 + 196r3 + 1136r3 + 716r3)
> 295
45 (1 −r)r3 > 0
(2.12)
Notice that in this case, the equality in (2.9) becomes
F(0) = 1
2p −π
2 = 15
4 −π
2 > 0,
(2.13)
Therefore, inequality (2.1) follows (2.6)-(2.8),(2.10),(2.12) and (2.13).
Case 2. p = 1/π. Then from (2.11) we have
−5p2 + p + 1 = π2 + π −5
π2

and
f′(r) = 5(p−1)2r4+4(−5p2+p+1)r3+6(5p−2)r2+8(5p2−p−1)r+4(1−4p) (2.20)
It follows from (2.14)-(2.17) and (2.20) that
f′(r) < 5(p −1)2r2 + 4(−5p2 + p + 1)r2 + 6(5p −2)r2 + 8(5p2 −p −1)r2 + 4(1 −4p)r2
= (25p2 −7)r2 = (25/π2 −7)r2 < 0
(2.21)
for r ∈(0, 1). Hence f(r) is strictly decreasing on (0, 1).
From inequalities (2.18) and (2.19), we clearly see that there exists r0 ∈(0, 1) such that
f(r) > 0 for r ∈(0, r0) and f(r) < 0 for r ∈(r0, 1).
Then from (2.10) we know that there exists r1 ∈(0, 1) such that F ′(r) < 0 for r ∈
(0, r1) and F ′(r) > 0 for r ∈(r1, 1). Hence F(r) is strictly decreasing on (0, r1) and
strictly increasing on (r1, 1).
Note that that equation (2.9) becomes
F(0) = 0
(2.22)
Therefore, inequality (2.2) follows from (2.6)-(2.8) and (2.22) together with the piece-
wise monotonicity of F(r), and Theorem 2.1 follows from (2.1) and (2.2) in conjunction
with the following statements.
If α1 > 2/15, Then equations (2.3) and (2.4) lead to the conclusion that there exists
0 < δ1 < 1 such that P(a, b) < α1D(a, b) + (1 −α1)G(a, b) for all a, b > 0 with
(a −b)/(a + b) ∈(0, δ1).
If β1 < 1/π, Then equations (2.3) and (2.5) imply that there exists 0 < δ2 < 1 such that
P(a, b) > β1D(a, b)+ (1 −β1)G(a, b) for all a, b > 0 with (a −b)/(a + b) ∈(1 −δ2, 1).
Secondly, we present the optimal convex combination bounds of the second contrahar-
monic and geometric means for second Seiffert mean as follows.
Theorem 2.2. The double inequality
α2D(a, b) + (1 −α2)G(a, b) < T(a, b) < β2D(a, b) + (1 −β2)G(a, b)
holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b if and only if α2 ≤1/3 and β2 ≥2/π.
Proof. Firstly, we prove that
T(a, b) > 1

holds for all a, b > 0 with a ̸= b.
Since T(a, b), D(a, b) and G(a, b) are symmetric and homogeneous of degree 1.
Without loss of generality, we assume that a > b.
Let t =

Therefore, inequality in (2.23) follows form (2.25)-(2.30) and (2.45). Notice that in this

The Optimal Convex Combination Bounds ...

From equation (2.44) and inequality (2.61), we clearly see that g7(t) > 0 for t > 1;
hence g6(t) is strictly increasing in (1, +∞), which together with (2.54) implies that there
exists t0 > 1 such that g6(t) < 0 for t ∈(1, t0) and g6(t) > 0 for t ∈(t0, +∞); and hence
g5(t) is strictly decreasing in (1, t0] and strictly increasing in [t0, +∞).
From (2.53) and (2.67) the piecewise monotonicity of g5(t), there exists t1 > t0 > 1
such that g5(t) < 0 for t ∈(1, t1) and g5(t) > 0 for t ∈(t1, +∞); hence g4(t) is strictly
decreasing in (1, t1] and strictly increasing in [t1, +∞).
It follows from (2.52) and (2.66) the piecewise monotonicity of g4(t) that there ex-
ists t2 > t1 > 1 such that g3(t) is strictly decreasing in (1, t2] and strictly increasing in
[t2, +∞).
From (2.51) and (2.65) the piecewise monotonicity of g3(t), there exists t3 > t2 > 1
such that g3(t) < 0 for t ∈(1, t3) and g3(t) > 0 for t ∈(t3, +∞); hence g2(t) is strictly
decreasing in t ∈(1, t3] and strictly increasing in [t3, +∞).
It follows from (2.50) and (2.64) the piecewise monotonicity of g2(t) that there ex-
ists t4 > t3 > 1 such that g1(t) is strictly decreasing in (1, t4] and strictly increasing in
[t4, +∞).
From (2.49) and (2.63) the piecewise monotonicity of g1(t), there exists t5 > t4 > 1
such that g1(t) < 0 for t ∈(1, t5] and g1(t) > 0 for t ∈[t5, +∞); hence g(t) is strictly
decreasing in (1, t5] and strictly increasing in [t5, +∞).
Equations (2.29), (2.30) and (2.48), (2.62) together with the piecewise monotonicity of
g(t) imply that there exists t6 > t5 > 1 such that G(t) is strictly decreasing in (1, t6] and
strictly increasing in [t6, +∞). Note that if p = 2/π, then the equality (2.28) becomes
lim
t→+∞G(t) = 0,
(2.69)
Thus G(t) < 0 for all t > 1. Therefore, the inequality (2.24) follows from (2.25) and
(2.26).
Secondly, we prove that 1
3D(a, b) + 2
3G(a, b) is the best possible lower convex combi-
nation bound of the second contraharmonic and geometric means for second Seiffert mean.
If α2 > 1/3, then (2.30) (with α2 in place of p) leads to
g(1) = 40(1 −3α2) < 0
(2.70)
From this result and the continuity of g(t) we clearly see that there exists δ3 = δ3(α2) >
0 such that g(t) < 0 for t ∈(1, 1 + δ3). Then the equality (2.29) implies that G′(t) < 0
for t ∈(1, 1 + δ3).Thus G(t) is decreasing for t ∈(1, 1 + δ3). Due to (2.29), G(t) < 0 for
t ∈(1, 1 + δ3), which is equivalent to, by (2.25),
T(t2, 1) < α2D(t2, 1) + (1 −α2)G(t2, 1)
(2.71)
for t ∈(1, 1 + δ3).
Finally, we prove that 2/πD(a, b) +(1−2/π)G(a, b) is the best possible upper convex
combination bound of the second contraharmonic and geometric means for second Seiffert
mean.

1. Introduction 
Let G=(V,E) be a simple connected graph of finite order n=|V|, such that it has the vertex set 
V=V(G) and the edge set E=E(G). A general reference for the notations in graph theory is 
[21]. A topological index is a numerical quantity derived in an unambiguous manner from the 
structure graph of a molecule. As a graph structural invariant, i.e. it does not depend on the 
labeling or the pictorial representation of a graph. Various topological indices usually reflect 
molecular size and shape.  
As an oldest topological index in chemistry, the Wiener index was first introduced by 
Harold Wiener [1] in 1947 to study the boiling points of paraffin. It plays an important role in

In this paper we study closed formulas of the Hosoya polynomial and Wiener index for 
Jahangir graphs J2,m for all integer number m≥3. The general form of Jahangir graphs Jn,mis 
defined as follows: 
 
Definition 1. [18-20] Jahangir graphs Jn,m for m≥3, is a graph on nm+1 vertices i.e., a graph 
consisting of a cycle Cnm with one additional vertex which is adjacent to m vertices of Cnm at 
distance n to each other on Cnm.

2. Main Results and Discussion 
In this section we compute the Hosoya polynomial, and Wiener index for Jahangir graphs J2,m 
m≥3. 
 
Theorem 1. Consider Jahangir graphs J2,m for all positive integers number m≥3. Then, the 
Hosoya polynomial of J2,m is equal to 
 
 
H(J2,m)=3mx1+½ (m2+3m)x2+(m2-2m)x3+½m(m-3)x4 
 
The Wiener index of J2,m is equal to W(J2,m)=6m(m-1). 

Hosoya Polynomial and Wiener Index of Jahangir Graphs J2,M 
223
Proof. From the definition of Jahangir graph J2,m, it is easy to see that the number of vertices 
in this graph is equal to |V(J2,m)|=m+m+1 (m≥3). Since m vertices of C2mhave degree two 
(we named it vertex set A) and m vertices of C2mhave degree three (we named it vertex set B) 
and only Center vertex of J2,mhas degree m (we named it vertex c and the vertex set C). Thus 
for ABC, the number of edges in this graph is |E(J2,m)|= 2



=3m. 
From the definition of the Hosoya polynomial, one can see that its first term is equal to 
the number of edges of G.  
From the structure of J2,m (Figure 1), we see that there is one 2-edges path between 
Center vertex C and member of A. And obviously, 3 2-edges paths start from a vertex of A 
and m-1 2-edges paths start from a vertex of B. So, the second term of the Hosoya polynomial 
of J2,m is equal to ½[m+3m+m(m-1)]x2=½ (m2+3m)x2. 
Similar above, from the structure of J2,m we obtain there are m×(m-2) 3-edges paths 
between vertices of A and B. Hence, the third term of H(J2,m,x)is (m2-2m)x3. 
From Figure 1, one can see that the diameter of Jahangir graph D(J2,m) is between two 
vertices of A(the diameter D(G) of G is the maximum eccentricity) 
 
 
D(G)=MaxvV(G){d(u,v)|uV(G)}. 
 
Since all member of B are adjacent with vertex c and then  
 
 
D(B)=MaxvV(B){d(u,v)|u,vV(B)}=2. 
 
Also, for a vertex vA, start m-3 4-edges paths. Thus, the last term of polynomial of 
H(J2,m,x)is equal to ½m(m-3)x4. 
Finally, the Hosoya polynomial of Jahangir graph J2,mwill be  
 
 
H(J2,m,x)=3mx1+½ (m2+3m)x2+(m2-2m)x3+½m(m-3)x4. 
 
By according to the definitions of the Wiener index and Hosoya Polynomial of, one can 
see that the Wiener index is the first derivative of Hosoya polynomial (evaluated at x=1). So, 
the Wiener index of Jahangir graph J2,m will be 
 
 
W(J2,m)=

Here the proof of theorem is completed. ■

Abstract
Let R be a commutative ring with identity. A triangular algebra is an algebra of
the form A =
 A
M
0
B

where A and B are unital algebras over R and M is an
(A, B)-bimodule which is faithful as a left A-module, that is, for A ∈A, AM = 0
implies A = 0 and as a right B-module, that is, for B ∈B, MB = 0 implies B = 0 .
In this paper, we study nonlinear Jordan triple derivable map on the triangular algebra
A and under a mild characteristic assumption it has been shown that if δ : A →A is a
nonlinear mapping satisfying δ(XY Z +ZY X) = δ(X)Y Z +Xδ(Y )Z +XY δ(Z)+
δ(Z)Y X + Zδ(Y )X + ZY δ(X) for all X, Y, Z ∈A, then δ is an additive derivation
on A.

Introduction
Let R be a commutative ring with identity and A be an algebra over R. A map δ from A into
A is called R-linear if δ(x + y) = δ(x) + δ(y) and δ(rx) = rδ(x) for all x, y ∈A, r ∈R.
A map δ : A →A (without assumption of linearity ) is called derivable (resp. Jordan
derivable) if δ(xy) = δ(x)y + xδ(y)(resp. δ(xy + yx) = δ(x)y + xδ(y) + δ(y)x + yδ(x))
holds for all x, y ∈A and δ is said to be a Jordan triple derivable if δ(xyx) = δ(x)yx +
xδ(y)x +xyδ(x) for all x, y ∈A. An R-linear derivable map (resp. Jordan derivable map)

is called a derivation (resp. Jordan derivation) and an R-linear Jordan triple derivable map
is called a Jordan triple derivation. An additive derivable mapping of an algebra A into
itself is called an additive derivation on A. It is straight forward to see that every derivation
on an algebra A is a Jordan derivation but the converse need not be true in general. Herstein
[7] showed that on a prime ring of characteristic different from two every Jordan derivation
is a derivation whereas Breˇsar [1] improved this result for semiprime ring and proved that
on a 2-torsion free semiprime ring every Jordan triple derivation is a derivation. If δ is a
Jordan triple derivation on an algebra A into itself, then it can be easily seen that δ also
satisﬁes the relation:
δ(xyz + zyx) =δ(x)yz + xδ(y)z + xyδ(z) + δ(z)yx
+ zδ(y)x + zyδ(x)
(1.1)
for all x, y, z ∈A.
Cheung [3] initiated the study of commuting mapping on triangular algebras [4]. Let
A and B be unital algebras over a commutative ring R with unity and let M be a nonzero
(A, B)-bimodule. The R-algebra
A = Tri(A, M, B) =
  a

b

a ∈A, m ∈M, b ∈B

under the usual matrix operations is called triangular algebra.
Let 1A (resp. 1B) be the identity of the algebra A (resp. B) and let I be the identity
of triangular algebra A.
Throughout this paper, we shall use the following notions:
P =
 1A
0
0
0

, Q = I −P =
 0


and A11 = PAP, A12 = PAQ, A22 = QAQ.
Thus A = PAP + PAQ + QAQ = A11 + A12 + A22 where A11 is a subalgebra of A iso-
morphic to A, A22 is a subalgebra of A isomorphic to B and A12 is a (A11, A22)-bimodule
isomorphic to M.
In the recent years, the additivity of mappings on rings or algebras has attracted the
attentions of many researchers. This study was initiated by Martindale [9] who proved that
every multiplicative bijective map from a prime ring containing a nontrivial idempotent
onto an arbitrary ring is necessarily additive. Further, Daif [5] proved that each derivable
map on a 2-torsion free prime ring containing a nontrivial idempotent is a derivation. In this
article, it is shown that every map (not necessarily linear) on a triangular algebra satisfying
the relation (1.1) is an additive derivation.
Throughout this article, A, B are unital R-algebras over a commutative ring R with
unity and M is assumed to be a nonzero (A, B)-bimodule which is faithful as a left A-
module, that is, for A ∈A, AM = 0 implies A = 0 and also as a right B-module, that is,
for B ∈B, BM = 0 implies B = 0. From now, we always assume that triangular algebra
A is 2-torsion free.

Jordan Triple Derivable Maps
In the year 2006, Zhang and Yu [11] studied Jordan derivation on triangular algebras and
proved that if A, B are unital algebras over a 2-torsion free commutative ring R with unity,

M is a unital (A, B)-bimodule which is faithful as a left A and also as a right B-module
and A = Tri(A, M, B) is a triangular algebra, then every Jordan derivation on A into
itself is a derivation. Many authors have made signiﬁcant contributions to the related topics
(see for reference [6, 8, 10, 11], where further references can be found). Cheng and Jing [2]
studied the additivity of maps on triangular algebras and proved that every multiplicative
bijective map, Jordan bijective map, Jordan triple bijective map and elementary surjective
map on triangular algebras is additive. Further, Du and Wang [6] studied the additivity of
Jordan maps on triangular algebras. In the present paper, we consider rather a more general
situation when a map δ (not necessarily linear) on A into itself satisﬁes the relation (1.1).
In fact, we prove the following result:
Theorem 2.1. Let A = Tri(A, M, B) be a triangular algebra and let δ be a nonlinear
mapping on A into itself such that δ(XY Z +ZY X) = δ(X)Y Z +Xδ(Y )Z +XY δ(Z)+
δ(Z)Y X + Zδ(Y )X + ZY δ(X) for all X, Y, Z ∈A. Then δ is an additive derivation on
A.
The proof of the above theorem will be organized in the series of lemmas.
Lemma 2.2. δ(0) = 0.
Proof. Clearly, for any A ∈A
δ(0)
=
δ(0A0 + 0A0)
=
δ(0)A0 + 0δ(A)0 + 0Aδ(0) + δ(0)A0 + 0δ(A)0 + 0Aδ(0)
=
0.
□
Lemma 2.3. δ(A12) ⊆A12.
Proof. Note that for any M12 ∈A12, M12 = PPM12 +M12PP for all M12 ∈A12. Then
δ(M12)
=
δ(PPM12 + M12PP)
=
δ(P)M12 + Pδ(P)M12 + Pδ(M12) + δ(M12)P
+M12δ(P)P.
(2.1)
Assume that δ(M12) = S11+S12 +S22 and δ(P) = P11+P12 +P22, where Sij, Pij ∈Aij
for 1 ≤i ≤j ≤2. Applying these relations in (2.1), we have
P11 = 0, S11 = 0 and S22 = 0.
(2.2)
Therefore, δ(A12) ⊆A12.
□
Lemma 2.4. δ(A11) ⊆A11 + A12 and δ(A22) ⊆A22 + A12.

Proof. Since 0 = A11QQ + QQA11 for all A11 ∈A11, we have
0 = δ(0)
=
δ(A11QQ + QQA11)
=
δ(A11)Q + A11δ(Q)Q + Qδ(Q)A11 + Qδ(A11).
Set δ(A11) = R11 + R12 + R22 and δ(Q) = Q11 + Q12 + Q22, where Rij, Qij ∈Aij for
1 ≤i ≤j ≤2. We have
0 = R12 + R22 + A11Q11 + R22.
This implies that 2R22 = 0 and R22 = 0. Therefore, δ(A11) ⊆A11 + A12.
Similarly, we can show that δ(A22) ⊆A22 + A12.
□
Lemma 2.5. δ(P), δ(Q) ∈A12 and δ(P) + δ(Q) = 0.
Proof. Since 0 = PQQ + QQP, we ﬁnd that
0 = δ(0) =δ(PQQ + QQP)
=δ(P)Q + Pδ(Q)Q + Qδ(Q)P + Qδ(P).
(2.3)
Using δ(P) = P11 + P12 + P22 and δ(Q) = Q11 + Q12 + Q22, we get 0 = P22 + P12 +
Q11 + Q12 + Q22, which implies that P22 = 0. By using (2.2), we obtain δ(P) ∈A12.
Similarly, we can show that δ(Q) ∈A12.
Now multiply by P and Q from the left and the right side of (2.3) respectively, we have
P(δ(P) + δ(Q))Q = 0. Since δ(P), δ(Q) ∈A12, we ﬁnd that
δ(P) + δ(Q) = P(δ(P) + δ(Q))P + P(δ(P) + δ(Q))Q + Q(δ(P) + δ(Q))Q = 0.
□
Lemma 2.6. For any A11 ∈A11, M12 ∈A12 and B22 ∈A22,
(i) δ(A11M12) = δ(A11)M12 + A11δ(M12),
(ii) δ(M12B22) = δ(M12)B22 + M12δ(B22).
Proof. Since A11M12 = PA11M12 + M12A11P for all A11 ∈A11 and M12 ∈A12, using
Lemmas 2.3, 2.4 & 2.5, we have
δ(A11M12)
=
δ(PA11M12 + M12A11P)
=
δ(P)A11M12 + Pδ(A11)M12 + A11δ(M12)
+δ(M12)A11P + M12δ(A11)P
=
δ(A11)M12 + A11δ(M12).
On the other hand, M12B22 = M12B22Q + QB22M12 for all M12 ∈A12 and B22 ∈A22.
Similarly, we get δ(M12B22) = δ(M12)B22 + M12δ(B22).
□
Lemma 2.7. For any A11, B11 ∈A11 and A22, B22 ∈A22,
(i) δ(A11B11) = δ(A11)B11 + A11δ(B11),

Nonlinear Jordan Triple Derivable Mappings on Triangular Algebras
231
(ii) δ(A22B22) = δ(A22)B22 + A22δ(B22).
Proof. For all A11, B11 ∈A11 and M12 ∈A12, we deduce from Lemma 2.6 that
δ(A11B11M12) = δ((A11B11)M12)
= δ(A11B11)M12 + A11B11δ(M12).
(2.4)
Again by Lemma 2.6, we know that
δ(A11B11M12)
=
δ(A11(B11M12))
=
δ(A11)B11M12 + A11δ(B11M12)
=
δ(A11)B11M12 + A11B11δ(M12)
+A11δ(B11)M12.
(2.5)
Combining relations (2.4) and (2.5), we get
δ(A11B11)M12 = δ(A11)B11M12 + A11δ(B11)M12.
(2.6)
Since δ(A11) ⊆A11 + A12 and PAQ is faithful as a left PAP-module, the relation (2.6)
implies that
δ(A11B11)P = (δ(A11)B11 + A11δ(B11))P.
(2.7)
Note that PB11Q + QB11P = 0 for all B11 ∈A11 and using Lemmas 2.4 & 2.5, we have
0 = Pδ(B11)Q + B11δ(Q) + δ(Q)B11 + Qδ(B11)P
= δ(B11)Q + B11δ(Q).
(2.8)
Multiplying (2.8) by A11 on the left , we obtain
A11δ(B11)Q + A11B11δ(Q) = 0.
(2.9)
Replacing B11 by A11B11 in (2.8) and combining the result so obtained with (2.9), we get
δ(A11B11)Q = A11δ(B11)Q,
which can also be rewritten as
δ(A11B11)Q = A11δ(B11)Q + δ(A11)B11Q.
(2.10)
Adding (2.7) and (2.10), we get
δ(A11B11) = A11δ(B11) + δ(A11)B11 for all A11, B11 ∈A11.
Similarly, we can prove that
δ(A22B22) = A22δ(B22) + δ(A22)B22 for all A22, B22 ∈A22.

Lemma 2.8. For any A11 ∈A11, M12 ∈A12 and B22 ∈A22,
δ(A11 + M12) ∈A11 + A12 and δ(M12 + B22) ∈A12 + A22.
Proof. Since Q(A11 + M12)Q + Q(A11 + M12)Q = 0 for all A11 ∈A11 and M12 ∈A12,
we ﬁnd that
0 = Qδ(A11 + M12)Q + Qδ(A11 + M12)Q
= 2Qδ(A11 + M12)Q.
(2.11)
Since A is 2-torsion free, we arrive at Qδ(A11 + M12)Q = 0 for all A11 ∈A11 and
M12 ∈A12, which implies that δ(A11 + M12) ∈A11 + A12. Similarly, one can show that
δ(M12 + B22) ∈A12 + A22 for all B22 ∈A22 and M12 ∈A12.
□
Lemma 2.9. For any A11 ∈A11, M12, N12 ∈A12 and B22 ∈A22,
(i) δ(A11 + M12) = δ(A11) + δ(M12),
(ii) δ(N12 + B22) + δ(N12) + δ(B22).
Proof. It is clear that A11X12 = P(A11+M12)X12+X12(A11+M12)P for all A11 ∈A11
and M12, X12 ∈A12. Now using Lemmas 2.2, 2.4 & 2.8, we get
δ(A11X12) = δ(P(A11 + M12)X12 + X12(A11 + M12)P)
= Pδ(A11 + M12)X12 + (A11 + M12)δ(X12) + X12δ(A11 + M12)P
= δ(A11 + M12)X12 + A11δ(X12).
(2.12)
On the other hand, by Lemma 2.7, we have
δ(A11X12) = A11δ(X12) + δ(A11)X12.
(2.13)
Combining (2.12) & (2.13) and using the fact that δ(A12) ⊆A12, we arrive at
{δ(A11 + M12) −δ(A11) −δ(M12)}X12 = 0.
Since δ(A11) ⊆A11 + A12 and PAQ is faithful as a left PAP-module, the above relation
gives that
P{δ(A11 + M12) −δ(A11) −δ(M12)}P = 0.
(2.14)
Also, since M12X22 = P(A11 + M12)X22 + X22(A11 + M12)P for all A11 ∈A11, M12 ∈
A12 and X22 ∈A22, we ﬁnd that
δ(M12X22) = δ(P(A11 + M12)X22 + X22(A11 + M12)P)
= Pδ(A11 + M12)X22 + (A11 + M12)δ(X22) + X22δ(A11 + M12)P.
(2.15)
Furthermore,
δ(M12X22) = δ(M12)X22 + M12δ(X22).
(2.16)

Nonlinear Jordan Triple Derivable Mappings on Triangular Algebras
233
Combining (2.15) and (2.16), we get {δ(A11 + M12) −δ(A11) −δ(M12)}X22 = 0 which
implies that
P{δ(A11 + M12) −δ(A11) −δ(M12)}Q + Q{δ(A11 + M12) −δ(A11) −δ(M12)}Q = 0.
In view of (2.14), the above relation yields that δ(A11 + M12) = δ(A11) + δ(M12) for all
A11 ∈A11 and M12 ∈A12. Similarly, we have δ(B22 + N12) = δ(B22) + δ(N12) for all
B22 ∈A22 and N12 ∈A12.
□
Lemma 2.10. For any M12, N12 ∈A12,
δ(M12 + N12) = δ(M12) + δ(N12).
Proof. For any M12, N12, it follows from Lemmas 2.5 & 2.8 that
δ(M12 + N12)

δ(M12) + δ(N12).
□
Lemma 2.11. For any A11, B11 ∈A11 and A22, B22 ∈A22,
(i) δ(A11 + B11) = δ(A11) + δ(B11),
(ii) δ(A22 + B22) = δ(A22) + δ(B22).
Proof. For any A11, B11 ∈A11 and M12 ∈A12, by Lemmas 2.6 & 2.10, we arrive at
δ((A11 + B11)M12)
=
δ(A11M12 + B11M12)
=
δ(A11M12) + δ(B11M12)
=
δ(A11)M12 + A11δ(M12) + δ(B11)M12
+B11δ(M12).
(2.17)
On the other hand, we have
δ((A11 + B11)M12) = (A11 + B11)δ(M12) + δ(A11 + B11)M12.
(2.18)
Combining (2.17) and (2.18), we ﬁnd that
{δ(A11 + B11) −δ(A11) −δ(B11)}M12 = 0.
(2.19)

234
Mohammad Ashraf and Aisha Jabeen
Since δ(A11) ⊆A11 + A12 and PAQ is faithful as a left PAP-module, the above relation
implies that
{δ(A11 + B11) −δ(A11) −δ(B11)}P = 0.
(2.20)
Since δ(0) = 0 , we ﬁnd that
0 = δ(PA11Q + QA11P)
= Pδ(A11)Q + A11δ(Q) + δ(Q)A11 + Qδ(A11)P
= δ(A11)Q + A11δ(Q).
(2.21)
Replacing A11 by B11 and A11 + B11 in the last relation respectively, we have
δ(B11)Q + B11δ(Q) = 0
(2.22)
and
δ(A11 + B11)Q + (A11 + B11)δ(Q) = 0.
(2.23)
Combining (2.23) with (2.21) and (2.22), we get
{δ(A11 + B11) −δ(A11) −δ(B11)}Q = 0.
(2.24)
In view of (2.20) and (2.24), we arrive at
δ(A11 + B11) = δ(A11) + δ(B11) for all A11, B11 ∈A11.
Similarly, we can show that
δ(A22 + B22) = δ(A22) + δ(B22) for all A22, B22 ∈A22.
□
Lemma 2.12. For any A11 ∈A11, A12 ∈A12 and A22 ∈A22,
δ(A11 + A12 + A22) = δ(A11) + δ(A12) + δ(A22).
Proof. It can be easily seen that
(A11 + A12 + A22)B12Q + QB12(A11 + A12 + A22) = A11B12
for all A11 ∈A11, A12, B12 ∈A12 and A22 ∈A22. From Lemmas 2.3 & 2.5 it follows that
δ(A11B12)
=
δ

=
δ(A11 + A12 + A22)B12 + A11δ(B12).
(2.25)
On the other hand, using Lemma 2.6, we get
δ(A11B12) = A11δ(B12) + δ(A11)B12.
(2.26)

Nonlinear Jordan Triple Derivable Mappings on Triangular Algebras
235
On combining (2.25)and (2.26), we have
{δ(A11 + A12 + A22) −δ(A11) −δ(A12) −δ(A22)}B12 = 0.
Since PAQ is faithful as a left PAP-module, the above relation implies that
P{δ(A11 + A12 + A22) −δ(A11) −δ(A12) −δ(A22)}P = 0.
(2.27)
Moreover, we know that
PB12(A11 + A12 + A22) + (A11 + A12 + A22)B12P = B12A22
for all A11 ∈A11, A12, B12 ∈A12 and A22 ∈A22. Then
Q{δ(A11 + A12 + A22) −δ(A11) −δ(A12) −δ(A22)}Q = 0.
(2.28)
Note that
(A11 + A12 + A22)B22Q + QB22(A11 + A12 + A22)
=
A12B22Q + A22B22Q + QB22A22 + QB22A12
for all A11 ∈A11, A12 ∈A12 and A22, B22 ∈A22. Thus
δ(A11 + A12 + A22)B22 + (A11 + A12 + A22)δ(B12)Q + δ(Q)B22A22
+Qδ(B22)(A11 + A12 + A22) + δ(A11 + A12 + A22)
=
δ(A12)B22 + A12δ(B22)Q + δ(A22)B22 + A22δ(B22)Q
+δ(Q)B22A22 + Qδ(B22)A22 + B22δ(A22).
The above relation can be rewritten as
{δ(A11 + A12 + A22) −δ(A11) −δ(A12) −δ(A22)}B22
+B22{δ(A11 + A12 + A22) −δ(A11) −δ(A12) −δ(A22)} = 0.
In the view of (2.28), the above relation becomes
P{δ(A11 + A12 + A22) −δ(A11) −δ(A12) −δ(A22)}Q = 0.
(2.29)
Now, combining (2.27),(2.28) and (2.29), we get
δ(A11 + A12 + A22) = δ(A11) + δ(A12) + δ(A22)
which is the required result.
□
Now we are well-equipped to prove our main theorem.
Proof of Theorem 2.1. For any X, Y ∈A, let X = X11 +X12 +X22 and Y = Y11 +Y12 +
Y22 where Xij, Yij ∈Aij with 1 ≤i ≤j ≤2. Then by Lemmas 2.10, 2.11 & 2.12, we
have
δ(X + Y )
=
δ(X11 + Y11) + δ(X12 + Y12) + δ(X22 + Y22)
=
δ(X11) + δ(Y11) + δ(X12) + δ(Y12) + δ(X22) + δ(Y22)
=
δ(X11 + X12 + X22) + δ(Y11 + Y12 + Y22)
=
δ(X) + δ(Y ).

Also, by applications of Lemmas 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 2.10 & 2.12, we conclude that
δ(XY )
=
δ(X11Y11 + X11Y12 + X12Y22 + X22Y22)

δ(X11Y11) + δ(X11Y12) + δ(X12Y22) + δ(X22Y22)

(2.30)
Since PX11Y22 + Y22X11P = 0 for all X11 ∈A11 and Y22 ∈A22, we ﬁnd that
0 = δ(0)
=
δ(PX11Y22 + Y22X11P)

+δ(X11)Y22 + X11δ(Y22).
(2.31)
On the other hand, from Lemmas 2.3, 2.4 & 2.12, we have

Introduction
We consider the initial- boundary value problem for the complex pseudodifferential Bona-
Mahone type equation on half-line

u (0, x) = u0 (x) , x ∈R+,

denotes the Laplace transform of u. Also we suppose that K(p) is nonanalytic in a right-
half complex plane and has m simple poles aj, Re aj > 0, Re K(p) > 0 for all Re p = 0
and
K(p) = Cp2n + O(1), for |p| < 1, n ∈N, n ≥1.
The equation (1.1) include many model wave equations for media with a strong spatial
dispersion, which appear in the nonlinear theory of the quasi-stationary processes in the
electric media with account for the spatial dispersion (see [18]). For results concerning the
Cauchy problem for nonlinear pseudoparabolic type equations see [9], [10],[1], [21], [22].
The large time asymptotic of solutions to the Cauchy problem was obtained in papers [5],
[11], [20]. In the case of the Cauchy problem the nonlinear equations were divided into
three general types: of asymptotically weak nonlinearity, of critical nonlinearity and of
strong (or subcritical) nonlinearity. Recently much attention was given to the study of the
global existence and large time asymptotic behavior of solutionsto the Cauchy problems for
nonlinear equations in the subcritical case (see papers [13] , [2], [16],[17], [19] and litera-
ture cited therein), where there were obtained optimal time decay estimates and asymptotic
formulas of solutions to different nonlinear local and nonlocal dissipative equations.
In this paper we study the initial boundary-value problem (1.1) in subcritical case, when
the nonlinear term of equation (1.1) has the time decay rate less then that of the linear
terms. For the general theory of nonlinear pseudodifferential equations on a half-line with
analytic symbols we refer to the book [15]. As far as we know there are few results in the
case of nonlinear pseudodifferential equations on half-line with a subcritical types of the
nonlinearity. We´ll give some reviewes of these works.
By C (I; B) we denote the space of continuous functions from a time interval I to the
Banach space B. The usual Lebesgue space is denote by Lp, 1 ≤p ≤∞, the weighted
Lebesgue space L1,a is deﬁned by

Note that the solution of the initial-boundary value problem (1.2) has the same time

the asymptotic depend on the mean value of the solution .
In the paper [7] it was considered the initial- boundary value problem (1.1) for the
pseudodifferential equation on a half-line with a symbol K(p) =

proved with the following result.

is valid for t →∞uniformly with respect to x ∈R+, where γ = 1
2 min(a, 1 −σ) .
This paper present a further development of the subcritical pseudodifferential equations
for the general class of the non analytic symbols K(p). Using an approach of paper [7]
we propose the universal method to construct the Green operator for problem (1.1), which
consists in the introduction of new necessary conditions at the singularity points of the
symbol K(p). In this paper we will prove that due to the nonanalytic properties of symbol
K(p) the solution of the initial-boundary value problem obtains an additional time decay
. As a result the main term of the asymptotic does not depend on the mean value of the
solution instead it is determined by the ﬁrst moment of the solution. Thus we have to
estimate the evolution of the ﬁrst moments to be able to obtain an optimal time decay
estimate of the solution. Note that we do not put any boundary condition in the initial-
boundary value problem (1.1), since the order of the operator is equal to zero (see book
[15]). Another difﬁculty which we overcome here is the complex coefﬁcient λ.
Here we use an approach of the paper [6]. In the case of the nonanalytic symbol K(p)
we need to estimate more carefully the response of the complex terms and the singularity
points of the symbol K(p) into the large time behavior of the solutions.

Remark 1. The condition that the value σ should be close to 1, so that 1 −σ ≤Cεσ is
rather technical and is caused by the application of the contraction mapping principle for
proving global existence of solutions.

Preliminary Lemmas
Consider the linear initial boundary-value problem on a half-line

and the symbol K(p) is the odd function of the zero order , such that Re K(p) > 0 for
all Re p = 0 and it is not analytic in a right-half complex plane at points aj, Re aj >
0, j = 1...m. Here a > maxj(Re aj). To derive an integral representation for solutions of
the problem (2.1) we suppose that there exists a solution u(t, x) of problem (2.1), which is
continued by zero for x < 0 :
u(t, x) = 0 for all x < 0.

We rewrite the equation (2.2) in the form

We now collect some preliminary estimates of the Green operator G (t) deﬁned by (2.11),
in the norms ∥φ∥Lr and ∥φ∥L1,1+w , where w ∈(0, 1), 1 ≤r ≤∞
Lemma 2. Suppose that the function φ ∈L∞(R+) ∩L1,1+a (R+) , where a ∈(0, 1).

Proof. Note that the Green operator G (t) can be represented as
G (t) φ = G0 (t) φ + e−tφ + R1 (t) φ + R2 (t) φ,
(2.13)
where the remainder

Now by representation (2.13) the estimates of the lemma follow. Lemma 2 is proved.

Proof of Theorem 3
We rewrite the initial-boundary value problem (1.1) as the following integral equation
u (t) = G (t) u0 −
Z t
0
G (t −τ) N (u (τ)) dτ,
(3.1)
where the Green operator G of the corresponding linear problem and N (u) = λ |u|σ u.
By standard method we can prove the local existence of weak solutions to the initial
boundary-value problem (1.1) (see, for example, [16])

250
Isahi S´anchez-Su´arez and Salvador Ju´arez-Zirate
Proposition 1. Let u0 ∈L1,1+a (R+) ∩L∞(R+) , a ≥0. Then for some T > 0 there
exists an unique solution u ∈C
 [0, T]; L1,1+a (R+) ∩L∞(R+)

to the problem (1.1).
By the Proposition 1, it follows that the global solution (if it exists) is unique. Indeed,
suppose that there exist two global solutions with the same initial data, which are different
at some time t > 0. By virtue of the continuity of solutions with respect to time, we can
ﬁnd a maximal time segment [0, T], where the solutions are equal, but for t > T they are
different. Now we apply the local existence theorem taking the initial time T and obtain
that these solutions coincide on some interval [T, T1] , which gives us a contradiction with
the fact that T is a maximal time until which the solutions coincide. So our main purpose
in the proof of Theorem 3 is to show the global in time existence of solutions. Denote by
∥g∥Z = (∥φ (t)∥L∞+ ∥φ (t)∥L1,1+a) ,

As in the paper [7] we make a change of the dependent variable u (t, x)
=
v (t, x) e−ϕ(t)+iψ(t) in equation (1.1). Then for the new function v (t, x) we get the fol-
lowing equation
∂tv + eϕ(t)−iψ(t)N(ve−ϕ(t)+iψ(t)) + K(v) −(ϕ′ −iψ′)v = 0.
Since for any z ∈C
ezN(ve−z) = e−σ Re zN(v),

252
Isahi S´anchez-Su´arez and Salvador Ju´arez-Zirate
we have
eϕ(t)−iψ(t)N(ve−ϕ(t)+iψ(t)) = e−σφN(v).
We assume that
Z

dx = 0.
Then since
Z
R+ xKvdx = ∂p(K(p)bv(t, p)) |p=0 = 0
the ﬁrst moment value of new function v (t, x) satisﬁes a conservation law:
d

Z
R+ xv (t, x) dx = 0,
hence

Abstract
The objective of this chapter is to provide an algebraic proof of involuntariness
(involutionness) of reﬂection of the plane R2 onto R2.
2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation: 14A25
Keywords and Phrases: Involuntariness, transformation, refelection
1.
Introduction and Preliminaries
A bijection from a plane onto itself is called a transformation.
A mapping I :R2 7→R2 deﬁned by I((x, y)) = (x, y), ∀(x, y) ∈R2 is known as
identity transformation.
A transformation f from a plane onto itself is called involution(involuntary transfor-
mation), if (1).(f ̸= I) and (2).(f2 = I).
Let ℓ: (ax + by + c) = 0 is a ﬁxed line, and σℓ:(ax+by+c)=0 : R2 7→R2 is deﬁned as
follows
σℓ:ax+by+c=0(P) :=

The Main Theorem
The σℓ:ax+by+c=0 is involution (involuntary transformation) of R2.
Proof. Let us consider

p1 −2a(ap1 + bp2 + c)
(a2 + b2)
, p2 −2b(ap1 + bp2 + c)

̸= (p1, p2) = I((p1, p2))
⇒σℓ:ax+by+c=0 ̸= I.
further, let us consider
σ2
ℓ((x, y)) = (x′, y′) ⇒σℓ:ax+by+c=0(σℓ:ax+by+c=0((x, y))) = (x′, y′)

(a2 + b2)
after simpliﬁcation, we get

(a2 + b2)2 = y.
(2.5)
Hence, we have
σ2
ℓ((x, y)) = (x, y), ∀(x, y) ∈R2
⇒σ2
ℓ= I
Therefore, σℓ:ax+by+c=0 is involution (involuntary transformation).

Abstract
We consider a nonlinear model of the Atmosphere dynamics which is based on
the known nonlinear Navier-Stokes system with the addition of the equations connect-
ing the Atmosphere ﬂows with the heat transfer, humidity and moisture content. We
deduce the explicit algorithm for the construction of the strong solution for the non-
linear system as a limit of the sequence of solutions for iterative linearized systems.
We prove the existence and uniqueness theorems for the strong solution. The results
may be used as well in numerical algorithms of calculation of the dynamics of the
Atmosphere.

Here x = (x1, x2, x3) is the space variable; v (x, t) = (v´, v4, v5, v6) ,
v´(x, t) =
(v1, v2, v3) is the velocity ﬁeld; v4 is the temperature; v5 is the relative humidity; v6
is the water (moisture) content in the clouds; p (x, t) is the scalar ﬁeld of the pressure;
w´(x) = (w1, w2, w3) and w (x) = (w´, w4, w5, w6), as well as f (x, t) are known smooth
functions; ν = (ν1, ν2) where ν1 > 0 is the kinematic viscosity parameter, ν2 > 0 is the
heat conductivity coefﬁcient; and the operator Av has the following form:

ω > 0, and Ki, Si are non-negative constants.
The equations 1.1 are deduced, for example, in [1], [2], where the considered model
was used for numerical calculations.
For the particular cases of solutions of the linearized system 1.1, and for additional
restrictions ν2 = K1 = K2 = w = 0, S1 = S2; various mathematical properties were
studied in [3], [4].
Let us associate the system 1.1 with the conditions
 v|t=0 = 0
v|∂Ω= 0
(1.2)
If we choose an orthonormal complete set of functions {uk} in the Hilbert space
H =
(
ϕ (x) = (ϕ1, ..., ϕ6) : ϕ ∈

W 1
2 (Ω) , div ϕ´= 0
)
,
then it can be shown (see [5]), that there exist a weak solution for the problem 1.1-1.2,
which can be found as the limit of the Galerkin approximations
vN (x, t) =
N

In [5] there was also deduced the explicit algorithm for calculating the functions CN
k (t).
In this paper, our aim is to study the strong solvability of the problem 1.1-1.2 and to
establish the uniqueness of the strong solution.

Construction of the Solution of the Nonlinear Problem as
a Limit of the Sequence of Solutions for Iterative Linearized
Problems
We will consider ﬁrst some auxiliary results.
In [6] the following theorem is proved.
Let Ωbe a bounded domain in R3, ∂Ω∈Cs, s = max (l, 2), v´(x) = (v1, v2, v3),
f ∈W l−2
q
(Ω) , l ≥1, 1 < q < ∞. Then, there exists a unique solution of the Stokes
system

−∆v´+ ∇p = f
div v´= 0, v´∂Ω= 0 ,
(2.1)
such that the estimate is valid:
∥v´∥W lq(Ω) + ∥∇p∥W l−2
q
(Ω) ≤C ∥f∥W l−2
q
(Ω) ,
where the constant C > 0 depends only on l , ∂Ω.
Let us prove the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let Ωbe a bounded domain in R3, ∂Ω∈C2, J∞
0 - a space of smooth solenoidal
functions with compact support, and J1
2 - the closure of J∞
0
in norm of W 1
2 (Ω). Suppose
that v´is a weak solution of 2.1: v´∈J1
2 and the integral identity holds:
3
X
j=1
Z
Ω
(ν1∆vj, ∇Φj) dx =
Z
Ω
(f, Φ) dx ∀Φ ∈J∞
0 .
If f ∈L2 (Ω) then there exist v´ ∈W 2
2 (Ω), p ∈W 1
2 (Ω) such that {v´, p} is the strong
solution of 2.1 and the following estimate is valid:
∥v´∥W 2
2 (Ω) + ∥∇p∥L2(Ω) ≤C ∥f∥L2(Ω) .
Proof. From the mentioned above Cattabriga theorem [6] we have that {v´, p} is the strong
solution of 2.1, v´∈W 2
2 (Ω), p ∈W 1
2 (Ω) . By the assumption of the lemma we have
3
X
j=1
Z
Ω
(ν1∆vj, ∇Φj) dx =
Z
Ω
(f, Φ) dx ∀Φ ∈J∞
0 .
Thus, v´is a weak solution.
We will show now that the weak solution is unique. In other terms, we have to verify
that v´= 0 if {v´, Φ} = 0 ∀Φ ∈J∞
0 .
Indeed, let Φk →v´in
0
W 1
2 . Then, we will have that ∥v´∥
0
W 1
2 (Ω)
= 0, where
∥v´∥0

In this way, the lemma is proved.

Let us denote QT = Ω× (0, T]. We introduce a real parameter λ and consider the
problem 1.1-1.2 in QT as follows.
 vt + (v´· ∇) v + (v´· ∇) w + (w´· ∇) v −ν∆v + Av + ∇p = λf (t, x)
div v´= 0, v|t=0 = 0, v|∂Ω= 0 .
(2.2)
We will obtain the needed solution later by putting λ = 1.
Let us assume that the solution {v, ∇p} of the problem 2.2 is analytic with respect to λ
near the point λ = 0. (Later we will prove it).
For m ≥0 we introduce the following notations.
v (t, x, λ) =
∞
X
m=0
v(m) (t, x)
m!
λm, v(m) (t, x) = ∂mv (t, x, λ)

∇p(m) (t, x)
m!
λm, ∇p(m) (t, x) = ∂mv (t, x, λ)
∂λm

.
We will deﬁne the functions v(m) (t, x) as solutions of the following iterative linear
problems.
First, let m = 0 and let us consider the problem

w + (w´· ∇) v(0) −ν∆v(0) + Av(0) + ∇p(0) = 0
div v´(0) = 0, v(0)
t=0 = 0, v(0)
∂Ω= 0 .
(2.4)
We choose v(0) = 0, ∇p(0) = 0 as the solution of the homogeneous problem 2.4.
For m = 1, the pair

v(1) (t, x) , ∇p(1) (t, x)
	
will be the solutionof the linear problem
(

div v´(1) = 0, v(1)
t=0 = 0, v(1)
∂Ω= 0 .
(2.5)
The problem 2.5 is obtained from 2.2 by differentiating once with respect to λ and taking
into account the values v(0) = 0, ∇p(0) = 0 . Using the assumption of smoothness with
respect to λ, we differentiate 2.2 m ≥1 times and thus obtain
(

Existence and Uniqueness of Strong Solutions for
the Auxiliary Linear Problems
We will consider the problem 2.6 in the linearized form
 vt + (v´· ∇) w + (w´· ∇) v −ν∆v + Av + ∇p = f (t, x)
div v´= 0, v|t=0 = 0, v|∂Ω= 0 .

Let aij (x, t) be elements of the matrix A, ν0 = min (ν1, ν2). We assume that
sup
(x,t)∈QT
|aij (x, t)| = β < ∞,
sup
(x,t)∈QT
(|w´| + |w´x| + |w´t| + |w´xt|) = γ < ∞.
We also suppose that Ωis a bounded domain in R3, ∂Ω∈C2. We would like to
establish ﬁrst some properties of weak solutions for the problem 3.1.
Theorem 1. There exists a unique weak solution v (t, x) of the problem 3.1 such that vt ∈
L2 (QT), Dα
xv ∈L2 (QT ) , |α| = 1, v´∈J1
2, v´t ∈J2 for almost every t ∈(0, T]; and the
following estimate holds
∥vt∥L2(QT ) + ν0
X
|α|=1
∥Dα
xv∥L2(QT ) ≤C ∥f∥L2(QT ) ,
where the positive constant C depends only on β, γ, T, ∂Ω.
Proof. We will approximate the solution of the problem 3.1 by Galerkin sequence
vN (x, t) =
N
X
k=1
CN
k (t) uk (x) ,
where the functions uk are deﬁned as above in Section 1. In 3.1 we put v = vN and multiply
by uk in sense of the inner product in L2 (Ω):

t=0 = 0, 1 ≤k ≤N.
We multiply these relations by CN

1 ≤k ≤N. In this way, we obtain

with the constant C0 depending on β, γ, ∂Ω.
We estimate the right-hand side of 3.3 with the help of the inequality

2
L2(QT ) ≤C1 ∥f∥2

(3.5)
where the constant C1 depends only on β, γ, T, ∂Ω.
We have to estimate the derivative of the approximate solution with respect to t in norm
L2 (QT). For that, we multiply the relations 3.2 by d

k (t) and sum the result with respect
to k, 1 ≤k ≤N and thus obtain

Now, analogously to 3.5, we integrate 3.6 with respect to t , use 3.4 and repeat the previous

L2(QT ) + ν0

(3.7)
The relations 3.5, 3.7 imply the inequality
vN
W 1
2 (QT ) ≤C ∥f∥L2(QT ) ,
where the positive constant C depends only on β, γ, T, ∂Ω. Therefore, from the estimates
3.5, 3.7 it follows that the Galerkin approximations are “a priori” bounded, together with
their derivatives with respect to t and x . With the help of 3.5, 3.7, and using the property
of weak compactness of bounded sets in the Hilbert space W 1
2 (QT ), we can separate from
vN	∞
N=1 a subsequence vNk	 which will converge weakly to some function v (t, x) in
W 1
2 (QT ). Thus, we have ﬁnally obtained a weak solution v (t, x) of the problem 3.1 such
that v ∈W 1
2 (QT) and the following estimates hold
∥v∥2
L2(Ω) + ν0 ∥vx∥2
L2(QT ) ≤C ∥f∥2
L2(QT ) ,
(3.8)
∥vt∥2
L2(QT ) + ν0 ∥vx∥2
L2(Ω) ≤C ∥f∥2
L2(QT ) .
(3.9)
From 3.8, 3.9 we obtain
∥v∥W 1
2 (QT ) ≤C ∥f∥L2(QT ) ,
where the constant C > 0 depends only on β, γ, T, ∂Ω. Since v ∈W 1
2 (QT) and v´∈J1
2
for almost every t ∈(0, T], then we have that v´t ∈J2 for almost every t ∈(0, T], and the
theorem is proved.
Now we can prove the unique strong solvability of the problem 3.1.

Strong Solution for a System of Nonlinear Atmosphere Dynamics
275
Theorem 2. There exists a unique strong solution {v (t, x) , ∇p (t, x)} of the linear prob-
lem 3.1 such that vt ∈L2 (QT), Dα
xv ∈L2 (QT) , |α| ≤2, v´ ∈J1
2 for almost every
t ∈(0, T], ∇p ∈L2 (QT ); and the following estimate holds
∥vt∥L2(QT ) + ν0
X
|α|≤2
∥Dα
xv∥L2(QT ) + ∥∇p∥L2(QT ) ≤C ∥f∥L2(QT ) ,
(3.10)
where the positive constant C depends only on β, γ, T, ∂Ω.
Proof. From theorem 1 there exists a weak solution v ∈W 1
2 (QT) of 3.1 such that v´∈J1
2
for almost every t ∈(0, T]. Since vt ∈L2 (QT), then, by virtue of Fubini theorem, the
norm ∥vt∥L2(Ω) is ﬁnite for almost every t ∈(0, T]. For the problem 3.1 we will introduce
the notations:
v = (v´, v”) , v´= (v1, v2, v3), v” = (v4, v5, v6),
Φ = (Φ´, Φ”) , Φ´= (Φ1, Φ2, Φ3), Φ” = (Φ4, Φ5, Φ6),
F´= (F1, F2, F3), F” = (F4, F5, F6), where
F = −vt −(w´· ∇) v −(v´· ∇) w −Av + f.
In this way, we will split the problem 3.1 into two following problems:
a) a Dirichlet problem for the linearized Stokes system
 −ν1∆v´+ ∇p = F´(t, x)
div v´= 0, v´|∂Ω= 0
,
(3.11)
and
b) a Dirichlet problem for three Poisson equations
 −ν2∆v” = F” (t, x)
v”|∂Ω= 0
.
(3.12)
We may deﬁne a weak solution of 3.11 as the integral identity:
Z




3
X
j=1
(ν1∇vj, ∇Φj) −(F´, Φ´)

dxdt = 0
(3.13)
for every test function Φ´∈W 1,0
2,x,t (QT): div Φ´= 0, Φ´|∂Ω= Φ´|t=T = 0.
Let us take Φ´in the form Φ´(t, x) = u´(x) ϕ (t): u´∈J∞
0
, ϕ ∈C∞
0 (0, T).
Thus, the integral identity 3.13 may be expessed as follows:

276
Andrei Giniatoulline and German Tobar
which is valid for all u´∈J∞
0
and for almost every value of parameter t ∈(0, T). In
this way, from lemma 1 and the estimates 3.8, 3.9 it follows that there exist the derivatives
Dα
xv´∈L2 (QT ), |α| ≤2, and also that there exists the function ∇p ∈L2 (QT ), such that
the estimate holds:
∥v´t∥L2(QT ) + ν1
X
|α|≤2
∥Dα
xv´∥L2(QT ) + ∥∇p∥L2(QT ) ≤C ∥F´∥L2(QT ) ,
where the positive constant C depends only on β, γ, T, ∂Ω.
For the test functions Φ´= 0 we deﬁne the weak solution for 3.12 as follows:
Z
QT



6
X
j=4
(ν2∇vj, ∇Φj) −(F”, Φ”)


dxdt = 0,
∀Φ” ∈W 1,0
2,x,t (QT) : Φ”|∂Ω= Φ”|t=T = 0.
We choose Φ”(t, x) = u”(x) ϕ (t): u”∈C∞
0 (Ω) , ϕ ∈C∞
0 (0, T). Using Du Bois-
Reymond lemma, as for the previous case of linearized Stokes equation, we obtain
Z
Ω



6
X
j=4
(ν2∇vj, ∇uj)

dx =
Z
Ω
(F”, u”) dx,
(3.15)
which is valid for all u” ∈C∞
0 (Ω) and for almost every value of parameter t ∈(0, T).
From 3.15 it is easy to see that v” ∈W 2
2 (Ω) for almost every t ∈(0, T), and that the
estimate is valid:
ν2
X
|α|≤2
∥Dα
xv”∥L2(QT ) ≤C ∥F”∥L2(QT ) ,
in other terms, we have that every weak solution v” ∈
0
W 1
2 (Ω) of the problem 3.15 with
F”∈L2 (Ω), will be a solution from W 2
2 (Ω) for ﬁxed values of t ∈(0, T].
In this way, we have obtained that the solution v = (v´, v”) has all the derivatives of the
second order such that Dα
xv ∈L2 (QT) , |α| ≤2, vt ∈L2 (QT) , ∇p ∈L2 (QT) , and the
estimate 3.10 holds.
Thus, the strong solution of the linearized problem 3.1 exists and is unique, which
concludes the proof.

Existence and Uniqueness of the Strong Solution

Now we shall prove the main result of this paper.

(4.2)
where C0 is the constant from 4.1 and C is the constant from 3.10. Then, there exists a

almost all t ∈(0, T), vt ∈L2 (QT), Dα
xv ∈L2 (QT) , |α| ≤2; ∇p ∈L2 (QT) . This

statement of theorem 3 for the problem 1.1, 1.2.
Now we shall prove the uniqueness of the strong solution {v, ∇p} for the problem 1.1,

Abstract
With unbalanced ranked set sampling, the empirical Bayes test rules for Rayleigh
distribution are presented. It is shown that asymptotically property is proved.

Introduction
The notion of ranked set sampling (RSS) was ﬁrst proposed by McIntyre (1952,[1])in order
to explore a more efﬁcient method to estimate pasture yields in agricultural experimen-
tion. In some situations where measuring an observation are time consuming or costly,
but ranking a small subset of observations can be easily done without actual measurement,
because the judgment ranking usually gain more useful subjective information(e.g., visual
inspection and available expert knowledge) than simple random sampling (SRS) without
addtional expense, ranked set sampling is a useful technique for improving the precision of
statistical inference compared to simple random sampling (SRS) of the same size and has

been applied successfully to reduce cost and to increase efﬁciency in some areas such as en-
vironment, ecology, industrial statistics and others. The reader is referred to the monograph
by Chen et al. [2].
Since H. Robbins (1955,[3];1964,[4]) ﬁrst introduced empirical Bayes (EB) approach,
Since then, many contributions have been made to development of EB. Quigley et al.
(2007,[6]) considered estimating rate of occurrence of rare events with empirical bayes: a
railway application. Empirical Bayes adjustment improved conventional estimates in post-
marketing drug-safety studies was investigated by Bagnardi et al. (2006,[7]). Chang and
Li (2006,[8])presented empirical Bayes decision rule for classiﬁcation on defective items in
Weibull distribution. Jaheen (2004,[9])described empirical Bayes analysis of record statis-
tics based on linex and quadratic loss functions. Ding and Karunamuni (2004,[10]) gave a
linear empirical Bayes solutionfor the calibration problem. Hoye (2015,[11]) derived safety
effects of section control-An empirical Bayes evaluation. Shreif et al. (2015,[12]) studied
the jigsaw puzzle of sequence phenotype inference: Piecing together Shannon entropy, im-
portance sampling, and Empirical Bayes. So far, EB methods are usually based on simple
random sampling (SRS), however, In such suitable circumstances where quanti?cation of a
large number of sampling units is costly or difﬁcult but ranking of the units in a small set
is easy and inexpensive. A natural idea is to develope EB methods with unbalanced RSS.
Rayleigh distribution plays an important role in reliability analysis. we will study empirical
Bayes test for Rayleigh distribution with unbalanced RSS.
Let X have a conditional density function for given θ
f(x|θ) = x
θ 2e−x2
2θ2 .
(1.1)
where θ is an unknown parameter, Ω= {x|x > 0} is sample space and Θ = {θ|θ > 0} is
parameter space. In this paper, we consider the following test
H0 : θ ≤θ0 ⇔H1 : θ > θ0,
(1.2)
where θ0 is a given positive constant.
For (1.2), we adopt loss function
L0(θ,d0) =

0,
θ ≤θ0
a[1−( θ0
θ )2],
θ > θ0
L1(θ,d1) =

a[( θ0

θ ≤θ0
0,
θ > θ0
where a > 0, d = {d0,d1} is action space, respectively, d0 and d1 imply acceptance
and rejection of H0.
Assume that the prior distribution G(θ) of parameter θ is unknown, we obtain random-
ized decision function.
δ(x) = P( accept H0|X = x).
(1.3)
Then, the risk function of δ(x) is shown by
R(δ(x),G(θ))
=

By (1.5) and simple calculation, we have
β(x) = u(x) fG(x)+v(x) f (1)
G (x).
(1.6)
where f (1)
G (x) is ﬁrst order derivative of fG(x), and u(x) = (1−θ0
4x2) = 1−1
4θ0x−2, v(x) =
θ0
2x = 1
2θ0x−1.
By (1.4), Bayes test function is obtained as follows
δG(x) =
 1,
i f β(x) ≤0,
0,
i f β(x) > 0,
(1.7)
Therefore, minimum Bayes risk is shown by
R(G) = inf
δ R(δ,G) = R(δG,G) = a
Z
Ωβ(x)δG(x)dx+CG.
(1.8)
If the prior distribution of G(θ) is known and δ(x) = δG(x), R(G) is achieved. While
G(θ) is unknown, we cannot make use of δG(x) and need to explore EB method.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 2, we construct an EB test.
In section 3, we discuss asymptotic properties of the EB test.

Construction of EB Test with Unbalanced Ranked
Set Sampling
An unbalanced ranked set sample (URSS) procedure can be described as follows: In such a
situation we have an unbalanced ranked set sample. The general form of unbalanced ranked
set sample may be gave by: X(1)1,X(1)2,··· ,X(1)n1,X(2)1,X(2)2,··· ,X(2)n2,··· ,X(k)1,X(k)2,··· ,X(k)nk .
The sample items may be referred to as X(i)j,i = 1,2,··· ,k; j,i = 1,2,··· ,nk, where the X(i)j are
independent and those with the same i are also identically distributed. that collected an
unbalanced RSS sample of total size n =
k
∑
i=1
ni.
Under the following frames,
we need to construct EB test function.
Let
X(1)1,X(1)2,··· ,X(1)n1,X(2)1,X(2)2,··· ,X(2)n2,··· ,X(k)1,X(k)2,··· ,X(k)nk be an unbalanced ranked set
sample from population which has the common marginal density function fG(x). We assume
perfect ranking.
Denote that X(1)1,X(1)2,··· ,X(1)n1,X(2)1,X(2)2,··· ,X(2)n2,··· ,X(k)1,X(k)2,··· ,X(k)nk
are historical samples, and X is present sample. Assume fG(x) ∈Cs,α,x ∈R1, where Cs,α =
{g(x)|g(x) is
a
probability density function and has continuous s-th order derivative
g(s)(x) with |g(s)(x)| ≤α,s ≥3,α > 0}. First construct estimator of β(x).

URSS(x) = fURSS(x), f (r)
URSS(x) is the r-the order derivative of fURSS(x), for
r = 0,1.
The estimator of β(x) is obtained by
βURSS(x) = u(x) fURSS(x)+v(x) f (1)
URSS(x).
(2.2)
Therefore, EB test function is given by
δURSS(x) =

Let E stand for mathematical expectation with respect to the joint distribution of

Hence, we get the overall

If lim

function. If R(δURSS,G) −R(δG,G) = O(n−q), where q > 0, O(n−q) is asymptotic opti-
mality convergence rates of EB test function {δURSS(x)}. Before proving the theorems, we
need the following lemmas.
Let c,c1,c2 be different constants in different cases even in the same expression.
Lemma 2.1. Let X(1)1,X(1)2,··· ,X(1)n1,X(2)1,X(2)2,··· ,X(2)n2, ··· ,X(k)1,X(k)2,··· ,X(k)nk be

Asymptotic Properties with Unbalanced Ranked

Theorem 3.1. Let X(1)1,X(1)2,··· ,X(1)n1,X(2)1,X(2)2,··· ,X(2)n2, ··· ,X(k)1,X(k)2,··· ,X(k)nk

(iii) f (1)
G (x) is continuous function, we have lim
n→∞R(δURSS,G) = R(δG,G).
Proof of Theorem 3.1. By lemma 2.2, we get
0 ≤R(δURSS,G)−R(δG,G) ≤a
Z
Ω|β(x)|p(|βURSS(x)−β(x)| ≥|β(x)|)dx.
Deﬁne TURSS(x) = |β(x)|p(|βURSS(x)−βG(x)| ≥|β(x)|).
It is not difﬁcult to see that TURSS(x) ≤|β(x)|.
And by (1.6) and Fubini theorem, we can get
R

(3.1)
If Theorem 3.1 holds, we only need to prove lim

Markov’s and Jensen’s inequations imply

Introduction
A topological index ,which is a graph invariant it does not depend on the labeling or picto-
rial representation of the graph, is a numerical parameter mathematically derived from the
graph structure. The topological indices of molecular graphs are widely used for establish-
ing correlations between the structure of a molecular compound and its physico-chemical
properties or biological activity . These indices are used in quantitive structure property re-
lations (QSPR) research. The ﬁrst distance based topological index was proposed by Wiener
in 1947 for modeling physical properties of alcanes [1], and after him, hundred topological
indices were deﬁned by chemists and mathematicians and so many properties of chemical
structures were studied. More than forty years ago Gutman and Trinajsti´c deﬁned Zagreb
indices which are degree based topological indices [2]. These topological indices were pro-
posed to be measures of branching of the carbon-atom skeleton in [3]. The ﬁrst and second

Zagreb indices of a simple connected graph G deﬁned as follows;
M1 (G) =

and
M2 (G) =

uv∈E(G)

where u, V (G), uv and E(G) denotes a vertex of G, the vertex set of G, an edge of
G and the edge set of G, respectively. For details of the chemical applications and the
mathematical theory of the Zagreb indices, see the surveys [4–7]. For the another version
of the ﬁrst Zagreb index;
M1 (G) =

see in [7].
Recently, reverse vertex degree of a vertex and reverse Zagreb indices of a simple connected
graph have been deﬁned in [8]. The reverse vertex degree of a vertex v of a simple connected
graph G deﬁned as;
cv = ∆−dv + 1
where ∆denotes the largest of all degrees of vertices of G and dv denotes the number of
edges incident to v. The total reverse vertex degree deﬁned as;

Extremal trees and graphs with respect to total reverse vertex degree and ﬁrst reverse Zagreb
alpha index were characterized in [8]. To ﬁnd maximum graphs with respect to the second
reverse Zagreb index were remained open questions in [8]. Also the relations between
Zagreb indices and reverse Zagreb indices were established in [8]. Chemical predictivity of
these novel indices have been investigated in [9]. Maximum chemical graphs with respect
to the ﬁrst reverse Zagreb alpha index have been determined in [10]. Maximum chemical
graphs with respect to the ﬁrst reverse Zagreb beta index have been determined in [11].
The aim of this paper is to characterize maximum chemical trees with respect to the second
reverse Zagreb index.

Maximum Chemical Trees of the Second Reverse Zagreb Index
291
2.
Maximum Chemical Trees with Respect to the Second
Reverse Zagreb Index
In this section our goal is to obtain sharp upper bound on the second reverse Zagreb index
of chemical trees and, accordingly, to characterize the chemical trees with maximal values
of the second reverse Zagreb index.
Lemma 1. If G is a chemical tree with at least one vertex of degree 3 , then its second
reverse Zagreb index cannot be maximal.
Proof. Let G be a chemical tree and x ∈V (G) be the only vertex such that dx = 3. Let
N(x) = {a, b, c}. There two cases.
Case 1. Let G contains a vertex which its degree four. Notice that reverse degrees of all
pendant vertex are four and the reverse degree of the vertex x, cx = 2. Let l ∈V (G) be a
pendant vertex, N(l) = {m} and the vertex m does not adjacent to the vertices x, a, b, c.
Let G
′ be a chemical tree which is obtained from G such that the vertex c detach from x
and attach to l. Notice that cx = 3 and cl = 3 after the transformation. Then;
CM2 (G) −CM2

G
′
= −ca −cb −cc + cm < 0.
Case 2. Let G does not contain a vertex which its degree four and contains at least two
vertices of degree three. Notice that reverse degrees of all pendant vertex are three and the
reverse degree of the vertex x, cx = 1. Let l ∈V (G) be a pendant vertex, N(l) = {m} and
the vertex m does not adjacent to the vertices x, a, b, c. Let G
′ be a chemical tree which is
obtained from G such that the vertex c detach from x and attach to l. Notice that cx = 2
and cl = 2 after the transformation. Then;
CM2 (G) −CM2

G
′
= −ca −cb −cc + cm < 0.
Lemma 2. If G is a chemical tree with at least two vertices of degree 4 , then its second
reverse Zagreb index cannot be maximal.
Proof. Let G be a chemical tree with at least two vertices say x and y vertices have degree
four and N(y) = {a, b, c, d}. Let G
′ be a chemical tree which is obtained from G such that
the vertex a detach from y and attach to any pendant vertex say l which is not adjacent to x
and N(l) = {k}. Notice that cy = 2 and cl = 3 after the transformation. Then;
CM2 (G) −CM2

G
′
= −ca −cb −cc −cd + ck < 0.
Theorem 3. If G be a chemical tree which has only the one vertex of degree four, no pendant
vertex adjacent to the vertex of degree four and has no vertex of degree three, then G has
the maximum second reverse Zagreb index value among all n-vertex chemical trees.

292
S¨uleyman Ediz
Proof. Let G
′ be a tree which has only the one vertex of degree four, one pendant vertex
adjacent to the vertex of degree four and has no vertex of degree three. Clearly, from the
deﬁnition of the second reverse Zagreb index;
CM2 (G) −CM2

G
′
= 2 > 0
And from this and Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 we complete the proof.
Theorem 4. Let G be n-vertex chemical tree. Then;
CM2 (G) ≤9n −21
Equality is attained if and only if G is a chemical tree which has only the one vertex of
degree four, no pendant vertex adjacent to the vertex of degree four and has no vertex of
degree three.
Proof. Let G is a chemical tree which has only the one vertex of degree four, no pendant
vertex adjacent to the vertex of degree four and has no vertex of degree three. Then G have
4 pendant vertices, n −5 verices of degree two and only one vertex of degree 4. Therefore
G have 4 vertices of reverse degree 4, n−5 vertices of reverse degree 3 and only one vertex
of reverse degree 1. Thus G have 4 edges which its end vertices has the reverse degrees 4,
3 and 4 edges which its end vertices has the reverse degrees 3, 1 and n −9 edges which its
end vertices has the reverse degrees 3, 3. From the deﬁniton of the second reverse Zagreb
index;
CM2 (G) = 4.12 + 4.3 + 9(n −9) = 9n −21
The other cases comes from Lemma 1, Lemma 2 and Theorem 3.
