1.1 IntroductIon
Electronics is the branch of science and engineering which relates to the conduction of electricity either 
through vacuum by electrons or through gases by electrons and ions. Basically, it is a study of electronic 
devices and their utilization. An electron device is that in which electrons flow through a vacuum or gas 
or semiconductor. In the beginning of 20th century, electrons began to take technological shape and it has 
enjoyed an explosive development in the last few decades.
Electronics has a wide range of applications, such as rectification, amplification, power generation, industrial 
control, photo-electricity, communications and so on. The electronic industry turns out a variety of items 
in the range of consumer electronics, control and industrial electronics, communication and broadcasting 
equipments, biomedical equipments, calculators, computers, microprocessors, aerospace and defence 
equipments and components.
A semiconductor is a material that has a resistivity value in between that of a conductor and an insulator. 
The conductivity of a semiconductor material can be varied under an external electric field. Devices made 
from semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics which includes radio, computers, 
telephones, and many other devices. Semiconductor devices include the transistor, many kinds of diodes 
including the light emitting diode, the silicon controlled rectifier, and digital and analog integrated circuits.  
This chapter deals with the classification of semiconductors based on energy band diagram. It also discusses 
the doping in semiconductors, Hall effect and Fermi level in semiconductors.
1.2 Insulator, semIconductors and metals classIfIcatIon usIng
 
energy band dIagrams
A very poor conductor of electricity is called an insulator; an excellent conductor is a metal; and a material 
whose conductivity lies between these two extremes is a semiconductor. A material may be classified as one 
of these three depending upon its energy-band structure.
1.2.1 Insulator
An insulator is a material having extremely poor electrical conductivity. The energy-band structure at the 
normal lattice spacing is indicated schematically in Fig. 1.1(a). The forbidden energy gap is large; for 
diamond, the energy gap is about 6 eV. If additional energy is given to an electron in the upper level of valence 
band, this electron attempts to cross the forbidden energy gap and enter the conduction band. However, in 
Semiconductor Physics

an insulator, the additional energy which may ordinarily be given to an electron is, in general, much smaller 
than this high value of forbidden energy gap. Hence, no electrical conduction is possible. The number of free 
electrons in an insulator is very small, roughly about 107 electrons/m3.

1.2.2 metal
Conduction in metals is only due to the electrons. A metal has overlapping valence and conduction bands. 
The valence band is only partially filled and the conduction band extends beyond the upper end of filled 
valence band. The outer electrons of an atom are as much associated with one ion as with another, so that the 
electron attachment to any individual atom is almost zero. The band occupied by the valence electrons may 
not be completely filled and that there are no forbidden levels at higher energies. Depending upon the metal, 
at least one, and sometimes two or three, electrons per atom are free to move throughout the interior of the 
metal under the action of applied fields. When an electric field is applied, few electrons may acquire enough 
additional energy and move to higher energy level within the conduction band. Thus, the electrons become 
mobile. Since the additional energy required for transfer of electrons from valence band to conduction band 
is extremely small, the conductivity of a metal is excellent.
In electron-gas theory description of a metal, the metal is visualized as a region containing a periodic three-
dimensional array of heavy, tightly bound ions permeated with a swarm of electrons that may move about 
quite freely. According to this theory, the electrons in a metal are continuously moving and the direction of 
motion changes whenever the electron collides with other electrons. The average distance travelled by an 
electron between successive collisions is called mean-free-path of an electron. In the absence of any applied 
potential, the average current in a metal is zero because the number of electrons passing through unit area in 
any direction is almost same as the number of electrons passing through the same unit area in the opposite 
direction. This can be attributed to the random nature of motion of electrons.
When a constant electric field E (volt per metre) is applied to a metal, the electrons would be accelerated and 
its velocity would increase indefinitely with time. However, because of collision of electrons, electrons lose 
energy and a steady-state condition is reached where a finite value of drift velocity vd is attained. The drift 
velocity, vd is in the direction opposite to that of the electric field and its magnitude is proportional to E. 

Semiconductor Physics
1.3
Thus,
 
vd = mE 
(1.1)
where m = mobility of the electron, m2/volt-second. Due to the applied field, a steady-state drift velocity 
has been superimposed upon the random thermal motion of the electrons. Such a directed flow of electrons 
constitutes a current. If the concentration of free electrons is n (electrons per cubic meter), the current density 
J (ampere per square metre) is
 
J = nqvd = nqmE = sE 
(1.2)
where  
s  = nqm 
(1.3)
s is the conductivity of the metal in (ohm-metre)–1. For a good conductor, n is very large, approximately, 1028 
electrons/m3. Equation (1.2) can be recognized as Ohm’s law which states that the conduction current density 
is proportional to the applied electric field. The energy acquired by the electrons from the applied field is 
given to the lattice ions as a result of collisions. Hence, power is dissipated within the metal by the electrons, 
and the power density (joule heat) is given by
 
JE = sE 2 watt/metre3 
(1.4)
1.3 classIfIcatIon of semIconductors
Semiconductors are classified as (i) intrinsic (pure), and (ii) extrinsic (impure) types. The extrinsic 
semiconductors are of N-type and P-type.
Intrinsic Semiconductor 
A pure semiconductor is called an intrinsic semiconductor. As  already 
explained in the first chapter, even at room temperature, some of the valence electrons may acquire sufficient 
energy to enter the conduction band to form free electrons. Under the influence of an electric field, these 
electrons constitute electric current. A missing electron in the valence band leaves a vacant space, which is 
known as hole, as shown in Fig. 1.2. Holes also contribute to electric current.
In an intrinsic semiconductor, even at room temperature, electron-hole pairs are created. When an electric 
field is applied across an intrinsic semiconductor, the current conduction takes place due to free electrons 
and holes. Under the influence of an electric field, the total current through the semiconductor is the sum of 
currents due to free electrons and holes.
Though the total current inside the semiconductor is due to free electrons and holes, the current in the external 
wire is only by electrons. In Fig. 1.3, holes being positively charged move towards the negative terminal of 
the battery. As the holes reach the negative terminal of the battery, electrons enter the semiconductor near

the terminal (X ) and combine with the holes. At the same time, the loosely held electrons near the positive 
terminal (Y ) are attracted towards the positive terminal. This creates new holes near the positive terminal 
which again drift towards the negative terminal.
Extrinsic Semiconductor 
Due to the poor conduction at room temperature, the intrinsic semiconductor 
as such, is not useful in the electronic devices. Hence, the current conduction capability of the intrinsic 
semiconductor should be increased. This can be achieved by adding a small amount of impurity to the intrinsic 
semiconductor, so that it becomes impure or extrinsic semiconductor. This process of adding impurity is 
known as doping.
The amount of impurity added is extremely small, say 1 to 2 atoms of impurity in 106 intrinsic atoms.
N-type Semiconductor 
A small amount of pentavalent impurity such as arsenic, antimony, or phosphorus 
is added to the pure semiconductor (germanium or silicon crystal) to get an N-type semiconductor.
The germanium atom has four valence electrons and antimony has five valence electrons. As shown in 
Fig. 1.4, each antimony atom forms a covalent bond with surrounding four germanium atoms. Thus, four 
valence electrons of the antimony atom form a covalent bond with four valence electrons of an individual 
germanium atom and the fifth valence electron is left free which is loosely bound to the antimony atom.
Fig. 1.4 N-type semiconductor: (a) Formation of covalent bonds (b) Charged carriers
This loosely bound electron can be easily excited from the valence band to the conduction band by the 
application of electric field or increasing the thermal energy. Thus, every antimony atom contributes one 
conduction electron without creating a hole. Such a pentavalent impurity is called a donor impurity because 
it donates one electron for conduction. On giving an electron for conduction, the donor atom becomes a 
positively charged ion because it loses one electron. But it cannot take part in conduction because it is firmly 
fixed in the crystal lattice.
Thus, the addition of a pentavalent impurity (antimony) increases the number of electrons in the conduction 
band, thereby increasing the conductivity of an N-type semiconductor. As a result of doping, the number of 
free electrons far exceeds the number of holes in an N-type semiconductor. So electrons are called majority 
carriers and holes are called minority carriers.

Semiconductor Physics
1.5
P-type Semiconductor 
A small amount of trivalent impurity such as aluminium or boron is added to the 
pure semiconductor to get the P-type semiconductor. The germanium (Ge) atom has four valence electrons 
and boron has three valence electrons as shown in Fig. 1.5. Three valence electrons in boron form a covalent 
bond with four surrounding atoms of Ge leaving one bond incomplete which gives rise to a hole. Thus, 
the trivalent impurity (boron) when added to the intrinsic semiconductor (germanium) introduces a large 
number of holes in the valence band. These positively charged holes increase the conductivity of the P-type 
semiconductor. A trivalent impurity such as boron is called acceptor impurity because it accepts free electrons 
in the place of holes. As each boron atom donates a hole for conduction, it becomes a negatively charged ion. 
As the number of holes is very much greater than the number of free electrons in a P-type material, holes are 
termed majority carriers and electrons minority carriers.

1.4 mobIlIty and conductIvIty
The conductivity of a material is proportional to the concentration of free electrons. The number of 
free electrons in a semiconductor lies between 107 and 1028 electrons/m3. Thus, a semiconductor has 
conductivity much greater than that of an insulator but much smaller than that of a metal. Typically, 
a semiconductor has a forbidden energy gap of about 1 eV. The most important practical semiconductor 
materials are germanium and silicon, which have values of Eg of 0.785 and 1.21 eV, respectively, at 0 degree 
Kelvin. Energies of this magnitude normally cannot be acquired from an applied field. At low temperatures the 
valence band remains full, the conduction band empty, and these materials are insulators at low temperatures. 
The conductivity of these materials increases with temperature and hence, these materials are called as 
intrinsic semiconductors. As the temperature is increased, some of the electrons in the valence band acquire 
thermal energy greater than the gap energy and move into the conduction band. These electrons are now free 
to move about under the influence of even a small applied field. These free electrons, also called conduction 
electrons, constitute for conduction and the material becomes slightly conducting. The current density due to 
the motion of electrons is given by
 
Jn = nmnqE = snE 
(1.5)

Electronic Devices and Circuits
1.6
where, mn is the electron mobility, and the suffix ‘n’ represents that the respective terms are due to motion of 
electrons. The absence of an electron in the valence band is represented by a small circle and is called a hole. 
The hole may serve as a carrier of electricity whose effectiveness is comparable with the free electron. The 
hole conduction current density is given by
 
Jp = pmp qE = spE 
(1.6)
where mp is the hole mobility and p is the hole concentration.
Hence, the total current density J in a semiconductor is given by
 
J = (nmn + pmp)qE = sE 
(1.7)
where s = (nmn + pmp)q is the total conductivity of a semiconductor. For a pure semiconductor (intrinsic 
semiconductor), the number of free electrons is exactly same as the number of holes. Thus, the total current 
density is
 
J = ni(mn + mp) qE 
(1.8)
where ni = n = p is the intrinsic concentration of a semiconductor.
The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor can be increased by introducing certain impurity atoms into the 
crystal. This results in allowable energy states which lie in the forbidden energy gap and these impurity levels 
also contribute to the conduction. Such a semiconductor material is called an extrinsic semiconductor.
Effective Mass 
An electron travelling through a crystal under the influence of an externally applied 
field hardly notices the electrostatic field of the ions making up the lattice, i.e., it behaves as if the applied 
field were the only one present. This is the basis of the electron-gas approximation and the assumption 
will now be looked at a little more closely. If the electrons were to experience only the applied field, E, 
then immediately after a collision it would accelerate in the direction of the field with an acceleration a, 
proportional to the applied force, i.e.,
 
qE = ma 
(1.9)
where the constant of proportionality is the electron mass, m. When quantum theory is applied to the problem 
of an electron moving through a crystal lattice, it predicts that under the action of an applied field, the electron 
acceleration will indeed be proportional to the field, but that the constant of proportionality will be different 
from the normal mass of an electron:
 
qE = mna 
(1.10)
The field due to the lattice ions can, therefore, be ignored providing we treat the electrons inside the crystal as 
if they had a slightly different mass to the real electron mass or, to put it another way, the effect of the lattice 
ions on an electron is to make it behave as if it had a different mass. This new mass is called the effective 
mass of the electron, mn, and the effective mass of a hole, mp, can be similarly defined. In general, mn and 
mp are not the same. Usually, mn is of the same order as m; in germanium, for instance, mn = 0.2 m and in 
silicon, mn = 0.4 m.
The value of effective mass is an important parameter for any semiconductor, especially from the device point 
of view. Certain semiconductors, for instance, have low electron effective mass and hence, high electron 
mobility. This makes them very suitable for high-frequency devices. The III-V semiconductor GaAs comes 
into this category and some of the best microwave transistors are made from this material.

Semiconductor Physics
1.7
In a pure semiconductor, the number of holes is equal to the number of electrons. Thermal agitation continues 
to produce new electron-hole pairs and the electron-hole pair disappears because of recombination. With 
each electron-hole pair created, two charge-carrying particles are formed. One is negative which is the free 
electron with mobility mn. The other is positive, i.e., the hole with mobility mp. The electrons and holes move 
in opposite directions in an electric field E, but since they are of opposite sign, the current due to each is in 
the same direction. Hence, the total current density J within the intrinsic semiconductor is given by
 
J = Jn + Jp
 
 = qn mn E + qp mp E
 
 = (nmn + pmp)qE
 
 = s E 
(1.11)
where  
Jn = electron-drift current density
 
Jp = hole-drift current density
 
n =  number of electrons per unit volume, i.e., magnitude of free-electron (negative) concentration
 
p = number of holes per unit volume, i.e., magnitude of hole (positive)  concentration
 
E = applied electric field strength, V/m
 
q = charge of electron or hole, coulomb
Hence, s is the conductivity of a semiconductor which is equal to (n mn + p mp)q. The resistivity (r) of a 
semiconductor is the reciprocal of conductivity, i.e., 
1
r
s
=
.
It is evident from the above equation that current density within a semiconductor is directly proportional to 
the applied electric field.
For a pure (intrinsic) semiconductor, n = p = ni, where ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration.
Therefore, 
J = ni (mn + mp) qE
and conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor is si = qni(mn + mp). Hence, it is clear that conductivity of an 
intrinsic semiconductor depends upon its intrinsic concentration (ni) and the mobility of electrons (mn) and 
holes (mp). The intrinsic conductivity of germanium and silicon increase by approximately 5 percent per °C 
and 7 percent per °C rise in temperature respectively due to the influence of ni.
Conductivities of N- and P-type Semiconductors 
The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor,
 
si = q ◊ ni(mn + mp) = q ◊ (n mn + pmp)

For a P-type semiconductor, as p>>n, the conductivity, s = q ◊ p ◊ mp.

1.5 drIft and dIffusIon currents
The flow of charge, i.e., current, through a semiconductor material is of two types, namely, drift and diffusion. 
The net current that flows through a PN junction diode also has two components, viz., (i) drift current, and  
(ii) diffusion current.
Drift Current 
When an electric field is applied across the semiconductor material, the charge carriers 
attain a certain drift velocity vd, which is equal to the product of the mobility of the charge carriers and the 
applied electric field intensity, E. The holes move towards the negative terminal of the battery and electrons 
move towards the positive terminal. This combined effect of movement of the charge carriers constitutes a 
current known as drift current. Thus, drift current is defined as the flow of electric current due to the motion 
of the charge carriers under the influence of an external electric field.
Drift current density

Therefore, 
J = nqvd = rvd
where r = nq is the charge density, in coulomb per cubic centimeter. Generally, the above current density 
can also be written as
 
J = nqvd = nqmE = sE
where E is the applied electric field intensity in V/cm, m is the mobility of electrons in cm2/V-s, the drift 
velocity, vd = mE in cm/s, and the conductivity, s = nqm in S · m–1. The equation J = sE is also called Ohm’s 
law.
The drift current density due to the charge carriers such as free electrons and holes are the current passing 
through a square centimeter perpendicular to the direction of flow. The equation for the drift current density, 
Jn, due to free electrons is given by
 
Jn = qnmnE A/cm2
and the drift current density, Jp, due to holes is given by
 
Jp = qpmpE A/cm2
where  
n = number of free electrons per cubic centimetre
 
p = number of holes per cubic centimetre
 
mn = mobility of electrons in cm2/V-s
 
mp = mobility of holes in cm2/V-s
 
E = applied electric field intensity in V/cm
 
q = charge of an electron = 1.602 × 10–19 coulomb
Diffusion Current 
It is possible for an electric current to flow in a semiconductor even in the absence 
of the applied voltage, provided a concentration gradient exists in the material. A concentration gradient 
exists if the number of either electrons or holes is greater in one region of a semiconductor as compared 
to the rest of the region. In a semiconductor material, the charge carriers have the tendency to move 
from the region of higher concentration to that of lower concentration of the same type of charge 
carriers. Thus, the movement of charge carriers takes place resulting in a current called diffusion 
current. The diffusion current depends on the material of the semiconductor, type of charge carriers, 
and the concentration gradient.
As indicated in Fig. 1.7(a), the hole concentration p(x) in a semiconductor bar varies from a high value to a 
low value along the x-axis and is constant in the y- and z-directions.

Since the hole density p(x) decreases with increasing x as shown in Fig. 1.7(b), dp/dx is negative and the

einstein relationship for a semiconductor
There exists a definite relationship between the mobility and diffusion coefficient of a particular type of 
charge carrier in the same semiconductor. The higher the value of mobility of a charge carrier, the greater will 
be its tendency to diffuse. The equation which relates the mobility m and the diffusion coefficient D is known 
as the Einstein relationship. The Einstein relationship is expressed as
 
 
      
p

m
 =

(1.14)
The importance of the Einstein relationship is that it can be used to determine Dp (or Dn), if the mobility of 
holes (or electrons) is measured experimentally. For an intrinsic silicon, Dp = 13 cm2/s and Dn = 34 cm2/s. 
For an intrinsic germanium, Dp = 47 cm2/s and Dn = 99 cm2/s.
Diffusion Length (L) 
As shown in Fig. 1.6, the excess hole or electron densities fall off exponentially 
with distance as a result of the recombination of these excess minority carriers with the majority carriers of 
the semiconductor. Here, the excess charge carriers have a finite lifetime, t, before they are totally destroyed 
by recombination. The average distance that an excess charge carrier can diffuse during its lifetime is called 
the diffusion length L, which is given by
 
L = 
Dt
where D is the diffusion coefficient that may be related to the drift mobility, m, through the Einstein relation 
as
 
D = 
kT
q
m
If the transverse length of the semiconductor is greater than the diffusion length L then the terminal currents 
are the recombination currents arising out of the recombination, as every electron lost by recombination is 
supplanted by the terminal electrode to maintain the charge neutrality.
1.6 generatIon and recombInatIon of charges
If a pure semiconductor is doped with N-type impurities, the number of electrons in the conduction band 
increases above a level and the number of holes in the valence band decreases below a level, which would 
be available in the intrinsic (pure) semiconductor. Similarly, the addition of P-type impurities to a pure 
semiconductor increases the number of holes in the valence band above a level and decreases the number of 
electrons in the conduction band below a level, which would have been available in the intrinsic semiconductor. 
This is because the rate of recombination increases due to the presence of large number of free electrons 
(or holes).

Electronic Devices and Circuits
1.12
Further, the experimental results state that under thermal equilibrium for any semiconductor, the product of 
the number of holes and the number of electrons is constant and is independent of the amount of donor and 
acceptor impurity doping. This relation is known as mass-action law and is given by
 
n ◊ p = ni
2 
(1.15)
where n is the number of free electrons per unit volume, p is the number of holes per unit volume, and ni is 
the intrinsic concentration.
While considering the conductivity of the doped semiconductors, only the dominant majority charge carriers 
have to be considered.
Charge Densities in N-type and P-type Semiconductors The law of mass-action provides the 
relationship between free-electron concentration and hole concentration. These concentrations are further 
related by the law of electrical neutrality as given below.
Let ND be the concentration of donor atoms in an N-type semiconductor. In order to maintain the electric 
neutrality of the crystal, we have
 
nN = ND + pN
 
 ª ND
where nN and pN are the electron and hole concentrations in the N-type semiconductor. The value of pN is 
obtained from the relations of mass-action law as
 
pN =

where NA, pP, and nP are the concentrations of acceptor impurities, holes, and electrons respectively in a 
P-type semiconductor.

Extrinsic Conductivity 
The conductivity of an N-type semiconductor is given by
 
sN = qnN mn ª qND mn, since nN ª ND
The conductivity of a P-type semiconductor is given by
 
sP = qpP mP ª qNA mP, since pP ª NA
The doping of intrinsic semiconductor considerably increases its conductivity.

Semiconductor Physics
1.13
If the concentration of donor atoms added to a P-type semiconductor exceeds the concentration of acceptor 
atoms, i.e., ND >> NA, then the semiconductor is converted from P-type to N-type. Similarly, a large number 
of acceptor atoms added to an N-type semiconductor can convert it to a P-type semiconductor if NA >> ND. 
This concept is precisely used in the fabrication of a PN junction, which is an essential part of semiconductor 
devices and integrated circuits.

1.7 hall effect
When a transverse magnetic field B is applied to a specimen (thin strip of metal or semiconductor) carrying 
current I, an electric field E is induced in the direction perpendicular to both I and B. This phenomenon is 
known as the Hall effect.
A Hall-effect measurement experimentally confirms the validity of the concept that it is possible for two 
independent types of charge carriers, electrons and holes, to exist in a semiconductor.
The schematic arrangement of the semiconductor, the magnetic field and the current flow pertaining to the 
Hall effect are shown in Fig. 1.8. Under the equilibrium condition, the electric field intensity, E, due to the 
Hall effect must exert a force on the carrier of charge, q, which just balances the magnetic force, i.e.,
 
qE = Bqvd
where vd is the drift velocity. Also, the electric field intensity due to Hall effect is
 
E = 
H
V
d

Semiconductor Physics

where d is the distance between surfaces 1 and 2, and VH is the Hall voltage appearing between surfaces 
1 and 2. In an N-type semiconductor, the current is carried by electrons and these electrons will be forced 
downward towards side 1 which becomes negatively charged with respect to side 2.

. A measurement of the Hall coefficient RH determines not only the sign of the charge 
carriers but also their concentration. The Hall coefficient for a P-type semiconductor is positive, whereas it 
is a negative for an N-type semiconductor. This is true because the Hall voltage in a P-type semiconductor is 
of opposite polarity to that in an N-type semiconductor.
The advantage of Hall-effect transducers is that they are non-contact devices with high resolution and small 
size.
Applications 
The Hall effect is used to find whether a semiconductor is N- or P-type and to determine 
the carrier concentration. If the terminal 2 becomes positively charged with respect to terminal 1, the 
semiconductor must be N-type and r = nq, where n is the electron concentration. On the other hand, if the 
polarity of VH is positive at terminal 1 with respect to terminal 2, the semiconductor must be P-type and 
r = pq, where p is the hole concentration.

Electronic Devices and Circuits

The mobility ( m) can also be calculated with simultaneous measurement of the conductivity (s). The 
conductivity and the mobility are related by the equation s  = rm  or m = s RH.
Therefore, the conductivity for N-type semiconductor is s = nqmn and for P-type semiconductor, s = pqmp, 
where mn is the electron mobility and mp is the hole mobility.
Thus, if the conductivity of a semiconductor is measured along with RH, then mobility can be determined 
from the following relations.
For N-type semiconductor, 
mn =

Since VH is proportional to B for a given current I, Hall effect can be used to measure the ac power and the 
strength of magnetic field and sense the angular position of static magnetic fields in a magnetic field meter. It 
is also used in an instrument called Hall-effect multiplier which gives the output proportional to the product 
of two input signals. If I is made proportional to one of the inputs and B is made proportional to the second 
signal, then from the equation, 
,
H

 will be proportional to the product of two inputs. Hall devices 
for such applications are made from a thin wafer or film of indium antimonide (InSb) or indium arsenide. As 
the material has a very high electron mobility, it has high Hall coefficient and high sensitivity.
An electrical current can be controlled by a magnetic field because the magnetic field changes the resistances 
of some elements with which it comes in contact. In the magnetic bubble memory, while read-out, the Hall 
effect element is passed over the bubble. Hence, a change in current of the circuit will create, say, a one. If 
there is no bubble, there will be a zero and there will be no current change in the output circuit. The read-in 
device would have an opposite effect, wherein the Hall device creates a magnetic field when supplied with a 
pulse of current. This, in turn, creates a little domain and then a magnetic bubble is created.
Some of the other applications are in measurement of velocity, rpm, sorting, limit sensing, and non-contact 
current measurements.

1.8 contInuIty equatIon
The fundamental law governing the flow of charge is called the continuity equation. The continuity equation 
as applied to semiconductors describes how the carrier concentration in a given elemental volume of the 
crystal varies with time and distance. The variation in density is attributable to two basic causes, viz., (i) the 
rate of generation and loss by recombination of carriers within the element, and (ii) drift of carriers into or 
out of the element. The continuity equations enable us to calculate the excess density of electrons or holes in 
time and space.
As shown Fig. 1.9, consider an infinitesimal 
N-type semiconductor bar of volume of area A and 
length dx and the average minority carrier (hole) 
concentration p, which is very small compared to 
the density of majority carriers. At time t, if 
minority carriers (holes) are injected, the minority 
current entering the volume at x is Ip and leaving at 
x + dx is Ip + d Ip which is predominantly due to 
diffusion. The minority carrier concentration 
injected into one end of the semiconductor bar 
decreases exponentially, with distance into the 
specimen, as a result of diffusion and recombination. 
Here, d Ip is the decrease in number of coulomb 
per second within the volume.
Since the magnitude of the carrier charge is q, then 
p

p  equals the decrease in the number of holes per 
second within the elemental volume A µ x. As the current density

We know that an increase in number of holes per unit volume per second is given by G = po /tp due to 
thermal generation. Further, there is a decrease of holes per unit volume per second given by R = p/tp due to 
recombination but charge can neither be created nor destroyed. Hence, increase in holes per unit volume per 
second, dp/dt, must equal the algebraic sum of all the increases in hole concentration. Thus,

Minority Carrier Injection in Homogeneous Semiconductors 
Consider the semiconductor bar 
shown in Fig. 1.7(a). This bar is uniformly doped with donor atoms so that the charge concentration n = ND 
is uniform throughout the bar on which radiation falls on one end of the bar at x = 0. Near the illuminated 
surface, the bound electrons in the covalent bonds capture some of the photons. This energy transfer results 
in breaking of covalent bonds and generation of hole-electron pairs.
The minority carrier (hole) concentration P is very small compared with the doping level, i.e., P << n. The 
condition p = P + po << n which states that the minority concentration is much smaller than the majority 
concentration is called the low-level injection. The controlling differential equation for p is

Here, the hole concentration decreases exponentially with distance as shown in Fig. 1.7(b).

1.9 law of JunctIon
Let us now derive the expression for the total current as a function of applied voltage assuming that the 
width of the depletion region is zero. When a forward bias is applied to a diode, holes are injected from the 
P-side into the N-side. Due to this, the concentration of holes in the N-side (pn) is increased from its thermal 
equilibrium value (pn0) and injected hole concentration [Pn(x)] decreases exponentially with respect to the 
distance (x).

The several components of hole concentration in the N-side of a forward-biased diode are shown in Fig. 1.6, 
in which the density pn(x) decreases exponentially with the distance (x).
Let pp and pn be the hole concentrations at the edges of the space charge in the P- and N-sides, respectively.

This is the Boltzmann’s relation of kinetic gas theory. This equation is valid as long as the hole current is 
small compared to diffusion or drift currents. This condition is called low-level-injection.
Under open-circuit condition (i.e., V = 0), pp = pp0, pn = pn0 and VB = V0. Equation (1.18) can be changed

1.10 fermI dIrac functIon
An electron inside the metal must possess an energy level that is at least greater than the surface barrier 
energy EB, so as to escape to a higher level. It is, therefore, important to know about the energies possessed 
by the electrons in a metal. This is given by the energy-distribution function.
Energy Density 
The distribution in energy of the free electrons in a metal is given by
 
dn = rdE
where dn is the number of electrons per cubic metre whose energies lie in the energy interval dE, and r is the 
density of electrons in a given energy interval.
It is assumed that there are no potential variations within the metal, since only free electrons are considered. 
Hence, there must be the same number of electrons in each cubic metre of the metal. That is, the density in 
space (electrons per cubic metre) is a constant. However, there will be electrons having all possible energies 
within each unit volume of the metal. This distribution in energy is expressed by 
 
r = f 
  (E) N(E)
where N(E) is the density of states in the conductance band, and f (E) is the probability that a quantum state 
with energy ‘E’ is occupied by an electron. Therefore,
 
N(E) =

Fermi–Dirac Function

at energy E (in eV) occupied under conditions of thermal equilibrium. From quantum physics, 
 
f (E) =

exists. That is, if E = EF  then

Fig. 1.10 Fermi–Dirac distribution function f (E) gives the probability that a state of energy E is occupied
At T = 0 K, the following conditions exist:
 
(i) 
If E > EF, the exponential term becomes infinite and f (E) = 0. Consequently, there is no probability 
of finding an occupied quantum state of energy greater than EF at absolute zero temperature.
 
(ii) 
If E < EF, the exponential becomes zero and f (E) = 1. All quantum levels with energies less than EF 
will be occupied at T = 0 K.
From these equations, we get at absolute zero temperature,

It implies that there are no electrons at 0 K which have energies in excess of EF. Therefore, the Fermi energy 
is the maximum energy that any electron may possess at absolute zero temperature.
The relationship given by the above equation is called the completely degenerate energy distribution function. 
In fact, all particles should have zero energy at 0 K. Based on Pauli’s exclusion principle, it is also to be 
mentioned that since no two electrons have the same set of quantum numbers, not all the electrons can have 
the same energy even at 0 K.

Since the density of free electrons, n, varies from metal to metal, EF will also vary among metals. Generally, 
the numerical value of EF is less than 10 eV.
1.11 fermI level In IntrInsIc and extrInsIc semIconductors
To calculate the conductivity of a semiconductor, the concentration of free electrons n and the concentration 
of free holes p must be known.
 
dn = N(E) f(E) dE
where dn represents the number of conduction electrons per cubic metre whose energies lie between E and 
E + dE, and N(E) is the density of states. In a semiconductor, the lowest energy in the conduction band is EC 
and hence,
 
N(E) = g (E – EC)1/2

Donor and Acceptor Impurities 
If a pentavalent substance (antimony, phosphorous, or arsenic) is 
added as an impurity to pure germanium, four of the five valence electrons of the impurity atoms will occupy 
covalent bonds and the fifth electron will be available as a carrier of current. These impurities donate excess 
electron carriers and are, hence, called donor or N-type impurities.
If a trivalent impurity (boron, gallium, or indium) is added to an intrinsic semiconductor, only three covalent 
bonds are filled, and the vacancy in the fourth bond constitutes a hole. These impurities are known as acceptor 
or P-type impurities.

Movement of EF with Temperature 
In an N-type semiconductor, as the temperature T increases, more 
of electron-hole pairs are formed. At a very high temperature T, the concentration of thermally generated 
electrons in the conduction band will be far greater than the concentration of donor electrons. In such a case, 
as concentration of electrons and holes become equal, the semiconductor becomes essentially intrinsic and 
EF returns to the middle of the forbidden energy gap. Hence, it is concluded that as the temperature of the 
P-type and N-type semiconductor increases, EF progressively moves towards the middle of the forbidden 
energy gap.

2.1 INTRODUCTION
The PN junction diode is one of the semiconductor devices with two semiconductor materials in physical 
contact, one with excess of holes (P-type) and other with excess of electrons (N-type). A PN junction diode 
may be formed from a single crystal intrinsic semiconductor by doping part of it with acceptor impurities and 
the remaining with donors. Such junctions can form the basis of very efficient rectifiers. The most important 
characteristic of a PN junction is its ability to allow the flow of current in only one direction. In the opposite 
direction, it offers very high resistance. The high vacuum diode has largely been replaced by silicon and 
selenium rectifiers. Semiconductor diodes find wide applications in all phases of electronics, viz. radio and 
TV, optoelectronics, power supplies, industrial electronics, instrumentation, computers, etc. The chapter deals 
with the working of PN junction diode and its characteristics.
In addition to the PN junction diode, other types of diodes like Zener diode and tunnel diode are also discussed 
in this chapter and they are manufactured for specific applications. These special diodes are two terminal 
devices with their doping levels carefully selected to give the desired characteristics.
Thyristor, in general, is a semiconductor device having three or more junctions. Such a device acts as a switch 
without any bias and can be fabricated to have voltage ratings of several hundred volts and current ratings 
from a few amperes to almost thousand amperes. The family of thyristors consists of PNPN diode (Shockley 
diode), SCR, TRIAC, DIAC, etc. which are discussed here. This chapter also discusses the operation and 
characteristics of special semiconductor devices like LED, photo diode and UJT.
2.2 TheORy Of PN JUNCTION DIODe
2.2.1  PN Junction Diode in equilibrium with no Applied Voltage
In a piece of semiconductor material, if one half is doped by P-type impurity and the other half is doped by 
N-type impurity, a PN junction is formed. The plane dividing the two halves or zones is called the PN junction. 
As shown in Fig. 2.1, the N-type material has high concentration of free electrons, while the P-type material 
has high concentration of holes. Therefore, at the junction there is a tendency for the free electrons to diffuse 
over to the P-side and holes to the N-side. This process is called diffusion. As the free electrons move across

the junction from N-type to P-type, the donor ions become positively charged. Hence, a positive charge is 
built on the N-side of the junction. The free electrons that cross the junction uncover the  negative acceptor 
ions by filling in the holes. Therefore, a net negative charge is established on the P-side of the junction. This 
net negative charge on the P-side prevents further diffusion of electrons into the P-side. Similarly, the net 
positive charge on the N-side repels the hole crossing from P-side to N-side. Thus, a barrier is set up near 
the junction which prevents further movement of charge carriers, i.e., electrons and holes. As a consequence 
of the induced electric field across the depletion layer, an electrostatic potential difference is established 
between P- and N-regions, which is called the potential barrier, junction barrier, diffusion potential, or contact 
potential, Vo. The magnitude of the contact potential Vo varies with doping levels and temperature. Vo is 0.3 V 
for germanium and 0.72 V for silicon.
The electrostatic field across the junction caused by the positively charged N-type region tends to drive the 
holes away from the junction and negatively charged P-type region tends to drive the electrons away from 
the junction. The majority holes diffusing out of the P-region leave behind negatively charged acceptor atoms 
bound to the lattice, thus exposing negative space charge in a previously neutral region. Similarly, electrons 
diffusing from the N-region expose positively ionized donor atoms, and a double-space-charge layer builds 
up at the junction as shown in Figs 2.1(a) and (c).
It is noticed that the space-charge layers are of opposite sign to the majority carriers diffusing into them, 
which tends to reduce the diffusion rate. Thus, the double space of the layer causes an electric field to be 
set up across the junction directed from N- to P-regions, which is in such a direction to inhibit diffusion of 
majority electrons  and holes, as illustrated in Figs 2.1(a) and (d). The shape of the charge density, r, depends 
upon how the diode is doped, Thus, the junction region is depleted of mobile charge carriers. Hence, it is 
called the depletion region (layer), the space-charge region, or the transition region. The depletion region is 
of order 0.5 mm thick. There are no mobile carriers in this very narrow depletion layer. Hence, no current 
flows across the junction and the system is in equilibrium. To the left of this depletion layer, the carrier 
concentration is p ª NA, and to its right, it is n ª ND.
Calculation of Depletion Width 
Let us now consider the width of the depletion region in the junction of 
Fig. 2.1. The region contains space charge due to the fact that donors on the N-side and acceptors on the P-side 
have lost their accompanying electrons and holes. Hence, an electric field is established which, in turn, causes 
a difference in potential energy, qVo, between the two parts of the specimen. Thus, a potential is built up across 
the junction and Fig. 2.1(e) represents the variation in potential. Here, the P-side of the junction is at a lower 
potential than the  N-side which means that the electrons on the P-side have a great potential energy.
In this analysis, let us consider an alloy junction in which there is an abrupt change from acceptor ions on 
P-side to donor ions on N-side. Assume that the concentration of electrons and holes in the depletion region 
is negligible and that all of the donors and acceptors are ionized. Hence, the regions of space charge may be 
described as
 
r = – qNA, 0 > x > X1
 
r = +qND, X2 > x > 0
 
r = 0, elsewhere
where r is the space-charge density, as indicated in Fig. 2.1(c)(i). The axes have been chosen in Fig. 2.1(e) 
in such a way that V1 and X1 have negative values. The potential variation in the space-charge region can be 
calculated by using Poisson’s equation, which is given by

Here, in an alloy junction, the depletion width W is proportional to (Vo)1/2.
In a grown junction, the charge density (r) varies linearly with distance (x) as shown in Fig. 2.1(c)(ii). If a 
similar analysis is carried for this junction, it is found that W varies as (Vo)1/3 instead of (Vo)1/2.
2.2.2 Under forward-Bias Condition
When the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the P-type and negative terminal to the N-type of the 
PN junction diode, the bias applied is known as forward bias.
Operation 
As shown in Fig. 2.2, the applied potential with external battery acts in opposition to the 
internal potential barrier and disturbs the equilibrium. As soon as equilibrium is disturbed by the application 
of an external voltage, the Fermi level is no longer continuous across the junction. Under the forward-bias 
condition, the applied positive potential repels the holes in the P-type region so that the holes move towards 
the junction and the applied negative potential repels the electrons in the  N-type region and the electrons 
move towards the junction. Eventually, when the applied potential is more than the internal barrier potential, 
the depletion region and internal potential barrier disappear.
V–I Characteristics of a Diode under Forward Bias 
Under forward-bias condition, the V–I 
characteristics of a PN unction diode are shown in Fig. 2.3. As the forward voltage (VF) is increased, for VF 
< VO, the forward current IF is almost zero (region OA) because the potential barrier prevents the holes from 
P-region and electrons from N-region to flow across the depletion region in the opposite direction.

Fig. 2.3 V–I characteristics of a diode under forward- 
                           bias condition
For VF > VO, the potential barrier at the junction completely disappears and, hence, the holes cross the 
junction from P-type to N-type and the electrons cross the junction in the opposite direction, resulting in 
relatively large current flow in the external circuit.

Electronic Devices and Circuits
2.6
A feature worth to be noted in the forward characteristics shown in Fig. 2.3 is the cut in or threshold voltage 
(Vr) below which the current is very small. It is 0.3 V and 0.7 V for germanium and silicon, respectively. At 
the cut-in voltage, the potential barrier is overcome and the current through the junction starts to increase 
rapidly.
2.2.3 Under Reverse-Bias Condition
When the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the P-type and positive terminal of the battery is 
connected to the N-type of the PN junction, the bias applied is known as reverse bias.
Operation 
Under applied reverse bias as shown in Fig. 2.4, holes which form the majority carriers of the 
P-side move towards the negative terminal of the battery and electrons which form the majority carrier of 
the N-side are attracted towards the positive terminal of the battery. Hence, the width of the depletion region 
which is depleted of mobile charge carriers increases. Thus, the electric field produced by applied reverse 
bias, is in the same direction as the electric field of the potential barrier. Hence, the resultant potential 
barrier is increased which prevents the flow of majority carriers in both directions; the depletion width, W, 
is proportional to   ÷ 
___
 
Vo   under reverse bias. Therefore, theoretically, no current should flow in the external 
circuit. But in practice, a very small current of the order of a few microampere flows under reverse bias as 
shown in Fig. 2.5. Electrons forming covalent bonds of the semiconductor atoms in the P- and N-type regions 
may absorb sufficient energy from heat and light to cause breaking of some covalent bonds. Hence, electron-
hole pairs are continually produced in both the regions. Under the reverse-bias condition, the thermally 
generated holes in the P-region are attracted towards the negative terminal of the battery and the electrons in 
the N-region are attracted towards the positive terminal of the battery. Consequently, the minority carriers, 
electrons in the P-region and holes in the N-region, wander over to the junction and flow towards their majority 
carrier side giving rise to a small reverse current. This current is known as reverse saturation current, Io. The 
magnitude of the reverse saturation current mainly depends upon junction temperature because the major 
source of minority carriers is thermally broken covalent bonds.

Fig. 2.4 PN junction under reverse bias 
Fig. 2.5 V–I characteristics under reverse bias
For large applied reverse bias, the free electrons from the N-type moving towards the positive terminal of the 
battery acquire sufficient energy to move with high velocity to dislodge valence electrons from semiconductor 
atoms in the crystal. These newly liberated electrons, in turn, acquire sufficient energy to dislodge other 
parent electrons. Thus, a large number of free electrons are formed which is commonly called an avalanche

of free electrons. This leads to the breakdown of the junction leading to very large reverse current. The 
reverse voltage at which the junction breakdown occurs is known as breakdown voltage, VBD.
2.2.4 PN Junction as a Diode
Figure 2.6 shows the current-voltage characteristics of PN junction. The characteristics of the PN junction 
vary enormously depending upon the polarity of the applied voltage. For a forward-bias voltage, the current 
increases exponentially with the increase of voltage. A small change in the forward-bias voltage increases 
the corresponding forward-bias current by orders of magnitude and, hence, the forward-bias PN junction 
will have a very small resistance. The level of current flowing across a forward-biased PN junction largely 
depends upon the junction area. In the reverse-bias direction, the current remains small, i.e., almost zero, 
irrespective of the magnitude of the applied voltage and hence the reverse-bias PN junction will have a high 
resistance. The reverse-bias current depends on the area, temperature and type of semiconductor material.

Fig. 2.6 Ideal I–V characteristics of a PN junction diode
The semiconductor device that displays these I–V characteristics is called a PN junction diode. Figure 2.7 
shows the PN junction diode with forward-bias and reverse-bias and their circuit symbols. The metal contacts 
are indicated with which the homogeneous P-type and N-type materials are provided. Thus, two metal-
semiconductor junctions, one at each end of the diode, are introduced. The contact potential across these 
junctions is approximately independent of the direction and magnitude of the current. A contact of this type 
is called an ohmic contact, which has low resistance. In the forward bias, a relatively large current is produced 
by a fairly small applied voltage. In the  reverse bias, only a very small current, ranging from nanoamps to 
microamps is produced. The diode can be used as a voltage controlled switch, i.e., OFF for a reverse-bias 
voltage and ON for a forward-bias voltage.

When a diode is reverse-biased by at least 0.1 V, the diode current is IR = – Io. As the current is in the reverse 
direction and is a constant, it is called the diode reverse saturation current. Real diodes exhibit reverse-bias 
current that are considerably larger than Io. This additional current is called a generation current which is due 
to electrons and holes being generated within the space-charge region. A typical value of I0 may be 10 – 14 A 
and a typical value of reverse-bias current may be 10 – 9 A.
2.2.5 PN Junction Diode as a Rectifier
A PN junction diode is a two-terminal device that is polarity sensitive. When the diode is forward biased, the 
diode conducts and allows current to flow through it without any resistance, i.e., the diode is ON. When the 
diode is reverse biased, the diode does not conduct and no current flows through it, i.e., the diode is OFF, or 
providing a blocking function. Thus, an ideal diode acts as a switch, either open or closed, depending upon 
the polarity of the voltage placed across it. The ideal diode has zero resistance under forward bias and infinite 
resistance under reverse bias.
2.2.6 Diode Ratings or Limiting Values of PN Junction Diode
The PN junction diode will perform satisfactorily only if it is operated within certain limiting values. They 
are the following:
Maximum Forward Current 
 
It is the highest instantaneous current under forward-bias condition that 
can flow through the junction.
Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) 
 
It is the maximum reverse voltage that can be applied to the PN junction. 
If the voltage across the junction exceeds PIV under reverse-bias condition, the junction gets damaged.
Maximum Power Rating 
 
It is the maximum power that can be dissipated at the junction without 
damaging the junction. Power dissipation is the product of voltage across the junction and current through 
the junction.
Maximum Average Forward Current 
 
It is given at a special temperature, usually 25°C, (77°F) and 
refers to the maximum amount of average current that can be permitted to flow in the forward direction. If 
this rating exceeds its limit then the structure breakdown can occur.
Repetitive Peak Forward Current 
 
It is the maximum peak current that can be permitted to flow in 
the forward direction in the form of recurring pulses. The limiting value of this current is 450 mA.
Maximum Surge Current 
 
It is the maximum current permitted to flow in the forward direction in the 
form of non-recurring pulses. The current should not equal this value for more than a few milliseconds.
The above diode ratings are subject to change with temperature variations. If the operating temperature is 
more than that stated for the rating then the ratings must be decreased.
2.3 CURReNT COmpONeNTs IN PN JUNCTION DIODe
Let us now derive the expression for the total current as a function of applied voltage assuming that the width of 
the depletion region is zero. When a forward bias is applied to a diode, holes are injected from the P-side into 
the N-side. Due to this, the concentration of holes in the N-side (pn) is increased from its thermal equilibrium 
value (pn0) and injected hole concentration [Pn(x)] decreases exponentially with respect to the distance (x).

Now, 
VT = kT/q = T/11600, volt-equivalent of temperature, i.e., thermal voltage,
where  
k = Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10–23 J/K) 
 
q = charge of the electron (1.602 × 10–19 C)
 
T = temperature of the diode junction (K) = (°C + 273)
At room temperature (T = 300 K), VT = 26 mV. Substituting this value in the current equation, we get
 
I = Io[e(40 V/h) – 1]
Therefore, for a germanium diode, I = Io [e40V – 1], since h = 1 for germanium. For a silicon diode, I = Io[e20V – 1], 
since h = 2 for silicon.
If the value of applied voltage is greater than unity then the equation of diode current for germanium,
 
I = Io (e40V)
and for silicon, 
I = Io (e20V)
When the diode is reverse biased, its current equation may be obtained by changing the sign of the applied 
voltage V. Thus, the diode current with reverse bias is

2.5 TempeRATURe DepeNDeNCe ON V–I ChARACTeRIsTICs
The reverse saturation current Io is temperature dependent while voltage equivalent of temperature VT is also 
temperature dependent. Hence, the diode current involving Io and VT is temperature dependent. Therefore, 
the overall diode characteristics depend on the temperature.
The dependence of Io on temperature T is given by
 
 
Io = KT me – VGo /hVT 
(2.7)
where  
K = constant independent of temperature (not the Boltzmann’s constant)
 
m = 2 for Ge and 1.5 for Si
 
and VGo = forbidden energy gap = 0.785 V for Ge and 1.21 V for Si.
As temperature increases, the value of Io increases and, hence, the diode current increases. To keep diode 
current constant, it is necessary to reduce the applied voltage V of the diode.
Let us calculate, the rate of change of the applied voltage to keep the diode current constant. For a constant 
diode current, 
0
dI
dT =
. Hence, the change in voltage has to be calculated.
A diode current equation is given by
 
I = Io (eV/hVT – 1)
Since I >> Io for a forward characteristics, we have
 
I = Io eV/hVT  
(2.8)
Substituting Eq. (2.7) into Eq. (2.8), we get
 
I = KT m e – VGo /hVT ◊ eV/hVT
 
 = KT m e(V–VGo)/hVT 
(2.9)
Since VT = kT, where k is Boltzmann’s constant,
 
I = KT m e(V – VGo)/h kT

This indicates that Io increases by 8% per degree rise in temperature. 
Practically, it is found that the reverse saturation current Io increases by 7% per °C change in temperature 
for both silicon and germanium diodes. If at T°C is 1 mA then at (T + 1) °C, it becomes 1.07 mA, and so on. 
From this, it can be concluded that reverse saturation current approximately doubles, i.e., 1.0710 for every 
10°C rise in temperature.

2.5.2 Temperature Dependence of V–I Characteristics
The rise in temperature increases the generation of electron-hole pairs in semiconductors and increases their 
conductivity. As a result, the current through the PN junction diode increases with temperature as given by 
the diode-current equation,
 
I = Io [e(V/hVT) – 1]
The reverse saturation current Io of the diode increases approximately 7 percent/°C for both germanium and 
silicon. Since (1.07)10 ª 2, reverse saturation current approximately doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature. 
Hence, if the temperature is increased at fixed voltage, the current I increases. To bring the current I to its 
original value, the voltage V has to be reduced. It is found that at room temperature, for either germanium or 
silicon, 
2.5 mV/°C

 in order to maintain the current I to a constant value.
At room temperature, i.e., at 300 K, the value of 
barrier voltage or cut-in voltage is about 0.3 V 
for germanium and 0.7 V for silicon. The barrier 
voltage is temperature dependent and it decreases 
by 2 mV/°C for both germanium and silicon. 
This fact may be expressed in mathematical 
form, which is given by
 
Io2 = Io1 × 2 (T2 – T1)/10
where Io1 = saturation current of the diode at the 
temperature (T1), and Io2 = saturation current of 
the diode at the temperature (T2).
Figure 2.8 shows the effect of increased 
temperature on the characteristic curve of a PN 
junction diode. A germanium diode can be used 
up to a maximum of 75°C and a silicon diode, to 
a maximum of 175°C.

2.6 DIODe ResIsTANCe (sTATIC AND DyNAmIC)
An ideal diode should offer zero resistance in forward bias and infinite resistance in the reverse bias. But in 
practice, no diode can act as an ideal diode, i.e., an actual diode 
does not behave as a perfect conductor when forward biased and 
as a perfect insulator when reverse biased. Let us consider four 
resistances of the diode (i) dc or static resistance, (ii) ac or dynamic 
resistance, (iii) average ac resistance, and (iv) reverse resistance.
dc or Static Resistance (RF) 
It is defined as the ratio of the 
voltage to the current, V/I, in the forward-bias characteristics of 
the PN junction diode. In the forward-bias characteristics of the 
diode as shown in Fig. 2.9, the dc or static resistance (RF) at the 
operating point can be determined by using the corresponding

. Here, the dc resistance is independent of the shape of 
the characteristics in the region surrounding the point of interest. The dc resistance levels at the knee and 
below will be greater than the resistance levels obtained for the characteristics above the knee. Hence, the dc 
resistance will be low when the diode current is high. As the static resistance varies widely with V and I, it is 
not a useful parameter.
ac or Dynamic Resistance (rf ) 
It is defined as the reciprocal of the slope of the volt-ampere 
characteristics.

A straight line drawn tangent to the curve through the quiescent point (Q-point) as shown in Fig. 2.10(a) will 
define a specific change in voltage and current which may be used to determine the ac or dynamic resistance 
for this region of the diode characteristics. As shown in Fig. 2.10(b), for a small change in voltage, there will 
be a corresponding change in current, which is equidistant to either side of the Q-point. Hence, the ac or

The ac resistance of a diode is the sum of bulk resistance rb and junction resistance rj. Bulk resistance (rb) is 
the sum of ohmic resistance of the P- and N-type semiconductors.

If two

the voltage across each diode and current through each diode. Assume similar value of Io = 1 mA for both the 
diodes and h = 1.
Solution   The arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.12.
As D1 is reverse biased, the total current flowing in the circuit is Io = 1 mA. 
The diode D2 is forward biased and its forward current is equal to the reverse 
Io = 1 mA, which can flow as D1 is reverse biased.
For the diode D2, I = Io = 1 mA and voltage across D2 is VD2.
Therefore, 
I = Io[eV/hVT – 1]

2.7.1 Transition or space Charge (or Depletion Region) Capacitance (CT )
Under reverse-bias condition, the majority carriers move away from the junction, thereby uncovering more 
immobile charges. Hence, the width of the space-charge layer at the junction increases with reverse voltage. 
This increase in uncovered charge with applied voltage may be considered a capacitive effect. The parallel

is expressed as
 
CT = dQ

where dQ is the increase in charge caused by a change in voltage dV. A change in voltage dV in a time dt will 
result in a current I = dQ/dt given by
 
I =

Therefore, CT is important while considering a diode or a transistor as a circuit element. The quantity CT is 
called the transition, space-charge, barrier or depletion region capacitance. 
step-graded Junction
A PN junction is formed from a single-crystal intrinsic semiconductor by doping part of it with acceptor 
impurities and the remaining with donors. A junction between P-type and N-type materials may be fabricated 
in a variety of ways.
The change in impurity concentration from P to N-type 
semiconductor occurs in a very short length, typically 
much less than 1 mm. In an abrupt PN junction, there is 
a sudden step change from acceptor ions on one side to 
donor ions on the other side. Such a junction is fabricated 
by placing trivalent indium against N-type germanium 
and heating the combination to a high temperature for a 
short time. Since some of the indium dissolves into the 
germanium, the N-type germanium is changed into P-type 
at the junction. Such a step-graded junction is called an 
alloy, or fusion junction. A step-graded junction is also 
formed between the emitter and base of an integrated 
transistor. 
A diffused junction is graded in which case the donor and 
acceptor concentrations are functions of distance across 
the junction. Then the acceptor density, NA, gradually 
decreases and the donor density, ND, gradually increases 
till NA = ND is reached. Therefore, ND increases and NA 
decreases to zero.
It is not necessary for the abrupt junction to be symmetrical, 
that is, the doping concentrations at either side of the 
junction are dissimilar.
As shown in Fig. 2.13, consider a PN diode which is 
asymmetrically doped at the junction. Since the net charge 
is zero then qNAWp = qNDWn.

When no external voltage is applied, i.e., V = 0, the width of the depletion region of a PN junction diode is 
of the order of 0.5 microns. The movement of majority carriers across the junction causes opposite charges 
to be stored at this distance W apart. This depletion region acts as a dielectric between the two conducting 
P- and N-regions. Therefore, these regions act as a parallel-plate capacitor whose transition capacitance CT is 
approximately 20 pF with no external bias.
When a forward bias of +V is applied, the effective barrier potential, VB = [Vo – (+V)], is lowered and hence, 
the width of the depletion region W decreases and CT increases. Under reverse-bias condition, the majority 
carriers move away from the junction, thereby uncovering more immobile charges. Now the effective barrier 
potential, VB = [Vo – (–V)], is increased and, hence, W increases with reverse voltage and CT decreases 
correspondingly. The values of CT range from 5 to 200 pF, the larger values being for the high-power diodes. 
This property of voltage variable capacitance with the reverse bias appears in varactors, vari-caps or volta-
caps.
2.7.2 Diffusion Capacitance (CD)
The capacitance that exists in a forward-biased junction is called a diffusion or storage capacitance (CD), 
whose value is usually much larger than CT, which exists in a reverse-biased junction. This is also defined as 
the rate of change of injected charge with applied voltage, i.e., 
D
dQ

dV
=
, where dQ represents the change 
in the number of minority carriers stored outside the depletion region when a change in voltage across the 
diode, dV, is applied.
Calculation of CD  
Let us assume that the P-material in one side of the diode is heavily doped in 
comparison with the N-side. Since the holes move from the P- to the N-side, the hole current I ª Ipn(0).
The excess minority charge Q existing on the N-side is given by

Diffusion capacitance CD increases exponentially with forward bias or, alternatively, that it is proportional to

the diode carrying a larger anode current, I.
The effect of CD is negligible for a reverse-biased PN junction. As the value of CD is inversely proportional 
to frequency, it is high at low frequencies and it decreases with the increase in frequency.
2.8 eNeRgy-BAND DIAgRAm Of PN JUNCTION DIODe
Consider that a PN junction has P-type and N-type materials in close physical contact at the junction on an 
atomic scale. Hence, the energy-band diagrams of these two regions undergo relative shift to equalise the 
Fermi level. The Fermi level EF should be constant throughout the specimen at equilibrium. The distribution 
of  electrons or holes in allowed energy states is dependent on the position of the Fermi level. If this is not so, 
electrons on one side of the junction would have an average energy higher than those on the other side, and 
this causes transfer of electrons and energy until the Fermi levels on the two sides get equalized. However, 
such a shift does not disturb the relative position of the conduction band, valence band, and Fermi level in 
any region. Equalization of Fermi levels in the P and N materials of a PN junction is similar to equalization 
of levels of water in two containers on being joined together.
The energy-band diagram for a PN junction is shown in Fig. 2.14, where the Fermi level EF is closer to the 
conduction-band edge Ecn in the N-type material while it is closer to the valence-band edge Evp in the P-type 
material. It is clear that the conduction-band edge Ecp in the P-type material is higher than the conduction 
band edge Ecn in the N-type material. Similarly, the valence-band edge Evp in the  P-type material is higher 
than the valence-band edge Evn in the N-type material. As illustrated in Fig. 2.14, E1 and E2 indicate the shifts 
in the Fermi level from the intrinsic conditions in the P and N materials respectively. Then the total shift in 
the energy level E0 is given by
 
E0 = E1 + E2 = Ecp – Ecn = Evp – Evn
This energy E0 (in eV) is the potential energy of the electrons at the PN junction, and is equal to qV0, where 
V0 is the contact potential (in volt) or contact difference of potential or the barrier potential.

2.9 ZeNeR DIODe
When the reverse voltage reaches breakdown voltage in a normal PN 
junction diode, the current through the junction and the power dissipated at 
the junction will be high. Such an operation is destructive and the diode gets 
damaged. Whereas diodes can be designed with adequate power dissipation 
capabilities to operate in the breakdown region. One such diode is known as 
the Zener diode. The Zener diode is heavily doped than the ordinary diode.
From the V–I characteristics of the Zener diode, shown in Fig. 2.15, it is found 
that the operation of the Zener diode is same as that of an ordinary PN diode 
under forward-biased condition. Whereas under reverse-baised condition, 
breakdown of the junction occurs. The breakdown voltage depends upon 
the amount of doping. If the diode is heavily doped, the depletion layer will 
be thin and, consequently, breakdown occurs at lower reverse voltage and 
further, the breakdown voltage is sharp. Whereas a lightly doped diode has 
a higher breakdown voltage. Thus, breakdown voltage can be selected with the amount of doping.
The sharp increasing currents under breakdown conditions are due to the following two mechanisms.
 
1. 
Avalanche breakdown
 
2. 
Zener breakdown
2.10 AVALANChe AND ZeNeR BReAkDOwN meChANIsm
Avalanche breakdown
As the applied reverse bias increases, the field across the junction increases correspondingly. Thermally 
generated carriers, while traversing the junction, acquire a large amount of kinetic energy from this field. 
As a result, the velocity of these carriers increases. These electrons disrupt covalent bond by colliding with 
immobile ions and create new electron-hole pairs. These new carriers again acquire sufficient energy from 
the field and collide with other immobile ions thereby generating further electron-hole pairs. This process 
is cumulative in nature and results in generation of avalanche of charge carriers within a short time. This 
mechanism of carrier generation is known as avalanche multiplication. This process results in flow of large 
amount of current at the same value of reverse bias.

Zener Breakdown
When the P- and N-regions are heavily doped, direct rupture of covalent bonds takes place because of the 
strong electric fields, at the junction of the PN diode. The new electron-hole pairs so created increase the 
reverse current in a reverse-biased PN diode. The increase in current takes place at a constant value of 
reverse bias typically below 6 V for heavily doped diodes. As a result of heavy doping of P- and N-regions, 
the depletion-region width becomes very small and for an applied voltage of 6 V or less, the field across the 
depletion region becomes very high, of the order of 107 V/m, making conditions suitable for Zener breakdown. 
For lightly doped diodes, Zener breakdown voltage becomes high and breakdown is then predominantly 
by avalanche multiplication. Though Zener breakdown occurs for lower breakdown voltage and avalanche 
breakdown occurs for higher breakdown voltage, such diodes are normally called Zener diodes.
2.11 ZeNeR DIODe AppLICATIONs
From the Zener characteristics shown in Fig. 2.15, under the reverse-bias condition, the voltage across the 
diode remains almost constant although the current through the diode increases as shown in region AB. Thus, 
the voltage across the Zener diode serves as a reference 
voltage. Hence, the diode can be used as a voltage 
regulator.
In Fig. 2.16, it is required to provide constant voltage 
across load resistance RL, whereas the input voltage 
may be varying over a range. As shown, Zener diode is 
reverse biased and as long as the input voltage does not 
fall below VZ (Zener breakdown voltage), the voltage 
across the diode will be constant and hence the load 
voltage will also be constant.
2.12 TUNNeL DIODe
The tunnel diode, or Esaki diode, is a thin-junction diode which exhibits negative resistance under low 
forward-bias conditions.
An ordinary PN junction diode has an impurity concentration of about 1 part in 108. With this amount of 
doping, the width of the depletion layer is of the order of 5 microns. This potential barrier restrains the flow 
of carriers from the majority carrier side to the minority carrier side. If the concentration of impurity atoms 
is greatly increased to the level of 1 part in 103, the device characteristics are completely changed. The width 
of the junction barrier varies inversely as the square root of the impurity concentration and, therefore, is 
reduced from 5 microns to less than 100 Å (10–8 m). This thickness is only about 1/50th of the wavelength of 
visible light. For such thin potential-energy barriers, the electrons will penetrate through the junction rather 
than surmounting them. This quantum mechanical behavior is referred to as tunneling and hence, these high-
impurity-density PN junction devices are called tunnel diodes.
The V–I characteristic for a typical germanium tunnel diode is shown in Fig. 2.17. It is seen that at first 
forward current rises sharply as applied voltage is increased, where it would have risen slowly for an ordinary 
PN junction diode (which is shown as dashed line for comparison). Also, reverse current is much larger for 
comparable back bias than in other diodes due to the thinness of the junction. The interesting portion of the 
characteristic starts at the point A on the curve, i.e., the peak voltage. As the forward bias is increased beyond

this point, the forward current drops and continues to drop until point B is reached. This is the valley voltage. 
At B, the current starts to increase once again and does so very rapidly as bias is increased further. Beyond 
this point, the characteristic resembles that of an ordinary diode. Apart from the peak voltage and valley 
voltage, the other two parameters normally used to specify the diode behaviour are the peak current and the 
peak-to-valley current ratio, which are 2 mA and 10 respectively, as shown.

Fig. 2.17 V–I characteristic of a tunnel diode
The V–I characteristic of the tunnel diode illustrates that it exhibits dynamic resistance between A and B. 
Figure 2.18 shows energy level diagrams of the tunnel diode for three interesting bias levels. The shaded 
areas show the energy states occupied by electrons in the valence band, whereas the cross hatched regions 
represent energy states in the conduction band occupied by the electrons. The levels to which the energy 
states are occupied by electrons on either side of the junctions are shown by dotted lines. When the bias is 
zero, these lines are at the same height. Unless energy is imparted to the electrons from some external source, 
the energy possessed by the electrons on the N-side of the junction is insufficient to permit to climb over the 
junction barrier to reach the P-side. However, quantum mechanics show that there is a finite probability for 
the electrons to tunnel through the junction to reach the other side, provided there are allowed empty energy 
states in the P-side of the junction at the same energy level. Hence, the forward current is zero.
When a small forward bias is applied to the junction, the energy level of the P-side is lower as compared with 
the N-side. As shown in Fig. 2.18(b), electrons in the conduction band of the N-side see an empty energy 
level on the P-side. Hence, tunnelling from N-side to P-side takes place. Tunnelling in other directions is not 
possible because the valence band electrons on the P-side are now opposite to the forbidden energy gap on 
the N-side. The energy band diagram shown in Fig. 2.18(b), is for the peak of the diode characteristic.

When the forward bias is raised beyond this point, tunnelling will decrease as shown in Fig. 2.18(c). The 
energy of the P-side is now depressed further, with the result that fewer conduction band electrons on the 
N-side are opposite to the unoccupied P-side energy levels. As the bias is raised, forward current drops. This 
corresponds to the negative resistance region of the diode characteristic. As forward bias is raised still further, 
tunneling stops altogether and it behaves as a normal PN junction diode.
2.12.1 equivalent Circuit
The equivalent circuit of the tunnel diode, when biased in the negative resistance region, is as shown in 
Fig. 2.19(a). In the circuit, Rs is the series resistance and Ls is the series inductance which may be ignored 
except at highest frequencies. The resulting diode equivalent circuit is thus reduced to parallel combination 
of the junction capacitance Cj and the negative resistance –Rn. Typical values of the circuit components are 
Rs = 6 W, Ls = 0.1 nH, Cj = 0.6 pF and Rn = 75 W.

2.13 LIghT emITTINg DIODe (LeD)
The Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a PN junction device which emits light when forward biased, by a 
phenomenon called electroluminescence. In all semiconductor PN junctions, some of the energy will be 
radiated as heat and some in the form of photons. In silicon and germanium, greater percentage of energy is 
given out in the form of heat and the emitted light is insignificant. In other materials such as gallium phosphide 
(GaP) or gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP), the number of photons of light energy emitted is sufficient to 
create a visible light source. Here, the charge 
carrier recombination takes place when electrons 
from the N-side cross the junction and recombine 
with the holes on the P-side.
LED under forward bias and its symbol are shown 
in Figs 2.20(a) and (b), respectively. When an 
LED is forward biased, the electrons and holes 
move towards the junction and recombination 
takes place. As a result of recombination, the 
electrons lying in the conduction bands of 
N-region fall into the holes lying in the valence 
band of a P-region. The difference of energy 
between the conduction band and the valence 
band is radiated in the form of light energy. Each 
recombination causes radiation of light energy. 
Light is generated  by recombination of electrons

and holes whereby their excess energy is transferred to an emitted photon. The brightness of the emitted light 
is directly proportional to the forward-bias current.
Figure 2.20(c) shows the basic structure of an LED showing recombination of carriers and emission of light. 
Here, an N-type layer is grown on a substrate and a P-type is deposited on it by diffusion. Since carrier 
recombination takes place in the P-layer, it is kept uppermost. The metal anode connections are made at 
the outer edges of the P-layer so as to allow more central surface area for the light to escape. LEDs are 
manufactured with domed lenses in order to reduce the reabsorption problem. A metal (gold) film  is applied 
to the bottom of the substrate for reflecting as much light as possible to the surface of the device and also to 
provide cathode connection. LEDs are always encased to protect their delicate wires.
The efficiency of generation of light increases with the increases in injected current and with a decrease in 
temperature. The light is concentrated near the junction as the carriers are available within a diffusion length 
of the junction.
LEDs radiate different colours such as red, green, yellow, orange, blue and white. Some of the LEDs emit 
infrared (invisible) light also. The wavelength of emitted light depends on the energy gap of the material. 
Hence, the colour of the emitted light depends on the type of material used is given as follows.
 
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) – infrared radiation (invisible)
 
Gallium phosphide (GaP) – red or green
 
Gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) – red or yellow
In order to protect LEDs, resistance of 1 kW or 1.5 kW must be connected in series with the LED. LEDs emit 
no light when reverse biased. LEDs operate at voltage levels from 1.5  to 3.3 V, with the current of some tens 
of milliamperes. The power requirement is typically from 10 to 150 mW with a lifetime of 1,00,000 + hours. 
LEDs can be switched ON and OFF at a very fast speed of 1 ns.
They are used in burglar alarm systems, picture phones, multimeters, calculators, digital meters, 
microprocessors, digital computers, electronic telephone exchange, intercoms, electronic panels, digital 
watches, solid state video displays, and optical communication systems. Also, there are two-lead LED lamps 
which contain two LEDs, so that a reversal in biasing will change the colour from green to red, or vice-
versa.
When the emitted light is coherent, i.e., essentially monocromatic, then such a diode is referred to as an 
Injection Laser Diode (ILD). The LED and ILD are the two main types used as optical sources. ILD has 
a shorter rise time than LED, which makes the ILD more suitable for wide-bandwidth and high-data-rate 
applications. In addition, more optical power can be coupled into a fibre with an ILD, which is important for 
long distance transmission. A disadvantage of the ILD is the strong temperature dependence of the output 
characteristic curve.
2.14 phOTODIODe
Silicon photodiode is a light-sensitive device, also called photodetector, which converts light into electrical 
signals. The construction and symbol of a photodiode are shown in Fig. 2.21. The diode is made of a 
semiconductor PN junction kept in a sealed plastic or glass casing. The cover is so designed that the light rays 
are allowed to fall on one surface across the junction. The remaining sides of the casing are painted to restrict 
the penetration of light rays. A lens permits light to fall on the junction. When light falls on the reverse-biased 
PN photodiode junction, hole-electron pairs are created. The movement of these hole-electron pairs in a

properly connected circuit results in current flow. The magnitude of the photocurrent depends on the number 
of charge carriers generated and hence, on the illumination of the diode element. This current is also affected 
by the frequency of the light falling on the 
junction of the photodiode. The magnitude of 
the current under large reverse bias is given by
I = IS + Io(1 –  e V/hVT )
where 
Io = reverse saturation current
 
IS =  short-circuit current which 
is proportional to the light 
intensity
 
V = voltage across the diode
 
VT = volt equivalent of temperature
 
h =  parameter, 1 for Ge and 2 for 
Si.
The characteristics of a photodiode are shown in Fig. 2.22. The 
reverse current increases in direct proportion to the level of 
illumination. Even when no light is applied, there is a minimum 
reverse leakage current called dark current, flowing through the 
device. Germanium has a higher dark current than silicon, but it 
also has a higher level of reverse current.
Photodiodes are used as light detectors, demodulators and 
encoders. They are also used in optical communication system, 
high-speed counting and switching circuits. Further, they 
are used in computer card punching and tapes, light operated 
switches, sound track films and electronic control circuits.
2.15 PNPN DIODe (shOCkLey DIODe)
As shown in Fig. 2.23, it is a four-layer PNPN silicon device with 
two terminals. When an external voltage is applied to the device in 
such a way that anode is positive with respect to cathode, junctions 
J1 and J3 are forward biased and J2 is reverse biased. Then the 
applied voltage appears across the reverse biased junction J2. Now, 
the current flowing through the device is only reverse saturation 
current.
However, as this applied voltage is increased, the current increases 
slowly until the so called firing or breakover voltage (VBO) is 
reached. Once firing takes place, the current increases abruptly and 
the voltage drop across the device decreases sharply. At this point, 
the diode switches over from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’state. Once the device 
is fired into conduction, a minimum amount of current known a 
holding current, IH, is required to flow to keep the device in the 
ON state. To turn the device OFF from ON state, the current has 
to be reduced below IH by reducing the applied voltage close to

in which the end P-layer acts as anode, the end N-layer acts as cathode, and the P-layer nearer to cathode 
acts as gate. As leakage current in silicon is very small compared to germanium, SCRs are made of silicon 
and not germanium.

Characteristics of SCR The characteristics of the SCR are shown in Fig. 2.26. SCR acts as a switch 
when it is forward biased. When the gate terminal is kept open, i.e., gate current IG = 0, operation of SCR is 
similar to the PNPN diode. When IG < 0, the amount of reverse bias applied to J2 is increased. So the 
breakover voltage VBO is increased. When IG > 0, the 
amount of reverse bias applied to J2 is decreased, 
thereby decreasing the breakover voltage. With very 
large positive gate current, breakover may occur at a 
very low voltage such that the characteristics of SCR 
is similar to that of the ordinary PN diode. As the 
voltage at which the SCR is switched ‘ON’ can be 
controlled by varying the gate current IG, it is 
commonly called as controlled switch. Once the 
SCR is turned ON, the gate loses control, i.e., the 
gate cannot be used to switch the device OFF. One 
way to turn the device OFF is by lowering the anode 
current below the holding current IH by reducing the 
supply voltage below the holding voltage VH, keeping 
the gate open.
The SCR is used in relay control, motor control, phase control, heater control, battery chargers, inverters, 
regulated power supplies, and as static switches.
Two-transistor Version of SCR 
The operation of an SCR can be explained in a very simple way by 
considering it in terms of two transistors, called the two-transistor version of SCR. As shown in Fig. 2.27, 
an SCR can be split into two parts and displaced mechanically from one another but connected electrically. 
Thus, the device may be considered to be constituted by two transistors T1 (PNP) and T2 (NPN) connected 
back to back.

Also, from Fig. 2.27, it is clear that
 
Ib1 = IC2 
(2.24)
and  
IC2  = a2IK 
(2.25)
Substituting the values given in Eqs (2.24) and (2.25) in Eq. (2.23), we get
 
(1 – a1) IA = a2IK 
(2.26)
We know that  
IK  = IA + Ig 
(2.27)
Substituting Eq. (2.27) in Eq. (2.26), we obtain
 
(1 – a1) IA = a2 (IA + Ig)

(1 – a1 – a2)IA  = a2Ig

(2.28)
Equation (2.28) indicates that if (a1 + a2) = 1, then IA = •, i.e., the anode current IA suddenly reaches a very 
high value approaching infinity. Therefore, the device suddenly triggers into ON state from the original OFF 
state. This characteristic of the device is known as its regenerative action.
The value of (a1 + a2) can be made almost equal to unity by giving a proper value of positive current Ig for a 
short duration. This signal Ig applied at the gate which is the base of T2 will cause a flow of collector current 
IC2 by transferring T2 to its ON state. As IC2 = Ib1, the transistor T1 will also be switched ON. Now, the action 
is regenerative since each of the transistors would supply base current to the other. At this point even if the 
gate signal is removed, the device keeps on conducting, till the current level is maintained to a minimum 
value of holding current.
2.16.1 Thyristor Ratings
Latching Current (IL ) Latching current is the minimum current required to latch or trigger the device 
from its OFF-state to its ON-state.
Holding Current (IH ) Holding current is the minimum value of current to hold the device in the ON-state. 
For turning the device OFF, the anode current should be lowered below IH by increasing the external circuit 
resistance.
Gate Current (Ig ) Gate current is the current applied to the gate of the device for control purposes. The 
minimum gate current is the minimum value of current required at the gate for triggering the device. The 
maximum gate current is the maximum value of current applied to the device without damaging the gate. 
More the gate current, earlier is the triggering of the device and vice versa.
Voltage Safety Factor (Vf ) Voltage safety factor Vf is a ratio which is related to the PIV, the RMS value 
of the normal operating voltage as,
 
Vf = 
peak inverse voltage (PIV)
2 × rms value of the operating voltage

Junction Diode Characteristics and Special Semiconductor Devices
2.39
  The value of Vf normally lies between 2 and 2.7. For a safe operation, the normal working voltage of the 
device is much below its PIV.
2.16.2 Rectifier Circuits using sCR
SCRs are much superior in performance than ordinary diode rectifiers. They find their main applications as 
rectifiers. Some of the rectifier circuits have been explained in the following sections.
SCR Half-Wave Rectifier 
Though the SCR is basically a switch, it can be used in linear applications like 
rectification. Figure 2.28 shows the circuit of an SCR half-wave rectifier.
During the negative half-cycle, the SCR 
does not conduct irrespective of the gate 
current, as the anode is negative with 
respect to cathode and also PIV is less than 
the reverse breakdown voltage.
During the positive half-cycle of ac voltage 
appearing across secondary, the SCR will 
conduct provided proper gate current is 
made to flow. The greater the gate current, 
the lesser the supply voltage at which the 
SCR is triggered ON. Referring to Fig. 
2.28(b), the gate current is adjusted to such 
a value that the SCR is turned ON at a 
positive voltage V1 of ac secondary voltage 
which is less than the peak voltage Vm. 
Beyond this, the SCR will be conducting 
till the applied voltage becomes zero. The 
angle at which the SCR starts conducting 
during the positive half-cycle is called 
firing angle q. Therefore, the conduction 
angle is (180° – q).
The SCR will block not only the negative 
part of the applied sinusoidal voltage, but 
also the part of the positive waveform up 
to a point SCR is triggered ON. If the angle 
q is zero, this will be an ordinary half-
wave rectification. Therefore, by proper 
adjustment of gate current, the SCR can be 
made to conduct full or part of a positive 
half-cycle, thereby controlling the power 
fed to the load.
Analysis 
Let V = Vm sin wt be alternating voltage that appears across the secondary of the transformer. In 
an SCR half-wave rectifier, q is the firing angle and the rectifier conducts from q to 180° (p radians) during 
the positive half-cycle.

In an SCR half-wave rectifier, the forward breakdown voltage of SCR is 110 V for a gate current of 1 mA. 
If a 50 Hz sinusoidal voltage of 220 V peak is applied, find firing angle, conduction angle, average voltage, 
average current, power output, and the time during which the SCR remains OFF. Assume load resistance is 
100 W and the holding current to be zero.
Solution   We know that, V1 = Vm sin q
 
110 = 220 sin q, i.e.,  sin q = 0.5
Therefore, firing angle,  
q = sin–1 (0.5) = 30°

SCR Full-Wave Rectifier 
The SCR 
full-wave rectifier is shown in Fig. 2.29. It 
is exactly similar to an ordinary full wave 
rectifier except that the two diodes have 
been replaced by two SCRs. The angle of 
conduction can be changed by adjusting 
the gate currents.
During the positive half-cycle of the input 
signal, anode of SCR1 becomes positive 
and at the same time, the anode of SCR2 
becomes negative. When the input voltage 
reaches V1 as shown in Fig. 2.29(b), SCR1 
starts conducting and therefore only the 
shaded portion of positive half-cycle will 
pass through the load.
During the negative half-cycle of the input, 
the anode of SCR1 becomes negative and 
the anode of SCR2 becomes positive. 
Hence, SCR1 does not conduct and SCR2 
conducts when the input voltage becomes 
V1.
The main advantage of this circuit over an 
ordinary full-wave rectifier circuit is that 
any voltage can be made available at the 
output by simply changing the firing angle 
of the SCRs.

V = Vm sin w t be the alternating voltage

2.16.3 LAsCR (Light-Activated sCR)
The LASCR shown in Fig. 2.31 is triggered by irradiating it with 
light. The arrows represent incoming light that passes through 
a window and falls on the depletion layer closer to the middle 
junction J2 of SCR. The incident light generates electron-hole 
pairs in the device thus increasing the number of charge carriers. 
This leads to the instantaneous flow of current within the device 
and the device turns ON. For light triggering to occur, the device 
must have high value of rate of change of voltage with time, 
dV/dt.

2.17 TRIAC (TRIODe AC swITCh)
The TRIAC is a three-terminal semiconductor switching device which can control alternating current in 
a load. Its three terminals are MT1, MT2, and the gate (G). The basic structure and circuit symbol of a 
TRIAC are shown in Fig. 2.32. The TRIAC is equivalent to two SCRs connected in parallel but in the reverse 
direction as shown in Fig. 2.33. So, a TRIAC will act as a switch for both directions. The characteristics of a 
TRIAC are shown in Fig. 2.34.
Like an SCR, a TRIAC also starts conducting only when the breakover voltage is reached. Earlier to that, the 
leakage current which is very small in magnitude flows through the device and therefore remains in the OFF 
state. The device, when starts conducting, allows very heavy amount of current to flow through it. The high 
inrush of current must be limited using external resistance, or it may otherwise damage the device.

During the positive half-cycle, MT1 is positive with respect to MT2, whereas MT2 is positive with respect 
to MT1 during the negative half-cycle. A TRIAC is a bidirectional device and can be triggered either by a 
positive or by a negative gate signal. By applying proper signal at the gate, the breakover voltage, i.e., firing 
angle of the device can be changed; thus phase control process can be achieved.
A TRIAC is used for illumination control, temperature control, liquid-level control, motor-speed control, and 
as static switch to turn ac power ON and OFF. Nowadays, the DIAC–TRIAC pairs are increasingly being 
replaced by a single component unit known as QUADRAC. Its main limitation in comparison to SCR is its 
low power-handling capacity.

2.18 DIAC (DIODe AC swITCh)
The construction and symbol of DIAC are shown in Fig. 2.35. DIAC is a three-layer, two-terminal 
semiconductor device. MT1 and MT2 are the two main terminals which are interchangeable. It acts as a 
bidirectional avalanche diode. It does not have any control terminal. It has two junctions J1 and J2. Though 
the DIAC resembles a bipolar transistor, the central layer is free from any connection with the terminals.
From the characteristic of a DIAC shown in Fig. 2.36, it acts as a switch in both directions. As the doping 
level at the two ends of the device is the same, the DIAC has identical characteristics for both positive and 
negative half of an ac cycle. During the positive half-cycle, MT1 is positive with respect to MT2 whereas

MT2 is positive with respect to MT1 in the negative half-cycle. At voltage less than the breakover voltage, a 
very small amount of current, called the leakage current, flows through the device and the device remains in 
OFF state. When the voltage level reaches the breakover voltage, the device starts conducting and it exhibits 
negative resistance characteristics, i.e., the current flowing in the device starts increasing and the voltage 
across it starts decreasing.
The DIAC is not a control device. It is used as triggering device in TRIAC phase-control circuits used for 
light dimming, motor speed control, and heater control.
2.19 UJT (UNIJUNCTION TRANsIsTOR) ReLAxATION OsCILLATOR
UJT is a three-terminal semiconductor switching device. As it has only one PN junction and three leads, it is 
commonly called unijunction transistor.
The basic structure of a UJT is shown in Fig. 2.37(a). It consists of a lightly doped N-type silicon bar with 
a heavily doped P-type material alloyed to its one side closer to B2 for producing a single PN junction. The 
circuit symbol of UJT is shown in Fig. 2.37(b). Here, the emitter leg is drawn at an angle to the vertical and 
the arrow indicates the direction of the conventional current.

Characteristics of UJT 
Referring to Fig. 2.37(c), the interbase resistance between B2 and B1 of the silicon 
bar is RBB = RB1 + RB2. With the emitter terminal open, if voltage VBB is applied between the two bases, a 
voltage gradient is established along the N-type bar. The voltage drop across RB1 is given by V1 = hVBB, 
where the intrinsic stand-off ratio h = RB1/(RB1 + RB2). The typical value of h ranges from 0.56 to 0.75. This 
voltage V1 reverse biases the PN junction and emitter current is cut-off. But a small leakage current flows 
from B2 to emitter due to minority carriers. If a positive voltage VE is applied to the emitter, the PN junction 
will remain reverse biased so long as VE is less than V1. If VE exceeds V1 by the cut-in voltage Vg , the diode 
becomes forward biased. Under this condition, holes are injected into N-type bar. These holes are repelled 
by the terminal B2 and are attracted by the terminal B1. Accumulation of holes in E to B1 region reduces the 
resistance in this section and hence, emitter current IE is increased and is limited by VE. The device is now in 
the ‘ON’ state. 

Junction Diode Characteristics and Special Semiconductor Devices
2.47
If a negative voltage is applied to the emitter, PN junction remains reverse biased and the emitter current is 
cut-off. The device is now in the ‘OFF’ state.
Figure 2.38 shows a family of input characteristics of UJT. Here, up to the peak point P, the diode is reverse 
biased and hence, the region to the left of the peak point is called cut-off region. The UJT has a stable firing 
voltage VP which depends linearly on VBB and a small firing current IP (ª 25 mA). At P, the peak voltage 
VP = hVBB + Vg , the diode starts conducting and holes are injected into N-layer. Hence, resistance decreases 
thereby decreasing VE for the increase in IE. So, there is a negative resistance region from the peak point P to 
the valley point V. After the valley point, the device is driven into saturation and behaves like a conventional 
forward biased PN junction diode. The region to the right of the valley point is called saturation region. In 
the valley point, the resistance changes from negative to positive. The resistance remains positive in the 
saturation region. For very large IE, the characteristic asymptotically approaches the curve for IB2 = 0.
A unique characteristic of UJT is, when it is triggered, the emitter current increases regeneratively until it 
is limited by emitter power supply. Due to this negative resistance property, a UJT can be employed in a 
variety of applications, viz., sawtooth wave generator, pulse generator, switching, timing and phase control 
circuits.

UJT Relaxation Oscillator 
The relaxation oscillator using UJT which is meant for generating sawtooth 
waveform is shown in Fig. 2.39. It consists of a UJT and a capacitor CE which is charged through RE as the 
supply voltage VBB is switched ON.
The voltage across the capacitor increases exponentially and when the capacitor voltage reaches the peak 
point voltage VP, the UJT starts conducting and the capacitor voltage is discharged rapidly through EB1 and 
R1. After the peak point voltage of UJT is reached, it provides negative resistance to the discharge path which 
is useful in the working of the relaxation oscillator. As the capacitor voltage reaches zero, the device then 
cuts off and capacitor CE starts to charge again. This cycle is repeated continuously generating a sawtooth 
waveform across CE.

Fig. 2.39 UJT relaxation oscillator
The inclusion of external resistors R2 and R1 in series with B2 and B1 provides spike waveforms. When the 
UJT fires, the sudden surge of current through B1 causes drop across R1, which provides positive going 
spikes. Also, at the time of firing, fall of VEBI causes I2 to increase rapidly which generates negative going 
spikes across R2.
By changing the values of capacitance CE or resistance RE, frequency of the output waveform can be changed 
as desired, since these values control the time constant RE CE of the capacitor charging circuit.
Frequency of Oscillation 
The time period and hence, the frequency of the sawtooth wave can be 
calculated as follows. Assuming that the capacitor is initially uncharged, the voltage VC across the capacitor 
prior to breakdown is given by
 
VC = VBB (1 –  e  – t/RE CE )
where RE CE = charging time constant of resistor-capacitor circuit, and t = time from the commencement of 
the waveform.
The discharge of the capacitor occurs when VC is equal to the peak-point voltage VP, i.e.,
 
VP = hVBB = VBB (1 –  e  – t/RE CE )
 
h = 1 –  e – t/RE CE 
 
 e – t/RE CE = (1 – h)

3.1 IntroductIon
All electronic circuits need dc power supply either from battery or power-pack units. Transformers, rectifiers 
and filters form the basic building blocks of a linear power supply. A transformer supplies ac voltage at the 
required level. This bidirectional ac voltage is converted into a unidirectional pulsating dc using a rectifier. 
The unwanted ripple contents of this pulsating dc are removed by a filter to get pure dc voltage. The output of 
the filter is fed to a regulator which gives a steady dc output independent of load variations and input supply 
fluctuations. This chapter mainly discusses the operation and characteristics of different types of rectifiers 
and filters.
3.2 rectIfIers
Rectifier is defined as an electronic circuit used for converting ac voltage into unidirectional voltage. A 
rectifier utilizes unidirectional conduction device like a vacuum diode or PN junction diode. Rectifiers are 
classified depending upon the period of conduction as half-wave rectifier and full-wave rectifier.
3.2.1 Half-wave rectifier
It converts an ac voltage into a pulsating dc voltage using only one half of the applied ac voltage. The rectifying 
diode conducts only during one half of the ac cycle. Figure 3.1 shows the basic circuit and waveforms of a 
half-wave rectifier (HWR).
Let vi be the voltage applied to the primary of the transformer and given by the equation
 
vi  = Vm sin w t; Vm >> Vg
where Vg is the cut-in voltage of the diode. During the positive half cycle of the input signal, the anode of the 
diode becomes more positive with respect to the cathode and hence, the diode D conducts. For an ideal diode, 
the forward voltage drop is zero. So, the whole input voltage will appear across the load resistance, RL.
During negative half cycle of the input signal, the anode of the diode becomes negative with respect to the 
cathode and hence, diode D does not conduct. For an ideal diode, the impedance offered by the diode is 
infinity. So the whole input voltage appears across diode D. Hence, the voltage drop across RL is zero.

From this expression, it is clear that the amount of ac present in the output is 121% of the dc voltage. So the 
half-wave rectifier is not practically useful in converting ac into dc.

The maximum efficiency of a half-wave rectifier is 40.6%.
Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) 
It is defined as the maximum reverse voltage that a diode can withstand 
without destroying the junction. The peak inverse voltage across a diode is the peak of the negative half 
cycle. For half-wave rectifier, PIV is Vm.
Transformer Utilization Factor (TUF) 
In the design of any power supply, the rating of the transformer 
should be determined. This can be done with a knowledge of the dc power delivered to the load and the type 
of rectifying circuit used.

It converts an ac voltage into a pulsating dc voltage using both half cycles of the applied ac voltage. It uses 
two diodes of which one conducts during one half-cycle while the other diode conducts during the other half-
cycle of the applied ac voltage. There are two types of full-wave rectifiers, viz., (i), full-wave rectifier with 
centre tapped transformer, and (ii) full-wave rectifier without transformer (bridge rectifier).

Fig. 3.2 Full-wave rectifier
Figure 3.2 shows the basic circuit and waveforms of full-wave rectifier with a center tap transformer. During 
positive half of the input signal, the anode of the diode D1 becomes positive and at the same time, the anode 
of diode D2 becomes negative. Hence, D1 conducts and D2 does not conduct. The load current flows through 
D1 and the voltage drop across RL will be equal to the input voltage.
During the negative half-cycle of the input, the anode of D1 becomes negative and the anode of D2 becomes 
positive. Hence, D1 does not conduct and D2 conducts. The load current flows through D2 and the voltage 
drop across RL will be equal to the input voltage.

3.2.3 Bridge rectifier
The need for a centre-tapped transformer in a full-wave rectifier is eliminated in the bridge rectifier. As 
shown in Fig. 3.3, the bridge rectifier has four diodes connected to form a bridge. The ac input voltage is 
applied to the diagonally opposite ends of the bridge. The load resistance is connected between the other two 
ends of the bridge.
vi
vi
Fig. 3.3 Bridge rectifier
For the positive half-cycle of the input ac voltage, diodes D1 and D3 conduct, whereas diodes D2 and D4 do 
not conduct. The conducting diodes will be in series through the load resistance RL. So the load current flows 
through RL.
During the negative half-cycle of the input ac voltage, diodes D2 and D4 conduct, whereas diodes D1 and D3 
do not conduct. The conducting diode D2 and D4 will be in series through the load RL and the current flows 
through RL in the same direction as in the previous half-cycle. Thus, a bidirectional wave is converted into 
an unidirectional one.
The average values of output voltage and load current for bridge rectifier are the same as for a centre-tapped 
full-wave rectifier. Hence,

The maximum efficiency of a bridge rectifier is 81.2% and the ripple factor is 0.48. The PIV is Vm.
Advantages of the Bridge Rectifier 
 
In the bridge rectifier, the ripple factor and efficiency of the 
rectification are the same as for the full-wave rectifier. The PIV across either of the non-conducting diodes 
is equal to the peak value of the transformer secondary voltage, Vm. The bulky centre-tapped transformer is

not required. Transformer utilization factor is considerably high. Since the current flowing in the transformer 
secondary is purely alternating, the TUF increases to 0.812, which is the main reason for the popularity of 
a bridge rectifier. The bridge rectifiers are used in applications allowing floating output terminals, i.e., no 
output terminal is grounded.
The bridge rectifier has only one disadvantage that it requires four diodes as compared to two diodes for 
centre-tapped full-wave rectifier. But the diodes are readily available at cheaper rate in the market. Apart 
from this, the PIV rating required for the diodes in a bridge rectifier is only half of that for a centre tapped 
full-wave rectifier. This is a great advantage, which offsets the disadvantage of using extra two diodes in a 
bridge rectifier.

3.3 HarmonIc components In a rectIfIer cIrcuIt
The term harmonic is defined as “a sinusoidal component of a periodic waveform or quantity possessing a 
frequency, which is an integral multiple of the fundamental frequency.” By definition, a perfect sine wave has 
no harmonics, except fundamental component at one frequency. Harmonics are present in waveforms that are 
not perfect sine waves due to distortion from nonlinear loads. The French mathematician Fourier discovered 
that a distorted waveform can be represented as a series of sine waves, with each being an integer multiple of 
the fundamental frequency and each with a specific magnitude. 

Rectifiers and Filters
3.19
That is, the harmonic frequencies are integer multiples [2, 3, 4,….] of the fundamental frequency. For 
example, the second harmonic on a 50 Hz system is 2 × 50 or 100 Hz. The sixth harmonic in a 50 Hz system, 
or the fifth harmonic in a 60 Hz system is 300 Hz. There are a number of different types of equipment that 
may experience faulty operations or failures due to high harmonic voltage and/ or current levels. The amount 
of the harmonic voltage and current levels that a system can tolerate is dependent on the equipment and the 
source.
The sum of the fundamental and all the harmonics is called the Fourier series. This series can be viewed as 
a spectrum analysis where the fundamental frequency and the harmonic component are identified.
The result of such an analysis for the current waveform of a half-wave rectifier circuit using a single diode 
is given by

The angular frequency of the power supply is the lowest angular frequency present in the above expression. 
All the other terms are the even harmonics of the power frequency.
The full-wave rectifier consists of two half-wave rectifier circuits, arranged in such a way that one circuit 
conducts during one half cycle and the second circuit operates during the second half cycle. Therefore, the 
currents are functionally related by the expression i1 (a) = i2 (a + p). Thus, the total current of the full-wave 
rectifier is i = i1 + i2 as expressed by

From the above equation, it can be seen that the fundamental angular frequency is eliminated and the lowest 
frequency is the second harmonic term 2w. This is the advantage that the full-wave rectifier presents in 
filtering of the output. Additionally, the current pulses in the two halves of the transformer winding are in 
such directions that the magnetic cycles formed through the iron core is essentially that of the alternating 
current. This avoids any dc saturation of the transformer core that could give rise to additional harmonics at 
the output.
3.4 fIlters
The output of a rectifier contains dc component as well as ac component. Filters are used to minimise the 
undesirable ac, i.e., ripple leaving only the dc component to appear at the output.
The ripple in the rectified wave being very high, the factor being 48% in the full-wave rectifier; majority of 
the applications which cannot tolerate this, will need an output which has been further processed.
Figure 3.4 shows the concept of a filter, where the full-wave rectified output voltage is applied at its input. 
The output of a filter is not exactly a constant dc level. But it also contains a small amount of ac component. 
Some important filters are
 
(i) 
Inductor filter
 
(ii) 
Capacitor filter
 (iii) 
LC or L-section filter
 (iv) 
CLC or p-type filter

Fig. 3.4 Concept of a filter
3.5 Inductor fIlter
Figure 3.5 shows the inductor filter. When the output of the rectifier passes 
through an inductor, it blocks the ac component and allows only the dc 
component to reach the load.
The ripple factor of the inductor filter is given by
 
G = 
3 2
L
R
L
w
It shows that the ripple factor will decrease when L is increased and RL is 
decreased. Clearly, the inductor filter is more effective only when the load current is high (small RL). The 
larger value of the inductor can reduce the ripple and at the same time the output dc voltage will be lowered 
as the inductor has a higher dc resistance.
The operation of the inductor filter depends on its well known fundamental property to oppose any change 
of current passing through it.
To analyse this filter for a full-wave, the Fourier series can be written as

3.6 capacItor fIlter
An inexpensive filter for light loads is found in the capacitor filter which is connected directly across the 
load, as shown in Fig. 3.6(a). The property of a capacitor is that it allows ac component and blocks the dc 
component. The operation of a capacitor filter is to short the ripple to ground but leave the dc to appear at the 
output when it is connected across a pulsating dc voltage.
During the positive half-cycle, the capacitor charges up to the peak value of the transformer secondary 
voltage, Vm, and will try to maintain this value as the full-wave input drops to zero. The capacitor will 
discharge through RL slowly until the transformer secondary voltage again increases to a value greater than 
the capacitor voltage (equal to the load voltage). The diode conducts for a period which depends on the 
capacitor voltage. The diode will conduct when the transformer secondary voltage becomes more than the 
‘cut-in’ voltage of the diode. The diode stops conducting when the transformer voltage becomes less than the 
diode voltage. This is called cut-out voltage.
Fig. 3.6 (a) Capacitor filter (b) Ripple voltage triangular waveform 
Referring to Fig. 3.6(b) with slight approximation, the ripple voltage waveform can be assumed as triangular. 
From the cut-in point to the cut-out point, whatever charge the capacitor acquires is equal to the charge the 
capacitor has lost during the period of non-conduction, i.e., from cut-out point to the next cut-in point.
The charge it has acquired = Vr, p–p × C
The charge it has lost 
= Idc × T2
Therefore, 
Vr, p–p × C = Idc × T2
If the value of the capacitor is fairly large, or the value of the load resistance is very large, then it can be 
assumed that the time T2 is equal to half the periodic time of the waveform,

3.7 l-sectIon fIlter (lc fIlter)
We know that the ripple factor is directly proportional to the load resistance RL in the inductor filter and 
inversely proportional to RL in the capacitor filter. Therefore, if these two filters are combined as LC filter or 
L-section filter as shown in Fig. 3.7, the ripple factor will be independent of RL.
If the value of the inductance is increased, it will increase the time of conduction. At some critical value of 
inductance, one diode, either D1 or D2 in full-wave rectifier, will always be conducting.

 cannot be satisfied for all load requirements. At no load, i.e., 
when the load resistance is infinity, the value of the inductance 
will also tend to be infinity. To overcome this problem, a bleeder 
resistor RB is connected in parallel with the load resistance as 
shown in Fig. 3.8. Therefore, a minimum current will always be 
present for optimum operation of the inductor. It improves voltage 
regulation of the supply by acting as the pre-load on the supply. 
Also, it provides safety by acting as a discharging path for 
capacitor.

Figure 3.9 shows the CLC or p-type filter which basically consists of a capacitor filter followed by an LC 
section. This filter provided a fairly smooth output, and is characterized by a highly peaked diode currents and 
poor regulation.
The action of a p-section filter can best be understood by 
considering the inductor and the second capacitor as an L-section 
filter that acts upon the triangular output-voltage wave from the 
first capacitor. The output voltage is then approximately that 
from the input capacitor, decreased by the dc voltage drop in the 
inductor. The ripple contained in this output is reduced by the 
L-section filter.

Therefore, if resistor R is chosen equal to the reactance of the 
inductor which it replaces, the ripple remains unchanged.
The resistance R will increase the voltage drop and hence, the 
regulation will be poor. This type of filters are often used for 
economic reasons, as well as the space and weight requirement of the iron-cored choke for the LC filter. Such 
RC filters are often used only for low current power supplies.

4.1 IntroductIon
A Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is a three terminal semiconductor device in which the operation depends 
on the interaction of both majority and minority carriers and hence the name bipolar. The BJT is analogous 
to a vacuum triode and is comparatively smaller in size. It is used in amplifier and oscillator circuits, and as 
a switch in digital circuits. It has wide applications in computers, satellites and other modern communication 
systems. 
The quiescent operating point of a transistor amplifier should be established in the active region of its 
characteristics. Since the transistor parameters such as b, ICO and VBE are functions of temperature, the 
operating point shifts with changes in temperature. The stability of different methods of biasing transistor 
circuits and compensation techniques for stabilizing the operating point are discussed in this chapter.
4.2 BIpolar JunctIon transIstor
4.2.1 construction
The BJT consists of a silicon (or germanium) crystal in which a thin layer of N-type silicon is sandwiched 
between two layers of P-type silicon. This transistor is referred to as PNP. Alternatively, in an NPN transistor, 
a layer of P-type material is sandwiched between two layers of N-type material. The two types of the BJT are 
represented in Fig. 4.1.
The symbolic representation of the two 
types of the BJT is shown in Fig. 4.2. 
The three portions of the transistor are 
emitter, base, and collector, shown as E, 
B, and C, respectively. The arrow on the 
emitter specifies the direction of current 
flow when the EB junction is forward 
biased.
The emitter is heavily doped so that it can inject a large number of charge carriers into the base. The base is 
lightly doped and very thin. It passes most of the injected charge carriers from the emitter into the collector. 
The collector is moderately doped.

4.2.2 transistor Biasing
As shown in Fig. 4.3, usually the emitter-base junction is forward biased (F.B.) and the collector-base junction 
is reverse biased (R.B.). Due to the forward bias on the emitter-base junction, an emitter current flows through 
the base into the collector. Though the collector-base junction is reverse biased, almost the entire emitter 
current flows through the collector circuit.
Fig. 4.3 Transistor biasing: (a) NPN transistor (b) PNP transistor
4.2.3 operation of an npn transistor
As shown in Fig. 4.4, the forward bias applied 
to the emitter base junction of an NPN transistor 
causes a lot of electrons from the emitter region to 
cross over to the base region. As the base is lightly 
doped with P-type impurity, the number of holes 
in the base region is very small and, hence, the 
number of electrons that combine with holes in 
the P-type base region is also very small. Hence, 
a few electrons recombine with holes to constitute 
a base current IB. The remaining electrons (more 
than 95%) cross over into the collector region to 
constitute a collector current IC. Thus, the base 
and collector current summed up gives the emitter 
current, i.e., IE = – (IC + IB).

Transistor Characteristics (BJT and FET)
4.3
In the external circuit of the NPN bipolar junction transistor, the magnitudes of the emitter current IE, the base 
current IB, and the collector current IC are related by IE = IC + IB.
4.2.4 operation of a PNP transistor
As shown in Fig. 4.5, the forward bias applied to 
the emitter-base junction of a PNP transistor causes 
a lot of holes from the emitter region to cross over 
to the base region as the base is lightly doped with 
N-type impurity. The number of electrons in the 
base region is very small and, hence, the number 
of holes combined with electrons in the N-type 
base region is also very small. Hence, a few holes 
combined with electrons to constitute a base 
current IB. The remaining holes (more than 95%) 
cross over into the collector region to constitute 
a collector current IC. Thus, the collector and 
base current when summed up gives the emitter 
current, i.e., IE = – (IC + IB).
In the external circuit of the PNP bipolar junction transistor, the magnitudes of the emitter current IE, the base 
current IB and the collector current IC are related by
 
IE = IC + IB 
(4.1)
This equation gives the fundamental relationship between the currents in a bipolar transistor circuit. Also, this 
fundamental equation shows that there are current amplification factors a and b in common-base transistor 
configuration and common-emitter transistor configuration respectively for the static (dc) currents, and for 
small changes in the currents.

where ICBO (or ICO) is the reverse saturation current flowing through the reverse-biased collector-base junction, 
i.e., the collector-to-base leakage current with the emitter open. As the magnitude of ICBO is negligible when 
compared to IC, expression (4.7) can be written as
 
a =

E
I
I
 
(4.8)
Since IC  and IE are flowing in opposite directions, a is always positive. The typical value of a ranges 
from 0.90 to 0.995. Also, a is not a constant but varies with emitter current IE, collector voltage VCB, and 
temperature.
4.3.5 General transistor equation
In the active region of the transistor, the emitter-base junction is forward biased and the collector-base 
junction is reverse biased. The generalized expression for collector current IC for collector junction voltage 
VC and emitter current IE is given by
 
IC = – a IE + ICBO (1 – eVC/VT)  
(4.9)
If VC is negative and |VC| is very large compared with VT , then the above equation reduces to
 
IC = – a IE + ICBO 
(4.10)
If VC, i.e., VCB, is a few volts, then IC is independent of VC. Hence, the collector current IC is determined only 
by the fraction a of the current IE flowing in the emitter.
4.3.6 relation among IC, IB, and ICBO 
From Eq. (4.10), we have
 
IC = – a IE + ICBO
Since IC and IE are flowing in opposite directions,
 
IE = – (IC + IB)
Therefore, 
IC = – a [– (IC + IB)] + ICBO
 
IC – a IC = a IB + ICBO
 
IC (1– a) = a IB + ICBO

4.3.7 relation among IC, IB, and ICEO 
In the common-emitter (CE) transistor circuit, IB is the input current and IC is the output current. If the base 
circuit is open, i.e., IB = 0, then a small collector current flows from the collector to emitter. This is denoted 

Electronic Devices and Circuits
4.6
as ICEO, the collector-emitter current with base open. This current ICEO is also called the collector-to-emitter 
leakage current.
In this CE configuration of the transistor, the emitter-base junction is forward-biased and collector-base 
junction is reverse-biased and, hence, the collector current IC is the sum of the part of the emitter current 
IE  that reaches the collector, and the collector-emitter leakage current ICEO. Therefore, the part of IE, which 
reaches collector is equal to (IC  – ICEO).
Hence, the large-signal current gain (b) is defined as,
 
b  = (

(4.13)
From the equation, we have

4.3.8 relation Between ICBO and ICEO
Comparing Eqs (4.12) and (4.14), we get the relationship between the leakage currents of transistor common-
base (CB) and common-emitter (CE) configurations as
 
ICEO = (1 + b) ICBO 
(4.15)
From this equation, it is evident that the collector-emitter leakage current (ICEO) in CE configuration is 
(1 + b) times larger than that in CB configuration. As ICBO is temperature-dependent, ICEO varies by large 
amount when temperature of the junctions changes.
Expression for Emitter Current

 The magnitude of emitter current is
 
IE  = IC + IB
Substituting Eq. (4.12) in the above equation, we get
 
IE  = (1 + b) ICBO + (1 + b) IB

Substituting Eq. (4.11) into Eq. (4.16), we have

When a transistor is to be connected in a circuit, one terminal is used as an input terminal, the other terminal 
is used as an output terminal, and the third terminal is common to the input and output. Depending upon 
the input, output, and common terminals, a transistor can be connected in three configurations. They are 
(i) Common Base (CB) configuration, (ii) Common Emitter (CE) configuration, and (iii) Common Collector 
(CC) configuration.

This is also called grounded-base configuration. In this configuration, the emitter 
is the input terminal, the collector is the output terminal, and the base is the common terminal.

This is also called grounded-emitter configuration. In this configuration, the base

Input Characteristics 
To determine the input characteristics, the collector-base voltage VCB is kept 
constant at zero volt and the emitter current IE is increased from zero in suitable equal steps by increasing 
VEB. This is repeated for higher fixed values of VCB. 
A curve is drawn between emitter current IE and 
emitter-base voltage VEB at constant collector-base 
voltage VCB. The input characteristics thus obtained 
are shown in Fig. 4.8.
When VCB is equal to zero and the emitter-
base junction is forward biased as shown in the 
characteristics, the junction behaves as a forward-
biased diode so that emitter current IE increases 
rapidly with small increase in emitter-base voltage 
VEB. When VCB is increased keeping VEB constant, 
the width of the base region will decrease. This 
effect results in an increase of IE. Therefore, the 
curves shift towards the left as VCB is increased.
Output Characteristics 
To determine the 
output characteristics, the emitter current IE is kept 
constant at a suitable value by adjusting the emitter-base voltage VEB. Then VCB is increased in suitable equal 
steps and the collector current IC is noted for each value of IE. This is repeated for different fixed values of 
IE. Now the curves of IC versus VCB are plotted for constant values of IE and the output characteristics thus 
obtained is shown in Fig. 4.9.

Fig. 4.9 CB output characteristics
From the characteristics, it is seen that for a constant value of IE, IC is independent of VCB and the curves are 
parallel to the axis of VCB. Further, IC flows even when VCB is equal to zero. As the emitter-base junction is 
forward biased, the majority carriers, i.e., electrons, from the emitter are injected into the base region. Due 
to the action of the internal potential barrier at the reverse-biased collector-base junction, they flow to the 
collector region and give rise to IC even when VCB is equal to zero.

Early Effect or Base Width Modulation 
As the collector voltage VCC is made to increase the reverse 
bias, the space charge width between collector and base tends to increase, with the result that the effective 
width of the base decreases. This dependency of base width on collector-to-base voltage is known as the 
Early effect. This decrease in effective base width has three consequences:
 
(i) 
There is less chance for recombination within the base region. Hence, a increases with increasing 
|VCB|.
 
(ii) 
The charge gradient is increased within the base, and consequently, the current of minority carriers 
injected across the emitter junction increases.
 (iii) 
For extremely large voltages, the effective base width may be reduced to zero, causing voltage 
breakdown in the transistor. This phenomenon is called the punch-through.
For higher values of VCB, due to Early effect, the value of a increases. For example, a changes, say from 0.98 
to 0.985. Hence, there is a very small positive slope in the CB output characteristics and, hence, the output 
resistance is not zero.
Transistor Parameters
The slope of the CB characteristics will give the following four transistor parameters. Since these parameters 
have different dimensions, they are commonly known as common-base hybrid parameters or h-parameters.

Input Characteristics 
To determine the input characteristics, the collector-to-emitter voltage is kept 
constant at zero volt, and the base current is increased from zero in equal steps by increasing VBE in the circuit 
shown in Fig. 4.10.
Fig. 4.10 Circuit to determine CE static characteristics
The value of VBE is noted for each setting of IB. This 
procedure is repeated for higher fixed values of VCE, 
and the curves of IB Vs. VBE are drawn. The input 
characteristics thus obtained are shown in Fig. 4.11.
When VCE = 0, the emitter-base junction is forward 
biased and the junction behaves as a forward biased 
diode. Hence, the input characteristic for VCE = 0 is 
similar to that of a forward-biased diode. When VCE 
is increased, the width of the depletion region at the 
reverse-biased collector-base junction will increase. 
Hence, the effective width of the base will decrease. 
This effect causes a decrease in the base current IB. 
Hence, to get the same value of IB as that for VCE = 0, 
VBE should be increased. Therefore, the curve shifts 
to the right as VCE increases.
Output Characteristics 
To determine the output characteristics, 
the base current IB is kept constant at a suitable value by adjusting 
the base-emitter voltage, VBE. The magnitude of the collector-emitter 
voltage VCE is increased in suitable equal steps from zero and the 
collector current IC is noted for each setting VCE. Now, the curves of 
IC versus VCE are plotted for different constant values of IB. The 
output characteristics thus obtained are shown in Fig. 4.12.

Transistor Characteristics (BJT and FET)

For larger values of VCE, due to Early effect, a very small change in a is reflected as a very large change in b. 
For example, when a  = 0.98,

 = 66. Here, a 
slight increase in a by about 0.5% results in an increase in b by about 34%. Hence, the output characteristics 
of CE configuration show a larger slope when compared with CB configuration.
The output characteristics have three regions, namely, saturation region, cut-off region, and active region. 
The region of curves to the left of the line OA is called the saturation region (hatched), and the line OA is 
called the saturation line. In this region, both junctions are forward biased and an increase in the base current 
does not cause a corresponding large change in IC. The ratio of VCE(sat) to IC in this region is called saturation 
resistance.
The region below the curve for IB = 0 is called the cut-off region (hatched). In this region, both junctions are 
reverse biased. When the operating point for the transistor enters the cut-off region, the transistor is OFF. 
Hence, the collector current becomes almost zero and the collector voltage almost equals VCC, the collector-
supply voltage. The transistor is virtually an open circuit between collector and emitter.
The central region where the curves are uniform in spacing and slope is called the active region (unhatched). 
In this region, emitter-base junction is forward biased and the collector-base junction is reverse biased. If the 
transistor is to be used as a linear amplifier, it should be operated in the active region.
If the base current is subsequently driven large and positive, the transistor switches into the saturation region 
via the active region, which is traversed at a rate that is dependent on factors such as gain and frequency 
response. In this ON condition, large collector current flows and collector voltage falls to a very low value, 
called VCEsat, typically around 0.2 V for a silicon transistor. The transistor is virtually a short circuit in this 
state.
High-speed switching circuits are designed in such a way that transistors are not allowed to saturate, thus 
reducing switching times between ON and OFF times.

parameters have different dimensions, they are commonly known as common-emitter hybrid parameters or

Input Characteristics 
To determine the input characteristics, VEC is kept at a suitable fixed value. The 
base-collector voltage VBC is increased in equal steps and the corresponding increase in IB is noted. This is 
repeated for different fixed values of VEC. Plots of VBC versus IB for different values of VEC shown in Fig. 4.14 
are the input characteristics.
Output Characteristics 
To determine the output characteristics, the base current, IB, is kept constant at 
a suitable value by adjusting the base-collector voltage, VBC. The magnitude of the emitter-collector voltage, 
VEC, is increased in suitable equal steps from zero and the emitter current, IE, is noted for each setting VEC. 
Now, the curves of IE versus VEC are plotted for different constant values of IB. The output characteristics thus 
obtained are shown in Fig. 4.15. These output characteristics are the same as those of the common emitter 
configuration.

In this circuit, an NPN transistor is used in CE configuration. Here, VBB supply will forward bias the emitter-

base junction and VCC supply will reverse bias the collector-base junction. This biasing arrangement makes 
the transistor to operate in the active region. The magnitude of the input ac signal vi always forward bias the 
emitter-base junction regardless of the polarity of the signal.
Fig. 4.16(a) CE transistor as an amplifier
During the positive half cycle of the input signal vi, the forward bias across the emitter-base junction is 
increased. As a result, more electrons are injected into the base and reaches the collector, resulting in an 
increase in collector current ic. This increase in collector current produces a greater voltage drop across the 
load resistance RL.
However, during the negative half cycle of the input signal vi, the forward bias across the emitter-base 
junction is decreased, resulting in a decrease in collector current ic. This decrease in collector current produces 
a smaller voltage drop across the load resistance RL. Hence, it is clear that a small change in the input ac 
signal in CE transistor amplifier produces a large change at the output with a voltage gain of around 500 and 
a phase shift of 180°. Here, the voltage gain is the ratio of output voltage to input voltage. Comparing to CB 
and CC transistor configurations, this CE transistor configuration is widely used in amplifier circuits due to 
its high voltage gain.
CB Transistor as an Amplifier 
A load resistor RL is connected in series with the collector supply voltage 
VCC of the CB transistor configuration as shown in Fig. 4.16(b).

A small change in the input voltage between emitter and base, say DVi, causes a relatively larger change in 
the emitter current, say DIE. A fraction of this change in current is collected and passed through RL and is 
denoted by the symbol a ¢. Therefore, the corresponding change in voltage across the load resistor RL due to 
this current is DV0 = a¢ RL DIE.

A germanium transistor used in a complementary symmetry amplifier has ICBO = 10 mA at 27°C and hFE = 50.

IC = b IB + (1 + b) ICBO

which is nothing but the general expression for collector current of a transistor given in Eq. (4.27). Hence, this 
model is valid for both forward and reverse static voltages applied across the transistor junctions. Here, the 
base spreading resistance has been omitted and the difference between ICBO and ICO has been neglected.
The dependent current sources may be removed from Fig. 4.21, provided aN = aI = 0. If the base-width 
is made much larger than the diffusion length of minority carriers in the base, all minority carriers will 
recombine in the base and no minority carrier will be available to reach the collector. Therefore, the transistor

amplification factor a will become zero. As a result, transistor action ceases. Hence, it is not possible to 
construct a transistor by simply placing two isolated diodes back to back.
4.8 punch-throuGh or reach-throuGh
According to early effect, the width of the collector-junction depletion region increases with increased 
collector-junction voltage. As the voltage applied across the junction VCB increases, the transition region 
penetrates deeper into the base and will have spread completely across the base to reach the emitter junction, 
as the base is very thin. Thus, the collector voltage has reached through the base region. This effect, known as 
reach-through, also affects the output characteristics of a transistor since IC versus VCB curves are no longer 
horizontal but take on a positive slope indicating that the device has a finite output impedance that is voltage 
dependent. Since the input characteristics are also affected, the input impedance is also influenced by VCB.
It is possible to raise the punch-through voltage by increasing the doping concentration in the base, but this 
automatically reduces the emitter efficiency.
Punch-through takes place at a fixed voltage between collector and base and is not dependent on circuit 
configuration, whereas avalanche multiplication takes place at different voltages depending upon the circuit 
configuration. Therefore, the voltage limit of a particular transistor is determined by either of the two types 
of breakdown, whichever occurs at lower voltage.
4.9 phototransIstor
The phototransistor or photodiode is a much more sensitive semiconductor photodevice than the PN 
photodiode. The current produced by a photodiode is very low which cannot be directly used in control 
applications. Therefore, this current should be amplified before applying to control circuits. The phototransistor 
is a light detector which combines a photodiode and a transistor amplifier. When the phototransistor is 
illuminated, it permits a larger flow of current.
Figure 4.22 shows the circuit of an NPN phototransistor. It is usually connected in a CE configuration with 
the base open. A lens focuses the light on the base-collector junction. Although the phototransistor has three 
sections, only two leads, the emitter and collector leads, are generally used. In this device, base current is 
supplied by the current created by the light falling on the base-collector photodiode junction.

When there is no radiant excitation, the minority carriers are generated thermally, and the electrons crossing 
from the base to the collector and the holes crossing from the collector to the base constitute the reverse 
saturation collector current ICO. With IB = 0, the collector current is given by
 
IC = (b + 1) ICO
When the light is turned ON, additional minority carriers are photogenerated and the total collector current 
is
 
IC = (b + 1)(ICO + IL)
where IL is the reverse saturation current due to the light.
Current in a phototransistor is dependent mainly on the intensity of light entering the lens and is less affected 
by the voltage applied to the external circuit. Figure 4.23 shows a graph of collector current IC as a function 
of collector-emitter voltage VCE and as a function of illumination H.
The phototransistors find extensive applications in high-speed reading of computer punched cards and tapes, 
light detection systems, light operated switches, reading of film sound track, production line counting of 
objects which interrupt a light beam, etc.

Transistor Characteristics (BJT and FET)
4.31
4.11 tYpes oF Fet
Based on the construction, the FET can be classified into two types as Junction FET (JFET) and Metal 
Oxide Semiconductor FET (MOSFET) or Insulated Gate FET (IGFET) or Metal Oxide Silicon Transistor 
(MOST).
Depending upon the majority carriers, JFET has been classified into two types, namely (i) N-Channel JFET 
with electrons as the majority carriers, and (ii) P-Channel JFET with holes as the majority carriers.
4.12 Fet constructIon
It consists of an N-type bar which is made of silicon. Ohmic contacts (terminals), made at the two ends of the 
bar, are called source and drain.
Source (
 
S) This terminal is connected to the negative pole of the battery. Electrons which are the 
majority carriers in the N-type bar enter the bar through this terminal.
Drain (
 
D) This terminal is connected to the positive pole of the battery. The majority carriers leave 
the bar through this terminal.
Gate (
 
G) Heavily doped P-type silicon is diffused on both sides of the N-type silicon bar by which 
PN junctions are formed. These layers are joined together and called the gate G.
Channel 
 
The region BC of the N-type bar between the depletion region is called the channel. Majority 
carriers move from the source to drain when a potential difference VDS is applied between the source and drain.
4.13 operatIon and characterIstIcs oF Fet
When VGS = 0 and VDS = 0 
When no voltage is applied between drain and source, and gate and source, 
the thickness of the depletion regions around the PN junction is uniform as shown in Fig. 4.24.
When VDS = 0 and VGS is Decreased from Zero  
In this case, the PN junctions are reverse biased and, 
hence, the thickness of the depletion region increases. 
As VGS is decreased from zero, the reverse-bias voltage 
across the PN junction is increased and, hence, the 
thickness of the depletion region in the channel also 
increases until the two depletion regions make contact 
with each other. In this condition, the channel is said to 
be cut-off. The value of VGS which is required to cut off 
the channel is called the cut off voltage VC.
When VGS = 0 and VDS is Increased from Zero 
Drain is positive with respect to the source with 
VGS = 0. Now the majority carriers (electrons) flow through the N-channel from source to drain. Therefore,

the conventional current ID flows from drain to source. The magnitude of the current will depend upon the 
following factors:
 
1. 
The number of majority carriers (electrons) available in the channel, i.e., the conductivity of the 
channel.
 
2. 
The length L of the channel.
 
3. 
The cross-sectional area A of the channel at B.
 
4. 
The magnitude of the applied voltage VDS. Thus, the channel acts as a resistor of resistance R given 
by
 
R =

(4.31)
 
ID =

where r is the resistivity of the channel. Because of the 
resistance of the channel and the applied voltage VDS, there 
is a gradual increase of positive potential along the channel 
from source to drain. Thus, the reverse voltage across the PN 
junctions increases and hence the thickness of the depletion 
regions also increases. Therefore, the channel is wedge-shaped 
as shown in Fig. 4.25.
As VDS is increased, the cross-sectional area of the channel will be reduced. At a certain value VP of VDS, the 
cross-sectional area at B becomes minimum. At this voltage, the channel is said to be pinched off and the 
drain voltage VP is called the pinch-off voltage.
As a result of the decreasing cross section of the channel with the increase of VDS, the following results are 
obtained.
 
(i)  As VDS is increased from zero, ID increases 
along OP, and the rate of increase of ID with 
VDS  decreases as shown in Fig. 4.26. The 
region from VDS = 0 V to VDS = VP is called 
the ohmic region. In the ohmic region, the 
drain-to-source resistance 
DS
D
V
I
 is related 
to the gate voltage VGS, in an almost linear 
manner. This is useful as a Voltage Variable 
Resistor (VVR) or Voltage Dependent 
Resistor (VDR).
 
(ii) 
When VDS = VP, ID becomes maximum. When 
VDS  is increased beyond VP, the length of 
the pinch-off or saturation region increases. 
Hence, there is no further increase of ID.
 (iii) 
At a certain voltage corresponding to the 
point B, ID suddenly increases. This effect is due to the avalanche multiplication of electrons caused 
by breaking of covalent bonds of silicon atoms in the depletion region between the gate and the 
drain. The drain voltage at which the breakdown occurs is denoted by BVDGO. The variation of ID 
with VDS when VGS = 0 is shown in Fig. 4.26 by the curve OPBC.

When 
 
VGS is Negative and VDS is Increased When the gate is maintained at a negative voltage less 
than the negative cut-off voltage, the reverse voltage across the junction is further increased. Hence, for a 
negative value of VGS, the curve of ID versus VDS is similar to that for VGS = 0, but the values of VP and BVDGO 
are lower, as shown in Fig. 4.26.
From the curves, it is seen that above the pinch-off voltage, at a constant value of VDS, ID increases with an 
increase of VGS. Hence, a JFET is suitable for use as a voltage amplifier, similar to a transistor amplifier.
It can be seen from the curve that for voltage VDS = VP, the drain current is not reduced to zero. If the drain 
current is to be reduced to zero, then the ohmic voltage drop along the channel should also be reduced to 
zero. Further, the reverse biasing to the gate-source PN junction essential for pinching off the channel would 
also be absent.
The drain current ID is controlled by the electric field that extends into the channel due to reverse-biased 
voltage applied to the gate; hence, this device has been given the name Field Effect Transistor.
In a bar of P-type semiconductor, the gate is formed due to N-type semiconductor. The working of the 
P-channel JFET will be similar to that of N-channel JFET with proper alterations in the biasing circuits; 
in this case, holes will be the current carriers instead of electrons. The circuit symbols for N-channel and 
P-channel JFETs are shown in Fig. 4.27. It should be noted that the direction of the arrow points in the 
direction of conventional current which would flow into the gate if the PN junction was forward biased.

4.14 JFet parameters
In a JFET, the drain current ID depends upon the drain voltage VDS and the gate voltage VGS. Any one of these 
variables may be fixed and the relation between the other two are determined. These relations are determined 
by the three parameters which are defined below.

It is the ratio of a small change in the drain voltage to the corresponding small change in the gate voltage at

for ID to remain constant.
Relationship among FET Parameters 
As ID depends on VDS and VGS, the functional equation can be 
expressed as 
 
ID = f(VDS ,VGS)
If the drain voltage is changed by a small amount from VDS to (VDS + DVDS) and the gate voltage is changed 
by a small amount from VGS to (VGS + DVGS) then the corresponding small change in ID may be obtained by 
applying Taylor’s theorem with neglecting higher order terms. Thus, the small change DID is given by

Power Dissipation, PD 
The FET’s continuous power dissipation, PD, is the product of ID and VDS.
Pinch-off Voltage, VP 
A single-ended-geometry junction FET is shown in Fig. 4.28 in which the diffusion 
is done from one side only. The substrate is of P-type material which is epitaxially grown on an N-type 
channel. A P-type gate is then diffused into the N-type 
channel. The substrate functions as a second gate which is of 
relatively low-resistivity material. The diffused gate is also of 
very low-resistivity material, allowing the depletion region to 
spread mostly into the N-type channel. A slab of N-type 
semiconductor is sandwiched between two layers of P-type 
material forming two PN junction in this device.
The gate-reverse voltage that removes all the free charge from 
the channel is called the pinch-off voltage VP. We consider 
that the P-type region is doped with NA acceptor atoms, the 
N-type region is doped with ND donor atoms and the junction 
formed is abrupt.
Moreover, if the acceptor impurity density is assumed to be much larger than the donor density, then the 
depletion region width in the P-region will be much smaller than the depletion width of the N-region, i.e.,  
NA >> ND, then WP << WN and WP = W. We know that, the relationship between potential and charge density 
is given by

4.14.3 Biasing for Zero current drift
Figure 4.31 shows the transfer characteristics of N channel JFET for different values of temperature. Here, the 
drain current varies due to change in temperature. The two factors which make drain current to change with 
temperature are the mobility of majority carriers and the depletion region width.
The mobility of majority carriers decreases with increase in temperature. As the temperature increases, the 
lattice ions vibrate more vigorously and hence, the carriers cannot move freely in the crystalline structure. 
For the given gate-source voltage VGS, their velocity is decreased and this reduces the drain current. The 
reduction in ID is 0.7% for 1°C increase in the temperature.

Transistor Characteristics (BJT and FET)
4.39
The width of the depletion region (increase in channel width) decreases with increase in temperature. This 
allows ID to increase and the increase in ID is 
equivalent to a change of 2.2 mV/1°C in |VGS|. 
This is a similar phenomenon to the change of |VBE| 
of 2.5 mV/°C in bipolar transistor.
Hence, it is required to design a biasing circuit which 
compensates for these two factors, so that there is 
no change of drain current with temperature. Such a 
biasing is called Biasing for zero current drift.

4.14.4 comparison of JFet and BJt
 
1. 
FET operation depends only on the flow of majority carriers—holes for P-channel FETs and 
electrons for N-channel FETs. Therefore, they are called unipolar devices. Bipolar transistor (BJT) 
operation depends on both minority and majority current carriers.
 
2. 
As FET has no junctions and the conduction is through an N-type or P-type semiconductor material, 
FET is less noisy than BJT.
 
3. 
As the input circuit of FET is reverse biased, FET exhibits a much higher input impedance (in 
the order of 100 MW) and lower output impedance and there will be a high degree of isolation 
between input and output. So, FET can act as an excellent buffer amplifier but the BJT has low input 
impedance because its input circuit is forward biased.
 
4. 
FET is a voltage controlled device, i.e., voltage at the input terminal controls the output current, 
whereas BJT is a current controlled device, i.e., the input current controls the output current.
 
5. 
FETs are much easier to fabricate and are particularly suitable for ICs because they occupy less 
space than BJTs.
 
6. 
The performance of a BJT is degraded by neutron radiation because of the reduction in minority-
carrier lifetime, whereas FETs can tolerate a much higher level of radiation since they do not rely on 
minority carriers for their operation.
 
7. 
The performance of an FET is relatively unaffected by ambient temperature changes. As it has a 
negative temperature coefficient at high current levels, it prevents the FET from thermal breakdown. 
The BJT has a positive temperature co-efficient at high current levels which leads to thermal breakdown.
 
8. 
Since the FET does not suffer from minority carrier storage effects, it has higher switching speeds 
and cut-off frequencies. BJT suffers from minority carrier storage effects and, therefore, has lower 
switching speed and cut-off frequencies.
 
9. 
FET amplifiers have low gain-bandwidth product due to the junction capacitive effects and produce 
more signal distortion except for small-signal operation.
 
10. 
BJTs are cheaper to produce than FETs.
4.14.5 applications of JFet
 
1. 
FETs are used as a buffer in measuring instruments and receivers since they have high input 
impedance and low output impedance.
 
2.  FETs are used in RF amplifiers in FM tuners, and in communication equipment for its low noise 
level.
 
3. 
Since the input capacitance is low, FETs are used in cascade amplifiers in measuring and test 
equipments.
 
4. 
Since the device is voltage controlled, FETs are used as a voltage variable resistors in operational 
amplifiers and tone controls.
 
5. 
FETs are used in mixer circuits in FM and TV receivers, and in communication equipment because 
their intermodulation distortion is low.
 
6. 
They are used in oscillator circuits because frequency drift is low.

Electronic Devices and Circuits
4.42
 
7. 
As the coupling capacitor is small, FETs are used in low-frequency amplifiers in hearing aids and in 
inductive transducers.
 
8. 
FETs are used in digital circuits in computers, LSD, and memory circuits because of their small size.
4.15 mosFet – tYpes and constructIon
4.15.1 types of mosFet
MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is the common term for the Insulated Gate 
Field Effect Transistor (IGFET). There are two basic forms of MOSFET: (i) Enhancement MOSFET, and 
(ii) Depletion MOSFET.
Principle 
By applying a transverse electric field across an insulator deposited on the semiconducting 
material, the thickness and, hence, the resistance of a conducting channel of a semiconducting material can 
be controlled.
In a depletion MOSFET, the controlling electric field reduces the number of majority carriers available for 
conduction, whereas in the enhancement MOSFET, application of electric field causes an increase in the 
majority carrier density in the conducting regions of the transistor.
4.15.2 construction
The construction of an N-channel enhancement MOSFET is shown in Fig. 4.32(a), and the circuit symbols 
for an N-channel and a P-channel enhancement MOSFET are shown in Figs 4.32(b) and (c), respectively. 
As there is no continuous channel in an enhancement MOSFET, this condition is represented by the broken 
line in the symbols.

Transistor Characteristics (BJT and FET)

Two highly doped N+ regions are diffused in a lightly doped substrate of P-type silicon substrate. One N+ 
region is called the source S and the other one is called the drain D. They are separated by 1 mil (10–3 inch). 
A thin insulating layer of SiO2 is grown over the surface of the structure and holes are cut into the oxide 
layer, allowing contact with source and drain. Then a thin layer of metal aluminium is formed over the layer 
of SiO2. This metal layer covers the entire channel region and it forms the gate G.
The metal area of the gate, in conjunction with the insulating oxide layer of SiO2 and the semiconductor 
channel forms a parallel-plate capacitor. This device is called the insulated gate FET because of the insulating 
layer of SiO2. This layer gives an extremely high input impedance for the MOSFET.
4.16 operatIon and characterIstIcs oF mosFet
4.16.1 operation of mosFet
If the substrate is grounded and a positive 
voltage is applied at the gate, the positive 
charge on G induces an equal negative 
charge on the substrate side between the 
source and drain regions. Thus, an electric 
field is produced between the source and 
drain regions. The direction of the electric 
field is perpendicular to the plates of the 
capacitor through the oxide. The negative 
charge of electrons which are minority 
carriers in the P-type substrate forms an 
inversion layer. As the positive voltage on the 
gate increases, the induced negative charge 
in the semiconductor increases. Hence, the 
conductivity increases and current flows 
from source to drain through the induced channel. Thus, the drain current is enhanced by the positive gate 
voltage as shown in Fig. 4.33.
4.16.2 depletion mosFet
The construction of an N-channel depletion MOSFET is shown in Fig. 4.34(a) where an N-channel is diffused 
between the source and drain to the basic structure of MOSFET. The circuit symbols for an N-channel and a 
P-channel depletion MOSFET are shown in Figs 4.34(b) and (c), respectively.
With VGS = 0 and the drain D at a positive potential with respect to the source, the electrons (majority 
carriers) flow through the N-channel from S to D. Therefore, the conventional current ID flows through the 
channel D to S. If the gate voltage is made negative, positive charge consisting of holes is induced in the 
channel through SiO2 of the gate-channel capacitor. The introduction of the positive charge causes depletion 
of mobile electrons in the channel. Thus, a depletion region is produced in the channel. The shape of the 
depletion region depends on VGS and VDS. Hence, the channel will be wedge shaped as shown in Fig. 4.34(a). 
When VDS is increased, ID increases and it becomes practically constant at a certain value of VDS, called the 
pinch-off voltage. The drain current ID almost gets saturated beyond the pinch-off voltage.
Since the current in an FET is due to majority carriers (electrons for an N-type material), the induced positive 
charges make the channel less conductive, and ID drops as VGS is made negative.

The depletion MOSFET may also be operated in an enhancement mode. It is only necessary to apply a 
positive gate voltage so that negative charges are induced into the N-type channel. Hence, the conductivity of 
the channel increases and ID increases. As the depletion MOSFET can be operated with bipolar input signals 
irrespective of doping of the channel, it is also called dual-mode MOSFET. The volt-ampere characteristics 
are indicated in Fig. 4.33.

Effect of Channel-Length Modulation 
In actual MOSFET characteristic as shown in Fig. 4.36, a non-
zero slope exists beyond the saturation point. For the saturation region, i.e., (VDS > VDS (sat)), the effective 
channel length decreases and this phenomenon is called channel length modulation. For an N-channel device, 
the slope of the curve in the saturation region can be expressed by using the drain current ID given by 
 
ID = KN (VGS – VTN)2 (1 + lVDS)
where l is a positive quantity called the channel-length modulation parameter or l–1 is analogous to the Early 
voltage in bipolar transistors, KN is the conduction parameter and VTN is the threshold voltage. The curves are 
extended so that the intercept at a point ID = 0, VDS = –VE which means that VE = 1/l.

Threshold Voltage in MOSFET 
The threshold voltage is the applied gate voltage needed to achieve 
the threshold inversion point. The condition for this threshold inversion point is that the surface potential, 
Fs = 2Ffp for P-type semiconductor and Fs = 2Ffn for N-type semiconductor. Here, Ffp and Ffn are the 
difference in potential between the Fermi energy levels for P-type and N-type semiconductors. The potential

Figure 4.37 shows the charge distribution in the MOS capacitor at the threshold inversion point for a P-type 
semiconductor substrate. Consider that the space charge width reaches its maximum value. Let us assume 
that there are equivalent oxide charge, Q¢ss, and the 
positive charge on the metal gate at threshold, Q¢mT. 
Here, the prime on Q¢ss and Q¢mT indicates the charge per

 Hence, the threshold voltage is a function of semiconductor doping, oxide charge Q¢ss and

The threshold voltage must be within the voltage range of a circuit design. If the threshold voltage of a 
MOSFET is beyond the operating voltage range, then the circuit cannot be turned ON and OFF.

Transistor Characteristics (BJT and FET)

Since VTN is negative for a P-type substrate, it implies that the device MOSFET is in depletion mode. The 
P-type substrate should be heavily doped to obtain an enhancement mode MOSFET.
Temperature Effects 
The threshold voltage VTN or VTP and conduction parameter KN or KP are functions 
of temperature. The magnitude of threshold voltage decreases with temperature and, hence, the drain current 
ID increases with temperature at a given VGS. The conduction parameter is directly proportional to mobility 
mN or mP of the carrier, which increases as the temperature decreases. Here, the temperature dependent of 
mobility is larger than that of the threshold voltage. Hence, the net effect of decreasing drain current at a 
given VGS due to increase in temperature provides a negative feedback condition and hence the stability for 
a power MOSFET.

1. 
In enhancement and depletion types of MOSFETs, the transverse electric field induced across an 
insulating layer deposited on the semiconductor material controls the conductivity of the channel. In 
the JFET, the transverse electric field across the reverse-biased PN junction controls the conductivity 
of the channel.
 
2. 
The gate-leakage current in a MOSFET is of the order of 10–12 A. Hence, the input resistance of a 
MOSFET is very high in the order of 1010 to 1015 W. The gate-leakage current of a JFET is of the 
order of 10–9 A and its input resistance is of the order of 108 W.
 
3. 
The output characteristics of the JFET are flatter than those of the MOSFET and, hence, the drain 
resistance of a JFET (0.1 to 1 MW) is much higher than that of a MOSFET (1 to 50 kW).
 
4. 
JFETs are operated only in the depletion mode. The depletion-type MOSFET may be operated in 
both depletion and enhancement mode.
 
5. 
Comparing to JFET, MOSFETs are easier to fabricate.
 
6. 
A MOSFET is very susceptible to overload voltage and needs special handling during installation. 
It gets damaged easily if it is not properly handled.
 
7. 
A MOSFET has zero offset voltage. As it is a symmetrical device, the source and drain can be 
interchanged. These two properties are very useful in analog signal switching.
 
8. 
Special digital CMOS circuits are available which involve near-zero power dissipation and very low 
voltage and current requirements. This makes them most suitable for portable systems.
MOSFETs are widely used in digital VLSI circuits than JFETs because of their advantages.

5.1 IntroductIon
The quiescent operating point of a transistor amplifier should be established in the active region of its 
characteristics. Since the transistor parameters such as b, ICO and VBE are functions of temperature, the 
operating point shifts with changes in temperature. The stability of different methods of biasing transistor 
(BJT, FET and MOSFET) circuits and compensation techniques for stabilizing the operating point are 
discussed in this chapter.
5.2 need for BIasIng
In order to produce distortion-free output in amplifier circuits, the supply voltages and resistances in the 
circuit must be suitably chosen. These voltages and resistances establish a set of dc voltage VCEQ and current 
ICQ to operate the transistor in the active region. These voltages and currents are called quiescent values which 
determine the operating point or Q-point for the transistor. The process of giving proper supply voltages and 
resistances for obtaining the desired Q-point is called biasing. The circuits used for getting the desired and 
proper operating point are known as biasing circuits.
The collector current for a common-emitter amplifier is expressed by
 
IC = bIB + ICEO = bIB + (1 + b )ICO
Here, the three variables hFE, i.e., b, IB, and ICO are found to increase with temperature. For every 10°C 
rise in temperature, ICO doubles itself. When ICO increases, IC increases significantly. This causes power 
dissipation to increase and hence, to make ICO increase. This will cause IC to increase further and the process 
becomes cumulative which will lead to thermal runaway that will destroy the transistor. In addition, the 
quiescent operating point can shift due to temperature changes and the transistor can be driven into the 
region of saturation. The effect of b on the Q-point is shown in Fig. 5.1. One more source of bias instability 
to be considered is due to the variation of VBE with temperature. VBE is about 0.6 V for a silicon transistor 
and 0.2 V for a germanium transistor at room temperature. As the temperature increases, |VBE | decreases at 
the rate of 2.5 mV/°C for both silicon and germanium transistors. The transfer-characteristic curve shifts 
to the left at the rate of 2.5 mV/°C (at constant IC) for increasing temperature and, hence, the operating 
point shifts accordingly. To establish the operating point in the active region, compensation techniques 
are needed.

5.3.1 dc Load Line
Referring to the biasing circuit of Fig. 5.2(a), the values of VCC and RC are fixed and IC and VCE are dependent 
on RB.
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the collector circuit in Fig. 5.2(a), we get VCC = IC RC + VCE.
The straight line represented by AB in Fig. 5.2(b) is called the dc load line. The coordinates of the end point 
A are obtained by substituting VCE = 0 in the above equation. Then 
CC

A are VCE = 0 and

The coordinates of B are obtained by substituting IC = 0 in the above equation. Then VCE = VCC. Therefore, 
the coordinates of B are VCE = VCC and IC = 0. Thus, the dc load line AB can be drawn if the values of RC and 
VCC are known.
As shown in Fig. 5.2(b), the optimum Q-point is located at the midpoint of the dc load line AB between the 
saturation and cut-off regions, i.e., Q is exactly midway between A and B. In order to get faithful amplification, 
the Q-point must be well within the active region of the transistor.
Even though the Q-point is fixed properly, it is very important to ensure that the operating point remains 
stable where it is originally fixed. If the Q-point shifts nearer to either A or B, the output voltage and current 
get clipped, thereby output signal is distorted.
In practice, the Q-point tends to shift its position due to any or all of the following three main factors:
 
(i) 
Reverse saturation current, ICO, which doubles for every 10 °C increase in temperature.
 
(ii) 
Base-emitter voltage, VBE, which decreases by 2.5 mV per °C.
 (iii) 
Transistor current gain, b, i.e., hFE which increases with temperature.

Fig. 5.2 (a) Biasing circuit (b) CE output characteristics and load line
Referring to Fig. 5.2(a), the base current IB is kept constant since IB is approximately equal to VCC /RB. If 
the transistor is replaced by another one of the same type, one cannot ensure that the new transistor will 
have identical parameters as that of the first one. Parameters such as b vary over a range. This results in the 
variation of collector current IC for a given IB. Hence, in the output characteristics, the spacing between the 
curves might increase or decrease which leads to the shifting of the Q-point to a location which might be 
completely unsatisfactory.
5.3.2 ac Load Line
After drawing the dc load line, the operating point Q is properly located at the center of the dc load line. This 
operating point is chosen under zero input signal condition of the circuit. Hence, the ac load line should also 
pass through the operating point Q. The effective ac load resistance, Rac, is the combination of RC parallel to 
RL, i.e., Rac = RC || RL. So the slope of the ac load line CQD will be

By joining points C and D, ac load line CD is constructed. As RC > Rac, the dc load line is less steep than the 
ac load line.
When the signal is zero, we have the exact dc conditions. From Fig. 5.2(b), it is clear that the intersection of 
dc and ac load lines is the operating point Q.

Voltage Swing Limitations 
In a linear amplifier, symmetrical sinusoidal signals at the input gets 
amplified as sinusoidal signal at the output, without any clipping. The maximum output symmetrical swing 
provided by the amplifier can be obtained from the ac load line. The output signal will be clipped if it exceeds 
this limit, resulting in signal distortion.
ExamplE 5.1
Determine the maximum voltage swing at the output of common emitter amplifier in which the quiescent 
point is ICQ = 0.9 mA and VCEQ = 9 V. The ac resistance seen at the output terminal is Rac = (RC || RL)

Solution   The maximum symmetrical peak to peak ac collector current is

For the transistor amplifier shown in Fig. 5.3(a), VCC = 12 V, R1 = 8 kW, R2 = 4 kW, RC = 1 kW, RE = 1 kW and

Solution

VCC = VCE + IC (RC + RE ).
 
 
To draw the dc load line, we need two end points, viz., maximum VCE point (at IC = 0) and maximum 
IC point (at VCE = 0).
 
Maximum VCE = VCC = 12 V, which locates the point B (OB = 12 V) of the dc load line.

5.4 BJt BIasIng – Methods and BasIc staBILIty
The stability factors for some commonly used biasing circuits are discussed here.
5.4.1 fixed Bias or Base resistor Method
A common-emitter amplifier using a fixed-bias circuit is shown 
in Fig. 5.6. The dc analysis of the circuit yields the following 
equation.
 
VCC = IBRB + VBE 
(5.4)
Therefore, 
IB = 
CC
BE
B
V
V
R
-
Since this equation is independent of the current IC, dIB/dIC = 0 and 
the stability factor given in Eq. (5.3) reduces to 
 
S = 1 + b 
Since b is a large quantity, this is a very poor bias stable circuit. Therefore, in practice, this circuit is not used 
for biasing the base.
The advantages of this method are (i) simplicity, (ii) small number of components required, and (iii) if the 
supply voltage is very large as compared to VBE of the transistor, then the base current becomes largely 
independent of the voltage VBE. 
ExamplE 5.6

. Note that the value of the stability factor S is always lower in emitter-

achieved in an emitter-feedback bias circuit than the fixed-bias circuit. 
Collector-Emitter Loop 
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law for the collector-emitter loop, we get 
 
IE RE + VCE + IC RC – VCC = 0 
Substituting IE = IC  , we have 
 
VCE  – VCC + IC (RC + RE) = 0 
and 
VCE = VCC – IC (RC + RE) 
(5.9) 
VE is the voltage from emitter to ground and is determined by 
 
VE = IERE 
(5.10) 
The voltage from collector to ground can be determined from 
 
VCE = VC – VE 
and 
VC = VCE + VE 
(5.11)
or 
VC = VCC – ICRC 
(5.12)

5.4.3 collector-to-Base Bias or collector-feedback Bias
A common-emitter amplifier using collector-to-base bias circuit is shown in Fig. 5.13. This circuit is the 
simplest way to provide some degree of stabilization to the amplifier operating point.
If the collector current IC tends to increase due to either increase in 
temperature or the transistor has been replaced by the one with a 
higher b, the voltage drop across RC increases, thereby reducing the 
value or VCE. Therefore, IB decreases which, in turn, compensates 
the increase in IC. Thus, greater stability is obtained. 
The loop equation for this circuit is 
 
VCC = (IB + IC) RC + IBRB + VBE

If RC is very small, then S = (b + 1), i.e., stability is very poor. Hence, the value of RC must be quite large 
for good stabilization. Thus, collector-to-base bias arrangement is not satisfactory for the amplifier circuits 
like transformer-coupled amplifier where the dc load resistance in the collector circuit is very small. For such

5.4.4 collector-emitter feedback Bias 
Figure 5.15 shows the collector-emitter feedback-bias circuit 
that can be obtained by applying both the collector feedback 
and emitter feedback. Here, collector feedback is provided by 
connecting a resistance RB from the collector to the base and 
emitter feedback is provided by connecting an emitter resistance 
RE from the emitter to ground. Both the feedbacks are used to 
control the collector current IC and the base current IB in the 
opposite direction to increase the stability as compared to the 
previous biasing circuits.
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the current, we get
 
(IB + IC) RE + VBE + IBRB + (IB + IC) RC – VCC = 0

5.4.5 Voltage-divider Bias, self-Bias, or emitter Bias
A simple circuit used to establish a stable operating point is the self-biasing configuration. The self-bias, 
also called emitter bias, or emitter resistor, and potential divider circuit, that can be used for low collector 
resistance, is shown in Fig. 5.16. The current in the emitter resistor RE causes a voltage drop which is in the

junction has to be forward biased. The required base bias is obtained from the power supply through the

Use of Self-bias Circuit as a Constant Current Circuit 
If IC tends to increase, say, due to increase 
in ICO with temperature, the current in RE increases. Hence, the voltage drop across RE increases thereby 
decreasing the base current. As a result, IC is maintained almost constant.
Advantage of Self-bias (Voltage-Divider Bias) Over Other Types of Biasing 
In the fixed-bias 
method discussed in Section 5.4.1, the stability factor is given by
 
S = 1 + b
Since b is normally a large quantity, this circuit provides very poor stability. Therefore, the fixed biasing 
technique is not preferred for biasing the base.
In the collector-to-base bias method, when RC is very small, S ª 1 + b, which is equal to that of fixed bias. 
Hence, the collector-to-base bias method is also not preferable. In the self-bias method, when 
B
E
R
R
 is very 
small, S ª 1, which provides good stability. Hence, the self-bias method is the best method over other types 
of ‘biasing’.

IC = aIE + ICO
 
S ª

As can be seen, the value of S is equal to one if the ratio RB /RE is very small as compared to 1. As this ratio 
becomes comparable to unity, and beyond towards infinity, the value of the stability factor goes on increasing 
till S = 1 + b.
This improvement in the stability up to a factor equal to 1 is achieved at the cost of power dissipation. To 
improve the stability, the equivalent resistance RB must be decreased, forcing more current in the voltage 
divider network of R1 and R2.
Often, to prevent the loss of gain due to the negative feedback, RE is shunted by a capacitor CE. The capacitive 
reactance XCE must be equal to about one-tenth of the value of the resistance RE at the lowest operating 
frequency.

5.6 BIas coMPensatIon
The various biasing circuits considered in the previous sections used some types of negative feedback to 
stabilize the operation point. Also, diodes, thermistors, and sensistors can be used to compensate for variations 
in current. 
5.6.1 thermistor and sensistor compensations
Thermistor Compensation 
In Fig. 5.21, a thermistor, RT, having a negative temperature coefficient 
is connected in parallel with R2. The resistance of the thermistor decreases exponentially with increase 
of temperature. An increase in temperature will decrease the base voltage VBE, reducing IB and IC. Bias 
stabilization is also provided by RE and CE.
Sensistor Compensation 
In Fig. 5.22, a sensistor, RS, having a positive temperature coefficient 
is connected across R1 (or RE). RS increases with temperature. As temperature increases, the equivalent 
resistance of the parallel combination of R1 and RS also increases and, hence, the base voltage VBE decreases,

Here, VDD is separately used to keep the diode in the forward-biased 
condition. If the diode is of same material and type as the transistor, 
then the voltage across the diode VD will have the same temperature 
coefficient (2.5 m V/°C) as the base-to-emitter voltage VBE. If VBE 
changes by a small amount with change in temperature, then VD 
also changes by the same amount and, therefore, the changes cancel 
each other.

When VBE changes with temperature, IC also changes. To cancel 
the change in IC, a diode is used at the base terminal to compensate 
the change in VBE as shown in Fig. 5.24. The voltage at the base, 
VB, becomes

If the diode is of the same material and type as the transistor, then the voltage across the diode will have the

and the collector current remains constant. Therefore,

The change in VBE due to temperature is compensated by a change in the diode voltage that keeps IC stable 
at the Q point.
Diode Compensation Against Variation in ICO 
Figure 5.25 
shows a transistor amplifier with a diode D connected across the base–
emitter junction for compensation of change in the collector saturation 
current ICO. The diode is of the same material as the transistor and it is 
reverse biased by the base–emitter junction voltage VBE, allowing the 
diode reverse saturation current Io to flow through the diode D. The base 
current IB = I – Io.
As long as temperature is constant, the diode D operates as a resistor. 
As the temperature increases, ICO of the transistor increases. Hence, to 
compensate for this, the base current IB should be decreased.
The increase in temperature will also cause the leakage current Io through D to increase and thereby decreasing 
the base current IB. This is the required action to keep IC constant.
This method of bias compensation does not need a change in IC to effect the change in IB, as both Io and ICO 
can track almost equally according to the change in temperature.

5.7 therMaL runaway
The collector current for the CE circuit of Fig. 5.2 is given by IC = bIB + (1 + b) ICO. The three variables in the 
equation, b, IB, and ICO increase with rise in temperature. In particular, the reverse saturation current or leakage 
current ICO changes greatly with temperature. Specifically, it doubles for every 10 °C rise in temperature. The 
collector current IC  causes the collector-base junction temperature to rise which, in turn, increase ICO, as a 
result IC will increase still further, which will further raise the temperature at the collector-base junction. This 
process will become cumulative leading to thermal runaway. Consequently, the ratings of the transistor are 
exceeded which may destroy the transistor itself.
The collector is normally made larger in size than the emitter in order to help dissipate the heat developed at 
the collector junction.
However, if the circuit is designed such that the base current IB is made to decrease automatically with rise 
in temperature then the decrease in b IB will compensate for the increase in (1 + b)ICO, keeping IC almost 
constant.
In power transistors, the heat developed at the collector junction may be removed by the  use of a heat sink, 
which is a metal sheet fitted to the collector and whose surface radiates heat quickly.
5.8 therMaL staBILIty
Thermal Resistance 
Consider a transistor used in a circuit where the ambient temperature of the air 
around the transistor is TA °C and the temperature of the collector-base junction of the transistor is TJ °C. 
Due to heating within the transistor, TJ is higher than TA. As the temperature difference TJ – TA is greater, the 
power dissipated in the transistor, PD will be greater, i.e., TJ – TA µ PD.
This equation can be written as TJ – TA = Q PD, where Q is the constant of proportionality and is called the 
thermal resistance. Rearranging the above equation, Q = (TJ – TA) /PD. Hence, Q is measured in °C/W which 
may be as small as 0.2 °C/W for a high power transistor that has an efficient heat sink or up to 1,000 °C/W for 
small signal, low power transistors which have no cooling provision.
As Q represents total thermal resistance from a transistor junction to the ambient temperature, it is commonly 
referred to as QJ – A. However, for power transistors, thermal resistance is given from junction to case, 
QJ – C.
The amount of power that may be safely dissipated in the transistor is given by
 
PD = (TJ – TA)/QJ – A
or 
PD = (TJ – TC)/QJ – C
The thermal resistance from junction to ambience is considered to consist of two parts.
 
QJ – A = QJ – C + QC – A
which indicates that heat dissipated in the junction must make its way to the surrounding air through two 
series paths from junction to case and from case to air. Hence, the power dissipated
 
PD = (TJ – TA)/QJ – A = (TJ – TA)/(QJ – C + QC – A)
QJ – C is determined by the type of manufacture of the transistor and how it is located in the case, but QC – A 
is determined by the surface area of the case or flange and its contact with air. If the effective surface area of 

Electronic Devices and Circuits
5.34
the transistor case could be increased, the resistance to heat flow, or QC–A, could be decreased. This can be 
achieved by the use of a heat sink.
The heat sink is a relatively large, finned, usually black metallic heat conducting device placed in close contact 
with the transistor case or flange. Many versions of heat sinks exist depending upon the shape and size of the 
transistor. Larger the heat sink, smaller will be its thermal resistance, QHS – A. This thermal resistance is not 
added to QC – A in series, but is instead in parallel with it and if QHS – A is much less than QC – A, then QC – A 
will be reduced significantly, thereby improving the dissipation capability of the transistor.
Thus, 
QJ – A = QJ – C + QC – A || QHS – A
ExamplE 5.28
For a given transistor, the thermal resistance is 8 °C/W and for the ambient temperature TA is 27 °C. If the 
transistor dissipates 3 W of power, calculate the junction temperature TJ.
Solution   We know that, 
TJ = TA + QPD
Therefore, 
TJ = 27 °C + (8 °C/W) × 3W = 27 °C + 24 °C = 51°C
ExamplE 5.29
For a transistor, TJ = 160 °C, TA = 40 °C, and QJ – A = 80 °C/W. Calculate the power that the transistor can

Types of Heat Sinks
low-power Transistor Type 
 
The small-signal low-power transistors can be mounted directly on 
the metal chassis to increase the sufficient heat dissipation capability. Care should be taken while doing 
this because very often the collector of the transistor is connected to the transistor case to increase heat-
dissipation capabilities. Hence, some provision for insulating the case from the chassis, which is usually at 
ground potential, must be provided unless a common collector is being employed.
One method of achieving this is to use a beryllium oxide insulating washer which has a good thermal 
conductivity, as shown in Fig. 5.26(a). By using a zinc oxide film silicon compound between the washer and

the chassis, heat transfer from the transistor case to the chassis may be improved. An insulated clamp over the 
top of the transistor may be used to help improve thermal dissipation and increase pressure.
When the transistor is mounted in Teflon (PTFE—Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene) sockets, it does not provide 
thermal conduction from the  transistor case to the chassis. Therefore, a press-on fin type of a black anodized 
heat sink may be used, as shown in Fig. 5.26(b), for mounting transistors that are encased in a metal TO-5 
package.

The diamond-shaped TO-3 and TO-66 types are the popular mounting 
packages used for the power transistors which have dissipation in the order of 100 W. These have two leads 
for emitter and base, but the case, or the mounting flange of the case, is the collector terminal. So, it is 
necessary to insulate the case from the heat sink by the use of an insulating washer. Figure 5.27 shows a 
typical heat sink that can accommodate a TO-3 power transistor package that provides cooling by conduction, 
convection, and radiation. Although measuring only 11.5 cm by 7.8 cm, it has a thermal dissipation equal to 
that of a flat aluminium sheet 25 cm × 20 cm × 0.32 cm. The thermal resistance of this heat sink is 3°C/W.

5.9 fet BIasIng – Methods and staBILIzatIon
For the proper functioning of a linear FET amplifier, it is necessary to maintain the operating point Q stable in 
the central portion of the pinch-off region. The Q-point should be independent of device-parameter variations 
and ambient temperature changes. This can be achieved by suitably selecting the gate to source voltage (VGS) 
and drain current (ID) which is referred to as biasing.
5.9.1 fixing the Q-point
The Q-point, the quiescent point or operating point for a self-biased JFET, is established by determining the 
value of drain current ID for a desired value of gate-to-source voltage, VGS, or vice versa. However, if the 
data sheet of JFET includes a transfer characteristics curve, then the Q-point may be determined by using the 
procedure given below.
 
(i) 
Select a convenient value of drain current whose value is generally taken half of the maximum 
possible value of drain current, IDSS. Then find the voltage drop across source resistor, Rs, by
 
Vs  = ID Rs
 
and the gate-to-source voltage from the equation
  
VGS = – Vs
 
(ii)  Plot the assumed value of drain current, ID, and the corresponding gate-to-source voltage, VGS, on 
the transfer characteristics curve.
 (iii)  Draw a line through the plotted point and the origin. The point of intersection of the line and the 
curve gives the desired Q-point. Then, read the coordinates of the Q-point.
It is necessary to fix the Q-point near the midpoint of the transfer characteristic curve of a JFET. The midpoint 
bias allows a maximum amount of drain current swing between the values of IDSS and the origin.
The following analytical method or graphical method can be used for the design of self-bias circuit.
Analytical Method 
The values of the maximum drain current, IDSS, and the gate-to-source cut-off voltage, 
VGS(off) are noted down from the data sheets of JFET.
The value of the drain current is determined by

4
GS
V
 then the value of the drain current will 
be 
 
ID = IDSS {1 – 0.25}2 = IDSS (0.75)2 = 0.56 IDSS
Here, the drain current is slightly more than one-half of IDSS. But it will bias the JFET close to the mid-point 
of the curve. The value of the drain resistor, RD, is selected in such a way that the drain voltage, VD, is equal to 
half the drain supply voltage, RD. The value of gate resistor, RG, is chosen arbitrarily large, so that it prevents 
loading on the driving stages.
Graphical Method 
A self-bias line is drawn such that it intersects the transfer characteristic curve near its 
midpoint giving the required Q-point. Then the coordinates of the Q-point are obtained. The value of source 
resistance, Rs, is expressed by the ratio of gate-to-source voltage, VGS, to the drain current, ID.

Transistor Biasing and Thermal Stabilization
5.37
Therefore, the source resistance is given by
 
Rs = 
GS
D
V
I
However, a more accurate method is to draw a self-bias line through the 
coordinates of IDSS and VGS(off) as shown in Fig. 5.28. Then the point of 
intersection of self-bias line and the transfer characteristic curve locates 
the Q-point. The value of the source resistor is expressed by the relation
 
RS = 
(off)
GS
DSS
V
I
The value of drain resistor, RD, and the gate resistor, RG, are selected in 
the same way as discussed above for the analytical method.
An FET may have a combination of self-bias and fixed bias to provide 
stability of the quiescent drain current against device and temperature 
variations.
5.9.2 self-bias
Figure 5.29 shows the self-bias circuit for an N-channel FET. When the drain 
voltage VDD is applied, a drain current ID flows even in the absence of gate 
voltage (VG). The voltage drop across the resistor Rs produced by the drain 
current is given by Vs = ID Rs. This voltage drop reduces the gate -to-source 
reverse voltage required for FET operation. The feedback resistor Rs prevents 
any variation in FET drain current.
The drain voltage, 
VD = VDD – ID RD
The drain-to-source voltage, 
 
VDS = VD – Vs = (VDD – ID RD) – ID Rs
 
 = VDD – ID(RD + Rs)
The gate-to-source voltage,
 
VGS = VGG – Vs = 0 – ID Rs = – IDRs
When drain current increases, the voltage drop across Rs increases. The increased voltage drop increases the 
reverse gate-to-source voltage, which decreases the effective width of the channel and, hence, reduces the 
drain current. Now, the reduced drain current decreases the gate-to-source voltage which, in turn, increases 
the effective width of the channel thereby increasing the value of drain current.
5.9.3 Voltage-divider Bias
Figure 5.30(a) shows the voltage-divider bias circuit and its Thevenin’s equivalent is shown in Fig. 5.30(b).

Fig. 5.30 (a) Voltage-divider bias circuit (b) Thevenin’s equivalent circuit
The bias satisfies the equation VGS = VGG – IDRs. 
The drain-to-ground voltage, VD = VDD – IDRD. If the gate voltage VGG is very large compared to gate-to-
source VGS, the drain current is approximately constant. In practice, the voltage-divider bias is less effective 
with JFET than BJT. 
This is because, in a BJT, VBE ª 0.7 (silicon) with only minor variations from one transistor to another. But 
in a JFET, the VGS can vary several volt from one JFET to another.
5.9.4 fixed Bias
The FET device needs dc bias for setting the gate-to-source 
voltage VGS to give desired drain-current ID. For a JFET, 
the drain current is limited by IDSS. Since the FET has a 
high input impedance, it does not allow the gate current to 
flow and the dc voltage of the gate set by a voltage divider 
or a fixed battery is not affected or loaded by the FET.
The fixed bias circuit for an N-channel JFET shown in 
Fig. 5.31 is obtained by using a supply VGG. This supply 
ensures that the gate is always negative with respect to 
source and no current flows through resistor RG and gate 
terminal, i.e., IG = 0. The VGG supply provides a voltage 
VGS to bias the N-channel JFET, but no resulting current 
is drawn from the battery VGG. Resistor RG is included to 
allow any ac signal applied through capacitor C to develop across RG. While any ac signal will develop across 
RG, the dc voltage drop across RG is equal to IGRG which is equal to zero volt.
Then, the gate to source voltage VGS is
 
VGS = VG – Vs = –VGG – 0 = –VGG
The drain-source current ID is then fixed by the gate-source voltage. This current will cause a voltage drop 
the drain resistor RD and is given as

But the self-bias technique given for JFET cannot be used for 
establishing an operating point for the enhancement MOSFET because 
the voltage drop across Rs is

i.e.,

D – 73ID + 144 = 0
Therefore, 
ID = 3.39 mA or 4.72 mA
As ID = 4.72 mA > 4 mA = IDSS, this value is inappropriate. So, IDQ = 3.39 mA is selected.
Therefore, 
 
VGSQ = VGG – IDQRs
 
 = 10 – (3.39 × 10–3 × 3 × 103) = – 0.17 V
and 
VDSQ = VDD – IDQ (RD + Rs)
 
 = 24 – 3.39 × 10–3 (0.91 + 3) × 103 = 10.745 V
Then 
VDGQ = VDSQ – VGQS
 
 = 10.745 + 0.17 = 10.915 V
which is greater than |VP | = 2 V. Hence, the FET is in the pinch-off region.

For the circuit shown in Fig. 5.35, find the values of VDS and VGS. Given, ID = 5 mA, VDD = 10 V, RD = 1 kW 
and Rs = 500 W.
Solution
 
VGG = VGS + IDRs
Since 
VGG = 0,
 
VGS = – IDRs

We know that, 
VDD = ID(RD + Rs) + VDS
Therefore, 
VDS = VDD – ID(RD + Rs)

Since VDS is negative, this value may be neglected. Let us choose ID = 2.65 mA.
Therefore, IDQ = 2.65 mA.
To find VGSQ:
 
VGSQ = 2.28 – 1.5 IDQ = 2.28 – (1.5 × 2.65) = – 1.695 V
To find VDSQ:
 
VDSQ = VDD – IDQ(RD + Rs)
Therefore,  
VDSQ = 20 – 2.65 × 10–3 (4.7 + 1.5) × 10–3 = 3.57 V
To find VD , Vs and VDG:
 
Vs = IDRs = 2.65 × 10–3 × 1.5 × 10–3 = 3.975 V
 
VD = Vs + VDS = 3.975 + 3.57 = 7.545 V
Hence,

For the common-source N-channel MOSFET circuit shown in Fig. 5.43(a) with the threshold voltage 
VTN = 1.5 V, conduction parameter KN = 1 mA/V2, the channel-length modulation parameter l = 0.01 V–1, 
Ri = R1 || R2 = 100 kW and the current at the transition point IDt = 4 mA. Design the MOSFET circuit with 
voltage-divider bias such that IDQ = 1.5 mA and Q-point is in the middle of the saturation region.
Solution   To determine VDSt
We know that, 
IDt = KN (VGSt – VTN)2
i.e., 
4 ×10–3 = 1 × 10–3 (VGSt – 1.5)2
where the subscript t indicates transition point values.
Solving, we get  
VGSt = 3.5 V

For the N-channel depletion-mode MOSFET circuit shown in Fig. 5.44. VTN = –2 V and KN = 0.1 mA/V2. 
Assume that VDD = 5 V and Rs = 5 kW. Determine ID and VDS.
Solution   Let us assume that the MOSFET is biased in the saturation 
region. Then the dc drain current is
 
ID = KN (VGS – VTN)2
 
 = KN (–VTN)2
 
 = (0.1) (–(–2))2 = 0.4 mA
The dc drain-to-source voltage is
 
VDS = VDD – IDRs
 
 = 5 – (0.4)(5) = 3 V
Then,  
VDS(sat) = VGS – VTN
 
 = 0 – (–2) = 2 V
Since VDS > VDS(sat), the MOSFET is biased in the saturation region.

6.1 IntroductIon
The equivalent circuit for a transistor can be drawn using simple approximations by retaining its essential 
features, at the same time discarding its less important qualities. These equivalent circuits will aid in analyzing 
transistor circuits easily and rapidly. In this chapter, small-signal equivalent circuits of the transistor are 
derived. Small-signal operation is that in which the ac input signal voltages and currents are in the order of 
±10% of Q-point voltages and currents.
6.2 BJt as a two port network
A transistor can be treated as a two-port network. The terminal behaviour of any two-port network can be 
specified by the terminal voltages v1 and v2 at ports 1 and 2, respectively, and currents i1 and i2, entering ports 
1 and 2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.1. Of these four variables v1, v2, i1, and i2, two can be selected as 
independent variables and the remaining two can be expressed in terms of these independent variables. This 
leads to various two-port parameters out of which the following three are more important.
 
(i) 
Z-parameters or impedance parameters
 
(ii) 
Y-parameters or admittance parameters
 (iii) 
h-parameters or hybrid parameters.

The dimensions of h-parameters are as follows:
 
h11 – W
 
h22 – mho
 
h12, h21 – dimensionless
As the dimensions are not alike, i.e., they are hybrid in nature, these parameters are called hybrid 
parameters.
An alternative subscript notation recommended by IEEE is commonly used:
 
i = 11 = input; o = 22 = output
 
f = 21 = forward transfer; r = 12 = reverse transfer
6.2.4 notations used in transistor circuits
When h-parameters are applied to transistors, it is a common practice to add a second subscript to designate 
the type of configuration considered: e for common emitter, b for common base, and c for common collector. 

Electronic Devices and Circuits
6.4
Thus, for a common emitter (CE) configuration,
 
hie = h11e = short-circuit input impedance
 
hoe = h22e = open-circuit output admittance
 
hre = h12e = open-circuit reverse voltage gain
 
hfe = h21e = short-circuit forward current gain
6.3 transIstor HyBrId Model
Based on the definition of hybrid parameters, the mathematical model for two-port networks known as 
h-parameter model can be developed. Equations (6.5) and (6.6) can be written as
 
 
v1 = hi i1 + hrv2 
(6.7)
 
 
i2 = hf  i1 + hov2 
(6.8)
The proposed model shown in Fig. 6.2 should satisfy these two equations and it can be readily verified by 
writing Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation in the input loop and Kirchhoff’s current law equation for the output 
node. It is to be noted that the input circuit has a dependent voltage generator and the output circuit contains 
a dependent current generator.

6.4 deterMInatIon of h-paraMeters
On extending the hybrid model for a two-port network to a transistor, it is assumed that the signal excursion 
about the Q-point is small so that the transistor parameters may be considered constant over the signal 
excursion.
Use of h-parameters to describe a transistor has the following advantages:
 
(i) 
h-parameters are real numbers up to radio frequencies.
 
(ii) 
They are easy to measure.
 (iii) 
They can be determined from the transistor static characteristics curves.
 (iv) 
They are convenient to use in circuit analysis and design.
 
(v) 
They are easily convertible from one configuration to other.
 (vi) 
They are readily supplied by manufacturers.

Small Signal Low Frequency Transistor Amplifier Models (BJT and FET)
6.5
In order to derive a hybrid model for a transistor, consider the CE circuit of Fig. 6.3. The variables are ib, ic, 
vb (= vbe) and vc (= vce). ib and vc are considered 
independent variables.
Then, 
vb = f1(ib, vc) 
(6.9)
 
ic = f2(ib, vc) 
(6.10)
Making a Taylor’s series expansion around the 
quiescent point Ib, Vc and neglecting higher order 
terms, the following two equations are obtained:

The values of current gain, voltage gain, input impedance, and output impedance calculated as a function of 
load and source impedances can be shown graphically as in Fig. 6.8.
Fig. 6.8 Comparison of transistor amplifier configurations: (a) Current gain as a function on RL (b) Voltage gain as a 
function of RL (c) Input impedance as a function of RL (d) Output impedance as a function of Rs
From Table 6.5 and Fig. 6.8, the performance of the CB, CC, and CE amplifiers can be summarized as 
follows:
Characteristics of Common-Base Amplifiers
 
(i) 
Current gain is less than unity and its magnitude decreases with the increase of load resistance RL,
 
(ii) 
Voltage gain AV is high for normal values of RL,
 (iii) 
The input resistance Ri is the lowest of all the three configurations, and
 (iv) 
The output resistance Ro is the highest of all the three configurations.

The CB amplifier is not commonly used for amplification purpose. It is used for
 
(i) 
matching a very low impedance source
 
(ii) 
as a non-inverting amplifier with voltage gain exceeding unity
 
(iii) for driving a high impedance load
 
(iv) as a constant current source
Characteristics of Common-Collector Amplifiers
 
(i) 
For low value of RL (< 10 kW), the current gain AI is high and almost equal to that of a CE amplifier.
 
(ii) 
The voltage gain AV is less than unity.
 (iii) 
The input resistance is the highest of all the three configurations.
 (iv) 
The output resistance is the lowest of all the three configurations.
applications 
 
The CC amplifier is widely used as a buffer stage between a high-impedance source 
and a low-impedance load. The CC amplifier is called the emitter follower.
Characteristics of Common-Emitter Amplifiers
 
(i) 
The current gain AI is high for RL < 10 kW.
 
(ii) 
The voltage gain is high for normal values of load resistance RL.
 (iii) 
The input resistance Ri is medium.
 (iv) 
The output resistance Ro is moderately high.
applications 
 
Of the three configurations, the CE amplifier alone is capable of providing both voltage 
gain and current gain. Further, the input resistance Ri and the output resistance Ro are moderately high. 
Hence, the CE amplifier is widely used for amplification purpose.
6.8 approxIMate HyBrId Model
As the h-parameters themselves vary widely for the same type of transistor, it is justified to make approximations 
and simplify the expressions for AI, AV, AP, Ri, and Ro. In addition, a better understanding of the behaviour 
of the transistor circuit can be obtained by using the simplified hybrid model. Since the CE configuration is 
more useful and general, it is taken for consideration.
The h-parameter equivalent circuit of the transistor in the CE configuration is shown in Fig. 6.9. Here, 
1
oe
h
 is parallel with RL. The parallel combination of two unequal impedances, i.e., 1
oe
h
 and RL is approximately 
equal to the lower value, i.e., RL. Hence, if 1
L
oe
R
h
>>
, then the term hoe may be neglected provided that 
hoeRL << 1. Further, if hoe is omitted, the collector current IC is given by IC = hfeIb.
Under this condition, the magnitude of voltage of the generator in the emitter circuit is
 
hre |VC | = hre IC RL = hre hfe Ib RL
Since hre hfe ª 0.01, this voltage may be neglected in comparison with the voltage drop across hie = hie Ib 
provided that RL is not too large.

Electronic Devices and Circuits
6.16
Fig. 6.9 Exact CE hybrid model
To conclude, if the load resistance RL is small, it is possible to neglect the parameter hre and hoe and obtain 
the approximate equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 6.10. It can be shown that if hoe RL £ 0.1, the error in 
calculating AI, AV, Ri, and Ro for CE configuration is less than 10%.
Fig. 6.10 Approximate CE hybrid model
Generalized Approximate Model
Figure 6.11 shows the simplified hybrid circuit that can be used for any configuration by simply grounding the 
appropriate terminal. The signal is connected between input and ground and the load is connected between 
output and ground. The errors introduced in calculating the various parameters using the approximate hybrid 
model are to be found out now. This is done for the CE configuration.

Hence, the maximum error in voltage gain is 5% and the magnitude of AV is overestimated by this amount.
Output Impedance 
It is the ratio of VC to IC with Vs = 0 and RL excluded.
The simplified circuit has infinite output impedance because with Vs = 0 and external voltage source applied 
at the output, it is found that Ib = 0 and hence, IC = 0.
However, the actual value of output impedance depends on the source resistance Rs and lies between 40 kW 
and 80 kW. With the load resistance RL included, the output resistance Ro calculated using the approximate 
model increases, but not more than 10%.

A circuit that increases the amplitude of the given input signal is an amplifier. A small ac signal fed to the 
amplifier is obtained as a larger ac signal of the same frequency at the output. Amplifiers constitute an essential 
part of radio, television, and other communication circuits. In discrete circuits, Bipolar junction transistors 
and field effect transistors are commonly used as amplifying elements. Depending on the nature and level of 
amplification and the impedance matching requirements, different types of amplifiers can be considered and 
they are discussed in this chapter.

6.13.1 common-emitter (ce) amplifier
Figure 6.15 shows the circuit of a single-stage CE amplifier using an NPN transistor. The emitter-base 
junction is forward biased by the power supply VBB, and the collector-base junction is reverse biased by the 
power supply VCC, so that the transistor remains in the active region throughout its operation. The quiescent 
(Q) point is determined by VCC, RB, and RC. The input signal is applied to the base-emitter circuit and the 
amplified output signal is taken from the CE circuit. C1 and C2 are coupling capacitors to provide dc isolation 
at the input and output of the amplifier.

Instead of using two power supplies, the same bias conditions can be set up in the CE amplifier circuit with 
a single power supply as shown in Fig. 6.16.

(6.52)
When a sinusoidal ac signal is applied at the input 
terminals of the circuit, during the positive half cycle, the 
forward bias of the base-emitter junction VBE is increased, 
resulting in an increase in IB. The collector IC is increased 
by b times the increase in IB. From Eq. (6.52), VCE is 
correspondingly decreased, i.e., the output voltage gets 
decreased as shown in Fig. 6.17.
Thus, in a CE amplifier, a positive-going input signal 
is converted into a negative-going output signal, i.e., a 
180° phase shift is introduced between the output and 
input signal and further, the output signal is an amplified 
version of the input signal.

The input signal is given to the base-collector circuit and the output signal is taken from the emitter-collector 
circuit.
Instead of using two power supplies, the required bias condition can be set up in a CC amplifier circuit with 
a single power supply as shown in Fig. 6.19.
C1 and C2 are coupling capacitors to provide dc isolation at the input and output of the amplifier.

From Fig. 6.19,
Output voltage 
Vo = IE RE = bIB RE 
(6.53)
When a sinusoidal ac signal is applied at the input, during the positive half cycle of the signal applied, the 
base potential VB increases, thereby increasing the base current IB. Hence, emitter current IE = IC + IB increases 
and voltage drop across RE, i.e., the output voltage increases.
Thus, a positive-going input signal results in a 
positive-going output signal as shown in Fig. 6.20. 
Hence, in a CC amplifier, input and output signals are 
in phase with each other and further, the voltage gain 
is approximately unity.
As the output signal taken at the emitter terminal almost 
follows the input signal, the CC amplifier is called the 
emitter Follower.

6.13.3 common-Base (cB) amplifier
Figure 6.21 shows the circuit of a single-stage CB amplifier using an NPN transistor. The emitter-base junction 
is forward biased by the power supply VEE, whereas the collector-base junction is reverse biased by VCC, so 
that the transistor remains in the active region throughout its operation.
Fig. 6.21 Common base amplifier
The input signal applied to the emitter-base circuit, and the output signal is taken from collector-base circuit. 
The output voltage (= VCB) is given by the equation
 
Vo = VCC – ICRC  
(6.54)
When a sinusoidal ac signal is applied at the input, 
during the positive half cycle of the applied signal, 
the amount of forward bias to base-emitter junction is 
decreased, resulting in a decrease in IB. As a result, 
IE (ª bIB) and hence, IC also decreases.
From Eq. (6.54), the drop ICRC decreases, hence 
Vo = VCB correspondingly increases. Thus, a positive 
half cycle appears at the output without any phase 
reversal as shown in Fig. 6.22.

 (i) Remove the dc effects of power supply (VCC) by grounding them.
 (ii) Replace the capacitors (C1 and C2) by short circuits.
Thus, the circuit of Fig. 6.23 reduces to the ac equivalent circuit of Fig. 6.24.
Substituting the approximate hybrid model for the transistor in Fig. 6.24, the circuit reduces to that shown

6.14.2 common-emitter amplifier with emitter resistor
A simple and effective way to provide voltage-gain stabilization in a CE amplifier is to add an emitter resistor 
RE which provides feedback as shown in Fig. 6.27. An approximate solution for this arrangement can be

Comparing with Eq. (6.38), the input resistance is augmented by (1 + hfe) RE and may be very much larger 
than hie. For example, with RE = 1 kW, hfe = 60, (1 + hfe) RE = 61 kW >> hie ª 1 kW.
Hence, RE greatly increases the input resistance of the amplifier.

Thus, the addition of emitter-resistor RE greatly reduces the voltage amplification as Ri has increased from hie

Hence, under these approximations, AV is completely stable and independent of all transistor parameters 
provided stable resistances are used for RL and RE.
Output Resistance, Ro 
Output resistance Ro with RL excluded is infinite and with RL included, it is equal 
to RL and is independent of RE.
ExamplE 6.8
A CE amplifier uses load resistor RC = 2 kW in the collector circuit and is given by the voltage source Vs of 
internal resistance 1000 W. The h-parameters of the transistor are hie = 1300 W, hre = 2 × 10–4, hfe = 55 and 
hoe = 22 mmhos. Neglecting the biasing resistors, compute the current gain AI, input resistance Ri, voltage 
gain AV, output resistance Ro, and output terminal resistance RoT for the following values of emitter resistor 
RE inserted in the emitter circuit: (a) 200 W, (b) 400 W, and (c) 1000 W. Use the approximate model for the

Solution

with high input impedance and near-unity voltage gain is used as a buffer amplifier and the CG amplifier is 
used as a high-frequency amplifier. The small-signal current-source model for the FET in CS configuration 
is redrawn in Fig. 6.41(a) and the voltage-source model shown in Fig. 6.41(b) can be derived by finding 
the Thevenin’s equivalent for the output part of Fig. 6.41(a). m, rd and gm are the amplification factor, drain 
resistance, and mutual conductance of the FET.
Field Effect Transistor (FET) amplifiers provide an excellent voltage gain with the added feature of high input 
impedance. They have low power consumption with a good frequency range, and minimal size and weight. 
The noise output level is low. This feature makes them very useful in the amplifier circuits meant for very 
small-signal amplifications. JFETs, depletion MOSFETs and enhancement MOSFETs are used in the design 
of amplifiers having comparable voltage gains. However, the depletion MOSFET circuit realizes much higher 
input impedance than the equivalent JFET configuration. Because of the high input impedance characteristic 
of FETs, the ac equivalent model is somewhat simpler than that employed for BJTs. The common-source 
configuration is the most popular one, providing an inverted and amplified signal. However, one also finds 
the common drain (source follower) circuits providing unity gain with no inversion and common gate circuits 
providing gain with no inversion. Due to very high input impedance, the input current is generally assumed to 
be negligible, and it is of the order of few microamperes and the current gain is an undefined quantity. Output 
impedance values are comparable for both the BJT and FET circuits

The h-parameter model of a BJT in CE configuration is redrawn in Fig. 6.45 for comparison.
The BJT also has a Norton’s output circuit, but the current generated depends on the input current and not on 
the input voltage as in FET. There is no feedback from output to input in the FET, whereas a feedback exists 
in the BJT through the parameter hre. The high (almost infinite) input resistance of the FET is replaced by an 
input resistance of about 1 kW for a CE amplifier.

Due to the high input impedance and the absence of feedback from output to input, FET is a much more ideal 
amplifier than the BJT at low frequencies. This becomes invalid beyond the audio range as the low frequency 
model of FET, shown in Fig. 6.41(a), is not valid in the high frequency range.
